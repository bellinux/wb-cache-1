5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the {{highlands}} remained very poor and traditional, with few {{connections to the}} uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. As late as 1878, 68 families owned nearly half the land in Scotland. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers. They turned to money rents, displaced farmers to raise sheep, and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans.

30|$|The {{lower section}} of Table  5 {{presents}} coefficients of {{variables in the}} inefficiency equation and their associated t-ratios. It shows that coefficients associated with five out of the 14 variables - PTREE, PFREHOLD, SIMPSON, ASSETINC and POFFFAM were significant. Coefficient of PTREE is negative and significant at p[*]<[*] 0.01 level, {{which means that the}} higher the proportion of the cultivated farmland devoted to tree <b>crops</b> <b>production</b> the lower is the inefficiency in the production system adopted by farm households. This result may appear to be a sharp contrast to earlier evidence that coefficient of LNTLAND (area of land devoted to tree <b>crops</b> <b>production)</b> was negative and insignificant in the revenue frontier. However, the import of these results is that while raising areas of land devoted to tree <b>crops</b> <b>production</b> when all other things are held constant would bring no improvement to household income, converting some areas of land from arable to tree <b>crops</b> <b>production</b> would lead to significant improvement in household income. This evidence would suggest that the tendency to convert tree crop estates to arable crop farms in search of short-term funds, would amount to greater inefficiency in farm households’ resource use. It is instructive to note that, until very recent times, the proportion of arable land devoted to permanent <b>crops</b> <b>production</b> in Nigeria had been on a steady decline, dropping from about 9.1 % in 1980 steadily to about 8.36 % in 1995 (FAO, [2014]). However, the trend is being reversed in recent times, with total area devoted to permanent crops growing from about 3 million hectares in 1995 to 3.2 million hectares in 2011 (FAO, [2014]) in response to policy reforms.|$|R

This index integrates a number of aspects that refract major concerns in the nexus.

30|$|Two out of {{the three}} {{coefficients}} associated with variables on farm size, LNCLAND and LNANU representing size of land devoted to arable <b>crops</b> <b>production</b> and stock of livestock raised by the farm households respectively, were positive and significant at p[*]<[*] 0.01. This shows that increase in size of arable crops and livestock farms raised by the farm households are associated with significant increases in their income. One per cent increase in farmland devoted to arable <b>crops</b> <b>production</b> is associated with about 0.71 % increase in farm household income. Similar increase in stock of livestock {{was found to be}} associated with about 0.08 % increase in farm household income. The fact that coefficient of LNTLAND (size of farmland devoted to tree <b>crops</b> <b>production)</b> is negative and not significant suggests that further increase in size of tree crop farm being cultivated by an average farm household in the sample, ceteris paribus, may not results in improvement in her income.|$|R
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} revolution {{changed the}} traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers migrated from farms and smallholdings {{to the new}} industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), Highland landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. Whereas rents had often been paid in kind, the landlords turned to money rents. They displaced farmers to raise sheep and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in the mid-nineteenth century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of <b>crop</b> <b>production.</b> One result of these changes was the Highland Clearances, by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the United Kingdom, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, and further afield to England, Canada, America and Australia. The potato famine of the 1840s, caused by potato blight, which devastated the population of Ireland, reached the Highlands in 1846. Although 150,000 people faced disaster, because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk), they were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland and prevented a major demographic crisis.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this direct impact, the presence of tsetse and trypanosomiasis discourages the use of more-productive exotic and cross-bred cattle, depresses the growth and affects the distribution of livestock populations, reduces the potential opportunities for livestock and <b>crop</b> <b>production</b> (mixed farming) through less draught power to cultivate land and less manure to fertilize (in an environment-friendly way) soils for better <b>crop</b> <b>production,</b> and affects human settlements (people tend to avoid areas with tsetse flies).|$|E
