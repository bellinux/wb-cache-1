5|$|The Oliver Typewriter Company {{had begun}} {{operating}} in 1895, with its headquarters {{on the ninth}} floor of a building {{on the corner of}} Clark and Randolph Street in Chicago. In 1896, manufacturing moved from Iowa to Woodstock, Illinois, when the City of Woodstock donated a vacant factory once used by the Wheeler and Tappan Company on the condition that the Oliver Typewriter Company remain there at least five years. Manufacturing was divided into six departments: type bar, <b>carriage,</b> <b>assembly,</b> tabulators and adjustment, inspection, and an aligning room. The company's headquarters moved to the Oliver Building, now a Chicago landmark on the National Register of Historic Places, when it was completed in 1907.|$|E
25|$|Each barrel is a {{very simple}} non-automatic design having its own breech and bolt. Like the {{original}} Gatling gun, the entire firing cycle is actuated by cams and powered by {{the rotation of the}} barrels. The seven-barrel <b>carriage</b> <b>assembly</b> itself is driven by the aircraft's dual hydraulic system.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the design}} {{advances}} in the Model 28 {{is the use of}} a compact and lightweight type box. In the Model 15, the moving <b>carriage</b> <b>assembly</b> weighs slightly over five pounds. The <b>carriage</b> <b>assembly</b> in the Model 28 weighs eight ounces. This weight reduction allows for a faster carriage return, necessary for 100 word-per-minute operation. The lighter <b>carriage</b> <b>assembly</b> effectively eliminates the effect of gravity on operation in the air and on the sea where level operation in not practical. The type box is easily removed, without tools, for cleaning and there are many type box options. The Teletype Parts Bulletin 1149-B. lists sixteen available Model 28 type box options. Another design advance in the Model 28 was the use of a new all-steel clutch that uses internal expansion to minimize wear and reduce the need for lubrication. The Model 28 series was also modular. The keyboard unit, the printing unit, the perforators and the transmitter distributors are self-contained and easily swappable to aid in troubleshooting and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The {{linear motion}} {{assemblies}} for the x- and y-axis roll directly on anodized aluminum extrusions. No proprietary rails and <b>carriage</b> <b>assemblies</b> are used. The Lasersaur carriages are built from standard-sized ball bearings, cap screws and custom-cut acrylic or metal pieces. Both axes are minimally constrained.|$|R
50|$|Pad-mount {{transformers}} are (nearly always) oil-filled {{units and}} so must be mounted outdoors only. The core and coils are enclosed in a steel oil-filled tank, with terminals for the transformer accessible in an adjacent lockable wiring cabinet. The wiring cabinet has {{high and low}} voltage wiring compartments. High and low voltage underground cables from below enter the terminal compartments directly. The top of the tank has a cover secured with <b>carriage</b> bolt-nut <b>assemblies.</b> The wiring cabinet has sidewalls on two ends with doors that open sideways to expose {{the high and low}} voltage wiring compartments.|$|R
40|$|Skate-weld <b>carriage</b> {{and track}} <b>assembly</b> were {{developed}} for controlled fusion welding on compound-curvature surfaces. Unlike fixed-position carriage used for vertical, horizontal, and circumferential welding, carriage has suspension system that permits angular positioning of weld head on carriage. It also has carriage-and-drive track mechanism capable of traveling over compound curvatures. Carriage is designed with universal mounting platform so that slim tools, weld heads, or X-ray units can be interchanged without need for realinement...|$|R

50|$|Many of {{the houses}} in this {{neighborhood}} {{date back to the}} late 19th century, when the city of Flint was transitioning from horse-drawn <b>carriage</b> <b>assembly</b> to automobile manufacturing. Currently, the central park neighborhood association is a collection of proud residents who meet monthly in promoting this viable area located between the college-cultural area and the downtown municipal and business center in which wide ranging demographic groups from college students to retirees reside.|$|E
50|$|Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval, a French {{artillery}} engineer, {{introduced the}} standardization of cannon {{design in the}} mid-18th century. He developed a 6 in field howitzer whose gun barrel, <b>carriage</b> <b>assembly</b> and ammunition specifications were made uniform for all French cannons. The standardized interchangeable parts of these cannons down to the nuts, bolts and screws made their mass production and repair much easier. Another major change at this time was {{the development of a}} flintlock firing mechanism for the cannons to replace the old method of igniting powder in the cannon touchhole. The flintlock was a far more reliable (and safe) mechanism.|$|E
50|$|From {{the early}} 1940s {{to the late}} 80s, Hillview was an {{industrial}} precinct with facilities such as Old Ford Motor Factory (built in 1941), Castrol Oil Company, Union Carbide and Cycle & <b>Carriage</b> Daimler-Benz car <b>assembly</b> plant (built in 1965). Hume Avenue was probably named after Walter R Hume, an inventor turned entrepreneur who founded Hume Pipe Company (Australia). Today, only the old Ford Motor factory still remains as other factories made way for new private residential developments.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century a number of small unions were formed in the Australian colonies to {{represent}} skilled coachbuilders in the horse-drawn coach building industry. In NSW a union of coachbuilders was formed in Bathurst in 1863, while a South Australian union was formed in the 1880s, before folding in 1896 due to lack of members. In 1917 the Australian Coach, Motor Car, Tram Car, Waggon Builders, Wheelwrights' and Rolling Stock Makers' Employees' Federation was registered federally. During the 1920s the union's membership was transformed as motor cars replaced coaches and <b>carriages,</b> and <b>assembly</b> line methods of production replaced trade-qualified coachbuilders with unskilled or semi-skilled assembly workers. In 1930 it reregistered under the even more cumbersome name of the Australian Coach, Motor Car, Tram Car, Waggon Builders, Wheelwrights' and Air Craft Rolling Stock Makers' Employeesâ€™ Federation. In 1938 it changed its name to the much simpler Vehicle Builders Employees' Federation.|$|R
60|$|The British government, not chusing {{to permit}} the union of the colonies as propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them, sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for that purpose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for <b>carriages.</b> Our <b>Assembly</b> apprehending, from some information, that he had {{conceived}} violent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish'd me to wait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general, {{under the guise of}} proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence, and of which they propos'd to pay the expense. My son accompanied me on this journey.|$|R

50|$|The cabin fell some 200 m down a mountainside, then skidded 100 m {{before coming}} {{to a halt in}} a grassy meadow. In the fall, the three-ton {{overhead}} <b>carriage</b> <b>assembly</b> fell on top of the car, crushing it. Forty-three people died, including 15 {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 15 and the 18-year-old cable car attendant. Initial reports stated 42 dead with one missing; however, the last body, that of Fabio Rustia, was found later. The only survivor was a 14-year-old Milanese girl, Alessandra Piovesana, who was on a school trip and was with two friends when the crash happened. She testified in the succeeding trials and later worked as a journalist for the science magazine Airone, before her death from illness in 2009.|$|E
40|$|An apparatus, system, {{and method}} for {{conveying}} an assembly along a track. A rail can include a first planar side, a second planar side, {{and a third}} planar side. The first, second, and third planar sides can be arranged to form at least two acute angles. A <b>carriage</b> <b>assembly</b> can include a drive wheel {{and at least two}} roller sets. The drive wheel can be configured to contact the first planar side and is configured to translate the <b>carriage</b> <b>assembly</b> along the rail. The at least two roller sets can be configured to contact the two other sides to maintain the carriage in contact with the rail...|$|E
25|$|The N type {{carriages}} {{were the}} first cars to be built at Newport Workshops in over 20 years. Each carriage took over 20 weeks to construct, with a rolling production line to give one new <b>carriage</b> off the <b>assembly</b> line every fortnight. Weeks 1 to 7 involved the general structure - welding the shell and the underframe together and attaching the ends. Following that, the electrical fitout took four weeks, and the bogies were fitted after Week 11. A mineral fibre insulation was sprayed on internal surfaces between weeks 12-14, and then the final six weeks the internal fibreglass ceiling and wall sheets were fitted, along with carpet, seats, lighting, doors and other components, with a one-week trial at the end. The cost was roughly $500,000 per carriage. The total build time added to 16,500 man-hours per carriage, against 32,000 for the earlier Z type carriages. Additionally, the carriages are between five and eight tonnes heavier than comparable designs overseas, partially due to their being a compromise between regional and commuter type vehicles. On the other hand, they cost a mere $13,000 per seat, against $47,000 per seat for the XPT carriages being built for New South Wales Railways around the same time.|$|R
5000|$|Center for Systems and Software Engineering (CSSE) at the University of Southern California has {{developed}} and released a code counting toolset called the Unified CodeCount (UCC), which ensures consistency across independent {{organizations in the}} rules used to count software lines of code. The primary purpose is to support sizing software counts and metrics for historical data collection and reporting purposes. It implements a code counting framework published by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and adapted by COCOMO. Logical and physical SLOC are among the metrics generated by the toolset. SLOC refers to Source Lines of Code and is a unit {{used to measure the}} size of software program based on a set of rules. SLOC is a key input for estimating project effort and is also used to calculate productivity and other measurements. There are two types of SLOC: physical and logical sloc. Physical SLOC (PSLOC)- One physical SLOC corresponds to one line starting with the first character and ending by a carriage return or an end-of-file marker of the same line. Blank and comment lines are not counted. Logical SLOC (LSLOC)- Lines of code intended to measure [...] "statements", which normally terminate by a semicolon (C/C++, Java, C#) or a <b>carriage</b> return (VB, <b>Assembly),</b> etc. Logical SLOC are not sensitive to format and style conventions, but they are language dependent.|$|R

My son accompanied me on this journey. We found the general at Fredericktown, waiting impatiently for the return of those whom we had sent through the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to collect wagons. I stayed with him several days, dined with him daily, and had full opportunities of removing his prejudices, by the information of what the Assembly had, before his arrival, actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate his operations. When I was about to depart, the returns of wagons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appeared that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all of those were in serviceable condition. The general and the officers were surprised; declared the expedition was then at an end, being impossible; and exclaimed against the ministers for ignorantly sending them into a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores, baggage, &c., not less than one hundred and fifty wagons being necessary. I happened to say, I thought it was a pity they had not been landed in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had his wagon. The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, [...] "Then you, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure them for us, and I beg you will undertake it." [...] I asked what terms were to be offered the owners of the wagons; and I was desired to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary. This I did, and they were agreed to; and a commission and instructions accordingly prepared immediately. What those terms were will appear in the advertisement I published soon as I arrived at Lancaster; which being, from the great and sudden effect it produced, a piece of some curiosity, I shall insert it at length, as follows: ...|$|R
