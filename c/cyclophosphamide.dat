5|$|Doxorubicin is {{commonly}} used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (adriamycin, <b>cyclophosphamide),</b> TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (<b>cyclophosphamide,</b> hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, <b>cyclophosphamide).</b>|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy with {{topotecan}} and <b>cyclophosphamide</b> {{is frequently}} used in refractory setting and after relapse.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin {{and several}} {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs (including <b>cyclophosphamide)</b> cause dyspigmentation. Other groups {{of drugs that}} cause this problem include antimalarials, amiodarone, heavy metals (but not iron), tetracyclines, and antipsychotics.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} from randomized clinical trials that treating children who have HSP with antiplatelet agent prevents persistent kidney disease. There is also {{no evidence}} from randomized clinical trials that treating children or adults with <b>cyclophosphamide</b> prevents severe kidney disease. Heparin treatment is not justified.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (<b>cyclophosphamide,</b> ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage {{would normally}} prompt a kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid), <b>cyclophosphamide</b> and dipyridamole followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent <b>cyclophosphamide</b> with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, <b>cyclophosphamide</b> and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug <b>cyclophosphamide</b> to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} GPA is <b>cyclophosphamide</b> and high dose corticosteroids for remission induction and less toxic immunosuppressants like azathioprine, leflunomide, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole {{may also help}} prevent relapse. Rituximab may be substituted for <b>cyclophosphamide</b> in inducing remission.|$|E
25|$|T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is {{difficult}} to treat, {{and it does not}} respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy (<b>cyclophosphamide,</b> doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone CHOP, <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> vincristine, prednisone , vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> bleomycin VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.|$|E
25|$|In {{pulmonary}} haemorrhage, {{high doses}} of <b>cyclophosphamide</b> with pulsed methylprednisolone may be used, or alternatively CYC, steroids, and plasma exchange.|$|E
25|$|With {{corticosteroids}} and <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> 5-year {{survival is}} over 80%. Long-term complications are common (86%), mainly chronic kidney failure, hearing loss and deafness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclophosphamide</b> is an {{immunomodulator}} used {{in combination}} with systemic steroids to remove bone marrow. This is followed by transplanting peripheral blood stem cells.|$|E
25|$|Active {{alveolitis}} {{is often}} treated with pulses of <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> often {{together with a}} small dose of steroids. The benefit of this intervention is modest.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{can include}} {{corticosteroids}} and anti-malarial drugs. Certain types of lupus nephritis such as diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis require intermittent cytotoxic drugs. These drugs include <b>cyclophosphamide</b> and mycophenolate.|$|E
25|$|In case of organ-threatening disease, pulsed {{intravenous}} <b>cyclophosphamide</b> with steroids is recommended. Once remission {{has been}} achieved, azathioprine and steroids {{can be used}} to maintain remission.|$|E
25|$|If {{the tumor}} is {{determined}} to be platinum-resistant, vincristine, dactinomycin, and <b>cyclophosphamide</b> (VAC) {{or some combination of}} paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin may be used as a second-line therapy.|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{chemotherapy}} {{for prostate}} cancer was first studied in the 1970s. The initial regimen of <b>cyclophosphamide</b> and 5-fluorouracil was quickly joined by multiple regimens using {{a host of other}} systemic chemotherapy drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclophosphamide</b> is {{used for}} severe {{glomerulonephritis}} or other organ-damaging complications. Mycophenolic acid is also used for treatment of lupus nephritis, {{but it is not}} FDA-approved for this indication, and FDA is investigating reports that it may be associated with birth defects when used by pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|Induction {{chemotherapy}} {{to bring}} about bone marrow remission. For adults, standard induction plans include prednisone, vincristine, and an anthracycline drug; other drug plans may include L-asparaginase or <b>cyclophosphamide.</b> For children with low-risk ALL, standard therapy usually consists of three drugs (prednisone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine) for {{the first month of}} treatment.|$|E
25|$|Cardiotoxicity (heart damage) is {{especially}} prominent {{with the use}} of anthracycline drugs (doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, and liposomal doxorubicin). The cause of this is most likely due to the production of free radicals in the cell and subsequent DNA damage. Other chemotherapeutic agents that cause cardiotoxicity, but at a lower incidence, are <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> docetaxel and clofarabine.|$|E
25|$|The myriad {{causes of}} {{intrinsic}} AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to vasculitis or glomerulonephritis may respond to steroid medication, <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> and (in some cases) plasma exchange. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as ACE inhibitors, ARB antagonists, aminoglycosides, penicillins, NSAIDs, or paracetamol.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{therapy is}} a {{combination}} of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with mesna, BCD (bleomycin, <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low.|$|E
25|$|Premedication with {{corticosteroids}} {{is recommended}} before each administration of docetaxel to reduce fluid retention and hypersensitive reactions. Other medications will often {{be given to}} aid pain management and other symptoms. The treatment of breast cancer with doxorubicin and <b>cyclophosphamide</b> is enhanced by adjuvant treatment with docetaxel. Docetaxel is also used in combination with capecitabine, a DNA synthesis inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} therapy of doxorubicin and sirolimus {{has been shown}} to drive AKT-positive lymphomas into remission in mice. Akt signalling promotes cell survival in Akt-positive lymphomas and acts to prevent the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin or <b>cyclophosphamide.</b> Sirolimus blocks Akt signalling and the cells lose their resistance to the chemotherapy. Bcl-2-positive lymphomas were completely resistant to the therapy; eIF4E-expressing lymphomas are not sensitive to sirolimus.|$|E
25|$|An {{extended}} release injectable {{version of}} granisetron, known as Sustol {{is also available}} in the United States as of 2016. The long acting form {{is used for the}} treatment of both acute and delayed CINV in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and anthrocycline and/or <b>cyclophosphamide</b> (AC) highly emetogenic regimens. In its review, the FDA did not grant the broad HEC label to the drug citing the focus on AC regimens, primarily breast-cancer, and lack of data.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemotherapy}} {{drugs are}} used in diseases other than cancer, such as in autoimmune disorders, and noncancerous plasma cell dyscrasia. In some cases they are often used at lower doses, {{which means that the}} side effects are minimized, while in other cases doses similar to ones used to treat cancer are used. Methotrexate is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis. The anti-inflammatory response seen in RA is thought to be due to increases in adenosine, which causes immunosuppression; effects on immuno-regulatory cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pathways; reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines; and anti-proliferative properties. Although methotrexate is used to treat both multiple sclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis, its efficacy in these diseases is still uncertain. <b>Cyclophosphamide</b> is sometimes used to treat lupus nephritis, a common symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus. Dexamethasone along with either bortezomib or melphalan is commonly used as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Recently, bortezomid in combination with <b>cyclophosphamide</b> and dexamethasone has also shown promise as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Other drugs used to treat myeloma such as lenalidomide have shown promise in treating AL amyloidosis.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy is the {{mainstay}} of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> vincristine, and prednisone. Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated {{with a combination of}} prednisolone and high dose pulse chlorambucil with success. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
25|$|Autologous hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) {{is based on the}} assumption that autoimmune diseases like systemic sclerosis occur when the white blood cells of the immune system attack the body. In this treatment, stem cells from the patient's blood are extracted and stored to preserve them. The patient's white blood cells are destroyed with <b>cyclophosphamide</b> and rabbit antibodies against the white blood cells. Then the stored blood is returned to the patient's bloodstream to reconstitute a healthy blood and immune system which will not attack the body. The results of a phase 3 trial, the Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, with 156 patients were published in 2014. HSCT itself has a high treatment mortality, so in the first year, the survival of patients in the treatment group was lower than the placebo group, but at the end of 10 years, the survival in the treatment group was significantly higher. The authors concluded that HSCT could be effective, if limited to patients who were healthy enough to survive HSCT itself. Therefore, HSCT should be given early in the progression of the disease, before it does damage. Patients with heart disease, and patients who smoked cigarettes, were less likely to survive. Another trial, the Stem Cell Transplant vs. <b>Cyclophosphamide</b> (SCOT) trial, is ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Neurosarcoidosis, once confirmed, is {{generally}} treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone. If this is effective, the dose may gradually be reduced (although many patients need {{to remain on}} steroids long-term, frequently leading to side-effects such as diabetes or osteoporosis). Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> pentoxifylline, thalidomide and infliximab {{have been reported to}} be effective in small studies. In patients unresponsive to medical treatment, radiotherapy may be required. If the granulomatous tissue causes obstruction or mass effect, neurosurgical intervention is sometimes necessary. Seizures can be prevented with anticonvulsants, and psychiatric phenomena may be treated with medication usually employed in these situations.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with CLL, it is incurable by present {{treatment}}s, so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years, rather than totally and permanently eliminating it. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with chlorambucil or <b>cyclophosphamide,</b> plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone. The use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In resistant cases, single-agent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful. Younger and healthier patients may choose allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation {{in the hope of}} a permanent cure.|$|E
25|$|Tyrosine kinase inhibitors {{are another}} investigational drug class {{that may have}} {{applications}} in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor group, including pazopanib, cediranib, and nintedanib, have {{also been shown to}} increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015. Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3–4 months and increased survival by 3 months. MK-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. Nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with <b>cyclophosphamide</b> for people with recurrences.|$|E
