40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the role of color-Doppler US {{in the assessment of}} orbital vasculature under normal conditions; the results were then applied to the flowmetric analysis of some vascular diseases of the orbit, i. e., retinitis pigmentosa, <b>simple</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> low-tension glaucoma and carotid-cavernous fistulas. The study consisted of two phases: first, a group of 20 healthy volunteers was examined and then 39 patients were divided into 4 subgroups. The patients (18 men and 21 women, age range: 52 - 68 years) were further divided into 4 subgroups: 12 of them had retinitis pigmentosa, 15 <b>simple</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> 8 low-tension glaucoma and 4 carotid-cavernous fistulas. Color-Doppler yielded useful pieces of information on the position of orbital vessels and flow direction, while pulsed Doppler allowed the measurement of several variables, i. e., time average velocity, protosystolic velocity, peak systolic velocity, mesodiastolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistive index and pulsatility index. The study of the 20 healthy volunteers yielded valuable information on the anatomy and flow patterns of some vessels, such as the ophthalmic artery, the central retinal artery, the lacrimal artery and the posterior ciliary arteries, all of them visible in 90 - 100 % of patients; the central retinal vein, the superior ophthalmic vein and venae varicosae were demonstrated in about 10 - 30 % of them. In the group of patients, the mean flow velocities of the examined arteries were significantly lower than those in the normal volunteers; in the patients with carotid-cavernous fistulas an ectasic superior ophthalmic vein was demonstrated, with its typical flow "arterialization" pattern. The results suggest that color-Doppler could play a mayor role in the study of ocular hemodynamics...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{therapeutic}} effect of triple {{surgery in the}} treatment of glaucoma with cataract at different stages. METHODS: Totally 31 patients(55 eyes) with glaucoma and cataract were treated with phacoemulsification, lens implantation and trabeculectomy. Preoperation and postoperation of visual acuity, intraocular pressure, filtering bleb and postoperation complications were observed. RESULTS: After 6 mo postoperation, the vision was significantly improved. The intraocular pressure was controlled in normal range and filtering bleb was good. There was a little complications after operation. CONCLUSION: Phacoemulsification intraocular lens implantation with anti-glaucoma establishes new aqueous humor outflow.

40|$|Fluorescein angiograms were {{performed}} {{on a group of}} low-tension glaucoma and <b>chronic</b> <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> patients with similar extent of visual field loss, under standardised conditions, to see whether differences attributable to chronic intraocular pressure elevation could be detected.

Low-tension glaucoma patients demonstrated focal sector hypoperfusion of the optic nerve in every case, while the <b>chronic</b> <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> patients demonstrated a wide range of optic nerve fluorescence, suggesting both focal and diffuse optic nerve head hypoperfusion. It was concluded that, while focal hypoperfusion of the optic nerve may reflect susceptible vasculature at the nerve head with or without intraocular pressure elevation, diffuse hypoperfusion suggested that prolonged intraocular pressure elevation may simultaneously affect the whole of the optic nerve head.

40|$|THE {{object of}} this note {{is to put}} forward the {{hypothesis}} that hour-glass stricture of the stomach occurs in persons with a <b>chronic</b> <b>simple</b> gastric ulcer of the lesser curvature, because these persons also have chronic iron deficiency, and that the stricture would not occur without the co-existence of the iron deficiency. Seven cases are described. An association with Plummer-Vinson stricture of the cervical oesophagus and with duodenal stricture is recorded. The X-ray appearances are reproduced. The haemoglobin and serum iron estimations are recorded. Gastroscopy was done in one case. One case was operated on. Important reviews of hour-glass stomach include those of Moynihan (1904) Hurst and Stewart (1929) and Bockus (1943). Hour-glass deformity of the stomach occurs almost exclusively in women.

40|$|HYALINE or glassy ridge {{formation}} on {{the posterior}} corneal surface {{appears to be}} a not uncommon phenomenon, the recognition of which may be missed without careful examina-tion with the slit-lamp microscope. Normally, Descemet's membrane is secreted as a hyaline tissue by the endothelial corneal cells during intra-uterine life; the exact point of development at which it appears is not definitely known, but may be at the 49 mm. stage (Mann, 1964). In some pathological conditions, these endothelial cells may exhibit exuberant hyaline formation, so that elevated plaques or ridges may form on the posterior corneal surface. Elsewhere in the eye, similar abnormal hyaline formation has long been recognized as occurring in circumstances of chronic irritation affecting ocular cellular layers, such as the lens and retinal epithelium and iris endothelium, and in such conditions as <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and <b>chronic</b> iridocyclitis (Herbert, 1927). Hyaline ridges or membranes on the cornea are of two kinds: the first and more common is closely applied to the cornea throughout its extent and the second lies mainly in the anterior chamber but is attached to the cornea at one or more extremities.

40|$|Abstract Background With the {{increasing}} number of people participating in physical aerobic exercise, jogging in particular, we considered that it would be worth knowing if there are should be limits to the exercise with regard to the intraocular pressure (IOP) of the eyes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to check IOP in healthy and primary glaucoma patients after aerobic exercise. Methods 145 individuals were subdivided into seven groups: normotensives who exercised regularly (Group A); normotensives in whose right eye (RE) timolol maleate 0. 5 % (Group B), latanoprost 0. 005 % (Group C), or brimonidine tartrate 0. 2 % (Group D) was instilled; and primary glaucoma patients under monotherapy with β-blockers (Group E), prostaglandin analogues (Group F) or combined antiglaucoma treatment (Group G) instilled in both eyes. The IOP of both eyes was measured before and after exercise. Results A statistically significant decrease was found in IOP during jogging. The aerobic exercise reduces the IOP in those eyes where a b-blocker, a prostaglandin analogue or an α-agonist was previously instilled. The IOP is also decreased in glaucoma patients who are already under antiglaucoma treatment. Conclusion There is no ocular restriction for <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> patients in performing aerobic physical activity. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{anatomical}} relationships of the anterior {{segment of the}} eye, using ultrasound biomicroscopy in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and nonglaucomatous eyes, after mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation. Patients and Methods: Thirty eyes with <b>chronic</b> <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and 30 nonglaucomatous eyes were studied. Anterior chamber depth, iris-lens contact and iris-zonule distance were measured, in both groups, using ultrasound biomicroscopy, in the three following conditions: without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, with 1 % tropicamide alone and with 1 % tropicamide plus 10 % phenylephrine chlorhydrate. Results: Ultrasound biomicroscopy examinations of glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes, without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, showed {{no statistically significant difference}} in the central anterior chamber depth, iris-lens contact and iris-zonule distance. The difference between examinations without mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation, with 1 % tropicamide and with 1 % tropicamide plus 10 % phenylephrine chlorhydrate was statistically significant regarding the variables measured in both groups. Conclusions: No anatomical difference was observed between the anterior segment of glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes after mydriatic and cycloplegic instillation.

40|$|There is now strong {{evidence}} for a genetic basis to glaucoma. Numerous family histories have been recorded, and Dodinval, Prijot, and Weekers (I 970) consider that at least 20 per cent. of cases of open-angle glaucoma are of a familial and hereditary character. Ad-ditional evidence derives from studies of the families of patients with glaucoma. Kellerman and Posner (1955) examined 192 relatives and detected eight cases of chronic simple glaucoma; Becker, Kolker, and Roth (I 960) examined I IO parents, siblings, and children of patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>simple</b> <b>glaucoma</b> and diagnosed the condition in six.

Objective: To carry out a comparative study between the bacterial findings found in the <b>simple</b> and cholesteatomatous <b>chronic</b> otitis media secretion. Method: We studied the bacterioscopy of 83 patients (125 ears) with chronic otitis media, 43 (52 ears) with cholesteatoma and 40 (73 ears) with <b>simple</b> <b>chronic</b> otitis, and age prevalence from 16 to 20 years. The duration of otorrhea ranged between 2 months and 10 years. For collection of the material we used very practical instrument with tioglicolate broth inside and outside sent to the laboratory for a maximum period of until 18 hours. Results: The S. aureus was more frequent in the <b>simple</b> <b>chronic</b> otitis, and the anaerobic were more frequent in the cholesteatoma.
