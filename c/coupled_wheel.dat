500|$|The K1 {{prototype}} {{was slightly}} {{faster and more}} powerful than the Kclass, and gave a smoother ride at low speeds. It was also found to have a wider route availability due to the smaller outside cylinders. However, the Holcroft valve gear proved to be difficult to maintain in everyday service. This locomotive was also noted for particularly poor riding characteristics at high speed, derailing twice in 1927. [...] The first derailment occurred at , near Maidstone on 31 March, when the flanges of the lead <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted the rails at [...] The second derailment was at [...] on 20 August, when the lead driving wheel mounted and completely dropped off the rails at , derailing the train and causing serious damage to the track. These derailments were attributed to the slightly higher centre of gravity of the boiler on the K1. Although the official reports of these accidents blamed the poor quality of the track, a group of directors sought to have both classes banned from use on passenger services, but were overruled by the Southern Railway's Chairman of the Board of Directors, Everard Baring on grounds of cost.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe {{this problem}} was often {{overcome}} {{by dividing the}} drive between inside and outside cylinders, or else by using Articulated locomotives, although {{at the time it}} was not believed possible to run one stably at greater than [...] American railroads proved to be unwilling to use locomotives with inside cylinders, so the problem of balance could not be solved by adding more cylinders per <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> set. As locomotives got larger and more powerful, their reciprocating machinery had to get stronger and thus heavier, and thus the problems posed by imbalance and hammer blow became more severe. Speed also played a factor, since the forces became greater and more destructive at higher wheel speeds. Ralph P. Johnson thought that the growing size and piston thrusts of existing express passenger locomotives could not be sustained with the by-then conventional 4-8-4 2-cylinder layout. In addition, he became convinced that a single pair of cylinders with conventional valve gear and piston valves was approaching the limits in terms of steam flow.|$|E

5000|$|Between 1913 and 1915, the SAR placed 45 Class 14 {{locomotives}} in service. Designed by Hendrie as {{a development}} of the Class 12, it was built by Robert Stephenson and Company. With 48 in <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> it was evolved as intermediate locomotive between the Class 3B with its 45 in <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> and the Class 12 with its 51 in <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Garratt {{design has}} some {{inherent}} drawbacks, however, the first being a diminishing factor of adhesion over long distances. As water and coal is consumed, the weight over the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> is reduced, thereby reducing their factor of adhesion, {{the ratio of}} weight on <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> to tractive effort. Therefore, as the weight on the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> decreases, the locomotive has less adhesion and becomes increasingly prone to slipping.|$|R

50|$|The S 3/6, {{designed}} by the Maffei company {{under the leadership of}} engineers Anton Hammel und Heinrich Leppla, was a development of the first German Pacific, the somewhat smaller Baden IV f. Like its forerunner, the S 3/6 had a four-cylinder compound running gear with single-axle drive on the second coupled axle. With the exception of series d and e, that had a <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter of 2,000 mm, the S 3/6 had a <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter of 1,870 mm, that allowed it to be deployed both in hilly terrain {{as well as on the}} plains.|$|E
50|$|The cylinders, with rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear, were {{identical}} {{to those of the}} Class 19C but with the stroke reduced from 26 in to 24 in. The modified cylinder covers had deep spigots to suit the reduction in stroke. The main drive and valve gear drive was from the third pair of coupled wheels. Grease lubrication was provided for all <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axle boxes. The ten-coupled wheel arrangement, in conjunction with the sharp curvature of the lines in South West, necessitated special side play for the leading <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axle boxes and spherical bearings for the leading crank pins.|$|E
5000|$|The second pair of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{had a total}} sideplay of 13/32 in, {{while the}} {{trailing}} <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> had a sideplay of 1 in. The engines bore number plates on their smokebox sides, inscribed [...] "LE" [...] and the engine number. Both versions of the type were equipped with dust shields over the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> and valve gear to protect the moving parts from blown sand in the Namib desert.|$|R
50|$|The {{class were}} four-cylinder {{compound}} locomotives of the de Glenn type - the high-pressure cylinders {{were on the}} outside and drove the middle <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> the low-pressure cylinders were inside, and drove the leading <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{compound}} Mallet locomotive, the rear set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are driven by}} the smaller high-pressure cylinders, from which spent steam is then fed to the larger low-pressure cylinders which drive the front set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first was}} {{delivered}} in May 1896 by Beyer, Peacock and Company with further orders {{over the next}} 20 years seeing the class number 280. Their second and third <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> tyres were flangeless to reduce curve friction.|$|E
50|$|The Class GCA {{proved to}} be good locomotives, {{although}} some trouble was experienced with coupling rods breaking, much of which was attributed to running them at excessive speed to maintain schedules with their small <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter of only 42+3/4 in.|$|E
50|$|The engine used Richardson slide valves, {{arranged}} {{above the}} cylinders and actuated by the Stephenson motion and rocker shafts. The eccentrics were fitted to the trailing <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axle, {{which resulted in}} exceptionally long valve connecting rods of 7 ft.|$|E
50|$|In the {{compound}} Mallet locomotive, the rear set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are driven by}} the smaller high-pressure cylinders which are fed steam from the steam dome. Their spent steam is then fed to the larger low-pressure cylinders which drive the front set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|These locomotives, {{which used}} Stephenson valve gear, were {{intended}} for freight work. The locomotives {{delivered to the}} Midland System had <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> of 42 in diameter, while those delivered to the Eastern System where grades were much more severe, had <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> of 38 in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{operated on}} [...] gauge. The “A”, {{is used to}} identify the number of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> being four <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> for the A10 class, followed by numerals indicating the cylinder diameter of ten inches. Baldwin indicates that the builder was the Baldwin Locomotive Works, United States.|$|R
50|$|The outside {{cylinders}} {{drove the}} coupled wheels {{and the inside}} cylinders drove a coupled pair of rack wheels. The rack wheels were carried on a frame suspended from the widely separated leading and driving <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axles, which had an 8 ft wheelbase.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} version, these engines had a 2 bar higher boiler {{pressure}} and larger <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> and cylinder diameters. In addition the top speed was not 45 km/h. An unusual feature was the driver's cab roof, that was rounded {{front and back}} and not, as was then common, at the sides.|$|E
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{conformed to}} SAR requirements {{as far as}} practicable but also incorporated the latest American railway engineering practices. The engines introduced several features which were new to the SAR at the time, such as top feeds to the boiler, self-cleaning smokeboxes, Sellar's drifting valves, and grease lubrication to the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axle boxes, crank pins and connecting rod big ends.|$|E
50|$|In the {{compound}} Mallet locomotive, the rear set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are driven by}} the smaller high-pressure cylinders which are fed steam from the steam dome via the superheater. Their spent steam is then fed to the larger low-pressure cylinders which drive the front set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the Class 14 was {{designed}} by D.A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR), {{it was believed that}} small differences in wheel diameter had disproportionate effects on performance. The SAR already had the Class 3B Mountain type with 45 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> and the Class 12 Mountain type with 51 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> but for the 300 ft radius curves and 1 in 30 (3⅓%) compensated gradients of the Natal mainline, the Class 14 with 48 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> was designed as an intermediate-sized locomotive.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} had larger boilers {{than the}} Eight-Coupled Tank locomotives {{which had been}} delivered from the same manufacturer between 1907 and 1910, but their cylinders, frames and motion were interchangeable {{with those of the}} tank engines. As on the tank engines, the second pair of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> had a total sideplay of 13/32 in, while the trailing <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> had a sideplay of 1 in. The locomotives were equipped with dust shields over the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> and valve gear to protect the moving parts from blown sand in the Namib desert.|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, 36 Class 19A {{locomotives}} entered service. It was a later {{model of}} the Class 19, but redesigned by Collins to achieve a lighter axle loading by reducing the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter from 54 to 51 in, reducing the cylinder diameter from 21 to 19.5 in and by using a smaller boiler. They were built by Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM).|$|E
50|$|The Class GB was {{numbered}} 1650, but {{the engine}} number was later changed to 2166. The locomotive was erected in the Durban shops and placed in service in June 1921. It was superheated, with a Belpaire firebox, plate frames and Walschaerts valve gear. The boiler was provided with the Gresley type air valve and mechanical lubrication was provided for the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axle boxes.|$|E
50|$|While these engines {{were also}} built on bar frames like the {{previous}} two 6th Class versions, they were slightly larger, with larger boilers and with 17+1/2 in diameter cylinders compared to the 17 in diameter cylinders of all earlier 6th Class locomotives. Like the two Class 6F locomotives, a visually obvious distinguishing feature was their higher mounted running boards {{without the need for}} <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> fairings.|$|E

50|$|All these {{locomotives}} had 42 {{in diameter}} <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels,</b> unlike the six 4th Class locomotives {{which had been}} delivered to the Eastern System in 1880 and 1881, which had smaller 38 in diameter <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b> These 33 locomotives were delivered with Stephenson valve gear, like their predecessors of 1880 and 1881.|$|R
50|$|The 2-6-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} was {{most often used}} for articulated compound steam Mallet locomotives. In a compound Mallet, the rear set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> are driven by the smaller high pressure cylinders, from which spent steam is then fed to the larger low pressure cylinders that drive the front set of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|All coupled wheels were flanged. The axle {{boxes of}} the leading and {{trailing}} wheels were equipped with roller bearings while the solid bronze <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> axle boxes were soft grease-lubricated. Soft grease lubrication was used throughout for the motion gear, except the piston rods, valve spindles and main crossheads which were oil-lubricated. Two four-feed sight lubricators, arranged in the cab, supplied oil to the steam chests and cylinders.|$|E
50|$|Like the Class 19, the Class 19A {{also had}} Walschaerts valve gear and a bar frame. Col F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR) at the time, {{redesigned}} the Class 19 {{to achieve a}} lighter axle loading by reducing the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> diameters from 54 to 51 in, reducing the cylinder diameter from 21 to 19+1/2 in and by using a slightly smaller boiler.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>coupled</b> <b>wheel</b> tyres {{had to be}} renewed, the {{diameter}} of the wheels was increased from 45+1/2 in to 46 in. This reduced the tractive effort from 46414 lbf kN at 50% of boiler pressure to 45900 lbf kN. Unlike all other locomotive types where the SAR reported tractive effort at 75% of boiler pressure, it followed an ultra-conservative practice of reporting that of all Mallet locomotives at 50%.|$|E

50|$|Like the Neilson-built 4th Class 4-6-0TT of 1882, these {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with Joy valve gear, {{but they had}} smaller <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> of 38+1/2 in diameter. The <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were not spaced equidistant from each other, with a wheelbase of 3 ft between the leading wheel and the driver and 4 ft between the driver and the trailing wheel.|$|R
50|$|The spring {{compensation}} {{of the engine}} was arranged in two groups. The leading Bissel bogie and the first two pairs of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were compensated in one group, while the remaining three pairs of <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels</b> were compensated with the trailing bogie. Cross compensation was provided between the leading Bissel bogie and leading <b>coupled</b> <b>wheels.</b> Instead of pins, case-hardened cotters were provided for fulcrums of the bearing spring compensating beams. The proportion of balanced reciprocating parts was only 6% which reduced the hammer blow on the rails to 5 lcwt kg per wheel at 50 mph. The locomotive was noted for its smooth running.|$|R
