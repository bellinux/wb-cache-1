40|$|The Marcus cross {{relation}} {{provides a}} tool to calculate <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> from the corresponding identity rates and the equilibrium constant. Assumptions made in deriving the Marcus cross relation and conclusions which {{can be drawn from}} agreement or disagreement between experimental and calculated <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> are discussed. For a small variation in identity rate constants agreement between experimental and calculated <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> simply means that the rate constant of a hypothetical thermoneutral cross reaction has a value within the range covered by the identity rates. Whether or not this value corresponds indeed to the mean value of logarithmic identity rate constants can only be checked for a large variation in identity rates. Therefore, a newly defined index M relates the difference in experimental and calculated logarithmic rate constants to the variation in the logarithmic identity rates. Provided the Marcus cross relation is not obeyed this indicates non-additivity of kinetic parameters. Applying this analysis to proton-transfers reactions between different transition metal acids and between 9 -alkylfluorenes and (9 -alkylfluorenyl) lithium shows that claims about agreement or disagreement of experimental rate constants with the rate constants calculated by means of the Marcus cross relation have to be revised in part...|$|E

In particular, under the assumption of no-arbitrage, the foreign exchange risk premium is driven by the difference between investors' market prices of risk in the two currencies. In an international economy with three currencies, sterling, US dollar and Deutschemark, we can use the information on implied volatilities of the three <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> to derive estimates of implied or ex ante market prices of risk and of foreign exchange risk premia.

40|$|Traditionally, asset {{demands are}} derived as a {{solution}} to the individual's or household's problem of allocating wealth among various real and financial alternatives. The demand for each asset depends on the own real rate of return, but also on the real rates of return to alternative assets. The sensitivity to own and <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> captures the speculative element in portfolio allocation, the motive usually being to maximise end-of-period wealth. Typically, asset demands also depend on income, reflecting the transactions motive for asset holding.

Also, the theoretical restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry are thoroughly rejected by the static model versions, however, not by the dynamic demand system. The cross rate elasticities between bonds and savings deposits and also between money and time deposits are found to be negligible for Germany.

This comes with a decrease in transaction volume in the euro rates relative to the previous DM rates. The starkest example is the DM(euro) /yen rate in which the spread has risen by almost two-thirds while the volume has almost halved. We propose a microstructure theory for a system of multiple exchange rates in which spreads are endogenously determined. It is argued that the elimination of <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> due {{to the introduction of}} the euro reduced the intra-temporal risk sharing capacity of the multicurrency dealership market.

However, crossings may vary by species, culvert design, different environmental factors, and land-use and land-cover (LULC) at culvert sites. We monitored 265 culverts located throughout Maryland, USA, with motion-detecting game cameras to assess seasonal and regional effects on culvert <b>crossing</b> <b>rates</b> by wildlife and other animal species considered common to the areas. Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) exhibited lower <b>crossing</b> <b>rates</b> in culverts during winter than at other times of the year. We did not detect any difference in seasonal crossings for other species, but several species exhibited similar patterns of lower crossings/culvert/day during winter. We detected more crossings/culvert/day in the Piedmont ecoregion of Maryland for several species associated with farmland and suburbia (e. g., raccoon and red fox [Vulpes vulpes]). In contrast, opossum and free-ranging domestic cat (Felis catus) <b>crossing</b> <b>rates</b> were greater in the Appalachian Mountain ecoregion.

40|$|Although it {{is a very}} {{important}} economic issue, the currency convertibility {{has become one of the}} most neglected issues in the modern economic theory, particularly after the abolition of dollar convertibility into gold in 1971. Nowadays, it is said that the currency convertibility is a technique for exchange of one currency to other currencies at floating rates in the <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> of exchange in the world and it is treated as a consequent solution into the evolution of currency convertibility. However, the facts are contrary to the treatment of such a kind. The exchange of one currency to other currencies at floating rates is a digression in the evolution of currency convertibility because its effects upon the rationality of the process of international division of labour have been corrected by this type of convertibility. This is a priority function within the original meaning of currency convertibility. However, this function cannot be fulfilled effectively without creating a global currency by which the national currencies will be connected to fixed, but adjustable exchange rates.

40|$|From the Introduction]. With {{only two}} more years to run on the European Community's (EC) 1992 single market program, European leaders have been seeking {{for the last several}} years to develop and specify a range of {{extensive}} proposals to enhance the benefits of an integrated market. One principal direction in which the Community has embarked has been to set the course for economic, monetary and political union. While political union probably will have the most visible impact on the face of Europe as we know it, any real progress seems light years away. No one in Europe is prepared to make the hard decisions required until some concrete evidence of the success of the single market is apparent. For the moment the most visible movement toward any substantial kind of union is in the realm of economic and monetary affairs (EMU). Originally intended for furthering the benefits already obvious from a decade's experience with closer currency cooperation by locking in the <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> between member countries, EMU, even in the draft stage, is taking on a much larger significance for the economies of each member state...|$|E

USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY) and measures of risk appetite (i. e. the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones Industrial Average index and the VIX index). Our results show the equity indexes, especially the Dow Jones Industrial Average, play a more important role in the determination of the Yen <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> than VIX. The popular carry-trade currencies, i. e. NZD/JPY, AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY, are more affected by the US equity market than USD/JPY and EUR/JPY. While the long-term relationships are consistent across the four different time zones, the short-term dynamics are different. We find that the response of NZD/JPY, AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY to changes in the US stock market is much greater in the New Zealand and Australian zones than in the UK or US. Although the short-term relationship between exchange rates and the equity index is quite strong, the error correction speed is very sluggish. We also find evidence of asymmetric adjustment in the response of exchange rates to changes in global risk aversion. Carry trade currencies tend to appreciate gradually when conditions are favorable but fall sharply when market risk increases...|$|E

Such a procedure is sensitive to the choice of base country, ignores the information in all the other <b>cross</b> <b>rates</b> and is subject to {{a high degree of}} cross section dependence which has adverse effects on estimation and inference. In this paper we conduct a variety of unit root tests on all possible N(N + 1) / 2 real rates between pairs of the N + 1 countries and estimate the proportion of the pairs that are stationary. This proportion can be consistently estimated even in the presence of cross-section dependence. We estimate this proportion using quarterly data on the real exchange rate for 50 countries over the period 1957 - 2001. The main substantive conclusion is that to reject the null of no adjustment to PPP requires sufficiently large disequilibria to move the real rate out of the band of inaction set by trade costs. In such cases one can reject the null of no adjustment to PPP up to 90 % of the time as compared to around 40 % in the whole sample using a linear alternative and almost 60 % using a non-linear alternative...|$|E
