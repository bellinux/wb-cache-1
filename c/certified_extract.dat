40|$|Work in Progress Session, 21 st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA 2016). 6 to 9, Sep, 2016. Berlin, Germany. Concurrent {{programming}} {{is dominated by}} thread based solutions with lock based critical sections. Careful attention has {{to be paid to}} avoid race and deadlock conditions. Real-Time for The Masses (RTFM) takes an alternative language approach, introducing tasks and named critical sections (via resources) natively in the RTFM-core language. RTFM-core programs can be compiled to native C-code, and efficiently executed onto single-core platforms under the Stack Resource Policy (SRP) by the RTFM-kernel. In this paper we formally define the well-formedness criteria for SRP based resource management, and develop a certified (formally proven) implementation of the corresponding compilation from nested critical sections of the input RTFM-core program to a resulting flat sequence of primitive operations and scheduling primitives. Moreover we formalise the properties for resource ceilings under SRP and develop a certified algorithm for their computation. The feasibility of the described approach is shown through the adoption of the Why 3 platform, which allows the necessary verification conditions to be automatically generated and discharged through a variety of automatic external SMT-solvers and interactive theorem provers. Moreover, Why 3 supports the extraction of certified Ocaml code for proven implementations in WhyML. As a proof of concept the <b>certified</b> <b>extracted</b> development is demonstrated on an example system. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

We give a coinductive {{characterisation}} {{of the set}} {{of continuous}} functions defined on a compact real interval, and <b>extract</b> <b>certified</b> programs that construct and combine exact real number algorithms {{with respect to the}} binary signed digit representation of real numbers. The data type corresponding to the coinductive definition of continuous functions consists of finitely branching non-wellfounded trees describing when the algorithm writes and reads digits.

40|$|Two {{standard}} solutions of deuterated {{polycyclic aromatic compounds}} (PACs) {{have been}} prepared for use as surrogate internal standards. Solution DPAC- 1 contains 21 deuterated PACs, and is intended for use with mass spectrometric (MS) detection. Most of the difficulties in certifying concentrations in DPAC- 1 arose {{from the fact that}} none of the individual compounds was 100 % deuterated, so that effects of mass spectrometric fragmentation are convoluted with those of isotopic distributions. The best methods are discussed for using such internal standards so as to minimize these problems, together with those arising from kinetic isotope effects. Solution DPAC- 2 contains 6 deuterated PACs, and is primarily intended for use with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection (FLD, dual programmed wavelength mode), in which the signals for analyte and internal standard are separated chromatographically rather than via the detector. Full details of the preparation of these solutions are described. In addition, examples of their use in the analysis of a <b>certified</b> coal-tar <b>extract</b> (NIST SRM 1597) are described briefly. In one example a novel HPLC-MS technique was employed, and in the other the HPLC-FLD technique was used. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

Each PAH in the spiked sediment was quantified by using the spectrofluorometric method. The optimised methods were compared on the extraction efficiency of 14 PAHs in a certified sediment reference material, LGC 6188. Recoveries of 14 PAHs were performed by HPLC-DAD at 254 nm using the standard addition method. The {{results showed that the}} most extraction efficient method was pressurised microwave-assisted extraction with cyclohexane:acetone (3 : 2) for 15 min at 140 % boiling point of acetone. Under this condition for the <b>extracted</b> <b>certified</b> sediment reference material recovery was 96. 55 %. It can be concluded from the experimental results that pressurised microwave-assisted extraction in a closed system provides a good alternative to sonication extraction for the extraction of PAHs from sediments.

This study aimed to assess a potential herb-drug interaction among a standardized (<b>certified)</b> Paullinia cupana <b>extract</b> and amiodarone (narrow therapeutic index drug) in rats. In a first pharmacokinetic study rats were simultaneously coadministered with a single dose of Paullinia cupana (821 [*]mg/kg, p. o.) and amiodarone (50 [*]mg/kg, p. o.), and in a second study rats were pretreated during 14 days with Paullinia cupana (821 [*]mg/kg/day, p. o.) receiving amiodarone (50 [*]mg/kg, p. o.) on the 15 th day. Rats of the control groups received the corresponding volume of vehicle. Blood samples were collected at several time points after amiodarone dosing, and several tissues were harvested {{at the end of}} the experiments (24 [*]h after dose). Plasma and tissue concentrations of amiodarone and its major metabolite (mono-N-desethylamiodarone) were measured and analysed. A significant reduction in the peak plasma concentration (73. 2 %) and in the extent of systemic exposure (57. 8 %) to amiodarone was found in rats simultaneously treated with Paullinia cupana and amiodarone; a decrease in tissue concentrations was also observed.

40|$|The {{present study}} reviews the {{potentiality}} of Rhizopus oryzae, a potent saprophytic and pathogenic fungus {{to produce a}} wide spectrum of metabolites, in the form of enzymes, esters, organic acids, volatile materials, polymers and bioalcohols. A number of extra and intra cellular enzymes are found to be synthesized by various strains of Rhizopus oryzae that includes cellulaes, hemicellulases, pectinases, tannase, phytase, amylase, lipase, protease and other enzymes of immense industrial importance. The fungus is a rich source of lactic acid and is widely studied as a commercially perspective producer of L(+) -LA. In many strains, the end product of glycolysis is channeled to ethanol by the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase and therefore may be used for the production of alcohol. Biodiesel can also be produced by methanolysis and transesterification reactions employing specific strains of R. oryzae having the relevant enzymes. Dry mycelium of Rhizopus oryzae are proved effective for efficiently catalyzing the synthesis of different flavor esters. Since the Joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food Additives (JEFCA) and Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, USA <b>certified</b> the enzymes <b>extracted</b> from Rhizopus oryzae may be used as food additives for human consumption, this fungal group may be exhaustively used for commercial purposes...|$|R

Tíðni sykursýki hefur aukist mikið í heiminum en ein af afleiðingum hennar eru þrálát sár. Markmið rannsóknanna var að kanna vefjasamrýmanleika og eiginleika sem skipta máli fyrir nýtingu roðsins til viðgerðar á líkamsvef. Efniviður og aðferðir: Bygging affrumaðs roðs var metin með smásjárskoðun. Mat á vefjasamrýmanleika græðlingsins var framkvæmd af vottaðri sérhæfðri rannsóknarstofu. Próteinhluti efnisins var kannaður með próteinrafdrætti. Seyting frumuboðanna interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) og IL- 12 p 40, IL- 6 og TNF-α frá einkjörnungum (monocytes) eða stórátfrumum (macrophages) í uppleystum próteinhluta efnisins var mældur með Elísu-prófi. Áhrif roðsins á nýmyndun æða in vivo var metin með æða- og þvagbelgshimnulíkani í hænufóstrum. Niðurstöður: Smásjármyndir sýna að bygging affrumaðs roðs er holótt. Efnið stóðst öll vefjasamrýmanleikapróf. Við rafdrátt próteinsýnis komu í ljós prótein á stærðarbilinu 115 - 130 kDa sem er einkennandi fyrir bandvef. Roðið reyndist ekki hafa marktæk áhrif á seytingu IL- 10, IL- 12 p 40, IL- 6 eða TNF-αfrá einkjörnungum eða stórátfrumum. Græðlingurinn hefur marktæk örvandi áhrif á æðamyndun í æða- og þvagbelgshimnulíkani. Ályktun: Niðurstöðurnar sýna að affrumað roð er skaðlaust og veldur ekki bólgusvari. Græðlingurinn inniheldur meðal annars bandvef líkt og mannshúð. Affrumað roð hefur marktæk örvandi áhrif á æðamyndun og smásjármyndir af byggingu roðsins sýna að hún sé vel til þess fallin að styðja innvöxt frumna.

Introduction: Acellular {{fish skin}} of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) {{is being used to}} treat chronic wounds. The {{prevalence}} of diabetes and the comorbidity of chronic wounds is increasing globally. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the biocompatibility and biological characteristics of acellular fish skin, important for tissue repair. Materials and methods: The structure of the acellular fish skin was examined with microscopy. Biocompatibility of the graft was conducted by a specialized <b>certified</b> laboratory. Protein <b>extracts</b> from the material were analyzed using gel electrophoresis. Cytokine levels were measured with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Angiogenic properties were assessed with a chick chorioallantoic membrane (chick CAM) assay. Results: The structure of acellular fish skin is porous and the material is biocompatible. Electrophoresis revealed proteins around the size 115 - 130 kDa, indicative of collagens. The material did not have significant effect on IL- 10, IL- 12 p 40, IL- 6 or TNF-α secretion from monocytes or macrophages. Acellular fish skin has significant effect on angiogenesis in the chick CAM assay. Conclusion: The acellular fish skin is not toxic and is not likely to promote inflammatory responses. The graft contains collagen I, promotes angiogenesis and supports cellular ingrowth. Compared to similar products made from mammalian sources, acellular fish skin does not confer a disease risk and contains more bioactive compounds, due to less severe processing...|$|R
