25|$|The Medallion {{featured}} four-wheel {{independent suspension}} with MacPherson struts {{in the front}} with negative offset for stability and inclined lower wishbones for anti-dive effect, while the rear suspension is controlled by a V-section <b>cross-member</b> with four transverse torsion bars and inclined shock absorbers.|$|E
25|$|Astres were {{confined}} to a single series for 1976, but they were refined with extensive engine, chassis, and body integrity improvements. A modest facelift included a revised grill. The 2.3L engine, named Dura-built 140, received improved cooling and durability refinements, and a five years/60,000 mile warranty. The chassis received the new Pontiac Sunbird's upgraded components including the box-section front <b>cross-member,</b> larger rear brakes and torque-arm rear suspension, replacing the four-link design, and effectively eliminating wheel-hop on rough roads. The body received extensive anti-rust improvements.|$|E

2500|$|Prime movers {{were used}} to tow field {{artillery}} pieces, they also transported gun crews, equipment, and ammunition. They had a pintle hitch at the rear for towing up to [...] Another pintle at the front {{could be used to}} emplace the piece.

2500|$|At the 2006 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, Aston Martin officially {{unveiled}} the V8 Vantage Roadster. The car gained 200 pounds over the coupé, but Aston Martin claimed the car {{would have the}} same performance as the coupé. To compensate for the loss of the roof a new, super-stiff <b>cross-member</b> was added to the frame. The soft top could be raised or lowered electronically in 18 seconds and could be operated in speeds up to [...]|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1956 the wheelbases were {{extended}} by [...] to [...] and , {{and the front}} chassis <b>cross-member</b> was moved an inch forward, to accommodate the new diesel engine, to be an option the following year. This change was made to all models {{with the exception of}} the 107 Station Wagon, which would never be fitted with a diesel engine, and would eventually be the last series I in production. These dimensions were to be used on all Land Rovers for the next 25 years.|$|E
50|$|The chassis was {{a ladder}} frame with large tubular steel <b>cross-members</b> downswept {{from the front}} and rear axles towards the centre to lower the centre of gravity.|$|R
50|$|Separating two logs {{by a pair}} of <b>cross-members</b> called akas {{achieved}} the increased stability at lower weight and less effort. Covering the intervening distance with a platform provides stability similar to a raft.|$|R
50|$|The Nimbus had {{a similar}} bolted {{lightweight}} steel frame with channel section longitudinals and tubular <b>cross-members</b> to the Claymore featuring a down-sloping front section. During its production life component changes followed those of the Claymore.|$|R
2500|$|The Passe-Partout had a {{monocoque}} fuselage of rounded rectangular cross-section. [...] Its {{engine was}} mounted, with cylinders exposed, {{in the upper}} nose. The pilot's open cockpit placed him just aft of the upper trailing edge but over the lower wing because of the stagger. [...] At the rear a plywood covered tailplane was mounted high on the fuselage and fitted with fabric covered elevators. Both the fin and rounded rudder were also ply covered. Its [...] fixed landing gear was of the conventional tailskid type with mainwheels on a single axle rubber rubber sprung from a frame consisting of two V-form struts from the lower fuselage with a single <b>cross-member.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the British Army had {{acquired}} around 9,000 Series III models, which were mainly a special 'Heavy Duty' {{version of the}} [...] Soft Top. These models had improved suspension components and a different chassis <b>cross-member</b> design. These were produced in 12-volt 'GS' models and 24-volt 'FFR' versions. A small number were [...] GS and FFR models, but in general the Army used the Air-Portable 1/2 ton, [...] "Lightweight" [...] version. The Lightweight was in service by many armies all over the world. In Europe even the Dutch Landmacht and the Danish Army used the Land-Rover Lightweight. Instead of the petrol engine the Dutch and Danish Lightweights had diesel engines. Instead of the canvas top the Dutch ones had PVC tops like the modern Land Rover 'Wolf'.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{take-off}} (PTO) was {{integral to}} the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was [...] "...to have power take-offs everywhere!" [...] The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: [...] "the power take-off is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis <b>cross-member</b> and an [...] belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing." [...] PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up {{to the demise of}} the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.|$|E
50|$|The frame had {{the popular}} {{cruciform}} or X-channelled sectioned <b>cross-membering.</b> The unit of engine, fluid flywheel and self-changing gearbox {{was held at}} four points on rubber, the two points in front being close together and on the cross member.|$|R
50|$|The prototypes were {{fitted with}} both 'General Service' canvas-covered rear bodies {{or with a}} steel/fibreglass box body. Some Llamas were fitted with a {{mechanical}} winch driven from the gearbox, which could be fed through the front or rear chassis <b>cross-members</b> for vehicle recovery.|$|R
50|$|So {{named for}} its {{resemblance}} to a ladder, the ladder frame {{is one of the}} simplest and oldest of all designs. It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels running the length of the vehicle, and several transverse <b>cross-members</b> connecting them. Originally seen on almost all vehicles, the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and unitized body construction. It is now seen mainly on trucks. This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular <b>cross-members</b> are used. Also, the vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the floor pan sitting above the frame instead of inside it.|$|R
2500|$|The Caudron-Fabre, {{like the}} earlier Caudron land-planes, had no {{enclosed}} fuselage but instead {{a pair of}} parallel vertical girders, each with cross-members but only cross-braced horizontally towards the tail. On the land-planes the lower longitudinal members of the girder ran to the undercarriage; this was not practical on the float-plane so they were replaced by horizontal members running forward from the tail to beyond the wing. These extensions, braced by sloping struts on each side to both of the centre section struts formed a kind of outrigger on which the pilot sat, exposed, just forward of the leading edge. Behind the pilot and mounted on the rear pair of the centre-section struts was an un-cowled, pusher configuration [...] Anzani 6-cylinder radial engine. Long cut-outs from the trailing edges of both wings were needed to clear {{the path of the}} large diameter, two blade propeller. A rectangular tailplane was mounted on a cross member between the upper girders, strengthened by outward diagonal bracing, with broad chord elevator-like surfaces extending beyond. A pair of rectangular rudders were hinged, close together, from this same <b>cross-member.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Caudron-Fabre had an {{undercarriage}} {{composed of}} both wheels and floats, {{though it was}} possible to remove the former; photographs show the aircraft in both configurations. [...] There was no cross-axle, each wheel being mounted individually on two pairs of outwardly splayed V-struts from the feet of the inner interplane struts and another to the feet of the nearest centre-section struts. Its floats were mounted immediately ahead of the wheels, articulated at a forward point on their centreline by a strut from the outrigger, a strut from the wing leading edge over the wheels and another from the wheel axle. A rear strut had a pneumatic shock absorber. [...] A third float, similar in size and shape, was mounted on a vertical strut attached to the girder <b>cross-member</b> ahead of the tailplane, braced at its lower end by a pair of struts angled up {{to the ends of the}} vertical girders. [...] The floats were flat bottomed with segmental section and an almost square plan, with a width about 70% of their length. As on Fabre's original aircraft, they were mounted with a pronounced angle of attack.|$|E
2500|$|The core of {{the flat}} frame {{fuselage}} was formed with a horizontal beam about [...] long, to which two other [...] converging struts were attached, making overall a vertical A-frame. The downward sloping extremities of these beams carried a slightly deeper horizontal box structure below the cross beam, with the open pilot's seat and controls upon it. On some later aircraft there was an extra vertical member for the lower cross beam to the wing root to provide the pilot with a backrest. [...] Others enclosed him or her in a simple, light, short nacelle between the nose and the backrest strut. The rear part of the fuselage frame was based on two longer beams reaching to the tail. [...] The upper one was horizontal and attached to both converging A-frame beams, near but not at its apex. The lower one sloped upwards and {{was attached to the}} rear sloping part of the A-frame just below the <b>cross-member.</b> [...] These two rear fuselage beams were cross braced with three more struts, one vertical about halfway to the tail, forming two bays which were crossed diagonally by the other two struts. [...] There was another, short vertical strut in the rear bay between the upper and diagonal members. [...] For landings a skid ran between three projecting ends of the forward and lower A-frame.|$|E
50|$|Clemons' later four {{cylinder}} chassis included deep-sectioned {{side rails}} with a raised section {{over the front}} axle, which carried the oil tank. The rear section was deep-skirted. The front and rear <b>cross-members</b> were tubular with transverse leaf springs and ‘Hartford’ type shock absorbers fitted length wise along the chassis.|$|R
50|$|The Warren truss {{consists}} of longitudinal members joined only by angled <b>cross-members,</b> forming alternately inverted equilateral triangle-shaped spaces along its length. This gives a pure truss: each individual strut, beam, or tie is only subject to tension or compression forces, {{there are no}} bending or torsional forces on them.|$|R
50|$|The frame {{comprised}} lightweight longitudinal {{channel and}} tubular <b>cross-members.</b> It was straight over the axles with a dropped section {{forward of the}} front axle to provide a lower entrance. A drop frame for a luggage boot was optional at the rear. Special steels were used to keep weight down.|$|R
2500|$|In 1976, the Valiant was {{available}} as a Code A38 police package car and offered in three basic engine sizes: E24 (California emission standards) and E25 (Federal) [...] single-barrel Slant-6; E44 , twin-barrel V-8; E58 , four-barrel V-8 with single (California) or dual (Federal) exhaust. It was the E58 that Chrysler recommended for police service {{as it was the}} only one with [...] "added endurance features to improve durability." [...] The E58 produced 175 net hp in California trim and 220 net hp in Federal form. The E58 dual exhaust engine (sans catalytic converters) made for a very fast Valiant squad car. So equipped, this compact Chrysler cop car tripped the quarter-mile lights in 16.4 seconds with trap speeds of [...] and could catch nearly all the so-called [...] "performance cars" [...] of the day. The Seattle Police Department using the Valiant A38 reported a 46 percent drop in the preventable accident rate among police officers, and according to a Motor Trend police survey, the A38 Valiant had much better evasive capabilities, better overall visibility, and was generally easier to drive than the full-size squad cars. A special handling package applied to the A38 Valiant included front and rear antisway bars. Unfortunately, the Valiant wasn't physically durable enough; it lacked additional frame welds and rear <b>cross-member</b> reinforcements standard on all other Mopar A38 packages. More importantly, the front K-frame of the Valiant was prone to failure under severe police use.|$|E

50|$|The car's styling was by Jensen's {{designer}} Eric Neale, and was {{not only}} considered attractive, but was aerodynamically efficient too; a Cd figure of only 0.39 was recorded, which became the lowest figure at Jensen. The body covered a chassis built by bracing 5-inch (12.7 cm) tubes {{with a mixture of}} steel pressings and <b>cross-members</b> to create a platform.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 {{researchers}} replicated the sea sponge's structure using {{ceramics and}} the nanoarchitecture called nanotruss. As of 2015 the largest {{result is a}} 1mm cube. The lattice structure compresses up to 85% of its original thickness and can recover to its original form. These lattices are stabilized into triangles with <b>cross-members</b> for structural integrity and flexibility.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{problem is}} 'impact incompatibility' where the 'hard points' of {{the ends of}} chassis rails of SUVs are higher than the 'hard points' of cars, causing the SUV to 'override' the engine {{compartment}} of the car.

50|$|The pilot {{controlled}} the aircraft {{by means of}} a universally pivoted lever (later to be known as a joystick) to induce roll and/or pitch, and a pivoted footrest which operated the rudder (for yaw). The control lever, when moved forwards or backwards, operated the wires (via vertical <b>cross-members</b> attached to the tailplane spar) to rotate the whole tailplane; when the lever was moved to the left or right, the attached wires warped the wings to induce roll.|$|R
