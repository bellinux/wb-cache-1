50|$|In the 1920s, Enthoven's {{collection}} {{had increased}} {{to such an}} extent that it could no longer remain in her home. In 1924, after more than a decade of campaigning, the Victoria and Albert Museum finally agreed to house her collection, at this time containing more than 80,000 playbills, prints, books and engravings. The collection was named the Gabrielle Enthoven Theatrical Collection. The playbills were housed in the Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design. In 1925, Enthoven and three members of staff arrived at the museum to begin to <b>catalogue,</b> <b>index</b> and arrange the collection. Enthoven received no payment for her work and paid the wages of her staff from her own funds. An appeal for financial aid to contribute to the cataloguing of the collection was launched in the national press, with theatrical personalities such as Sybil Thorndike supporting the campaign. After the Second World War, the government provided Enthoven with two paid assistants, though she herself never received a salary.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—When the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) begins {{operation}} at CERN in 2007 it will produce data in volumes never before seen. Physicists {{around the world}} will manage, distribute and analyse petabytes of this data using the middleware provided by the LHC Computing Grid. One of the critical factors in the smooth running of this system is the performance of the file catalogues which allow users to access their files with a logical filename without knowing their physical location. This paper presents a detailed study comparing the performance and respective merits and shortcomings of two of the main catalogues: the LCG File Catalogue and the gLite FiReMan <b>catalogue.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Catalogue, grid computing, performance.

40|$|The {{problems}} associated with retrieving information are becoming more evident to library professionals and teachers as knowledge continues to grow exponentially. However, children are frequently expected to use library resources independently, yet little is known of the cognitive demands imposed upon them by research tasks, books and library systems. Here 23 Form 1 children shared their thinking processes as they endeavoured to generate questions and find information for topic work. Video recordings of think aloud/concurrent interviews, and subsequent audio recording of retrospective interviews, were used to gain a child's view of the problems involved in such assignments. It {{was found that the}} children's limited knowledge base resulted in formulation of general, frequently vague, questions. These made the choice of search terms compatible with the demands of indexing systems rather difficult. The children understood the Dewey Decimal system in terms of locating a broad subject area but the distinctions made possible by the use of decimal points were understood by only 1 child. The children's theoretical understanding of the Dewey system could not always be put into practise {{because of a lack of}} understanding about the relationship between <b>catalogue</b> <b>index</b> cards and the actual books on the shelves, together with confusions caused by the manner in which books are shelved. Only 3 children showed clear evidence that they knew that the library shelving consisted of adjacent bays rather than shelves which ran continuously around the room. 15 children located books relevant to the topic BIRDS. Most children relied on cover information to determine which books should be examined more closely. 7 of them sought a title which contained the exact word they had chosen as a search term. While only 1 child failed to use the table of contents or indexes in books, the children found relevant information during the interviews to answer only 30 of the 86 questions generated. Completed projects included answers to only 48 % of the questions originally posed by the children together with questions substituted to fit the information found. This appeared to be a function of the questions themselves, the search terms chosen and whether the table of contents or index was examined. Further, several books were found to lack both (or either) contents or indexes and some had no page numbers, thus making information location extremely difficult. The management of a task as complex as information seeking demands knowledge of the information retrieval process itself and a range of appropriate cognitive and metacognitive strategies to allow the searcher to monitor and regulate strategy application in terms of information seeking and the demands of the information resources to hand. Given the barriers to information location inherent in both the books and the library system as viewed by these children, it appears that students need to approach information seeking with a problem-solving orientation. Several levels of assistance are required by Form 1 students engaged in topic work. Blanket assessment of the end product of such assignments ignores much of the learning potential inherent in the task. The implications of these findings for the teaching of information and thinking skills are discussed...|$|E

40|$|An {{integral}} {{component of}} the CAIRNS e-Lib project was an examination of interoperability problems caused in distributed Z 39. 50 union catalogues by variations in <b>cataloguing</b> and <b>indexing</b> practices in participant libraries. After consultation with the <b>Cataloguing</b> and <b>Indexing</b> Group in Scotland (CIGS), CAIRNS identified {{the nature of these}} issues in detail and then proposed short-term and long-term strategies for their amelioration. With the agreement of SCURL, CAIRNS published the 'CAIRNS Project recommendations for a <b>cataloguing</b> and <b>indexing</b> strategy for Scottish libraries' (CAIRNS <b>Cataloguing</b> and <b>Indexing</b> Working Group, 2000). Deliverable B 3 of CC-interop builds on this work, establishing a set of recommendations for developing <b>cataloguing</b> and <b>indexing</b> practices to improve interoperability in distributed and centralised union catalogues. The report indicates a clear consensus among the cataloguing community for the adoption of prescriptive cataloguing guidelines by libraries contributing to union catalogues, helping local cataloguers to actively improve interoperability and raising awareness among senior management of the wider impact of local policy. There is general recognition that a union catalogue itself may become a component of a larger distributed union catalogue, and therefore development of cataloguing guidelines based on CAIRNS, as originally envisaged, would require a significant amount of work. Instead, the report proposes a number of recommendations for a wider, more active and co-ordinated approach to improving interoperability. The CAIRNS guidelines have been updated and references to the specific union catalogue removed, and may be used by other consortia as a basis for local development...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of new technology has an important impact in libraries and especially in art libraries because these institutions manage a great volume of visual information. The new digital tools provide a lot of digital information that must be adquired and preserved in a library.
