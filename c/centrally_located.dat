5|$|The {{orientation}} and placement of many structures within Ambohimanga were copied from Ambohimanga's older twin city, the rova at Antananarivo, which likewise embodies both traditional notions of space. The {{placement of the}} city of Ambohimanga relative to Antananarivo also reflects these systems. <b>Centrally</b> <b>located</b> Antananarivo is the nation's political capital today, and Ambohimanga to its northeast is regarded as the spiritual capital.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. <b>Centrally</b> <b>located</b> males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E

40|$|Operators can be poor {{monitors}} of automation if {{they are}} engaged concurrently in other tasks. However, in previous studies of this phenomenon the automated task was always presented in the periphery, away from the primary manual tasks that were centrally displayed. In this study we examined whether <b>centrally</b> <b>locating</b> an automated task would boost monitoring performance during a flight-simulation task consisting of system monitoring, tracking and fuel resource management sub-tasks. Twelve nonpilot subjects were required to perform the tracking and fuel manage-ment tasks manually while watching the automated system monitoring task for occasional failures. The automation reliability was constant at 87. 5 % for six subjects and variable (alternating between 87. 5 % and 56. 25 %) for the other six subjects. Each subject completed four 30 min sessions {{over a period of}} 2 days. In each automation reliability condition the automation routine was disabled for the last 20 min of the fourth session in order to simulate catastrophic automation failure (0 % reliability). Monitoring for automation failure was inef ficient when automation reliability was constant but not when it varied over time, replicating previous results. Furthermore, {{there was no evidence of}} resource or speed accuracy trade-of f between tasks. Thus, automation-induced failures of monitoring cannot be prevented by <b>centrally</b> <b>locating</b> the automated task. Ö 1997 Academic Press Limited...|$|R

5|$|As the {{historic}} capital of Imerina, Antananarivo is <b>centrally</b> <b>located</b> in the homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 {{percent of the}} population and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture and trade has ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas. Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their tanindrazana (ancestral village), where the extended family and typically a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Western Road {{was built}} along the {{southern}} edge of the castle. This required the demolition of part of the castle wall and the fortified bridge, and the weakening of the foundations caused the subsequent collapse of the south-eastern tower later that year. The town of Launceston declined in importance in the 19th century and from 1823 onwards the county gaol, which had a reputation for filthy and unhealthy conditions, began to be run down in favour of the facility at Bodmin Gaol. In 1838 the county government and the assizes were moved to Bodmin, which was more <b>centrally</b> <b>located</b> in Cornwall, resulting in the closure of the castle's gaol and its final demolition in 1842.|$|E

That same year, Stackpole traveled to Mexico City to see Rivera working on some of his 124 frescoes in the courtyard of the Secretariat of Public Education. Returning with a small Rivera painting, Stackpole gave it to San Francisco Arts Commission president William Gerstle (who was initially unimpressed), and began a several-year effort to bring Rivera to work in California.|$|E

5|$|The {{parents and}} {{families}} of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence.
