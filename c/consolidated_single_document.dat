These requirements had undergone review, and a report on potential amendments was presented by the Committee on Commonwealth Membership at the 2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. New members were not admitted at this meeting, though applications for admission were considered at the 2009 CHOGM.|$|R
50|$|Bringing out a {{district}} plan document giving district wise break-up {{of the annual}} plan {{began in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s. That could be the first event in the lineage of district planning exercise in Kerala. Each department prepared district-wise break up of schemes divisible among districts. That district-wise break-up of schemes has been <b>consolidated</b> into a <b>single</b> <b>document</b> by the Kerala State Planning Board for better monitoring of the State Plan at the district level. There was neither any sort of district planning nor any attempt for integration of sectoral schemes at the district level during the period. Those district plans were mere compilations of departmental or similar programmes into a single volume. They were useful for coordination and monitoring, but do not deserve the status of district plans.|$|R

NERL supports the CAA’s proposal to update and <b>consolidate</b> into a <b>single</b> <b>document</b> its current licence procedures and policies. Single European Sky The CAA is right to acknowledge the impact on NERL’s Licence of developments such as SES 2. NERL believes that this statement should be strengthened, anticipating the need to modify the Licence in the future as SES 2 legislation evolves. In addition, reference could be made within the consultation draft to relevant SES legislation that has an impact on certain aspects of the NERL Licence (e. g. in Condition 10 reportin...|$|R
5000|$|The Constitution of Alberta {{describes}} the fundamental rules {{under which the}} Canadian province of Alberta is governed. As is typical of all Canadian provinces, and Westminster systems more generally, Alberta's is an unwritten constitution. Alberta's constitution, like Britain's (on which it is modeled), includes any and all pieces of legislation, court decisions, proclamations, and conventions which together inform how the province operates. Many statutes are important to understanding the governance of the province, but nowhere are they <b>consolidated</b> into a <b>single</b> <b>document</b> or even a list. The office of Attorney-General at one time suggested 23 acts which might be included, but cautioned {{that this was not}} a [...] "definitive list". [...] However, since Alberta is a part of federation, its powers are clearly delineated in law, via the Constitution of Canada.|$|R
2500|$|The United States, and a {{few other}} common law countries, split the {{corporate}} constitution into two separate documents (the UK got rid of this in 2006). The memorandum of Association (or articles of incorporation) is the primary document, and will generally regulate the company's activities with the outside world. It states which objects the company is meant to follow (e.g. [...] "this company makes automobiles") and specifies the authorised share capital of the company. The articles of association (or by-laws) is the secondary document, and will generally regulate the company's internal affairs and management, such as procedures for board meetings, dividend entitlements etc. In the event of any inconsistency, the memorandum prevails and in the United States only the memorandum is publicised. In civil law jurisdictions, the company's constitution is normally <b>consolidated</b> into a <b>single</b> <b>document,</b> often called the charter.|$|R
40|$|This report {{described}} NIOSH {{efforts to}} lessen the problems of occupational disease among workers. The report <b>consolidated</b> in a <b>single</b> <b>document,</b> descriptions of all NIOSH surveillance activities, along with reprints of publications resulting from those activities for Fiscal Year 1991. The report also serves {{as the first step}} in the systematic assessment of current NIOSH surveillance efforts. Some gaps which have been identified by gathering all this information include the need to comprehensively utilize existing data and collect additional data in order to create truly national surveillance systems. The need for coordination and collaboration among federal and state agencies conducting occupational health surveillance or possessing data useful for such surveillance, and the need for periodic evaluation of surveillance activities were considered. Specific areas of information discussed in this report included occupational lung disease research, research on occupational traumatic injuries, assessment of the effectiveness of OSHA's lead (7439921) standard and surveillance programs for lead exposure, occupational psychological disorder surveillance, surveillance in the construction trades, gaining access to various databases, methods of surveillance, and surveillance related activities.

This paper proposes the technique of document expansion to provide more knowledge to help <b>single</b> <b>document</b> summarization. A specified document is expanded to a small document set by adding a few neighbor documents close to the document, and then the graphranking based algorithm is applied on the expanded document set for extracting sentences from the <b>single</b> <b>document,</b> by making use of both the within-document relationships between sentences of the specified document and the cross-document relationships between sentences of all documents in the document set. The experimental results on the DUC 2002 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on document expansion. The cross-document relationships between sentences in the expanded document set are validated to be very important for <b>single</b> <b>document</b> summarization...|$|R

In some cases, a <b>single</b> <b>document</b> may serve both purposes. In general, a bill of lading serves as a legal instrument focusing on and documenting such issues as ownership, whereas a {{cargo manifest}} is often more concerned with physical aspects of the cargo, such as weight and size. When the cargo is being shipped by several different shipping companies on the same vessel, there will usually be separate bills of lading for each company, but only a <b>single</b> <b>consolidated</b> cargo manifest. On the other hand, if the cargo contains dangerous goods, {{there may be a}} separate dangerous cargo manifest.|$|R
