5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and dreams, {{for a more}} linear one.

5|$|In May 1946, SMERSH agents {{recovered}} from the crater where Hitler was buried two burned skull fragments with gunshot damage.

According to the American researchers, the tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman and {{the examination of the}} sutures where the skull plates <b>come</b> <b>together</b> placed her age at less than 40 years old. The jaw fragments which had been recovered in May 1945 were not tested.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{inhabitants}} of the new French territory did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them.

5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates <b>come</b> <b>together.</b> The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanically}} rigid {{outer layer}} of Earth, the lithosphere, {{is divided into}} pieces called tectonic plates.

Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic plates ride {{on top of the}} asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.|$|E
