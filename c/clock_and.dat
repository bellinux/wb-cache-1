5|$|The <b>clock</b> <b>and</b> {{carillon}} (bell tower) of 23 bells {{was erected}} in 1922, {{the same year}} as Lutyens' memorial, on the corn exchange in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names of those involved in the commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the <b>clock</b> <b>and</b> carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the <b>clock</b> <b>and</b> carillon after the bells were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of the clock tower.|$|E

50|$|Following its {{foundation}} in 1961, the company {{focused on the}} manufacture of navigation cockpit <b>clocks</b> <b>and</b> pilot chronographs and sold these through direct selling, bypassing retailers. The <b>clocks</b> <b>and</b> watches were produced according to pilot Helmut Sinn’s specifications in the private label sector in Switzerland. By eliminating the trade margin of the retailers, the company was able to offer its <b>clocks</b> <b>and</b> watches {{at a lower price}} than through traditional sales channels.|$|R
50|$|The Duties on <b>Clocks</b> <b>and</b> Watches Act 1797 (38 Geo. III, c. 108) was an Act {{passed by}} the Parliament of Great Britain, instituting a tax on <b>clocks</b> <b>and</b> watches. The tax nearly ruined the {{manufacturers}} of <b>clocks</b> <b>and</b> watches as demand decreased considerably so that {{in less than a}} year the production of these had been reduced by a half, with thousands of people made unemployed. The tax was thus repealed within a year, in April 1798.|$|R
5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish <b>clock</b> <b>and</b> {{instrument}} maker, was {{the first}} to invent and patent the electric clock in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} the clock to secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the <b>clock</b> <b>and</b> forcing a Florida State punt. Only {{a minute and a}} half had run off the <b>clock,</b> <b>and</b> Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the <b>clock,</b> <b>and</b> it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E

5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and wind in their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour.

5|$|After {{receiving}} Louisville's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{elected to}} run out the <b>clock</b> <b>and</b> bring the first half to an end. During the process, Marcus Vick ran the ball on a designed play and was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil after Vick gained nine yards. Following the play, Vick paused, then stomped on Dumervil's leg.

5|$|As the freeholders {{shared the}} mineral royalties, the mines brought {{prosperity}} which {{gave rise to}} the remodelling and redevelopment of much of the village. Green Terrace, which includes the old post office, was built in the 1870s, and Main Street was transformed from a back lane into the high street.

5|$|Beginning {{at their}} own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced to use its timeouts to stop the <b>clock</b> <b>and</b> the first half from ending before {{they had a chance}} to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected with wide receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed into the end zone for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 1616.|$|E

This set up a fourth-and-two for the Tigers, who needed to gain a first down to keep their potential game-winning drive going. Instead, Parker was stymied {{in his attempt to}} run for the needed yards, and Clemson turned the ball over on downs.
