40|$|Multi-groups and multi-residues {{test methods}} will be developed, for the {{purposes}} of the official control of pesticides in foodstuffs and vegetables. In particular, our goal is to develop 2 methods for animal derived products, 1 for vegetables and 1 for feeds. Animal derived foods will be selected on the basis of their fat content. The active compounds will be chosen according to the following criteria: - the matching matrix-pesticide indicated by the Regulation 1213 / 2008 /EC - the maximum residue limits (MRL) set by the Regulation 396 / 2005 /EC - the suggestions from the <b>Community</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratories</b> (CRLs) - the pesticides used in agriculture in Italy - the pesticides monitored within the IIZZSS network in the framework of the National Monitoring Plans for drug residues(PNR) and Feeds (PNAA The Regulation 1213 / 2008 /EC states to pay particular attention to the monitoring of organophosphates, carbamates, triazoles and pyretroids. The test methods will be developed according to the suggestions from the CRLs, above all considering recently introduced techniques for both sample treatment (extraction, purification) and determination of pesticides (LC-MS/MS and GCMS/ MS using triple quadrupole detectors). The methods will be: multi-group and multi-residue, able to determinate a lot of compounds exhibiting different chemical and physical properties, applicable to several matrices. During the first step of the project, a practical workshop organised by e CRL will be carried out, to transfer the scientific and technical know how already available. For sample treatment, the potency and relative merits of SPE, ASE, QUECHERS system will be tested for extraction and purification steps. This approach should also allow for reducing analysis time, costs and wastes of solvents. Test methods will be validated according to the SANCO/ 2007 / 3131 guideline from the Commission, integrated with the requirements of the Regulation 882 / 2004 /EC and the Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, with particular reference to the case of feeds. Regarding speciation of mercury and its organic form, test methods will be developed for determination of methyl-mercury in seafood and feeds for aquaculture, based on LC-ICP/MS, LC-FIMS/AAS techniques. The methods will be validated according to the Regulation 882 / 2004 /EC. The ratio total mercury /methyl- mercury in some seafood will be evaluated. A model for risk evaluation, managing and communication will be studied to assess consumer#s exposure due to some seafood...|$|E

40|$|The JRC as <b>Community</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratory</b> (CRL) for the GM Food and Feed (see Regulation EC 1829 / 2003), in {{collaboration}} with the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL), has carried out a collaborative study to assess the performance of a quantitative event-specific method to detect and quantify the H 7 - 1 transformation event in sugarbeet DNA (unique identifier KM-ØØØH 71 - 4). The collaborative trial was conducted according to internationally accepted guidelines. Monsanto provided the method-specific samples (seeds of sugarbeet line H 7 - 1, 100 % event H 7 - 1 and seeds of non-GM conventional sugarbeet line, 0 % event H 7 - 1) whereas the JRC, upon extraction of the respective DNA, prepared the validation samples (calibration samples and blind samples at unknown GM percentage). The trial involved thirteen laboratories from ten European countries. The results of the collaborative trial fully met ENGL's performance requirements and the scientific understanding about satisfactory method performance. Therefore, the JRC as <b>Community</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratory</b> considers the method validated as fit for the purpose of regulatory compliance.

In total, 20 strains of the species Salmonella enterica were selected for serotyping and antibiotic resistance pattern typing, while 10 strains of Salmonella Typhimurium (STM) and 10 strains of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) were selected for phage typing. In general, no problems were encountered with the typing of the O antigens. However, with the typing of the H antigens some laboratories had problems.

Test materials were a deoxynivalenol (DON) solution in acetonitrile and three cereal test materials. Laboratories determined the DON content by either enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA), gas chromatography (GC) or reverse-phase high-performance liquid-chromatography (RP-HPLC). One NRL did not report any results. Applying the Horwitz equation {{as a basis for}} the target standard deviation (19 % in the case of this {{proficiency test}}), 27 out of the remaining 34 laboratories reported values within the z-score limit of 2 after recovery correction of the result for the DON-positive sample.
