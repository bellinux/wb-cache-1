Based on Mayer and Salovey 2 ̆ 7 s (1997) theoretical framework of emotional intelligence, VET was originally developed in Croatian academic settings by Takšić, Harambašić and Velemir (2003). This study involved 1119 secondary school students, 682 Portuguese and 437 Croatian, attending different grades and courses. Overall, in both <b>Croatian</b> (original <b>version)</b> and Portuguese (adapted version) contexts, VET evidenced good psychometric properties particularly concerning sensibility, difficulty item analysis and reliability, although slightly better indicators {{were found in the}} <b>Croatian</b> original <b>version.</b> Moreover, cultural and gender differences were found, benefiting Portuguese students and girls...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} of {{signs and symptoms of}} TMD in PTSD and non-PTSD matched control patients using RDC/TMD protocol. Material and Methods: The study sample consisted of 30 patients with PTSD and 30 patients without PTSD. Data was collected using the <b>Croatian</b> <b>versions</b> of the RDC/TMD protocol. Data were analyzed using PASW Statistics 18. 0. The significance of the differences between groups (PTSD patients and control group) was tested using Chi-Square test, Independent Samples test and Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0. 05. Results: A comparison of the frequency of individual symptoms in both groups revealed significant differences in the following symptoms: pain in face, jaw, temple, in front of the ear or in the ear in the past month; jaw locking or catching; jaw clicking or popping; jaw grinding noise; jaw aching or stiffness in the morning; noises or ringing in the ears; uncomfortable or unusual bite; headaches or migraines during the last six months. Independent Samples test revealed a statistically significant difference between subjects with / without PTSD for the maximum assisted opening (p < 0. 024) and measurement of the opening click on the left side (p < 0. 014). Only in the posterior attachment on the left side (inside the ear), statistically significant difference in pain between patients with PTSD and without PTSD was detected (p < 0. 008). Conclusion: There are significant differences between PTSD patients and control group in terms of RDC/TMD protocol...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the high}} {{variability}} in any bilingual population, it {{is of a great}} importance to control for language dominance in both research and language assessment. This control is crucial in research in order to form unified groups of participants according to language dominance. In the language assessment of bilingual children, determining language dominance should be a priority. Children exposed to two languages from an early age may acquire them at a slower rate when compared to their monolingual piers. While this lag is hardly noticeable in some children, for others it is significant. Without knowledge about the child’s language skills in the other, non-assessed language, it is impossible to determine if the results of language assessment point to the dominance of one language over another or general language difficulties. In bilingual areas of Croatia, such as Rijeka and Istria, this can be quite a challenge. While language dominance has generally been measured using a large number of different methods, there is no universally accepted procedure. This research uses the results of the Italian and <b>Croatian</b> <b>versions</b> of the TROG test to determine language dominance. Participants were 56 preschool-aged children attending kindergartens with an Italian language programme in Rijeka and Istria. Participants were preselected by their kindergarten teachers as children that might be balanced bilinguals. Using the differences in results between both TROG tests, approximately 70 % of children were placed in a balanced bilinguals group. No differences were shown between groups of participants from Rijeka and Istria...|$|R
