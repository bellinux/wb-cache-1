Some media outlets, unable to afford the cost of additional security, have even abandoned their bureaus in Baghdad. This trend has forced journalists to depend even more heavily on U.S. military sources, which has led some critics to <b>call</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> impartiality of their reports on events such as the Iraqi elections.|$|E

However, both Theodoricus monachus and the Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum report that when Gunnhild was at the court of Harald Bluetooth after Erik's death, the Danish king offered marriage to her; if valid, these accounts <b>call</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> identification of Gunnhild as Harald's sister, but their most recent editors follow Jones in viewing their accounts of Gunnhild's origins as unreliable.|$|E
25|$|Under English law {{effective}} {{during the}} {{ratification of the}} U.S. Constitution, including the Treason Act 1351, there were essentially five species of treason. Of the five, the Constitution adopted only two: levying war and adhering to enemies. Omitted were species of treason involving encompassing (or imagining) {{the death of the}} king, certain types of counterfeiting, and finally fornication with women in the royal family of the sort which could <b>call</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> parentage of royal successors. James Wilson wrote the original draft of this section, and he was involved as a defense attorney for some accused of treason against the Patriot cause.|$|E
25|$|Further, the Court of Appeal {{rejected}} two arguments {{raised by}} the Prosecution circumscribing the scope of fair criticism. In the first place, the Court found that fair criticism should {{not be limited to}} criticism that does not question the independence, impartiality and integrity of courts. This would overly restrict the scope of fair criticism and render the concept redundant, given that most allegedly contemptuous statements, by their nature, <b>call</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> independence, impartiality and integrity of the courts. Furthermore, Commonwealth courts have previously held that imputation of judicial impropriety is not ipso facto scandalizing contempt.|$|E

25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that some modern historians <b>call</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> {{identification}} of the Erik who ruled over Jorvik with Erik Bloodaxe. None of the English sources for Erik's reign in Northumbria identify him as Norwegian or as the son of Harald Fairhair. A thirteenth-century letter from Edward I to Pope Boniface VIII identifies Erik as Scottish in origin. Lappenberg, Plummer and Todd, writing in the late nineteenth century, identified Erik as a son of Harald Bluetooth, a claim Downham discounts as untenable. Downham, however, regards Erik the king of Jorvik as a distinct individual from Erik Bloodaxe, and thus views Gunnhild's sojourn in Orkney and Jorvik as the construct of later saga-writers who conflated different characters between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries.|$|E
25|$|A renewed {{interest}} on the site's importance in the 1980s was sparked by the visit to the site by the late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1970. This led {{to the protection of}} the complex's remains as a national monument in 1987, through the national heritage legislation. A landscape project over a part of the site and a series of restoration works were initiated in the 1990s. The lack of a formal conservation plan or a methodical archaeological approach have <b>call</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> site's historic authenticity. 2001 was a landmark year for the site. The Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund was established to manage the site directly. Its responsibilities include overseeing the excavations and implementing corrective actions on restorations that were haphazardly done since the 1990s. Among the previous preservation works that are being reversed are the landscape project, the hospital building's roof installation, which unfortunately used modern materials, the use of native lime mortar technique in the reconstruction and maintenance of the remaining stone walls, and devising an archaeological strategy to document finds and discoveries, as well as to safeguard the existing artifacts. The objective of the conservation efforts is for the site to regain its appearance in the 1860s. The site's name was officially changed to Aapravasi Ghat that same year. The name change was not without controversy. Although it was meant to reflect the Hindu Indian majority of indentured laborers, the use of the Hindi translation swept away the myriad of other ethnic and religious populations that also passed through the Immigration Depot.|$|E
500|$|Linois {{continued}} his raiding, achieving some success against individual sailing ships, but failing to press successfully his numerical superiority against British naval forces; most notably at the Battle of Vizagapatam on 15 September 1804 and the Action of 6 August 1805. Ironically, Linois was eventually captured at the Action of 13 March 1806 after mistaking {{a squadron of}} British ships of the line for a merchant convoy in the mid-Atlantic. Linois was concerned throughout the engagement {{for the safety of}} his ships: with the nearest dockyard over [...] away at Île de France, he could not afford to suffer severe damage to his rigging or masts that would leave his squadron crippled. He also sought to defend his behaviour off Pulo Aura with the claim that the British convoy was protected by as many as eight ships of the line, and that he had performed heroically in saving his squadron from this overwhelming force. Subsequent historians have ridiculed this latter statement: William James wryly commented in his account of the action, written in 1827, that [...] "it would be uncharitable to <b>call</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> <b>the</b> courage of Rear-admiral Linois" [...] and William Laird Clowes stated in 1900 that [...] "his timidity and want of enterprise threw away a great opportunity". Nicholas Rodger, writing in 2004, was even more critical, insisting that [...] "his [...] officers do not seem to have been fooled, and it is extremely difficult to believe that he was." [...] He goes on to suggest that no experienced seaman could possibly have mistaken a poorly manned and poorly trained merchant crew for the crew of a real Royal Navy ship of the line, concluding that [...] "Linois had thrown away a prize worth at least £8 million through mere timidity". The most scathing criticism of Linois's conduct came from Napoleon himself, who wrote to Minister of Marine Denis Decrès on the subject, stating: ...|$|E
