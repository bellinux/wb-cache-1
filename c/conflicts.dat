40|$|In this {{longitudinal}} study, we {{contribute to}} the contingency models of intragroup <b>conflict</b> by examining the moderating role of coping strategies {{in the evolution of}} <b>conflict</b> over time. We conceptualize coping strategy as a configural group property and focus on whether task <b>conflict</b> evolves into relationship <b>conflict</b> (<b>conflict</b> transformation) and on whether relationship <b>conflict</b> perpetuates over time (<b>conflict</b> escalation). We use a multilevel model to test the way in which individual <b>conflict</b> perceptions interact with other members’ coping strategies to influence the level of intragroup <b>conflict</b> at later stages. The results indicate that (a) the interaction between task <b>conflict</b> and problem-focused coping decreases the chances that task <b>conflict</b> transforms into relationships <b>conflict</b> and (b) the interaction between relationship <b>conflict</b> and emotion-focused coping decreases and the interaction between relationship <b>conflict</b> and problem-focused coping increases the chances that relationship <b>conflict</b> escalates over time.

Results of a field survey of 96 business school project groups showed task <b>conflict</b> inhibited performance when groups used avoidance tactics; however, these effects were negated when avoidance tactics were not used. Similarly, relationship <b>conflict</b> was only harmful to performance when avoided. When the use of avoidance was low, relationship <b>conflict</b> improved performance. Collaboration mitigated the harmful effects of task <b>conflict</b> and compromising mitigated those of relationship <b>conflict</b> on group satisfaction.

The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E

The <b>Conflict</b> Cultures Survey was sent to all tenured and tenure-track faculty member at a large Midwestern university. Results supported a two-factor model of <b>conflict</b> cultures such that <b>conflict</b> cultures vary according to two dimensions: agreeableness and activeness. Intradepartmental agreement and intraclass correlations suggest that there do exist cohesive <b>conflict</b> cultures in some departments. Perceived <b>conflict</b> cultures predicted individual outcomes such that collaborative <b>conflict</b> cultures were associated with higher job satisfaction and organizational identification with the department, and with lower intent to leave. The department-level variable of <b>conflict</b> cultures are interpreted by faculty member which influences their individual level outcomes.
