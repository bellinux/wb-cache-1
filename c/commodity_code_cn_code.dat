In the empirical research the eight-digit <b>commodity</b> <b>codes</b> <b>CN</b> 8 were used as well as HS 2 codes that allow grouping imported commodities covered by anti-dumping proceedings by their manufacturing divisions. In that way a determined classification of commodities was used to describe a comparative advantage. To conduct assessment the modified Ballasa index (Bi) and Grupp/Legler index were used. The result of conducted analysis is determination of groups of commodities that are crucial for export of a given country...|$|R

30|$|To {{calculate}} {{the concentration of}} Spanish exports, we have used the export transactions database, which is elaborated by the Customs and Excise Department of the Spanish Tax Agency. For each transaction, we know the firm’s identification code, the product according to the 8 -digit Combined Nomenclature (CN) classification 2, the destination of the export transaction, the free-on-board (FOB) value in euros of the transaction, and the exported quantity (in weight metric and/or units). 3 Every year, new <b>CN</b> 8 <b>codes</b> {{are added to the}} classification and some <b>CN</b> <b>codes</b> are dropped. Since some sections of the paper compare data for different years, we use the Van Beveren et al. (2012) algorithm to create a consistent product classification over the period of analysis. 4 Using this database, we first analyze, how export concentration varies by the number of top firms. Second, we study whether concentration also occurs in export flows, where a flow is defined as a particular 8 -digit product shipped to a particular destination. Finally, we analyze how sensitive concentration is to different product classifications.|$|R

Using the <b>commodity</b> <b>codes</b> of trade data analyses for the European copper model as a connection point, we discuss a concept which links the material flow model to multisectoral economic models based on input output tables.

Methodology/methodsThe methods of induction, deduction, analysis, synthesis, statistical observation and grouping have been used in the research process. The aim of the scientific work is to determine the principles for improving the statistical registration of commodity at the customs in Georgia. ResultsCountries of origin are not yet completely reflected in the cargo-customs declaration at the Georgian customs; the field ``means of transport at the border'' in the cargo-customs declaration is not filled in; data on estimated market value of the means of transport in the databases of Service Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is not complete; detailed coding of imported vehicles is carried out incorrectly; the simplified customs declarations are not completely filled in with reference to countries, 11 -digit item coding and value. In terms of registration, certain problems are caused by the fact that a sender and a country of final destination are not always filled out in the declaration. Problems exist in producing foreign trade price indices, the issue being that he information on foreign trade statistics is classified according to the Harmonized <b>Commodity</b> Description and <b>Coding</b> System while price indices are calculated according to the classification of types of economic activity on the 4 -digit level; in filling in declarations there are frequent errors related to registration of <b>commodity</b> <b>code,</b> weight and additional units of measurement.

Data National retail price data. The retail price data were compiled and published by Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Community, {{in cooperation with the}} national statistical agencies of the countries that participated. While all of the price data we utilize is published we are unaware of available electronic copies. All prices refer to cash prices paid by final consumers, including taxes, both VAT and any others paid by the purchaser. Sales points are selected is {{such a way that the}} sample selected is representative of the distribution in the capital city. Prices are collected at different locations so that the average price is representative of the distribution within the city. These data were not available electronically so we had a private firm key-punch the <b>commodity</b> <b>codes,</b> <b>commodity</b> descriptions and prices into an electronic format. Data Reconciliation. In order to explain the price dispersion across goods that exists in our data we constructed measures of tradeability and the costs of non– traded inputs into production. The constructed variables for tradeability, and non– traded inputs from input-output tables are available at different levels of detail. For this reason, and in order to make the most of the information available for each of these factors, we matched the retail price data with each of the variables using two-digit, three-digit, and four-digit classifications depending on the level of detail available for each of the variables rather than attempting to match all variables using the same level of detail. The input-output data are also available at a three-digit level of detail that extends to four-digits for some industry groups. In order to reconcile the data as accurately as possible, we used the ISIC codes and descriptions available in the User Guide of the OECD International Sectoral Database. A description of each of our variables is as follows. • Tradeability. We obtained data on imports, exports, and gross output fo...|$|R
