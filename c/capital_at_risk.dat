50|$|The Swindells and to {{a lesser}} extent the Gregs {{dominated}} the mid century textile industry in Bollington. Martins Swindells father, Francis (1763-1823) ran away from his Disley Home in 1779, and became successful in London. He returned to Stockport where he and his brother became cotton manufacturers. Martin (1763-1823) ran many of the Bollington Mills, and moved to Pott Hall, Pott Shrigley to be closer to the business in 1830. He was a proprietor of the Macclesfield Canal which opened in 1831 and built Clarence Mill alongside it in 1834. He was totally dependent on the canal to move in his raw cotton and coal, and to take away his finished cloth. From the start, Clarence Mill was a combined mill doing the spinning, weaving and finishing. His daughter, Annie married Joseph Brookes. On his death his son Martin (1814-1880) succeeded him and formed a partnership with Joseph Brookes and they just ran Clarence Mill- though later Martin and his brother George built the Adelphi Mill. These mills were privately financed. The Swindells did not build tied cottages for their workers- but were generous benefactors of the local Methodist church. Joint stock companies that limited the <b>capital</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> appeared in East Cheshire around 1866, when Samuel Greg and Company was formed. Brookes Swindells and Company Ltd was formed in 1876 and this enabled the financing of the 1877 expansion. 12000 ₤10 shares were floated- but the company was not successful- and this was blamed on the fact the managers did not have the same incentive to succeed. While the Lancashire Cotton industry prospered until 1926, 1877 was the turning point in Bollington. The mill was now taken over by George Swindells and Co, and became part of the Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association Ltd that had been pioneered by Horrocks of Preston in 1887. Swindells specialised to survive and like Thomas Oliver and Son concentrated on spinning extremely fine cotton counts for lace and muslins, and in 1940 was spinning 'Sylex' a cotton yarn so fine it was comparable to silk. The Cotton Spinning Industry Act (1936) encouraged the Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association to diversify and Clarence Mill started to spin silk, and the Adelphi went over to silk completely having 25000 silk twisting spindles. At Quarry Bank Mill, the Gregs abandoned spinning in 1894, and installed 465 looms and 109 Northrops, Quarry Bank Mill continues today as a Textile Museum. The textile industry finished in Cheshire in the mid 1970s, Clarence Mill and Adelphi Mill have survived: today they are offices and Clarence Mill houses the Bollington Civic Trust Heritage Centre.|$|E

The economic capital is the amount of money which is needed to secure the survival in a worst-case scenario, it is a buffer against unexpected shocks in market values. Economic capital is a function of market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, and is often calculated by VaR.
