5|$|Diefenbaker {{continued}} practising law. In 1951, {{he gained}} national attention by accepting the Atherton <b>case,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> young telegraph operator {{had been accused}} of negligently causing a train crash by omitting crucial information from a message. Twenty-one people were killed, mostly Canadian troops bound for Korea. Diefenbaker paid $1,500 and sat a token bar examination to join the Law Society of British Columbia to take the case, and gained an acquittal, prejudicing the jury against the Crown prosecutor and pointing out a previous case in which interference had caused information to be lost in transmission.|$|E
5|$|In {{all of its}} history, {{the only}} <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> Guyanese athlete has medaled at the Olympics was when Michael Anthony won a bronze medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union. The size of Guyana's {{delegation}} peaked at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles when it sent ten athletes, but (as of Beijing) had never risen past seven athletes other than in the 1980s. In Beijing, swimmer Niall Roberts bore Guyana's flag at the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|When {{confronted with}} {{inaccuracies}} or inconsistencies, {{those who are}} suspected of perpetrating fabrications may compound the deceit by accusing forum members of imposing greater stresses upon them, exacerbating their conditions, or worsening their depression. Users may employ sockpuppets—separate online identities controlled by the same person—to accuse other forum members of disloyalty and persecution, or support the user who is under suspicion. Feldman's 1998 article in the Western Journal of Medicine notes a <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> member of {{a support group for}} people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome created a husband, sister-in-law, and family friend who simultaneously engaged in arguments with and about the original member; when the amount of attention directed toward the original member became inadequate, she claimed the sister-in-law committed suicide in response to the lack of support.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{three kinds of}} {{unethical}} and unconstitutional practices and policies of prosecutors’ offices: (1) <b>Cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> prosecutor, <b>in</b> {{the heat of a}} trial, unintentionally acts unethically or unconstitutionally, and the prosecutor’s office then makes that conduct official policy by adopting and seeking to justify the conduct on appeal; (2) <b>Cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> “rogue” prosecutor purposefully engages in unethical and/or unconstitutional tactics, like concealing Brady material, and the prosecutor’s office seeks to justify the conduct on appeal; (3) <b>Cases</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> chief prosecutor adopts unethical and/or unconstitutional practices as office policy. In addition, a related issue is discussed – the general failure of disciplinary authorities and courts to take disciplinary or other remedial measures against prosecutors who violate both the rights of criminal defendants and the prosecutors’ own ethical obligations...|$|R
25|$|Although Kant never {{explicitly}} states {{what the}} first proposition is, {{it is clear that}} its content is suggested by the following common-sense observation. Common sense distinguishes among: (a) the <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> person clearly acts contrary to duty; (b) the <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> person’s actions coincide with duty, but are not motivated by duty; and (c) the <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> person's actions coincide with duty because she is motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper (4:397) who chooses not to overcharge an inexperienced customer in order to preserve his business’s reputation. Because it is not motivated by duty, the shopkeeper's action has no moral worth. Kant contrasts the shopkeeper with the case of a person who, faced with “adversity and hopeless grief” (4:398) obeys his duty to preserve his life. Because this person acts from duty, his actions have moral worth. Kant thinks our actions only have moral worth and deserve esteem when they are motivated by duty.|$|E
25|$|On 12 December 2001, after a four-week trial before Mr Justice Curtis and a jury, Whiting {{was convicted}} of the {{abduction}} and murder of Payne and {{he was sentenced to}} life imprisonment.

25|$|In 1994, the John and Lorena Bobbitt <b>case,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> wife cut off {{the penis}} of her {{sleeping}} husband, seized the attention of media in the Philippines, which reported that a similar incident had occurred in Cebu the previous November. The Bobbitt case was reported {{at a time when}} Filipino feminist groups were protesting against prostitution, the practice of mail-order brides, and marital rape. In 2008, a similar case in Pasig City was reported.|$|E
25|$|Self-defense {{when using}} a {{reasonable}} and proportionate {{degree of violence}} {{in response to the}} abuse might appear the most appropriate defense but, until recently, it almost never succeeded. Research in 1996 in England found no <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> battered woman successfully pleaded self-defense (see Noonan at p198). After analysing 239 appellate decisions on trials of women who killed in self-defense in the U.S., Maguigan (1991) argues that self-defence is gender biased.|$|E

25|$|The Kansas Supreme Court's most {{important}} duty is being {{the state court}} of last resort and the highest judicial authority {{in the state of}} Kansas. The Court rarely conducts a trial.

25|$|The United States Department of State website states that,...in {{cases of}} {{international}} parental child abduction, foreign parents are greatly disadvantaged in Japanese courts, {{both in terms}} of obtaining the return of children to the United States, and in achieving any kind of enforceable visitation rights in Japan.

25|$|In 1915 Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, {{speaking}} for the Court, again decided in favor of Loewe, upholding a lower federal court ruling ordering the union to pay damages of $252,130.

This was not a typical <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> few union leaders were punished with short terms in jail; specifically, the life savings of several hundreds of the members were attached.
