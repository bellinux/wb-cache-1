40|$|How far can shoe-leather go in {{explaining}} the welfare cost of inflation? Using {{a unique set of}} microeconomic data on households, we estimate the parameters of the demand for money derived from a generalized Baumol-Tobin model. Our data set contains information on average holdings of <b>cash,</b> <b>on</b> <b>deposits</b> and other interest bearing accounts, on the number of trips to the bank, on the size of withdrawals and on the ownership and use of ATM cards. We model the adoption of new transaction technologies and use these estimates to correct for the selectivity bias induced by some households choosing to hold no interest bearing assets and some to use an ATM card. The interest rate and expenditure flow elasticities of the demand for cash are close to the theoretical values implied by standard inventory models. However, we find significant differences between the individuals with an ATM card and those without. The estimates of the demand for cash allow us to calculate a measure of the welfare cost of inflation analogous to Bailey's triangle, but based on a rigorous microeconometric framework. The welfare cost of inflation varies considerably within the population, but never turns out to be very large (about 0. 1 percent of consumption or less). Our results are robust to various changes in the specification. In addition to the main results based on the average stock of cash held, we provide some evidence {{based on the number of}} trips to the bank and on the average withdrawals that confirm our basic findings. demand for money, financial innovation, welfare cost of inflation...|$|R

50|$|Instead, Abra uses Bitcoin and its {{blockchain}} technology to store and encrypt <b>cash</b> <b>deposits</b> <b>on</b> the mobile device. Using Abra {{does not require}} the average user to possess any knowledge of Bitcoin or how it works. The Abra model is entirely non-custodial, meaning neither Abra nor Abra Tellers ever take custody of anyone's funds other than their own. In other words, everyone in the Abra system always holds their own money. A deposit and withdrawal are a purchase or sale, respectively, of digital cash via a peer to peer swap of paper cash in exchange for digital cash. In March of 2017, Abra added the ability to purchase Bitcoin currency directly from its wallet. However, it has also been reported that some consumers were displeased that Abra does not inform users that a verification process will be required after funds have been deposited with Abra.|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a survey on Cambodian financial institutions and collected financial data at bank- and branch-level, in order to reveal the actual situation of dollarization in Cambodian financial institutions. We {{found that there were}} differences in shares of FX currency deposit and loans between commercial banks (CBs) and microfinance institutions (MFIs). MFIs are likely to have more local currency in their <b>cash</b> <b>on</b> hand, loans, <b>deposits,</b> and borrowings, while CBs rely mostly on FX currency in intermediation. Furthermore, although it is subtle, it can be observed that the share of local currency in deposits has increased over the period of 2009 - 2013 in the cases both of CBs and MFIs. It might suggest that there is the potential that local currency deposits can be facilitated. However, commercial banks did not allocate KHR funds, although they had large excess KHR funds in Phnom Penh. Moreover, FX currency shares in MFIs' loans have been increasing despite the increase of KHR currency in their deposits. Finally, we found that there were regional differences in dollarization of deposits and loans.
