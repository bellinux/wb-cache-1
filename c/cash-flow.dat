So the Company was having to transfer its assets in another, more complicated and expensive way.

It was not grown in India until the 1840s).|$|E

40|$|We {{study how}} {{securities}} and trading mechanisms {{can be designed}} to mitigate the adverse impact of market imperfections on liquidity. Following De Marzo and Duffie (1999), we consider asset owners who seek to obtain liquidity by selling their claims on future <b>cash-flows,</b> on which they have private information. We allow for strategic liquidity supply and take a mechanism design approach to characterize both the optimal security and the optimal trading mechanism. For a given arbitrary security, issuers with <b>cash-flows</b> below a threshold entirely sell their holdings of the securities, while issuers with larger <b>cash-flows</b> are excluded from trading. The optimal security design entirely avoids this partial market breakdown phenomenon. We find that the optimal security is debt.

Furthermore, by pooling all issuers with high <b>cash-flows,</b> it reduces the ability of strategic liquidity suppliers to exclude them from trade to better extract rents from agents with lower <b>cash-flows.</b> We also show that competition in non-exclusive schedules between finitely many oligopolistic liquidity suppliers implements the competitive trading mechanism. adverse selection; liquidity; mechanism design; security design...|$|R

From its first productions in early 1920 through late 1928, when it was dissolved in a merger, the company produced approximately 400 films under the brand of either Robertson-Cole Pictures or FBO Pictures. Between 1924 and 1926, several higher-end productions were made under the rubric of Gothic Pictures. The studio's top-of-the-line movies, aimed at major exhibition venues beyond the reach of most FBO films, were sometimes marketed as FBO [...] "Gold Bond" [...] pictures.

With the system now largely complete, Baer and Harrison were unsure who to approach to sell it until a Sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers. Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm; only RCA was willing to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached. Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for Magnavox and convinced them to look at the console again. The three creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969; they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Marketing Gerry Martin was in favor and Magnavox agreed to produce the console. After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971.|$|E
