At nitrogen concentrations as low as 0. 001 gN L- 1, the BTF presented removal efficiencies higher than 70 % for an inlet load of 110 g m- 3 h- 1. A nitrogen concentration of 0. 005 gN L- 1 was used to study the effect of EBRT and the <b>continuous</b> <b>recirculation</b> of nutrient solution.

40|$|The <b>continuous</b> <b>recirculation</b> of naïve T {{cells and}} their {{subsequent}} migration to tissue following activation {{is crucial for}} maintaining protective immunity against invading pathogens. The preferential targeting of effector and memory T cells to tissue is instructed during priming and mediated by cell surface expressed adhesion receptors such as integrins. Integrins are involved in nearly all aspects of T cell life, including naive T cell circulation, activation, and finally effector T cell trafficking and localization. Recent research has revealed that microenvironmental factors present during T cell priming result in the specific regulation of adhesion/integrin and chemokine receptor expression. Once antigen-experienced T cells enter tissue, further changes in integrin expression may occur that is critical for T cell localization, retention, effector function, and survival. This review will discuss the function of integrin expression on T cells and the multiple roles integrins play on naïve T cells and in directing effector T cell trafficking to non-lymphoid sites {{in order to maintain}} protective adaptive immunity at body barriers...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{procedure for}} the regeneration of iron oxy-hydroxide arsenic adsorbents by granulated MgO is proposed in this study. A <b>continuous</b> <b>recirculation</b> configuration, with a NaOH solution flowing sequentially through the saturated adsorbent (leaching step) and the MgO (adsorption step) column beds, was optimized by utilizing the high arsenic adsorption efficiency of MgO at strong alkaline environments. Experimental {{results indicated that}} the total amount of leached arsenic was captured by MgO whereas the regenerated iron oxy-hydroxide recovered around 80 % of its removal capacity upon reuse. The improved adsorption capacity of MgO for As(V), which is maximized at pH 10, is explained by the intermediate hydration to Mg(OH) (2) and the following As(V) oxy-anions adsorption on its surface through the formation of monodentate inner sphere complexes, as it is deduced from the As K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. In addition to the economical-benefits, corresponding tests proved that the solid wastes of this process, namely spent MgO/Mg(OH) (2), can be environmentally safely disposed as stable additives in cement products, while the alkaline solution is completely detoxified and can be recycled to the regeneration task.

40|$|The {{immune system}} {{consists}} of a complex collection of leukocytes and dendritic cells that surveys most tissues in the body for the appearance of foreign antigens. For an efficient immune response, the interaction and co-localization of antigen-presenting cells, costimulatory helper cells and effector cells are crucial parameters. Therefore, the migration routes of antigen-presenting cells and potential antigen-specific lymphocytes merge in secondary lymphoid organs {{in order to increase}} the likelihood and speed of a lymphocyte finding its cognate antigen. Additionally, antigen-primed effector cells are directed to the tissue where they are most likely to encounter their cognate antigen. This highly organized and efficient antigen encounter is based on a <b>continuous</b> <b>recirculation</b> of antigen-specific lymphocytes between blood, peripheral tissue, and secondary lymphoid organs.

Precipitation of phosphates from nanofiltration concentrate was induced by locally increasing the pH at the cathode surface by water electrolysis and thereby creating supersaturated conditions at the cathode. 70 – 95 % recovery of total phosphate was achieved at a pH of 8 – 10 near the cathode. Ion analysis, XRD and ATR-FTIR spectra indicated that the precipitate consisted of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and minor proportions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC).

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of the diffusion coefficient of a solute in a solid matrix (polymers, gels, adsorbents) is often determined based on batch kinetics experiments performed when a given amount of matrix is put into a stirred cell containing a defined volume of diluting fluid (gas or liquid). There is, however, a strong trend to develop smaller and smaller volume set-ups (due to, for instance, the cost of either the solute or the matrix in biological or pharmaceutical fields). Furthermore, a continuous monitoring of the solute concentration in the release (or exhaustion) medium is obviously attractive and frequently applied, {{in place of a}} sequential manual sampling protocol. This option demands, however, most often a <b>continuous</b> <b>recirculation</b> loop to be implemented on the cell volume, so that a continuous detector (such as spectrophotometric, conductimetric or refractive index) can be used.

Numerical simulations covering a broad range of situations have been performed, and an experimental validation on a system consisting of alginate hydrogel beads as a model matrix and pullulan molecules (molecular weight ranging between 730 and 880 000) as model solute is reported.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Liquid-xenon based {{particle}} detectors {{have been}} dramatically growing in size {{during the last}} years, and are now exceeding the one-ton scale. The required high xenon purity is usu-ally achieved by <b>continuous</b> <b>recirculation</b> of xenon gas through a high-temperature getter. This challenges the traditional way of cooling these large detectors, since in a thermally well insulated detector, most of the cooling power is spent to compensate losses from recirculation. The phase change during recondensing requires five times more cooling power than cooling the gas from am-bient temperature to- 100 oC (173 K). Thus, to reduce the cooling power requirements for large detectors, we propose to use {{the heat from the}} purified incoming gas to evaporate the outgoing xenon gas, by means of a heat exchanger. Generally, a heat exchanger would appear to be only of very limited use, since evaporation and liquefaction occur at zero temperature difference. However, the use of a recirculation pump reduces the pressure of the extracted liquid, forces it to evaporate, and thus cools it down. We show that this temperature difference can be used for an efficient heat exchange process. We investigate the use of a commercial parallel plate heat exchanger with a small liquid xenon detector. Although we expected to be limited by the available cooling power to flow rates of about 2 SLPM, rates in excess of 12 SLPM can easily be sustained, limited only by the pump speed and the impedance of the flow loop. The heat exchanger operates with an effi-ciency of (96. 8 ± 0. 5) %. This opens the possibility for fast xenon gas recirculation in large-scale experiments, while minimizing thermal losses...|$|R

The interaction of endothelial cells with blood-borne constituents and the mechanical forces due to blood flow regulate {{a broad range of}} diseases that originate at the vasculature. The challenges of studying endothelial cell biology in vivo is that it is highly invasive to access, experimentally manipulate, and/or observe changes inside of blood vessels. Furthermore, current in vitro-based systems do not faithfully recreate the mechanical and chemical cellular environments with the proper length scales seen in physiology. Here we show examples of using the tools of microfluidics and microfabrication in developing perfusion-based in vitro systems that mimic the in vivo environments of endothelial cells.

The OLR applied to each bioreactor was increased stepwise from 4 to 12 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m(- 3) d(- 1) by increasing feed flow rate. The methane yields decreased with increasing OLR in both bioreactors. The methane yield for the bioreactor with the lower recirculation flow rate ranged between 0. 10 and 0. 14 m(3) CH 4 kg COD- 1 removed, while for the other bioreactor it was 0. 14 - 0. 20 m(3) CH 4 kg COD- 1 removed.

Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the mystery surrounding the identity of the antigen recognized by the prototype blood vascular marker PAL-E.

The expression of mVAP- 1 is induced on inflammation in the vessels of the endocrine pancreas during the development of insulitis, and the up-regulation correlates with the extent of the lymphocytic infiltrate. In general, different mouse strains displayed very similar VAP- 1 expression, but the small differences seen in liver and gut suggest that immunostimulation may modulate VAP- 1 synthesis in extrapancreatic organs as well. Finally, we show that mVAP- 1 has a monoamine oxidase activity against naturally occurring substrates, implying a role in the development of vasculopathies. These data show that mVAP- 1 and hVAP- 1 are very similar molecules that nevertheless have certain marked differences in expression, biochemical structure, and substrate specificity.

Theoretical considerations {{on the effect of}} operative parameters on the performances of the process were conﬁrmed by electrocarboxylation experiments performed in undivided cells equipped with sacriﬁcial anodes both in a bench-scale electrochemical batch reactor and in a <b>continuous</b> batch <b>recirculation</b> reaction system equipped with a parallel plate electrochemical cell.

40|$|Activation of naive T and B cells occurs {{only within}} the context of {{organized}} lymphoid tissue. Thus, the <b>continuous</b> <b>recirculation</b> of mature lymphocytes is crucial for the development of primary immune response to foreign Ags. We have previously shown that low levels of IFN- � inhibit homing of B cells to the secondary lymphoid organs. In this study, we demonstrate that similarly low doses of IFN- � down-regulate integrin-mediated adhesion and migration of naive T and Th 2 cells, and {{have a profound effect on}} the in vivo homing of naive T cells to the lymph nodes. Moreover, we show that these low doses of IFN-� have anti-inflammatory effects in an in vivo asthma model. Thus, in contrast to the proinflammatory effects of IFN- � at relatively high concentrations, low dose IFN- � appears to exert global suppressory effects on T cell trafficking and may have clinical application as an anti-inflammatory agent. The Journal of Immunology, 2002, 168 : 3707 – 3711. The surveillance of the body for foreign Ags is a critical function of the immune system. Lymphocytes migrate from the blood into tissues and secondary lymphoid organs, and return to the blood via lymph vessels and the thoracic duct (1). The majority of lymphocytes are capable of tissue selective trafficking (homing), recognizing organ-specific adhesion molecules on specialized endothelial cells (2). Leukocytes are specifically recruited by a combination of molecular events: bloodborne cells use primary adhesion molecules to tether to, and roll on the luminal wall of postcapillary venules, and thereby encounter and rapidly transduce signals to up-regulate secondary adhesion molecules, which then mediate firm arrest (3, 4). Naive T lymphocytes traffic through the T cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs in search of Ag presented by dendritic cell...|$|R
40|$|The study {{reports the}} use of three {{biomarkers}} i. e. total arsenic in hair and nails, total arsenic in blood, and total arsenic in urine to identify or quantify arsenic exposure and concomitant health effects. The main source of arsenic was inorganic exposure through drinking water. The arsenic levels and the health effects were analyzed closely in a family having maximum symptoms of arsenic. Based on {{the result of this}} study it is reported that there exist a correlation between the clinically observable symptoms, the blood and urine arsenic level, and the arsenic intake through drinking water. An intensive study on the urinary arsenic levels was carried out in which the urine levels of arsenic and the urine sufficiency tests were performed. A composite picture of body burden of arsenic has been obtained by carrying out a complete biochemical analysis of a maximum affected family. This confirms pronounced chronic exposure of the arsenic to these people. A combined correlation study on the arsenic levels measured in whole blood, urine, hair, nails and age present a remarkable outcome. Accordingly, the arsenic levels in blood are negatively correlated with the urine arsenic levels, which indicate either the inadequacy of the renal system in cleaning the blood arsenic or a <b>continuous</b> <b>recirculation</b> of the accumulated arsenic. This is an important conclusion about arsenical metabolism in humans. The study also raises the issues of the prospects of complete elimination of the accumulated arsenic and the reversibility of the health effects. Based on the work in Kourikasa village we report that there are very remote chances of complete purging of arsenic and thus reversibility of the health effects owing to various factors. The paper also discusses the various issues concerning the chronic arsenic poisoning management in the affected locations...|$|R
40|$|Subsurface {{radionuclide}} {{and metal}} contaminants throughout the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) complex pose one of DOE?s greatest challenges for long-term stewardship. One promising stabilization mechanism for divalent ions, {{such as the}} short-lived radionuclide Sr- 90, is co-precipitation in calcite. We have previously found that nutrient addition can stimulate microbial ureolytic activity, that this activity accelerates calcite precipitation and co-precipitation of Sr, and that higher calcite precipitation rates can result in increased Sr partitioning. We have conducted integrated field, laboratory, and computational research to evaluate the relationships between ureolysis and calcite precipitation rates and trace metal partitioning under environmentally relevant conditions, and investigated the coupling between flow/flux manipulations and precipitate distribution. A field experimental campaign conducted at the Integrated Field Research Challenge (IFRC) site located at Rifle, CO {{was based on a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>recirculation</b> design; water extracted from a down-gradient well was amended with urea and molasses (a carbon and electron donor) and re-injected into an up-gradient well. The goal of the recirculation design and simultaneous injection of urea and molasses was to uniformly accelerate the hydrolysis of urea and calcite precipitation over the entire inter-wellbore zone. The urea-molasses recirculation phase lasted, with brief interruptions for geophysical surveys, for 12 days and was followed by long-term monitoring which continued for 13 months. A post experiment core located within the inter-wellbore zone was collected on day 321 and characterized with respect to cation exchange capacity, mineral carbonate content, urease activity, ureC gene abundance, extractable ammonium (a urea hydrolysis product) content, and the C- 13 isotopic composition of solid carbonates. It was also subjected to selective extractions for strontium and uranium. Result of the core characterization suggest that urea hydrolysis occurred primarily within the upper portion of the inter-wellbore zone and that strontium was mobilized from cation exchange sites and subsequently co-precipitated with new calcium carbonate...|$|R

Producing UPW involves energy-intensive operations, such as membrane separations, ultraviolet lamps, and <b>continuous</b> pumping and <b>recirculation</b> systems. Indirect energy costs can also be allocated to steps in the UPW process. Motorola recognizes that by reducing UPW consumption, energy savings will result. Energy conservation can also be achieved by improving the UPW generation process itself and by recycling or reclaiming UPW and other water streams...|$|R
40|$|<b>Continuous</b> {{lymphocyte}} <b>recirculation</b> between {{blood and}} lymphoid tissues forms {{a basis for}} the function of the immune system. Lymphocyte entrance from the blood into the tissues has been thoroughly characterized, but mechanisms controlling lymphocyte exit from the lymphoid tissues via efferent lymphatics have remained virtually unknown. In this work we have identified mannose receptor (MR) on human lymphatic endothelium and demonstrate its involvement in binding of lymphocytes to lymphatic vessels. We also show that the binding requires L-selectin, and L-selectin and MR form a receptor–ligand pair. On the other hand, L-selectin binds to peripheral lymph node addressins (PNAds) on high endothelial venules (HEVs) that are sites where lymphocytes enter the lymphatic organs. Interestingly, MR is absent from HEVs and PNAds from lymphatic endothelium. Thus, lymphocyte L-selectin uses distinct ligand molecules to mediate binding at sites of lymphocyte entrance and exit within lymph nodes. Taken together, interaction between L-selectin and MR is the first molecularly defined mechanism mediating lymphocyte binding to lymphatic endothelium. Key words: lymph node H. Irjala and E. -L. Johansson contributed equally to this paper...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of shower water deserves special {{consideration}} for reuse {{not only because}} of its low pollutant loading but also because it is produced in large quantities. In this study, a pilot scale study of photocatalytic degradation of impurities in real shower water was performed in a 31 [*]L volume reactor using titanium dioxide as the photocatalyst. The reactor was operated in a <b>continuous</b> slurry <b>recirculation</b> mode. Several operational parameters were studied including the slurry initial pH, catalyst concentration, air flow rate, and slurry recirculation rate. Up to 57 % of total organic carbon (TOC) elimination was obtained after 6 hours of treatment (for 3. 0 slurry initial pH, 0. 07 [*]gL− 1 catalyst concentration, 1. 8 [*]Lmin− 1 air flow rate, and 4. 4 [*]Lmin− 1 slurry recirculation rate). This study showed that photocatalysis could be successfully transposed from bench scale to pilot scale. Furthermore, the ease of operation and the potential to use solar energy make photocatalysis an attractive prospect with respect to treatment of grey water...|$|R
