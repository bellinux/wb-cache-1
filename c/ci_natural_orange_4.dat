The specimens were immersed in their respective solutions for 5 min, 6 x/day for 5 days, in an erosion-remineralization cycling model. Enamel specimens were analyzed by surface Knoop microhardness and optical profilometry and dentin specimens only by optical profilometry. Outcomes were analyzed statistically by ANOVA followed by Tukey&# 8217;s test considering a significance level of 5 %. For enamel, the surface loss and microhardness changes found for MM and SJ groups were similar (p> 0. 05) and significantly lower (p 0. 05) was observed in dentin surface loss between MM and SJ.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the degree of smear layer removal and dentinal tubules exposure by different <b>natural</b> <b>orange</b> juices. Extracted human teeth were submitted to manual scaling in order to develop the smear layer. Seventy dentin samples were obtained and distributed into the following groups: Control, lime orange, lime, valência orange, navel orange, mandarin, and tangerine. Each group included 2 methods of application: Topical and topical + friction. After preparation for SEM analysis, photomicrographs were assessed by a blind calibrated examiner using an index system. The Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant influence of the orange juices on smear layer removal. Significant difference was observed between navel orange, valência orange, mandarin and the control group (p < 0. 05). These orange juices resulted in greater removal of the smear layer and greater opening of dentinal tubules. The comparison between the application methods for each group using the Mann-Whitney test showed that friction increased smear layer removal significantly only for lime orange and lime.
