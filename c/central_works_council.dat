40|$|This thesis {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point {{the question whether}} European Works Councils (EWCs) can overcome the divisive pressures of cross-border competition for jobs and investment between sites. A review {{of the body of}} literature on EWCs yields that with respect to this question, opinion is divided and examples are contradictory. The <b>central</b> <b>works</b> <b>council</b> (CWC) established according to the German Betriebsverfassungsgesetz is identified as a close analogue to an EWC. In the absence of a body of literature on the internal functioning of CWCs, this research undertook to examine in depth the experience of a single CWC as a lead case. As an analytical framework, the contributions of theories of federalism as a means of reconciling unity and diversity were applied to the multi-level system of employee interest representation. A conceptualisation of solidarity as it might be generated among the members of a central and/or European works council is developed. It is concluded that a discursive/participative structure is most likely to enable the generation of solidarity across and within a multi-level, essentially federalist system. Key analytical factors are identified which are applied to the experience of the <b>Central</b> <b>Works</b> <b>Council</b> at DaimlerChrysler, and to EWCs more generally. Applying the methods of participant observation, semi-structured interviews with the CWC members, documentary analysis, and a postal survey of the local works council members, the operation of the <b>central</b> <b>works</b> <b>council</b> at DaimlerChrysler is explored in detail, covering its day-to-day functioning, its articulation with local works councils, and the values and expectations underlying its work. With reference to the conceptual framework, the findings from the case study are compared with EWC law and practice more generally. It is concluded that the EWC can be considered a nascent federalist system at most. Despite the existence of important gaps, however, this research concludes that solidarity within EWCs is possible if it can be built upon a participative and transparent set of institutions and processes which are seen by EWC members, national and local employee representatives, and trade unions to be fair and legitimate. The final chapter explores the implications of this research for policy, practice and further research.

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} gain more {{insights}} into <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness in two ways: 1. studying the influence of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence on organizational outcomes; and, 2. studying the determinants of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness. We found that productivity increases {{with the presence of}} a <b>works</b> <b>council.</b> <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> in smaller organizations (less than 50 employees), have a positive effect in reorganizations without layoffs. Creating acceptance for reorganizations, can lead to understanding among employees. In reorganizations with layoffs, <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence is negatively related to productivity in small organizations. Layoffs may signal to employees that the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> did not do its best to prevent bad consequences for the employees, and that it is siding with management. Our study of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effects on labor turnover revealed that in good times, <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence does not affect voluntary quits, and is associated with more hires and layoffs. In bad times, in organizations with a <b>works</b> <b>council,</b> more voluntary quits are reported, hires are not affected, and less involuntary quits occur. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> might thus place the organizational interests above employee interests in good economic times, and the other way around in bad economic times. We employed an experimental design {{to gain more}} insights into the fundamental processes underlying <b>works</b> <b>council</b> advice. Managers had to choose to set a low or high price for their products. Part of the managers received an advice from a <b>works</b> <b>council,</b> advising high or low. Managers only follow the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> advice when it is in line with playing Nash (choosing “low”). This reflects the conflict of interests that exists between management and works councils; if the goals are more aligned, cooperation is more likely to occur. Furthermore, prosocial managers tended to follow the advice of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> more often. They even chose a high price when the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> advised to play a low price. These results support earlier research, suggesting that a favorable attitude towards the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> often leads to more effective <b>works</b> <b>councils.</b> We found that the position in the organizational social network did not show positive effects for the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> members. Influence tactics used by the works councilors were more important, and mostly regarding influence towards management. These influence tactics for example include behaving rationally, and searching for support from persons higher in the organization. To come to a more integrative model of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness, combining determinants and outcomes, we conducted case study research. We found support for some of our earlier findings, and we identified new important determinants of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence. Management attitude was again identified as one of the crucial elements affecting <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence. Further, influence tactics are important. Relations with management, as well as relations with employees and internally, are important determinants of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence. Also, a well understood and well performed dual task of the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> was expected to lead to higher <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence...|$|R

A few months later, self-management was introduced in the Uljanik Shipyard, and the first meeting of the works council was held in October 1950. Thereby the shipyard was given in charge to the workers’ management. In the first ten years there was one active works council and one management board on the level of the whole shipyard, and in March 1961 on a proposal from the union branch and the management board, the works council brought a decision on the establishment of yet another workers’ councils in certain plants provided that the <b>central</b> <b>works</b> <b>council</b> still remained on the level of the whole shipyard. In early 1968, based on the decision of the workers’ council, a referendum for the union of Uljanik with other naval shipyards was conducted, which made Uljanik a part of the united shipbuilding industry Jadranbrod with five “people from Uljanik” elected in the works council and one elected in the management board. The workers’ councils and management boards were bringing a number of decisions on workers and employees issues, {{as well as on the}} shipyard’s work.

40|$|German <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> have {{experienced}} a growing importance in recent years. They are endowed with numerous opportunities of participation ranging from simple information rights to extensive codetermination rights according to the Works Constitution Act (WCA). Since they are mandatory but not automatic, the initiative of the employees is necessary to install a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> in firms with five or more permanent employees. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> are committed to improve working relationships and thus they may also increase firm performance. Not without reason <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> {{can be regarded as}} a central element of the industrial democratization. Due to their direct contact with the employees of a firm, they seem to be better suited to represent employees’ interests towards the management of a firm. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies with regards to works councils’ economic effects examine issue such as productivity, innovations or profitability which are of particular interest for the management of a firm. This dissertation aims to counter this problem by providing comprehensive analyses concerning the employee level. At first, the focus is laid on the relationship between <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and the incidence of both overtime work and working time accounts. Based on the GSOEP, a yearly representative longitudinal survey of individuals living in Germany, the main results show that <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are negatively correlated with the existence of overtime work. This can in particular be pronounced for men and unskilled and semi-skilled blue collar workers. In addition, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are negatively related to the number of overtime hours. Concerning subgroups of employees, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are associated with a reduced number of overtime hours of both men and white collar workers. While both paid and unpaid overtime work is less likely for employees with a <b>works</b> <b>council,</b> time-off or a combination of time-off and paid overtime work is more likely in such firms. Turning to flexible working time accounts as an important instrument of flexibility within a workplace, empirical results show a positive correlation between a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> and such accounts. But the incidence of long-term working time accounts is negatively associated with the presence of a <b>works</b> <b>council.</b> Taking the problem of unobserved heterogeneity and additional selection issues into account, women moving to a firm with a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> actually <b>work</b> fewer hours than in their previous position. However, further difference-in-differences estimations do not find a <b>works</b> <b>council’s</b> effect on overtime work or overtime hours as well as on individual working time accounts for both stayer and mover. Then, the association between <b>works</b> <b>councils,</b> wages and job satisfaction is investigated. This study provides empirical evidence that <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are associated with higher wages and a reduced gender wage differential. Moreover, <b>works</b> <b>council</b> are not correlated with employees’ job satisfaction in general. While they are negatively associated with job satisfaction of white collar workers, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are positively associated with job satisfaction of blue collar workers. Taking the issue of causality into account, a significant effect of a change in the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> status on wages cannot be shown. However, further difference-in-difference estimations hint at a positive effect on job satisfaction. This result is more pronounced for women than for men. The effect is rather driven by employees who move to a different firm during the observation period. Particular effects of an introduction of a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> for individuals who stay at their firm are not observable. Particular effects for blue collar workers compared to white collar employees cannot be found, either. Finally, the relation between <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and employment separations as well as severance payments is focused on. Empirical results show that the existence of a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> is negatively associated with both individual dismissals and voluntary quits. Hence, results from previous studies can be confirmed. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> particularly favor men as well as qualified employees. In contrast, results with respect to <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and severance payments are not as expected. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> are negatively associated with severance payments for dismissed employees. Dismissed men as well as white collar worker with simple tasks are affected in particular. These results indicate that the behavior of both <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and employees due to a dismissal may be a crucial factor in explaining who receives a severance payment at all...|$|R

Moreover, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are challenged by a partial decentralisation of collective bargaining towards the establishment level dissolving the established division of labour between <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and trade unions.

Compared to primarily prosperous establishments without staff association downgrade their result situation. In case of negative result situation establishments with a <b>work</b> <b>council</b> have no greater problems to reduce the employment than establishments without a <b>work</b> <b>council.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{representative}} {{data from}} the IAB Establishment Panel, we show that the managerial environment has a strong influence on the introduction and survival of <b>works</b> <b>councils.</b> Employees in owner-managed establishments {{are less likely to}} introduce a <b>works</b> <b>council.</b> Moreover, in case of an introduction, the new <b>works</b> <b>council</b> is less likely to survive if the establishment is owner-managed. The pattern of results even holds in situations that involve positive economic effects of <b>works</b> <b>councils.</b> This suggests that owner-managers oppose <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> not primarily for economic reasons. Our findings are rather consistent with the hypothesis that owner-managers oppose co-determination because it reduces the utility they gain from being the ultimate bosses within the establishment...|$|R
40|$|There are {{different}} kinds of <b>works</b> <b>councils.</b> They can be cooperative or antagonistic for example. There are also {{different kinds of}} management. The managers can be friendly or unfriendly to the workers and the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> representing them. Here the mutual relationship between <b>works</b> <b>council</b> and management is analysed. To this end two data sets are connected, the NIFA-Panel with information about mechanical engineering plants in Germany given by the management and the Bochumer survey of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> {{in some of these}} plants. A new typology {{of the relationship between the}} <b>works</b> <b>council</b> and the managers of a firm is derived from these combined data. The effects of a positive, neutral or negative relationship on different turnover rates, product innovations and earnings fo the firms are empirically analysed. The results are in accordance with prior studies using only separated data for <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> or management. Concretely, turnover and earnings are mostly lower and innovations more probable as long as any kind of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> exists. The kind of relationship influences the magnitudes of these effects and their statistical significance. A positive relationship reduces the departure rate most of all, a negative relationship has the strongest effect on innovations and, unexpectedly, an inconsistent relationship is best for earnings.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{the first full}} examination {{of the effect of}} German <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> on wages using matched employer-employee data (specifically, the LIAB for 2001). We find that <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are associated with higher earnings. The wage premium is around 11 percent (and is higher under collective bargaining). This result persists after taking account of worker and establishment heterogeneity and the endogeneity of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence. Next, using quantile regressions, we find that the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> premium is decreasing with the position of the worker in the wage distribution. And it is also higher for women than for men. Finally, the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> wage premium is associated with longer job tenure. This suggests that some of the premium is a noncompetitive rent, even if <b>works</b> <b>council</b> voice may dominate its distributive effects insofar as tenure is concerned.

40|$|There are union {{concerns}} that non-union forms of employee representation such as <b>work</b> <b>councils</b> may {{open up a}} second channel of communication between employees and management that would weaken union workplace representation. During World War II and the immediate post-war period, Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Australia followed its British parent firm's practice of introducing <b>works</b> <b>councils.</b> It established its first <b>works</b> <b>council</b> at its Yarraville Factory in Melbourne in 1942. By 1959 there were <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> at 12 Australian factories, each with {{an equal number of}} management nominees, and representatives elected by employees. Although they could not deal with matters covered by agreements with unions, they could deal with issues such as accident prevention, factory efficiency and timekeeping. This article analyses the impact of these <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> on labour relations, particularly trade union representation, and the demise of the <b>works</b> <b>councils.</b> 21 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Using both {{household}} and linked-employer-employee data we study {{the effects of}} <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> on individual sickness absence rates and a subjective measure of personnel problems due to absenteeism in Germany. We find that the existence of a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> is positively correlated with the incidence of absence and the amount of days being absent. Further, personnel problems due to absenteeism are more likely in plants {{in which there is a}} <b>works</b> <b>council.</b> We cannot reject the hypothesis, however, that self-selection of employees or firms gives rise to this relationship between absenteeism and <b>works</b> <b>councils...</b>|$|R
