50|$|Ellie {{starts to}} believe the {{werewolf}} hypothesis when she meets Zela, who warns about the effect the coming full moon will have. Jimmy proves they have been cursed when he holds a silver <b>cake</b> <b>server</b> and gets burned, discovering that the picture frame Ellie touched earlier was only stainless steel. Their dog, Zipper, bites Jimmy, tastes his blood, becomes a lycanthropoid monster, and goes on a rampage. Realizing what's happening, Jimmy goes to warn Ellie with Bo, who showed up at their house to confess that he is gay and has feelings for Jimmy; Bo is flatly rejected, but still helps Jimmy.|$|E

He reveals that he did bite Ellie and Jimmy, and wants to kill Jimmy (due to his Alpha male instinct) and have Ellie live forever by his side. She and Jake fight, but her {{werewolf}} form emerges sporadically while he has complete control over his, dominating the fight. Werewolf Jimmy joins in, climbing across the ceiling and biting Jake, allowing Ellie to stab and badly injure Jake with a silver <b>cake</b> <b>server.</b> Ellie decapitates Jake with a shovel and breaks the curse on the two siblings (and Zipper). They watch as Jake's body bursts into flames.|$|E
