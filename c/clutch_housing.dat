25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the <b>clutch</b> <b>housing,</b> clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new <b>clutch</b> <b>housing</b> adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique <b>clutch</b> <b>housing</b> adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E
2500|$|Dual-clutch {{transmissions}} use two {{fundamentally different}} types of clutches: either two wet multiplate clutches, bathed in oil (for cooling), or two dry single-plate clutches.

2500|$|Though not {{as obvious}} as the car's radical styling, the new chassis {{was just as}} {{important}} to the Sting Ray's success. Maneuverability was improved thanks to the faster recirculating ball, or [...] "Ball-Race", steering, and a shorter wheelbase. The latter might ordinarily imply a choppier ride, but the altered weight distribution partly compensated for it. Less weight on the front wheels also meant easier steering, and with some 80 additional pounds on the rear wheels, the Sting Ray offered improved traction. Stopping power improved, too. Four-wheel cast-iron 11-inch drum brakes remained standard but were now wider, for an increase in effective braking area. Sintered-metallic linings, segmented for cooling, were again optional. So were finned aluminum drums, which not only provided faster heat dissipation (and thus better fade resistance) but less unsprung weight. Power assist was available with both brake packages. Evolutionary engineering changes included positive crankcase ventilation, a smaller flywheel, and an aluminum <b>clutch</b> <b>housing.</b> A more efficient alternator replaced the old-fashioned generator.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} indicates that variation in intensity of aggressiveness and competitive ability among nestlings of a clutch may be attributed, at least partly, to differences in maternally deposited yolk testosterone that affects embryonic development (Schwabl 1993). We developed a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for measuring yolk testosterone levels in house wren (Troglodytes aedon) eggs. This procedure was used in initial studies to determine whether yolk testosterone varies within a <b>clutch</b> of <b>house</b> wren eggs. The analysis revealed the presence of higher levels of testosterone in yolks of eggs laid later in the clutch sequence. Because later laid eggs tend to hatch later (Winkler 1993), variation {{in the amount of}} testosterone deposited by the female may ensure a greater chance of survival for younger, less developed offspring...|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{the later}} Honda CB750 and other Japanese superbikes which had {{horizontally}} split crankcases, the Trident engine {{was essentially a}} vertically split parallel twin with a separate central chamber to accommodate the third cylinder. Whereas the Speed Twin was a traditional British twin with a 360° crankshaft, this new triple had crankpins offset 120° and so inherently had much smoother primary balance, albeit with a rocking couple. Although most British motorcycles used a wet multiplate clutch, this triple had a dry single-plate <b>clutch</b> in a <b>housing</b> between the primary chaincase and the gearbox.

5000|$|In 1961 the Series IIIA was {{announced}} with the Series II Sunbeam Alpine [...] engine. Externally and internally the Series IIIA was {{identical to the}} Series III. The improvements were directed solely at improving the durability of the car. To this end, engine capacity was increased and a stiffer crankshaft fitted. To increase reliability, the crankshaft incorporated larger diameter connecting rod bearings which called for modifications to the connecting rods and gudgeon pins. Modified oil and water pumps completed the engine changes. As a result, power output increased from [...] to [...] at 5,100 rpm and torque increased from 84 lbft Nm at 3500 rpm to [...] at 3,900 rpm. In addition, the Series IIIA included many detail changes such as an increased diameter front anti-roll bar which greatly improved roadholding, a redesigned <b>clutch</b> bell <b>housing,</b> a revised <b>clutch</b> assembly with nine pressure springs instead of six and a redesigned air cleaner assembly. Inside the car a fresh-air heater, hitherto available only at extra cost, became a standard fitting.

40|$|Trade-offs in the {{allocation}} of finite resources among different stages of a breeding attempt {{as well as between}} different reproductive events should shape the evolution of life-history traits. To investigate the effects of incubation effort on within-brood and between-brood trade-offs in house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), we manipulated the clutch size that females incubated. We isolated effects of incubation by reversing the manipulation at hatching to allow all parents to provision their natural brood sizes. Females that incubated enlarged clutches had longer incubation periods than control females, both early and late in the season, suggesting that the experimental treatment increased incubation effort. Contrary to predictions, however, increased incubation effort did not adversely affect {{the allocation}} of effort to nestling provisioning. Rather, in the early season, but not in the late season, females that incubated enlarged clutches appeared to allocate more effort to nestling provisioning, producing heavier and larger fledglings than control females. Although females with enlarged early-season clutches consequently lost more mass than control females, this was likely an adaptive response to reduce wing loading in anticipation of high provisioning demands. There were no treatment-related differences in fledgling mass or size, or in female mass loss, in the late season. Thus, elevated incubation demands negatively affected a fitness-related trait (duration of incubation) that may constrain clutch size but not {{the allocation of}} resources to subsequent stages of the same breeding event or to subsequent breeding events. We suggest that environmental conditions may mediate clutch-size effects on trade-offs in allocation of resources between incubation and nestling provisioning.

5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs.

A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and crank journals. Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|E
5000|$|This type of clutch {{has several}} driving members {{interleaved}} or [...] "stacked" [...] with several driven members. It {{is used in}} racing cars including Formula 1, IndyCar, World Rally and even most club racing. Multiplate clutches see much use in drag racing, which requires the best acceleration possible, and is notorious for the abuse the clutch is subjected to. Thus motorcycles, automatic transmissions and in some diesel locomotives with mechanical transmissions. It is also used in some electronically controlled all-wheel drive systems {{as well as in}} some transfer cases. They can also be found in some heavy machinery such as tanks and AFV's (T-54) and earthmoving equipment (front-end loaders, bulldozers), as well as components in certain types of limited slip differentials. The benefit in the case of motorsports is that you can achieve the same total friction force with a much smaller overall diameter (or conversely, a much greater friction force for the same diameter, important in cases where a vehicle is modified with greater power, yet the maximum physical size of the clutch unit is constrained by the <b>clutch</b> <b>housing).</b> In motorsports vehicles that run at high engine/drivetrain speeds, the smaller diameter reduces rotational inertia, making the drivetrain components accelerate more rapidly, as well as reducing the angular velocity of the outer areas of the clutch unit, which could become highly stressed and fail at the extremely high drivetrain rotational rates achieved in sports such as Formula 1 or drag racing. In the case of heavy equipment, which often deal with very high torque forces and drivetrain loads, a single plate clutch of the necessary strength would be too large to easily package as a component of the driveline.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the Master Thesis done by two {{students at the}} Mechanical Engineering program, Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology. The thesis was performed at Luleå University of Technology in collaboration with BorgWarner PDS located in Landskrona. The objective for the thesis was to study the potential for predicting and optimizing drag losses and oil flow characteristics in a wet clutch system using numerical simulations in LS-DYNA. BorgWarner PDS manufactures and distributes the Haldex coupling, which is an electro-hydraulic coupling used in an active four-wheel drive system. BorgWarner PDS strives to make the Haldex coupling more efficient by minimizing energy losses in order to lower fuel consumption for the vehicle and a smaller impact on the environment. As testing on prototypes are costly and time consuming it is therefore desirable to use numerical simulations instead. To determine the potential for numerical simulations to predict and optimize both drag losses and oil flow characteristics a numerical model was set up using LS-DYNA. A test rig was designed {{in order to achieve}} a controlled testing environment in order to validate the numerical models, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The numerical model uses the built in Fluid Structure Interaction method in LS-DYNA, which is a combination of a structural model and an incompressible fluid model. The test rig measures torque on the <b>clutch</b> <b>housing</b> induced by the dragging of oil as the clutch drum rotates. The tests were performed using different rotational speeds, varying from 250 - 1500 rpm, and different <b>clutch</b> <b>housing</b> geometries. The results were gathered from an average of ten measurements of the drag torque. A high- speed camera was also used to capture the oil flow characteristics. The numerical simulations were done using the same parameters used for the tests i. e. different rotational speeds and <b>clutch</b> <b>housing</b> geometries. In addition, each simulation was performed using different mesh sizes; 0. 5 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm in order to analyze mesh dependence. The numerical model was set to measure the drag torque on the clutch drum and was then compared to the experimental results in order to validate the numerical model quantitatively. The oil flow characteristics from the numerical simulation were compared to the high-speed movies to validate the numerical model qualitatively. The numerical model shows promising results when it comes to predicting drag torque and oil flow characteristics. The results also show that using a numerical model for optimization purposes are possible as the experimentally measured drag torque at different clutch house geometries corresponds to the numerically simulated drag torque. The conclusions from this Master Thesis is that numerical simulations do have a potential for predicting drag losses and oil flow characteristics in a wet clutch system. The numerical model created in this project {{can also be used to}} obtain valuable information about geometry changes when it comes to optimizing the wet clutch system. However, the numerical model is still at an early stage and can be seen as a second generation model where further work needs to be done in order to include more of the complex geometries of a wet clutch system have. Although LS-DYNA is state-of-the-art when it comes to these kinds of complex simulations it still needs to be developed further to handle such complex simulations. ...|$|E

40|$|Summary. At {{the present}} time both clutch and {{mechanism}} housings, which are the main components from automotive gear boxes, are made of special aluminium alloys. These alloys are extremely light when compared with steel, making them a perfect choice to mitigate the cars weight and machining costs. Nonetheless they possess a high thermal expansion coefficient, which {{can be considered a}} major disadvantage since it makes necessary to pay extraordinary attention to dimensional variations during the production cycle due to temperature deviations. High speed machining of precision components made of aluminium requests thus their temperature to become previously stable. This procedure {{is the only way to}} force dimensions to stay inside its tolerance intervals. The main purpose of the present work was to assess the possibility to avoid the use of special ovens to make the <b>clutch</b> <b>housing</b> temperature become stable prior to machining. The dimensional stabilization of 40 sample parts, pre-heated at three temperature levels, was accomplished through the use of this system. The achieved results were made possible by analysing the part’s temperature at the machine’s entrance, the machine’s interior temperature, 35 measured dimensions and their tolerance intervals as well as the averag...|$|E

The dimensional stabilization of 40 sample parts, pre-heated at three temperature levels, was accomplished through the use of this system. The achieved results were made possible by analysing the part’s temperature at the machine’s entrance, the machine’s interior temperature, 35 measured dimensions and their tolerance intervals as well as the average temperature deviations of each of the five considered batches. By analysing the obtained results in detail it was possible to determine which dimensions show high sensitiveness to temperature (high correlation between dimension’s variation and temperature). Among these dimensions we can point out the ones related with depth, since they display the highest deviations due to temperature. Being a work with practical application it was possible to confirm the benefit of using this methodology by achieving significant enhancements on production efficiency, energy savings and reduction on maintenance costs, through the application of small adjustments to the machining sequence and by adopting a systematic tuning of certain dimensions...|$|E
