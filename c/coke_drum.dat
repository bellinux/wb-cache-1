50|$|Construction {{started in}} August 1966. It {{was built for}} Continental Oil (UK) Ltd. It was {{originally}} estimated to cost £25 million but cost twice that. It was built by Power-Gas Corporation, a subsidiary of Sheffield-based Davy-Ashmore who had a £22 million contract.

The railway sidings were installed by the Ward Group of Sheffield. 75 miles of steel tubing were made by the Corby steel works for £250,000. In September 1967 there were gales across the country and a man was killed on the site when an engineering shed fell on him. In October 1967 there was a strike, and 120 workers in the Constructional Engineers Union were sacked. In January 1968 a 20-year-old worker from Dublin was killed when a 275-ton <b>coke</b> <b>drum,</b> being raised by a twin jib rig onto a gantry, fell 50 feet to the ground, causing the worker to be crushed by a crane.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Delayed coke drums are {{operated}} under severe conditions of cyclic heating and forced cooling that apply repetitive thermal stresses to the drum {{walls and the}} skirt. Since thermal cycling is most severe {{near the bottom of}} the <b>coke</b> <b>drum,</b> where temperatures can reach up to 1000 °F, the skirt and other attachment welds are just as prone to cracking and premature structural failure as the vessel wall. The purpose is to determine a skirt / “Hot-box ” junction geometry which will minimize thermal gradient stresses and improve fatigue life. The process flow of <b>coke</b> <b>drum</b> along with the temperature gradient due to coking process and the effect of thermal stresses on the skirt shell junction / hot-box using finite element model. In present project work comparative analysis of hot box is done by analytical, FEA using ANSYS 13. Study demonstrates that by modifying the dimensions of the hot box such as length, will affects the fatigue life of <b>coke</b> <b>drum.</b> This appears to be due to the longer hot-box length, which results in a more gradual thermal gradient and also moves the gradient lower on the skirt away from the welded connection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCoke drums undergo cyclic thermal and {{mechanical}} loading during operation, {{which tend to}} cause damage like bulging and cracking near circumferential welds in coke drums. In this paper, considering {{the existence of the}} overmatch welds and uneven temperature field during oil-feeding and water quenching as well as quenching conditions, the bulging behavior of the <b>coke</b> <b>drum</b> is investigated. Firstly, the uniaxial tension and ratchetting experiments of parent metal and weld of <b>coke</b> <b>drum</b> are carried out at 20 oC, 200 oC, 300 oC, and 400 oC. Secondly, the ratchetting strains are predicted by OW-II kinematic hardening model and the predicted ratchetting strain rates of steady stage are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results. By comparison, weld has significantly smaller ratchetting strain rate than parent metal under the same loading conditions, which shows that the anti-ratchetting ability of weld is better than that of parent metal. Thirdly, the transient temperature field during oil-feeding and water quenching are numerically simulated with the help of dynamic coordinate system method, which yields the axial temperature difference and its characteristic value for the simplified characteristic load {{to be used in the}} cyclic plastic analysis of <b>coke</b> <b>drum</b> cycled between oil-feeding and water quenching. Fourthly, the ratchet boundaries are determined under moving axial temperature gradient by cyclic plasticity analysis for the parent metal. It is found that, when temperature difference range of water quenching is smaller, the ratchet boundaries are heavily influenced by the cyclic internal pressure. Finally, considering the strength differences between parent metal and weld, cyclic plasticity analysis is done for the circumferential weld connection region of <b>coke</b> <b>drum.</b> The results indicate that the bulging is preferentially near and about 10 mm above the weld under given loading conditions. It is also observed that, for cylinder with or without the circumferential weld, the co-existence of cyclic internal pressure can increase the ratchetting strain of the structure and the ratchetting strain rate of structure also increases with the cyclic internal pressure range...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{is to develop a}} new approach for the direct liquefaction of coal to produce an all-distillate product slate at a sizable cost reduction over current technology. The approach integrates coal selection, pretreatment, coal swelling with catalyst impregnation, liquefaction, product recovery with characterization, alternate bottoms processing, and carrying out a technical assessment including an economic evaluation. The primary coal of this program, Black Thunder subbituminous coal, can be effectively beneficiated to about 3. 5 wt % ash using aqueous sulfurous acid pretreatment. This treated coal can be further beneficiated to about 2 wt % ash using commercially available procedures. All three coals used in this study (Black Thunder, Burning Star bituminous, and Martin Lake lignite) are effectively swelled by a number of solvents. The most effective solvents are those having hetero-functionality. laboratory- and bench-scale liquefaction experimentation is underway using swelled and catalyst impregnated coal samples. Higher coal conversions were observed for the SO{sub 2 }-treated subbituminous coal than the raw coal, regardless of catalyst type. Conversions of swelled coal were highest when Molyvan L, molybdenum naphthenate, and nickel octoate, respectively, were added to the liquefaction solvent. The study of bottoms processing consists of combining the ASCOT process which consists of coupling solvent deasphalting with delayed coking to maximize the production of coal-derived liquids while rejecting solids within the <b>coke</b> <b>drum.</b> The asphalt production phase has been completed; representative product has been evaluated.

40|$|LectureDelayed coking is a {{refining}} process {{that consists of}} the upgrading of petroleum residues into lighter and more valuable hydrocarbon fractions by promoting thermal cracking on the residue stream. Petroleum coke is a by-product of this process and depending on its morphology {{it can be used}} as fuel for steam generation, cement calcination or as feed stock for the manufacturing of aluminum and steel. Delayed cokers are very complex systems and require a considerable amount of hardware such as fired heaters, <b>coke</b> <b>drums,</b> a main fractionator and a hydraulic decoking system. In a typical delayed coker petroleum residues are passed through fired heaters before they are charged, in an alternating fashion, into large drums as boiling product. In the drums some of this effluent thermally cracks into lighter fractions (vapors) and these are removed from the drum overhead and returned to the coker fractionator before they are sent to a gas plant for further refining. The heavier product that stays behind slowly forms into coke and it is allowed to fill the drum over time. This time is takes to do this is usually referred to as the coking cycle. Once the drum is full and the feed is switched to start filling an empty drum, a series of activities such as sludging, quenching and steam-outs are performed on the full drum prior to removing the ocke. Very high pressure water is used to cut this solid coke out and after some preparations this drum is empty and ready for a new coking cycle to begin again. As stated above, delayed coking is thus a combination of a continuous process through the fractionation tower and furnace and a batch process in the drums. As a result of this configuration the high pressure decoking pump only needs to operate a portion of the total cycle time. Regardless of its ?part-time? operation the water jet coke cutting pump is still a very important component of the hydraulic decoking system because it not only provides the required cutting pressure necessary to cut the coke but also contributes to the quality of coke removed and the duration fo the decoking cycle. Recent history shows that the majority of new hydraulic decoking installations use electric motor drived with fixed speed operation. The pump generally requires on operating speed to produce the necessary pressure to cut the coke and its flow, pressurization, and depressurization duties are controlled by a decoking control valve. During noncutting cycles operators typically shut off the motor to minimize power consumption of the system or they keep the motor running (rarely done), depressurize the line and operate this valve on bypass to recirculate the water through a holding tank until the coke cutting is resumed. Both operating alternatives have their disadvantages with regard reliability (the first) and energy consumption (the second). This paper explores the use of a hydrodynamic variable speed drive (HVSD) with an electric motor-driven pump as a way to increase the flexibility and reliability of the hydraulic decoking system. The HVSD or variable speed coupling (VSC) is able to seamlessly vary the speed of the pump and accomplish the following: Keep the motor running and operate the pump at minimum idle speed during noncutting cycles, avoiding periodic motor shutdowns and start ups; Eliminate the need for soft starter or special motor design considerations to handle periodic start ups; Reduce work and extend life of the decoking control valve by helping with depressurization duties during noncutting cycles and cutting tool mode shifting; Efficiently adjust cutting pressures depending on feed stock quality to avoid coke pulverization. This paper also describes the function of the variable speed coupling and how its unique design features are suited for the start up and intermittent operation of the water jet coke cutting pump. Field data and operator experience from two existing installations are collected and evaluated and the advantages of variable speed operation over fixed speed operation of the decoking pump are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The {{maximum yield}} taken in an oil {{refinery}} can not exceed 70 % without including Delayed Coker Unit (DCU) {{as part of}} unit operations in the refinery. This implies naturally a big attraction on investing of such a unit for refiners. However, during the past decades, there were few refiners included Coker unit in the refinery, {{due to the fact}} of its large capital investment with a high marginal profitability. On the other hand the technologies developed to operate a coker unit, involve a series of process steps that require highly trained and well experienced operators with a state of art of design to overcome all the challenges with this unit operation. Safety, as a prime factor of design and operation requires much attention in the design of this unit. Among different safety consideration in the design and operation of Coker Unit, this project thesis focuses on the dynamic behaviour of Coke Drums PSV (Process Safety Valve) relief and its interaction with Blowdown section of the unit that leads also to the PSV relief of Blowdown section with change of temperature versus time during the first 15 minutes that is considered as the time required for operators intervention.

5000|$|Coke Studios season 9 {{became one}} of the most {{anticipated}} series, after the immensely positive reception from previous season. The change of format drew wide attention leading to the speculations that having six music directors on the show would bring chaos, record producer Faisal Rafi said that [...] "multiple-producer idea, if implemented, will be the last nail in the coffin," [...] he went on to say that,"Producers are selfish people. They wouldn’t want others to share their limelight." [...] In contradict to Rafi's statement, housband member and <b>Coke</b> Studio long-term <b>drummer</b> Gumby said, [...] "The initial success of Coke Studio lay in the fact that we had an ensemble of producers joining forces. People like Asad Ahmed, Omran Shafique and I used to work in coordination," [...] and said [...] "Hyatt did hold the reins but the show had our input as well." [...] Speaking on the format change he explained, [...] "it is ridiculous that a single producer churns out 25 to 30 songs alone." [...] Citing the example of the Shiraz Uppal-produced [...] "Tajdare-Haram" [...] in season eight, he said [...] "tracks like these prove that the formula works." [...] Receiving mixed reception from media on the change of format, Faisal Kapadia said, [...] "Bringing in new people was the need of the hour. It’s going to shake things up and keep audiences riveted. It is our job to assess what works and to make changes accordingly. And honestly, with or without us, Coke Studio identifies Pakistan’s pop industry. We don’t just own it; the whole nation does." [...] The death of Qawali singer Amjad Sabri brought wide media attention to series before it premier or any press release, when it was revealed that he was a debut featured artist on show before being killed in a target killing on 22 Jun 2016, just 25 days after he recorded his debut performance. His appearance on show {{became one of}} the most awaited performances on the Coke Studio. In an interview Faisal said, [...] "On recording day, after a small briefing session, we skipped the rehearsal and went straight into recording. Sabri started singing in his grand sonorous voice and blew everyone away. We all cried that night. These two masters took us to a very different journey, a journey we can never forget. Just 25 days later, Sabri is not with us. We still can’t believe it." [...] Sabri became the first featured-artist whose performance was aired posthumously.|$|R
