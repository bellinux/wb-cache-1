The pair had worked on several other series before The X-Files, and had also contributed the episodes [...] "Conduit", [...] "Ghost in the Machine", [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] and [...] "Lazarus" [...] to the series so far. Series creator Chris Carter recalls being asked to collaborate on the episode, saying [...] "Howard <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> and said, 'Help me out,' so we went to my living room and put up this bulletin board and {{in a matter of hours}} we came up with this story". Originally the script had called for more overt religious imagery, though censors at Fox objected to depictions of faith healer Samuel being beaten to death whilst in a cruciform pose, leading to scenes being cut.|$|E

"Police <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> on Sunday at 1pm when I {{was having}} my siesta {{and told me}} that the escapees had demanded to see me before they gave {{themselves}} up to the police voluntarily. I was reluctant because last time I helped the police I was arrested but I agreed if it meant they would give themselves up, so I went with two officers to Tanoliu.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a conference}} call Ergen stated after being asked about the removal of AMC channels, [...] "Our {{customers}} are not looking at zombies in New York City. They live in farms and ranches ... We have data, real data from our customers. And for whatever reason, our customers don't watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper, perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever." [...] Ergen also said [...] "I've had satellite television {{for as long as}} satellite television has been around, and there's never been one minute that I know of that anybody in my family or anybody who's <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> has ever watched one second of any of those channels. They have no clue about zombies in New York City marching around saying, 'Where is my AMC?'" [...] Soon after the call, Business Insider blared the headline, [...] "Dish CEO says customers don't care about AMC because they live on 'farms and ranches.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1869, Dr. Dio Lewis {{gave the}} lecture in Dover {{that he gave}} three years later in Hillsboro, Ohio, where it {{inspired}} the woman's temperance crusade {{and led to the}} organization of the W. C. T. U. In Dover, a committee of women was appointed, meetings held and saloons visited. Burlingame was a member of this committee, presided at the great mass meetings held, and was offered the leadership of the movement, which she declined. “In June, 1873,” said Burlingame, “Mrs. M. M. H. Hills <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> and told me I had been elected president of the Free Baptist W.M.S., just organized at the New Hampshire Yearly Meeting. I at once decided that if president in name, I would be in fact. It had been the custom for women's societies in the denomination to ask a minister to preside, read reports and conduct all public business. I arranged at the first meeting after my election for the women to do their own work. I well remember the first time I presided at the Anniversaries in 1873 at Farmington, N. H." [...] The prominent men, Dr. O. B. Cheney, Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, who had formerly conducted the exercises for the women, sat in the front pew, ready to grasp the helm should anything go wrong. Ascending the steps to the platform, Burlingame was too abashed to stand behind the pulpit, so she stood beside it. Other officers sustained their parts well. At the close of the exercises Rev. Knowlton came and congratulated her and said, [...] "The brethren will have to look out for their laurels after this.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Though {{he would}} not be much {{relieved}} to find you had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> instead? Well, I suppose one must make allowances for the Puritan character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> when I wasn’t at home," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Vickers, in {{a trembling}} but sarcastic voice. [...] "I {{want to hear}} about it. That’s what I’ve come for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> I {{put up with}} him, which I think {{describes}} it best, though I fail to see much reason for doing so any longer. But {{what are you going}} to do about the lode?" ...|$|E

"He <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> in the wynd," [...] said Henry, [...] "about half an {{hour before}} midnight; and I {{admitted}} him, something unwillingly, as he had been keeping carnival while I remained at home; and 'There is ill talk,' says the proverb, 'betwixt a full man and a fasting.'" ...|$|E

Now, you can't drag him from his work. <b>Came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> to fix a pipe under the kitchen sink--wouldn't quit at six o'clock.

6000|$|... "You {{may well}} be," [...] {{said the old}} man, [...] "for I am all alone in the world, and without wife or child.

He was afraid to go home. 'I can't face my wife and children,' he said. He told me what he'd seen, and then when I remembered that it had all been decided in my stable, and the committee appointed there, I began to tremble. You believe I'm telling the truth, don't you?" [...] he again asked, with piteous accent.|$|E
60|$|LADY MARKBY. That {{is quite}} true, dear. But one needn’t know them. I’m sure I don’t know {{half the people}} who <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> Indeed, from all I hear, I shouldn’t like to.|$|R

I shall know that always; and when I turn my face to the wall, as I soon shall, that shall be my last earthly thought." [...] And so in tears they parted for that night. But the sorrow that was bringing him to his grave came from the love of which he had spoken. It is seldom that a young man may die from a broken heart; but if an old man have a heart still left to him, it is more fragile.|$|E
60|$|When I {{was just}} {{preparing}} {{to pay my}} respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu, a distinguished person at Court, to whom I had once done a great service, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> very privately at night, and without sending his name desired admission. I put his lordship into my coat pocket, and, giving orders to a trusty servant to admit no one, I fastened the door, placed my visitor on the table, and sat down by it. His lordship's face was full of trouble; {{and he asked me}} to hear him with patience, in a matter that highly concerned my honor and my life.|$|E

"Is it not strange," [...] {{she said}} to her jailors, [...] "that I should be put in chains, and some of my friends should be sent to {{perpetual}} slavery and some killed, though we have done no evil? We have neither excited rebellion, nor stolen the property of any, nor spoken ill of any--yet we are treated thus, and our property is confiscated. It will be wise if the persecutors think what they do, lest they bring on themselves the wrath of God. But I do not fear. When Hater-of-lies <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> I rejoiced that I was counted worthy to suffer affliction for believing in Jesus." ...|$|E
