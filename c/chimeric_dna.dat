50|$|This {{in vitro}} {{technique}} {{was one of}} the first techniques in the era of recombination. It begins with the digestion of homologous parental genes into small fragments by DNase1. These small fragments are then purified from undigested parental genes. Purified fragments are then reassembled using primer-less PCR. This PCR involves homologous fragments from different parental genes priming for each other, resulting in <b>chimeric</b> <b>DNA.</b> The <b>chimeric</b> <b>DNA</b> of parental size is then amplified using end terminal primers in regular PCR.|$|E

One set of <b>chimeric</b> <b>DNAs</b> was made by exchanging the regulatory regions between JCV and simian virus 40 (SV 40) or JCV and BK virus (BKV). A second set of constructs was produced that expressed hybrid JCV-BKV T proteins {{under the control of}} either JCV or BKV regulatory signals. Transformation of Rat 2 cells with the parental and <b>chimeric</b> <b>DNAs</b> indicated that both the JCV regulatory signals and the sequence encoding the amino terminus of T protein contributed to the restricted transforming behavior of this virus. Analysis of the viral proteins in the transformed rat cells indicated that the large T antigens of JCV and BKV were less stable than their SV 40 counterpart, that small t protein was produced in JCV transformants, and that the subpopulation of T antigen that forms a stable complex with cellular p 53 protein was smaller in JCV-transformed cells than in SV 40 - or BKV-transformed cells...|$|R
40|$|Although {{hepatitis}} B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) per se is highly immunogenic, its {{use as a}} vector for the delivery of foreign cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes has met with little success because of constraints on HBsAg stability and secretion imposed by the insertion of foreign sequence into critical hydrophobic/amphipathic regions. Using a strategy entailing deletion of DNA encoding HBsAg-specific CTL epitopes and replacement with DNA encoding foreign CTL epitopes, we have derived <b>chimeric</b> HBsAg <b>DNA</b> immunogens which elicited effector and memory CTL responses in vitro, and pathogen- and tumor-protective responses in vivo, when the <b>chimeric</b> HBsAg <b>DNAs</b> were used to immunize mice. We further show that HBsAg DNA recombinant for both respiratory syncytial virus and human papillomavirus CTL epitopes elicited simultaneous responses to both pathogens. These data demonstrate the efficacy of HBsAg DNA as a vector for the delivery of disease-relevant protective CTL responses. They also suggest {{the applicability of the}} approach of deriving <b>chimeric</b> HBsAg <b>DNA</b> immunogens simultaneously encoding protective CTL epitopes for multiple diseases. The DNAs we tested formed chimeric HBsAg virus-like particles (VLPs). Thus, our results have implications for the development of vaccination strategies using either <b>chimeric</b> HBsAg <b>DNA</b> or VLP vaccines.

50|$|The {{procedure}} {{begins with}} a <b>chimeric</b> <b>DNA</b> oligonucleotide annealing to the target RNA around the candidate modification site. The chimeric ssDNA has 2’OMe/2’H modifications and is complementary to the target sequence. The chimeric oligonucleotide serves {{as a guide to}} allow RNase H to cleave the RNA strand precisely at the 5’-end of the candidate site. The cut site is then radiolabeled with phosphorus-32 and splint-ligated to a 116nt ssDNA oligonucleotide using DNA ligase. RNase T1/A is introduced to the sample to digest all RNA, except for the RNA molecules with the 116-mers DNA attached. This radiolabeled product is then isolated and digested by nuclease to generate a mixture of modified and unmodified adenosines (5’P-m6A and 5’-P-A) which is separated using thin layer chromatography. The relative proportions of the two groups can be determined using UV absorption levels.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that certain unique features of the JC virus (JCV) regulatory region are responsible for the restricted lytic and transforming activities of this virus in vitro. To pursue this possibility, we have constructed hybrid polyomavirus genomes by exchanging the regulatory sequences of JCV, BK virus (BKV), and simian virus 40 (SV 40). The host range of JCV was not expanded by the substitution of the BKV or SV 40 regulatory signals; such hybrids were nonviable even in primary human fetal glial cells, the sole permissive cell for JCV. However, <b>chimeric</b> <b>DNAs</b> containing JCV regulatory sequences and BKV- or SV 40 -coding sequences were lytically active, indicating that the BKV and SV 40 T proteins were capable of effectively interacting with the JCV replication and transcription signals to yield infectious hybrid viruses.

40|$|An M 13 phage {{deletion}} mutant, M 13 delta E 101, {{developed as}} a vector for selecting DNA sequences that direct DNA strand initiation on a single-stranded template, {{has been used for}} cloning restriction enzyme digests of phi X 174 replicative-form DNA. Initiation determinants, detected on the basis of clear-plaque formation by the chimeric phage, were found only in restriction fragments containing the unique effector site in phi X 174 DNA for the Escherichia coli protein n' dATPase (ATPase). Furthermore, these sequences were functional only when cloned in the orientation in which the phi X 174 viral strand was joined to the M 13 viral strand. A 181 -nucleotide viral strand fragment containing this initiation determinant confers a phi X 174 -type complementary-strand replication mechanism on M 13 chimeras. The chimeric phage is converted to the parental replicative form in vivo by a mechanism resistant to rifampin, a specific inhibitor of the normal RNA polymerase-dependent mechanism of M 13.

The mRNA profiles of ChIL- 2 and ChIFN-γ in spleen were characterized by means of real-time PCR. Chickens immunized with pcDNA- 3 - 1 E-linker-mChIL- 15 exhibited significant upregulated level of ChIL- 2 and ChIFN-γ transcripts in spleen following two immunizations compared with chickens in other groups (P < 0. 01).

40|$|The {{replication}} {{origins of}} viral and complementary strands of bacteriophage M 13 DNA are contained within a 507 -nucleotide intergenic {{region of the}} viral genome. Chimeric plasmids have been constructed by inserting restriction endonuclease fragments of the M 13 intergenic region into the plasmid pBR 322. Replication of these hybrid plasmids, under conditions not permissive for the plasmid replicon, depends on specific segments of the M 13 origin region and {{on the presence of}} M 13 helper virus. Thus M 13 -infected polA- Escherichia coli can be transformed to ampicillin resistance by hybrid plasmids that have a functional M 13 origin. Cells transformed to drug resistance by plasmids bearing M 13 origin sequences contain the duplex <b>chimeric</b> <b>DNA</b> at high copy number but do not accumulate significant amounts of single-stranded plasmid DNA.

The two digestion profiles were quite similar in their overall banding patterns, indicating that the clone bank was significantly representative of the rickettsial genome. When both clone banks were screened for expression of rickettsial antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with goat anti-R. prowazekii serum, ca. 20 % of the clones reacted positively. Two clones were randomly selected for more detailed analysis. Each contained a large chimeric plasmid (40. 2 and 38. 1 kilobases) which apparently yielded smaller deletion derivatives (13. 6 and 12. 6 kilobases) when transformed into an E. coli minicell strain. Each recombinant plasmid directed the synthesis of new protein species not observed in control minicells. One of the clones produced a 51, 000 -dalton protein in minicells, which comigrated with a protein reactive with anti-R. prowazekii serum. This protein was not present in negative controls. When antibodies to this protein were incubated with a Western blot of rickettsial total protein, they bound to a 52, 000 -dalton polypeptide.
