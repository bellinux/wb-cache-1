40|$|Background: The genus Burkholderia is {{widespread}} in diverse ecological niches, {{the majority of}} known species are soil bacteria that exhibit different types of non-pathogenic interactions with plants. Burkholderia species are versatile organisms that solubilize insoluble minerals through the production of organic acids, which increase the availability of nutrients for the plant. Therefore these bacteria are promising candidates for biotechnological applications. Results: Burkholderia sp. (R 3. 25 isolate) was isolated from agricultural soil in Ponta Grossa-PR-Brazil and identified through analysis of the 16 S rDNA as a strain classified as Burkholderia gladioli. The expression of membrane-bound acid phosphatase (MBAcP) was strictly regulated with optimal expression at a concentration of phosphorus 5 mM. The apparent optimum pH for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate (PNPP) was 6. 0. The hydrolysis of PNPP by the enzyme exhibited a hyperbolic relationship with increasing concentration of substrate and no inhibition by excess of substrate was observed. Kinetic data revealed that the hydrolysis of PNPP exhibited cooperative kinetics with n[*]=[*] 1. 3, Vm[*]=[*] 113. 5 U/mg and K 0. 5 [*]=[*] 65 μM.

Potassium bitartrate and <b>calcium</b> <b>tartrate</b> precipitations are undesirable phenomena which can occur in bottled wines, especially when these are stored at low temperatures. The occurrence of tartrate salt crystals (potassium hydrogen tartrate – KHT and <b>calcium</b> <b>tartrate</b> – CaT) in bottles has severe consequences in the final aspect of the wine and therefore on the consumer’s acceptance, making tartrate wine stabilization virtually mandatory before bottling. Currently, several solutions to prevent this haze are available: subtractive methods including the conventional cold treatments that promote the cristalization of KHT, removal of potassium and calcium ions either by electrodialysis or ion exchange resins; and additive methods such as the addition of carboxymethylcellulose, mannoproteins or metatartaric acid. For monitoring the KHT stability, several analytical methods have been developed based on conductivity evaluation, namely the mini-contact test and the saturation temperature measurements (TS). These methods will also be revisited, aiming to raise awareness of their utility as tools in quality control of wines.

Titration of <b>calcium</b> <b>tartrate</b> to physiologically relevant Ca 2 þ levels provided evidence for intermediately metalated species during the transition from apo- to holo-calmodulin, with collision cross-section measurements indicating that higher Ca 2 þ occupancy is correlated with more compact structures.

There are a variety of current tartrate stabilization techniques such as cold stabilization, chemical additives, ion exchange resins, and electrodialysis that stabilize wine, but the most popular being cold stabilization. Cold stabilization requires high amounts of energy and resources to stabilize wine. With the ever increasing demand for more efficient processing, an alternative tartrate stabilization technology based on an electrolytic method was developed and its viability to stabilize wine was determined. Twelve treatments involving different combinations of time and current were replicated three times each on different batches of Chardonnay wine. Several different variables were analyzed for stability and quality purposes. Tartaric acid, potassium, calcium, and conductivity differences were the most important factors for tartrate stability. Temperature, titratable acidity, pH, color (hue and intensity), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were indicators of sensory quality characteristics of the wine. The concentrations of potassium, calcium, and tartaric acid were reduced by the electrolytic method at satisfactory process parameters, inherently making the wine more stable. The temperature and hue were significantly affected by the electrolytic method and accelerated the oxidative browning process. Electrolytic treatment of Chardonnay is a viable alternative stabilization technology.

40|$|For {{biological}} treatment of drinking water, several crucial issues {{need to be}} addressed: firstly, microorganisms used in the treatment must be confined and free from leaking into the bulk water; secondly, certain nutrients, particularly, organic carbon source must be provided for optimal microbial growth; finally, the end products of biological conversions must be non-toxic to humans and animals.

In principle, therefore, ESI-MS represents a simple and elegant approach for gaining insights into the binding stoichiometry and affinity of these assemblies. Unfortunately, the formation of nonspecific metal adducts during ESI can be a severe problem, often leading to binding levels that are dramatically higher than those in bulk solution. Focusing on several calcium binding proteins as test systems, this work explores the suitability of different salts to serve as metal source. Despite their widespread use in previous ESI-MS studies, calcium chloride and acetate induce extensive nonspecific adduction. In contrast, much lower levels of artifactual metal binding are observed in the presence of <b>calcium</b> <b>tartrate.</b> In the case of high and intermediate affinity proteins, the resulting ESI-MS data are in excellent agreement with the calcium binding behavior in bulk solution. The situation is more challenging when studying proteins with very low affinities, but in the presence of tartrate qualitative information on protein-metal interactions can still be obtained. The beneficial effects of tartrate also extend to zinc binding experiments. This work does not directly explore the mechanism by which tartrate suppresses nonspecific metalation. However, it seems likely that weak chelators such as tartrate sequester metal ions within rapidly shrinking droplets during the final stages of ESI, thereby reducing nonspecific metal adduction to protein carboxylates. The use of tartrate and possibly other weak chelators will greatly enhance the reliability of future ESI-MS studies on the interactions of proteins with divalent metal ions...|$|E

Successful systemic therapy typically led to a transient increase in osteoblast activity ('flare'), a reduction in osteoclast activity and symptomatic improvement. After 1 month a greater than 10 % rise in serum osteocalcin (BGP) and alkaline phosphatase bone isoenzyme (ALP-BI) and a greater than 10 % fall in urinary calcium excretion were seen in 14 / 16 patients with radiographic evidence of bone healing (UICC partial responders). In comparison similar biochemical changes at 1 month were seen in only 4 / 20 patients with progressive disease (P less than 0. 001). The predictive value and diagnostic efficiency (DE) of changes at 1 month in biochemical measurements and symptom score has been calculated. The combination of a greater than 10 % rise in ALPBI and BGP and a greater than 10 % fall in urinary calcium excretion had a DE of 89 % for discriminating response from progression, 88 % for response from non-response (progressing + no change patients), and 76 % for TTF of greater than 6 months from TTF of less than 6 months.

Nonspecific metalation artifacts were eliminated by conducting the experiments in negative ion mode and with <b>calcium</b> <b>tartrate</b> as metal source [Pan et al. (2009) Anal. Chem. 81, 5008]. Two coexisting CaM subpopulations can be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their ESI charge state distributions, namely, relatively disordered conformers (CaM(D), high charge states) and more tightly folded proteins (CaM(F), low charge states). Calcium titration experiments on isolated CaM reveal that the transition from apo-CaM(D) to Ca(4). CaM(F) proceeds with apparent K(d) values of 10, 14, 30, and 12 microM. In the presence of Mel, a gradual [Ca(2 +) ] increase results in an overall population shift from apo-CaM(D) to Ca(4). CaM(F). Mel. This transition involves various intermediates, Ca(n). CaM(F). Mel with n = 0, [...] ., 3, as well as apo-CaM(D). Mel. Thus, neither the binding of four Ca(2 +) nor the existence of a tightly folded CaM conformation is a prerequisite for target binding.

In Chapter 2 we describe some novel phases of organoborate phases including [(C 4 H 10 N 2) (B 6 O 10 H 2) ] with direct B-N connection. The flux approach also {{led to the formation}} of a number of organic salts of polyborate anions. In Chapter 3 metal and organic bis(salicylato) spiroborates have been synthesized with high yield, purity and crystallinity by the flux approach. Since salicylate and its derivatives are asymmetric chelates, the boron centers are chiral. Resolution of the [BS(Sal) 2] anion was effected by using quininium as chiral counter cation. In aqueous media the chiral B center was found to be labile, the rate of scrambling t 1 / 2 is about 40 mins. However. solutions of chirally resolved B(Sal) 2 ions have been found to be indefinitely stable in DMF solution at room temperature. In Chapter 4 hydrothermal boric acid ‘flux’ and solvothermal synthesis of tartratoborates affords simple monomer, cyclic oligomer or chain polymer arrangements. For L-tartrate all three types can be isolated through use of different crystallization conditions, such as solvent, temperature, reagent stoichiometry and the identity of the counter cations.

40|$|Calcium is the 5 th most {{abundant}} element on earth, and {{is found in}} numerous biological tissues, proteins, materials, and increasingly in catalysts. However, due {{to a number of}} unfavourable nuclear properties, such as a low magnetogyric ratio, very low natural abundance, and its nuclear electric quadrupole moment, development of solid-state 43 Ca NMR has been constrained relative to similar nuclides. In this study, 12 commonly-available calcium compounds are analyzed via 43 Ca solid-state NMR and the information which may be obtained by the measurement of both the 43 Ca electric field gradient (EFG) and chemical shift tensors (the latter of which are extremely rare with only a handful of literature examples) is discussed. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations, this 'tensor interplay' is, for the first time for 43 Ca, illustrated to be diagnostic in distinguishing polymorphs (e. g., calcium formate), and the degree of hydration (e. g., CaCl 272 H 2 O and <b>calcium</b> <b>tartrate</b> tetrahydrate). For Ca(OH) 2, we outline the first example of 1 H to 43 Ca cross-polarization on a sample at natural abundance in 43 Ca.

40|$|In Nature, organisms produce {{single-crystal}} composites of calcite crystals with incorporated biomacromolecular matrices. In {{order to}} understand this phenomenon, we have developed a model system of agarose-incorporated calcite single-crystals grown from agarose hydrogels. Annular dark-field {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (ADF-STEM) and electron tomography reveal how random three-dimensional networks of agarose nano-fibers (diameter: 13 ± 5 nm) are incorporated into single-crystals of synthetic calcite by allowing both high- and low-energy fiber/crystal interface facets to satisfy network curvatures. The effects of gel concentration, gel strength, and the concentration of calcium ions on the amount of incorporated polymers have been investigated qualitatively by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantitatively by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The results show that gel-grown calcite crystals have two states: without and with polymer incorporation. Crystals switch from the former state to the latter one when gel strength and/or crystal growth rate increase, suggesting that at the growth fronts there are two competitions: a force competition between a disjoining force, a hydrodynamic force, and the resistance of the gel network and a mass competition between growth fronts screened and unscreened by the gel fibers. The interplay between these two factors determines if the gel polymers are incorporated by the growing crystals. TEM observation shows that agarose/calcite single-crystal composites become porous single-crystals after removal of the incorporated polymers by pyrolysis at 300 oC. The specific surface area (5. 8 m 2 g- 1 for crystals grown from 3 w/v % gels) measured by Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) method is around 100 times higher than that of the non-porous calcite single-crystals with the same size. In addition to calcite, we prepared gel-grown glycine and <b>calcium</b> <b>tartrate</b> single-crystals and found that these two crystals also incorporated gel polymers. These results imply that gel-incorporation might be a general phenomenon for crystallization in gels. This work presents an approach for modifying the internal structures of crystals and synthesizing single-crystal composites and porous single-crystals. Potential uses for the gel method include the preparation of materials that require both high crystallinity and high surface areas such as photovoltaic materials...|$|E
