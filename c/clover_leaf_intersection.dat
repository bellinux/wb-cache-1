40|$|In 1991, {{there has}} been a lot of concern about the <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevil in alfalfa in eastern Nebraska. Many farmers in the eastern one-third of the state {{experienced}} problems with the regrowth of alfalfa after the first cutting in 1990, caused by the feeding of the adult of this insect. This NebFact discusses the difference between the alfalfa weevil and the <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevil and to control them in the field(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} from 1990 through 1992 to determine consumption rates and feeding duration of adult <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils, Hypera punctata (F.), {{to characterize the}} injury potential of this species during alfalfa regrowth. Adults were fed for 29 d in 1990 and 18 d in both 1991 and 1992. The mean cumulative consumption per adult was 27. 2 ± 1. 6 cm 2 and 92. 7 ± 3. 5 mg dry weight in 1991 and 24. 6 ± 0. 9 cm 2 and 87. 5 ± 2. 9 mg dry weight in 1992. The mean cumulative consumption pattern was curvilinear for both dry weight and leaf area consumption. Most consumption was within 11 d of adult eclosion. The peak consumption rate occurred ~ 5 d after adult emergence. Because the highest consumption rates and the greatest percentage of defoliation were within the first 11 d of emergence, adult <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils potentially can delay regrowth of alfalfa stubble when adult emergence coincides with the 1 st harvest. Further, because adult consumption patterns between <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils and alfalfa weevils are similar, alfalfa stubble defoliation thresholds developed for alfalfa weevils and cutworms {{also can be used}} for <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils. Injury equivalents (injury by 1 species in terms of another species) are determined for adult <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> weevils, larval variegated cutworm, Peridroma saucia (Hubner), and larval and adult alfalfa weevils, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) ...|$|R
