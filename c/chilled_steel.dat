An experimental study has been conducted on carbon steel WCC (ASTM A 216 /A 216 M WCC) ball valve body casting using ms chills.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results from}} experiments performed to help understand {{certain aspects of}} the MC- 1 engine prestart thermal conditioning procedure. The procedure was constrained {{by the fact that the}} engine must chill long enough to get quality LOX at the LOX pump inlet but must be short enough to prevent freezing of RP- 1 in the fuel pump. A chill test of an MC- 1 LOX impeller was performed in LN 2 to obtain data on film boiling, transition boiling and impeller temperature histories. The transition boiling data was important to the chill time so a subsequent experiment was performed <b>chilling</b> simple <b>steel</b> plates in LOX to obtain similar data for LOX. To address the fuel freezing concern, two experiments were performed. First, fuel was frozen in a tray and its physical characteristics were observed and temperatures of the fuel were measured. The result was physical characteristics as a function of temperature. Second was an attempt to measure the frozen thickness of RP- 1 on a cold wall submerged in warm RP- 1 and to develop a method for calculating that thickness for other conditions...|$|R

40|$|Unmodified, Na-modified, and Sr-modified {{castings}} of Al- 7 pct Si and Al- 12. 5 pct Si alloys {{were cast}} in molds {{in which it}} was possible to create different cooling conditions. It is shown how solidification influences the distribution of porosity at the surface and the center of the castings as a function of modification and Si content in sand- and chill-cast samples. Eutectic modification, Si content, and cooling conditions have a great impact on the distribution of porosity. Unmodified and Na-modified castings are more easily fed with porosity tending to congregate near the centerline of the casting, while Sr-modified castings solidify in a mushy manner that creates a more homogeneous distribution of porosity in the casting. The amount of porosity was highest in the Sr-modified alloys, lower in the Na-modified alloys, and lowest in the unmodified alloys. The size of the porosity-free layer and the effectiveness of the feeders were greater in the castings made with the <b>steel</b> <b>chills</b> due to the increased thermal gradients and consequent increase in the directionality of solidification...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of composite materials are strongly dependent on micro structural {{parameters of the}} system. The evolution of microstructure depends largely on the cooling rate during phase change. Though the microstructure evolution depends on many process parameters, the final structure is decided by the cooling conditions during solidification. The mold material has a decided effect on the structure formation. The use of end chills during casting not only favors directional solidification but also accelerates solidification. Faster cooling rates give rise to finer structures and improved {{mechanical properties}}. In this work an attempt is made to vary the cooling rate of AL-B 4 C, composite cast using stainless steel, cast iron and copper chills. The microstructure and micro hardness of the chill cast specimens are analyzed and reported. It is observed that the chill material has a significant influence on the microstructure and hardness of the cast specimens. Finer structure and better hardness were observed with the specimens cast using copper chills, whereas, cast iron and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>chills</b> gave rise to coarse structure with reduced hardness...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} {{a surface}} modification technique {{to evaluate the}} mechanical properties like hardness and sliding wear resistance of cast Iron surface used in engineering. Basic sand casting mold was used and a portion of {{it was designed to}} accommodate the external mild <b>steel</b> <b>chill</b> (MSC). Chill accelerates the cooling rate of molten metal which leads to directional solidification. Cooling rate is directly proportional to formation of carbides in the form of iron carbide (Fe 3 C) near the chill end By controlling the flow of liquid nitrogen, the temperature of chills was reduced (upto - 100 °C). Effect of using chills on mechanical properties like hardness and sliding wear resistance was evaluated and analyzed. The present work provides the effective chilling thickness, which gives higher hardness near the chilled surface and a fairly appreciable hardness conducive for a specific wear functional requirement. The mechanical properties of chilled cast iron (CCI) is compared with sub zero chilled cast iron (SZCCI) and normal cast iron without using chill. The present results clearly demonstrates that chilled cast iron has superior sliding wear resistance at the chilled surface, good machinibility away from the chilled end...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of the heat transfer coefficient during casting (between a molten and/or semi-solid material and the mold) is critical {{to be able to}} develop representative mathematical models for casting process such as Twin Roll Casting (TRC). In this project, an experimental apparatus was developed to enable to measurement of the interfacial heat transfer coefficient (HTC) at the interface between a liquid metal as it solidifies against a chill surface. The experimental apparatus consists of a cylinder and piston surrounded by a heater to melt the metal samples. Pressure can be applied {{at the top of the}} piston so that the pressure of the liquid metal at the interface can be varied. The apparatus was instrumented with a number of sensors so that the temperature in both the molten metal and chill surface could be monitored as well as a force sensor so that the interfacial pressure and how it varies during solidification is known. Using the measured temperature time history, the interfacial heat transfer was calculated by using an inverse heat conduction method in conjunction with the known thermo-physical properties of the chill and solidifying metal. The apparatus was tested successfully by using Sn- 7. 5 %Sb- 3. 5 %Cu alloy as the casting metal solidifying against H 13 tool <b>steel</b> <b>chill</b> block. In addition, the effect of different values of chill roughness and test metal superheat were investigated on the heat transfer coefficient...|$|R
40|$|A new multi-zone {{model is}} {{proposed}} that explains how porosity forms in various regions of a casting under different conditions {{and leads to}} distinct zonal differences in pore shape, size and distribution. This model was developed by considering the effect of cooling rate on solidification and distribution of porosity in Al-Si alloys cast as plates in moulds made with silica, ilmenite or zirconia sand cores or <b>steel</b> <b>chills</b> facing the major plate faces. The alloys cast were Al- 7 wt. % Si and Al- 12. 5 wt. % Si in unmodified and modified forms, the latter with either Na or Sr addition. It is found that, regardless of cooling condition, Si content and modification treatment, the microstructure {{can be divided into}} three zones of varying size (across the casting thickness) that are determined by the local cooling conditions and the nucleation and growth mode of the Al-Si eutectic. The zones are: (1) an outer shell-like zone where directional columnar dendritic grains and a fine-celled, coherent eutectic form a low-porosity shell at the casting surface; (2) a transitional zone where equiaxed, eutectic cells grow between columnar dendritic grains and irregular pores become trapped in the mush; and finally (3) a central zone where the thermal gradient is low and equiaxed dendritic grains and eutectic cells grow at the centre of the casting and larger, rounded pores tend to form. The paper discusses how Si content, modification type and cooling conditions influence the location and size (i. e. depth) of each of these zones and how the distribution of porosity is thus affected...|$|R
