40|$|Thirteen of {{the most}} common lepidopteran-specific <b>Cry</b> {{proteins}} of Bacillus thuringiensis have been tested for their efficacy against newly hatched larvae of two populations of the spiny bollworm, Earias insulana. At a concentration of 100 μg of toxin per milliliter of artificial diet, six <b>Cry</b> toxins (<b>Cry</b> 1 Ca, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ea, <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ja, <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa, and <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab) were not toxic at all. <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ja, and <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth. The other <b>Cry</b> toxins (<b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, <b>Cry</b> 1 Da, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, and <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca) were toxic to E. insulana larvae. The 50 % lethal concentration values of these toxins ranged from 0. 39 to 21. 13 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca and <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, respectively) for an E. insulana laboratory colony originating from Egypt and from 0. 20 to 4. 25 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca and <b>Cry</b> 1 Da, respectively) for a laboratory colony originating from Spain. The relative potencies of the toxins in the population from Egypt were highest for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca and <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, and they were both significantly more toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac and <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, followed by <b>Cry</b> 1 Da and finally <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia. In the population from Spain, <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca was the most toxic, followed in decreasing order by <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac and <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, and the least toxic was <b>Cry</b> 1 Da.

Competition binding experiments among these toxins showed that only <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab and <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac competed for the same binding sites, indicating a high possibility that this insect may develop cross-resistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab upon exposure to <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac transgenic cotton but not to the other toxins tested...|$|R
40|$|Mexico {{is located}} in a {{transition}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical biogeographical regions and contains a rich and unique biodiversity. A total of 496 Bacillus thuringiensis strains were isolated from 503 soil samples collected from the five macroregions of the country. The characterization of the strain collection provided useful information on the ecological patterns of distribution of B. thuringiensis and opportunities for the selection of strains to develop novel bioinsecticidal products. The analysis of the strains was based on multiplex PCR with novel general and specific primers that could detect the <b>cry</b> 1, <b>cry</b> 3, <b>cry</b> 5, <b>cry</b> 7, <b>cry</b> 8, <b>cry</b> 9, <b>cry</b> 11, <b>cry</b> 12, <b>cry</b> 13, <b>cry</b> 14, <b>cry</b> 21, and cyt genes. The proteins belonging to the <b>Cry</b> 1 and <b>Cry</b> 9 groups are toxic for lepidopteran insects. The <b>Cry</b> 3, <b>Cry</b> 7, and <b>Cry</b> 8 proteins are active against coleopteran insects. The <b>Cry</b> 5, <b>Cry</b> 12, <b>Cry</b> 13, and <b>Cry</b> 14 proteins are nematocidal. The <b>Cry</b> 11, <b>Cry</b> 21, and Cyt proteins are toxic for dipteran insects. Six pairs of general primers are used in this method. Strains for which unique PCR product profiles were obtained with the general primers were further characterized by additional PCRs with specific primers. Strains containing <b>cry</b> 1 genes were the most abundant in our collection (49. 5 %). Thirty-three different <b>cry</b> 1 -type profiles were identified. B. thuringiensis strains harboring <b>cry</b> 3 genes represented 21. 5 % of the strains, and 7. 9 % of the strains contained <b>cry</b> 11 and cyt genes. <b>cry</b> 7, <b>cry</b> 8, and <b>cry</b> 9 genes were found in 0. 6, 2. 4, and 2. 6 % of the strains, respectively. No strains carrying <b>cry</b> 5, <b>cry</b> 12, <b>cry</b> 13, <b>cry</b> 14, or <b>cry</b> 21 genes were found. Finally, 14 % of the strains did not give any PCR product and did not react with any polyclonal antisera. Our results indicate the presence of strains that may harbor potentially novel <b>Cry</b> proteins as well as strains with combinations of less frequently observed <b>cry</b> genes...|$|R

40|$|Transgenic corn {{expressing the}} Bacillus thuringiensis <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab gene is highly insecticidal to Ostrinia nubilalis (European corn borer) larvae. We ascertained whether <b>Cry</b> 1 F, <b>Cry</b> 9 C, or <b>Cry</b> 9 E recognizes the <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab binding {{site on the}} O. nubilalis brush border by three approaches. An optical {{biosensor}} technology based on surface plasmon resonance measured binding of brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) injected over a surface of immobilized <b>Cry</b> toxin. Preincubation with <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab reduced BBMV binding to immobilized <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, whereas preincubation with <b>Cry</b> 1 F, <b>Cry</b> 9 C, or <b>Cry</b> 9 E did not inhibit BBMV binding. BBMV binding to a <b>Cry</b> 1 F-coated surface was reduced when vesicles were preincubated in <b>Cry</b> 1 F or <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab but not <b>Cry</b> 9 C or <b>Cry</b> 9 E. A radioligand approach measured 125 I-Cry 1 Ab toxin binding to BBMV {{in the presence of}} homologous (<b>Cry</b> 1 Ab) and heterologous (<b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 1 F, <b>Cry</b> 9 C, or <b>Cry</b> 9 E) toxins. Unlabeled <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac effectively competed for 125 I-Cry 1 Ab binding in a manner comparable to <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab itself. Unlabeled <b>Cry</b> 9 C and <b>Cry</b> 9 E toxins did not inhibit 125 I-Cry 1 Ab binding to BBMV. <b>Cry</b> 1 F inhibited 125 I-Cry 1 Ab binding at concentrations greater than 500 nM. <b>Cry</b> 1 F had low-level affinity for the <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab binding site. Ligand blot analysis identified <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, and <b>Cry</b> 1 F binding proteins in BBMV. The major <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab signals on ligand blots were at 145 kDa and 154 kDa, but a strong signal was present at 220 kDa and a weak signal was present at 167 kDa. <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac and <b>Cry</b> 1 F binding proteins were detected at 220 and 154 kDa. Anti-Manduca sexta aminopeptidase serum recognized proteins of 145, 154, and 167 kDa, and anti-cadherin serum recognized the 220 kDa protein. We speculate that isoforms of aminopeptidase and cadherin in the brush border membrane serve as <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, and <b>Cry</b> 1 F binding proteins...|$|R
40|$|We tested toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis against larvae from susceptible, <b>Cry</b> 1 C-resistant, and <b>Cry</b> 1 Aresistant {{strains of}} diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). The <b>Cry</b> 1 C-resistant strain, which {{was derived from}} a field {{population}} that had evolved resistance to B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki and B. thuringiensis subsp. aizawai, was selected repeatedly with <b>Cry</b> 1 C in the laboratory. The <b>Cry</b> 1 C-resistant strain had strong crossresistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, and <b>Cry</b> 1 F, low to moderate cross-resistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa and <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca, and no cross-resistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 Bb, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ja, and <b>Cry</b> 2 A. Resistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 C declined when selection was relaxed. Together with previously reported data, the new data on the cross-resistance of a <b>Cry</b> 1 C-resistant strain reported here suggest that resistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 A and <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins confers little or no cross-resistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 Bb, <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa, or <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca. Therefore, these toxins might be useful in rotations or combinations with <b>Cry</b> 1 A and <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins. <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca was much more potent than <b>Cry</b> 1 Bb or <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa and thus might be especially useful against diamondback moth.

40|$|First {{generation}} of insect-protected transgenic corn (Bt-corn) {{was based on}} the expression of <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab or <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa proteins. Currently, the trend is the combination of two or more genes expressing proteins that bind to different targets. In addition to broadening the spectrum of action, this strategy helps to delay the evolution of resistance in exposed insect populations. One of such examples is the combination of <b>Cry</b> 1 A. 105 with <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa and <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab to control O. nubilalis and S. frugiperda. <b>Cry</b> 1 A. 105 is a chimeric protein with domains I and II and the C-terminal half of the protein from <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, and domain III almost identical to <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the chimeric <b>Cry</b> 1 A. 105 has shared binding sites either with <b>Cry</b> 1 A proteins, with <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa, or with both, in O. nubilalis and in S. frugiperda. Brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from last instar larval midguts were used in competition binding assays with (125) I-labeled <b>Cry</b> 1 A. 105, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, and <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa, and unlabeled <b>Cry</b> 1 A. 105, <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa, <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab and <b>Cry</b> 2 Ae. The results showed that <b>Cry</b> 1 A. 105, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac and <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa competed with high affinity for the same binding sites in both insect species. However, <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab and <b>Cry</b> 2 Ae did not compete for the binding sites of <b>Cry</b> 1 proteins. Therefore, according to our results, the development of cross-resistance among <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab/Ac, <b>Cry</b> 1 A. 105, and <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa proteins is possible in these two insect species if the alteration of shared binding sites occurs. Conversely, cross-resistance between these proteins and <b>Cry</b> 2 A proteins is very unlikely in such case...|$|R

NO-QA showed high levels of resistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, and <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac and high levels of cross-resistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 F, <b>Cry</b> 1 J, and H 04. Cross-resistance was low or nil to <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, <b>Cry</b> 1 Bb, <b>Cry</b> 1 C, <b>Cry</b> 1 D, <b>Cry</b> 1 I, and <b>Cry</b> 2 A. <b>Cry</b> 1 E and <b>Cry</b> 2 B showed little or no toxicity to susceptible or resistant larvae. In dendrograms based on levels of amino acid sequence similarity among proteins, <b>Cry</b> 1 F and <b>Cry</b> 1 J clustered together with <b>Cry</b> 1 A proteins for domain II, but not for domain I or III. High levels of cross-resistance to <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab-Cry 1 C hybrid H 04 show that although <b>Cry</b> 1 C is toxic to NO-QA, domain III of <b>Cry</b> 1 C is not sufficient to restore toxicity when it is combined with domains I and II of <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab. Thus, diamondback moth strain NO-QA cross-resistance extends beyond the <b>Cry</b> 1 A family of proteins to at least two other families that exhibit high levels of amino sequence similarity with <b>Cry</b> 1 A in domain II (<b>Cry</b> 1 F and <b>Cry</b> 1 J) and to a protein that is identical to <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab in domain II (H 04).

40|$|Insecticidal {{activity}} and receptor binding properties of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins to yellow and striped rice stem borers (Sciropophaga incertulas and Chilo suppresalis, respectively) were investigated. Yellow stem borer (YSB) was susceptible to <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, and <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins with similar toxicities. To striped stem borer (SSB), <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, and <b>Cry</b> 1 C were more toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa toxin. Binding assays were performed with (sup 125) I-labeled toxins (<b>Cry</b> 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, and <b>Cry</b> 1 C) and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) prepared from YSB and SSB midguts. Both <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa and <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac toxins showed saturable, high-affinity binding to YSB BBMV. <b>Cry</b> 2 A and <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins bound to YSB BBMV with relatively low binding affinity but with high binding site concentration. To SSB, both <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa and <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac exhibited high binding affinity, although these toxins are less toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 C and <b>Cry</b> 2 A. <b>Cry</b> 1 C and <b>Cry</b> 2 A toxins bound to SSB BBMV with relatively low binding affinity but with high binding site concentration. Heterologous competition binding assays {{were performed to}} investigate the binding site cross-reactivity. The results showed that <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa and <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac recognize the same binding site, which {{is different from the}} <b>Cry</b> 2 A or <b>Cry</b> 1 C binding site in YSB and SSB. These data suggest that development of multitoxin systems in transgenic rice with toxin combinations which recognize different binding sites may be useful in implementing deployment strategies that decrease the rate of pest adaptation to B. thuringiensis toxin-expressing rice varieties...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bacillus thuringiensis <b>Cry</b> toxins {{are used}} {{worldwide}} {{in the control}} of different insect pests important in agriculture or in human health. The <b>Cry</b> proteins are pore-forming toxins that affect the midgut cell of target insects. It was shown that non-toxic <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab helix a- 4 mutants had a dominant negative (DN) phenotype inhibiting the toxicity of wildtype <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab when used in equimolar or sub-stoichiometric ratios (1 : 1, 0. 5 : 1, mutant:wt) indicating that oligomer formation is a key step in toxicity of <b>Cry</b> toxins. Methodology/Principal Findings: The DN <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab-D 136 N/T 143 D mutant that is able to block toxicity of <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab toxin, was used to analyze its capacity to block the activity against Manduca sexta larvae of other <b>Cry</b> 1 toxins, such as <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ca, <b>Cry</b> 1 Da, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ea and <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa. <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab-DN mutant inhibited toxicity of <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac and <b>Cry</b> 1 Fa. In addition, we isolated mutants in helix a- 4 of <b>Cry</b> 4 Ba and <b>Cry</b> 11 Aa, and demonstrate that <b>Cry</b> 4 Ba-E 159 K and <b>Cry</b> 11 Aa-V 142 D are inactive and completely block the toxicity against Aedes aegypti of both wildtype toxins, when used at sub-stoichiometric ratios, confirming a DN phenotype. As controls we analyzed <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab-R 99 A or <b>Cry</b> 11 Aa-E 97 A mutants that are located in helix a- 3 and are affected in toxin oligomerization. These mutants do not show a DN phenotype but were able to block toxicity when used in 10 : 1 or 100 : 1 ratios (mutant:wt) probably by competition of binding with toxin receptors. Conclusions/Significance: We show that DN phenotype can be observed among different <b>Cry</b> toxins suggesting that ma...|$|R
40|$|One hundred twenty one {{isolates}} of Bacillus thuringiensis {{were isolated}} from 91 soil samples {{collected in the}} national park and wildlife sanctuary in Krabi province. All isolates of B. thuringiensis were tested for their insecticidal activity against Spodoptera litura, S. exigua and Plutella xylostella larvae. Seven isolates of B. thuringiensis named JCPT 7, JCPT 16, JCPT 18, JCPT 64, JCPT 68, JCPT 74 and JCPT 89 exhibited toxic activities against the insects, more than 90 % mortality. The detection of <b>cry</b> gene of these isolates was done by a method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR result indicated that <b>cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>cry</b> 1 C, <b>cry</b> 1 D, <b>cry</b> 1 I, <b>cry</b> 9 A, <b>cry</b> 9 B and <b>cry</b> 2 A were on chromosomal DNA and <b>cry</b> 1 Aa, <b>cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>cry</b> 1 Ac, <b>cry</b> 1 C, <b>cry</b> 1 D, <b>cry</b> 1 I and <b>cry</b> 2 A were on plasmid DNA. This study has introduced the promising B. thuringiensis isolates collected from soil samples which could be developed as an effective biocontrol agent for Lepidopterous pest...|$|R
