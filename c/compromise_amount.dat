40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{compared}} bone regeneration following guided bone regeneration {{with two}} bioabsorbable collagen membranes in saddle-type bone defects in dog mandibles. METHODS: Three standardized defects were created, filled with bone chips and deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM), and covered by three different methods: control = no membrane; test 1 = collagen membrane; and test 2 = cross-linked collagen membrane (CCM). Each {{side of the}} mandible was allocated {{to one of two}} healing periods (8 or 16 weeks). The histomorphometric analysis assessed the percentage of bone, soft tissue, and DBBM in the regenerate; the absolute area in square millimeters of the bone regenerate; and the distance in millimeters {{from the bottom of the}} defect to the highest point of the regenerate. RESULTS: In the 8 -week healing group, two dehiscences occurred with CCM. After 8 weeks, all treatment modalities showed no significant differences in the percentage of bone regenerate. After 16 weeks, the percentage of bone had increased for all treatment modalities without significant differences. For all groups, the defect fill height increased between weeks 8 and 16. The CCM group showed a statistically significant (P = 0. 0202) increase over time and the highest value of all treatment modalities after 16 weeks of healing, CONCLUSIONS: The CCM showed a limited beneficial effect on bone regeneration in membrane-protected defects in dog mandibles when healing was uneventful. The observed premature membrane exposures resulted in severely <b>compromised</b> <b>amounts</b> of bone regenerate.

We present two solutions for protecting directory services information from insider attacks. The first is a centralized approach utilizing a customized virtual directory server. The second is a distributed approach using existing key management infrastructure and a new component called a Personal Virtual Directory Service.

We also show how impact to existing users, client applications, and directory services are minimized, and how we prevent insider attacks from revealing protected data. We compare and contrast both solutions, including potential tradeoffs, administrative overhead, and enterprise systems impact.

40|$|Abstract. Random number {{generators}} (RNGs) play {{a crucial}} role in many cryptographic schemes and proto-cols, but their security proof usually assumes that their internal state is initialized with truly random seeds and remains secret at all times. However, in many practical situations these are unrealistic assumptions: The seed is often gathered after a reset/reboot from low entropy external events such as the timing of manual key presses, and the state can be compromised at unknown points in time via side channels or penetration attacks. The usual remedy (used by all the major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS, iOS, etc.) is to periodically replenish the internal state through an auxiliary input with additional randomness harvested from the environment. However, recovering from such attacks in a provably correct and computationally optimal way had remained an unsolved challenge so far. In this paper we formalize the problem of designing an efficient recovery mechanism from state compromise, by considering it as an online optimization problem. If we knew the timing of the last <b>compromise</b> and the <b>amount</b> of entropy gathered since then, we could stop producing any outputs until the state becomes truly random again. However, our challenge is to recover within a time proportional to this optimal solution even in the hardest (and most realistic) case in which (a) we know nothing about the timing of the last state <b>compromise,</b> and the <b>amount</b> of new entropy injected since then into the state, and (b) any premature production of output...|$|R

On the other hand, the hypervisor revokes resources from the VM whose calculated resources load and actual resources load do not match (line 6 - 7). This dissimilarity, in most cases, is either because the VM has lied about its declared metrics, or because the VM has been <b>compromised.</b> The <b>amount</b> of resources revoked from the VM can {{be decided by the}} system administrator, who clearly knows the real impact of adjusting the VM’s resources on their performance.

This encourages VMs to truthfully declare their metrics used to calculate the resources load.|$|R
