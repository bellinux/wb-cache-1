If an archaeoastronomer <b>can</b> <b>calculate</b> from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice.

5|$|Another {{study in}} July 2017 by Miriam Hirt et al., {{published}} in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the top speed of Tyrannosaurus was around 17mph (27km/h). Other dinosaurs including Triceratops, Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus were also analyzed in the study, as were many living animals like elephants, cheetahs and rabbits. The speed of Tyrannosaurus was calculated by factoring its weight in conjunction with the medium upon which it travelled (in the case of the theropod, land) and by the assumptions that: one; animals reach their maximum speeds during comparatively short sprints, and two; Newton's laws of motion dictate that mass has to overcome inertia. It found that large animals like Tyrannosaurus exhaust their energy reserves long before they reach their theoretical top speed, resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and speed. The equation <b>can</b> <b>calculate</b> the top speed of an animal with almost 90% accuracy and can be applied to both living and extinct animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry is a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory. In the A-model of topological string theory, physically interesting quantities are {{expressed in terms of}} infinitely many numbers called Gromov–Witten invariants, which are extremely difficult to compute. In the B-model, the calculations can be reduced to classical integrals and are much easier. By applying mirror symmetry, theorists can translate difficult calculations in the A-model into equivalent but technically easier calculations in the B-model. These calculations are then used to determine the probabilities of various physical processes in string theory. Mirror symmetry can be combined with other dualities to translate calculations in one theory into equivalent calculations in a different theory. By outsourcing calculations to different theories in this way, theorists <b>can</b> <b>calculate</b> quantities that are impossible to calculate without the use of dualities.|$|E
