5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the top}} of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from {{the top of the}} furnace. The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich <b>combustion</b> <b>gases</b> is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the <b>combustion</b> <b>gases</b> and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|E

The turret's sprinkling system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion, but the water leaked into the turret's electrical switchboard and started a small fire that was easily put out. Due to the navy's limited budget, the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel-saving measure. In Fiscal Year 1936–37, the ship was anchored for 267 days; the following year it was in port for 255 days. The ship {{spent the rest of}} her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTorrefaction is a mild {{thermochemical}} {{treatment of biomass}} between 473 - 573 K in inert atmosphere. The poor economic feasibility of torrefaction due to continuous supply of inert gas hinders the commercialization of this technology. The present study investigates torrefaction of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) in a vertical tubular reactor under the presence of <b>gas</b> from charcoal <b>combustion.</b> The <b>combustion</b> <b>gas</b> consisted of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, carbon monoxide and hydrogen at percentages of 75. 5, 16. 4, 4. 0, 3. 5 and 0. 3 vol%, respectively. In the present study, the thermal energy generated through charcoal combustion was directly utilized for torrefaction of EFB. Torrefaction experiment was carried out at 461 – 494 K for 30 min. The mass and energy yields and properties of torrefied biomass were investigated. Torrefaction {{in the presence of}} <b>combustion</b> <b>gas</b> resulted in an increase in the energy density and carbon content of torrefied EFB.

25|$|The Woolnough {{design was}} used by Sentinel for their larger railway locomotives. It resembled most other three-drum designs, having almost-straight tubes. Its {{distinguishing}} feature was a firebrick wall {{two-thirds of the way}} down the furnace. The furnace grate was on the longer side of this, with the <b>combustion</b> <b>gases</b> passing out through the tube bank, along inside a steel outer casing, then back within the shorter tube bank. Coiled tube superheaters were placed in the gas flow outside the tubes. The <b>combustion</b> <b>gases</b> thus passed through the tube bank twice, once outwards and then again inwards. A single central chimney exhausted from the centre of the far end, not as usual from outside the tubes. The relative temperature difference between gas passage through the two sections of the bank led to a circulation current that was upwards through the first, hotter, part of the bank and downwards through the further, less hot, bank. Circulation was also controlled by an internal weir plate within the upper water drum, so as to keep a depth of water above the ends of the hotter tubes, thus avoiding overheating of dry tubes.|$|E
25|$|The heat source, {{contained}} within the firebox, is the energy released by the combustion, typically of a solid or liquid fuel, creating a by-product of hot <b>combustion</b> <b>gases.</b> If wood, coal or coke is used as the combustion material it is introduced through a door, typically by a fireman, onto a set of grates where ashes fall away from the burning fuel. If oil is used as the fuel, a door allows adjusting of the air flow, maintenance and access for cleaning the oil jets.|$|E
25|$|At {{the front}} of the boiler is the smokebox, into which used exhaust steam is {{injected}} to increase the draught of smoke and <b>combustion</b> <b>gases</b> through the fire tubes in the boiler and out through the chimney. The search for thermal efficiency greater than that of the typical fire-tube boiler led such engineers as Nigel Gresley to consider innovations such as the water-tube boiler. Although he tested the concept on the LNER Class W1, the difficulties during development exceeded the will to solve the efficiency problem at the time.|$|E
40|$|It is very {{important}} to accurately predict the gas pressure, gas and solid temperature, as well as the amount of O-ring erosion inside the space shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) joints {{in the event of a}} leak path. The scenarios considered are typically hot <b>combustion</b> <b>gas</b> rapid pressurization events of small volumes through narrow and restricted flow paths. The ideal method for this prediction is a transient three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation with a computational domain including both <b>combustion</b> <b>gas</b> and surrounding solid regions. However, this has not yet been demonstrated to be economical for this application due to the enormous amount of CPU time and memory resulting from the relatively long fill time as well as the large pressure and temperature rising rate. Consequently, all CFD applications in RSRM joints so far are steady-state simulations with solid regions being excluded from the computational domain by assuming either a constant wall temperature or no heat transfer between the hot <b>combustion</b> <b>gas</b> and cool solid walls...|$|R

25|$|The {{method by}} which Glock barrels are rifled is {{somewhat}} unusual; instead of using a traditional broaching machine to cut the rifling into the bore, the Glock process involves beating a slowly rotating mandrel through the bore to obtain the hexagonal or octagonal shape. As a result, the barrel's thickness {{in the area of}} each groove is not compromised as with conventional square-cut barrels. This has the advantage of providing a better gas seal behind the projectile as the bore has a slightly smaller diameter, which translates into more efficient use of the <b>combustion</b> <b>gases</b> trapped behind the bullet, slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities, and increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the {{combustion}} of propellant in the rocket engine {{is to increase the}} velocity of the resulting gases to very high speeds, hence producing a thrust. Initially, the gases of combustion are sent in every direction, but only those that produce a net thrust have any effect. The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, it pushes upward against the top of the rocket engine's combustion chamber. As the <b>combustion</b> <b>gases</b> approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they increase in speed. The {{effect of the}} convergent part of the rocket engine nozzle on the high pressure fluid of <b>combustion</b> <b>gases,</b> is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas (Bernoulli's principle or conservation of energy) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the German {{practice}} of sliding block breeches {{that required a}} metallic cartridge case to seal the gun's chamber against <b>combustion</b> <b>gases,</b> Škoda preferred to use an interrupted screw breech with a deBange obdurator to seal the chamber. This lowered the rate of fire, but had the great economic advantage of allowing bagged propellant charges that didn't use scarce brass or steel cartridge case when those metals were in short supply. The other unusual feature of the gun was that it used a monobloc auto-frettaged barrel. This was {{a single piece of}} steel that was radially expanded under hydraulic pressure. This had the advantage of placing the steel of the barrel under compression, which helped it resist the stresses of firing and was simpler and faster to build since the barrel didn't require assembly as with more traditional construction techniques.|$|E

25|$|Thousands of coal {{fires are}} burning around the world. Those burning {{underground}} {{can be difficult}} to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their <b>combustion</b> <b>gases</b> are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires. Coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a mine fire or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire. Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO2, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO2 from fossil fuels. In Centralia, Pennsylvania (a borough located in the Coal Region of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned anthracite strip mine pit. Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and it continues to burn underground to this day.
