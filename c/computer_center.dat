5|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized <b>computer</b> <b>center</b> based on an Internet Protocol structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; and the radio net, which consists of base stations with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s by Viggo Kann, Kimmo Eriksson and Olle Johansson, three children who had played the game Adventure and wanted to create a similar game in Swedish. The Cottage began as a collection of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own, with the player moving through an amusement arcade to choose what to play; as they found it more fun to move through the arcade than to play the games, they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games. Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold; despite this, the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre-paid royalties. The game had a cult-like status among Oden users at the time, and was commercially important to the <b>computer</b> <b>center</b> in Stockholm.|$|E

40|$|Our country's {{computer}} {{potential is}} increasing {{at a rapid}} rate. Our aggregate computer capacities increased more than fourfold under the Tenth Five-Year Plan compared with the preceding five-year plan. There was a concurrent {{increase in the number}} of <b>computer</b> <b>centers</b> as the major organizational form in which computers are used. <b>Computer</b> <b>centers</b> (which now number almost 4, 000) have become mass-type organizations. The majority of them serve the more than 5, 000 automated control systems of different classes and designations. Under the last five-year plan, a number of branches in the national economy allocated up to 3 % of the capital investments in the development of the branch for the formation of <b>computer</b> <b>centers</b> and automated control systems. Quantitative growth is accompanied by the concentration and centralization of the computerized production of information, by its integration, by the creation of group and collectively used <b>computer</b> <b>centers</b> based on large multicomputer complexes. ...|$|R

Harvard placed restrictions on the computer's use, and Gates and Allen had to use a commercial time share computer in Boston to finalize the software.|$|E

ECC installed a new supercomputing system in late 2009 with a disk storage capacity of 1,050 terabytes (i.e, exceeding one petabyte), the largest storage installation in Saudi Aramco's history to support its exploration in the frontier areas and the Red Sea.|$|E
