5|$|Despite its aims, the <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> {{in large}} part {{responsible}} for {{the ease with which}} the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as deportation of workers to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the persecution of Jews. In particular, encouraging the Germans to delegate tasks to the Committee meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, the <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> always at a disadvantage during negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Randall left {{no doubt}} about his sympathies when he {{assigned}} members to the committee, stacking it with Hayes's enemies from both parties. The committee's investigation had {{the opposite of the}} Democrats' intended effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The Pelton telegrams were in code, which the <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but the <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.|$|E
