25|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1970 the UNP suffered a major defeat, when the SLFP and its newly formed coalition of leftist parties won almost 2/3 of the parliamentary seats. Once again elected to parliament J. R. Jayewardene took over as opposition leader and de facto leader of the UNP due to the ill health of Dudley Senanayake. After Senanayake's death in 1973, Jayewardene succeeded him as UNP leader. He gave the SLFP government his fullest support during the 1971 JVP Insurrection (even though his son was arrested by the police without charges) and in 1972 when the new constitution was enacted proclaiming Ceylon a republic. However he opposed the government in many moves, which he saw as short sighted and damaging for the country's economy in the long run. These included the adaptation of the <b>closed</b> <b>economy</b> and nationalization of many private business and lands. In 1976 he resigned from his seat in parliament in protest, when the government used its large majority in parliament to extend {{the duration of the}} government by two more years {{at the end of its}} six-year term without holding a general election or a referendum requesting public approval.|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{the paradox}} assumes a <b>closed</b> <b>economy</b> in which savings are not {{invested}} abroad (to fund exports of local production abroad). Thus, while the paradox may hold {{at the global}} level, it need not hold at the local or national level: if one nation increases savings, this can be offset by trading partners consuming a greater amount relative to their own production, i.e., if the saving nation increases exports, and its partners increase imports. This criticism is not very controversial, and is generally accepted by Keynesian economists as well, who {{refer to it as}} [...] "exporting one's way out of a recession". They further note that this frequently occurs in concert with currency devaluation (hence increasing exports and decreasing imports), and cannot work as a solution to a global problem, because the global economy is a closed system – not every nation can increase net exports.|$|E

40|$|Using a two-sector {{endogenous}} growth model, {{the speed of}} convergence is determined primarily by the gap in rates of return between physical and human capital. In <b>closed</b> <b>economies,</b> for a typical situation of having relatively less physical capital than in a steady state, the return on physical capital will be significantly high, whereas the return on human capital will be relatively low. This gap in rates of return is quite large {{when the economy is}} not at its steady state. In open economies, where human capital is nontradable, the gap in rates of return is small, as is the gap between the international interest rate (which is less than the <b>closed</b> <b>economies</b> return on physical capital) and the return on human capital. Convergence in open economies will be relatively slow, and convergence in <b>closed</b> <b>economies</b> will be relatively fast, and therefore there is little gain from financial liberalization.

30|$|The open economies {{scenario}} {{assumes that}} the growth of worker productivity will be higher than that in the business-as-usual scenario, while for the <b>closed</b> <b>economies</b> scenario {{it is assumed that}} up to 2035 worker productivity growth will be 0 % per annum. The rationale for these assumptions is that the open economies scenario assumes that GDP growth is realized mainly by worker productivity growth and much less by growth of numbers of job vacancies. For the <b>closed</b> <b>economies</b> scenario, we assume the opposite. The case of Algeria is a special one as worker productivity growth has been at very low levels in the past, while, periodically, considerable GDP growth was realized. This was the result of labour market interventions of the government creating more jobs to reduce the exodus of male residents in search for a job abroad (Furceri 2012). Contrary to the situation in other countries, recent trends in GDP and worker productivity growth of Algeria, basis for the business-as-usual assumptions, closely resemble assumptions of the <b>closed</b> <b>economies</b> scenario. This is reflected in similar assumptions about future trends in these indicators.|$|R

40|$|In {{choosing}} an exchange rate regime {{for a small}} open economy, the common wisdom (Fried-man (1953), Meade (1950)) calls for a floating regime to outperform a peg because of {{the ability of the}} former to cope with relative price changes without major output effects. With balance sheet effects in mind, doubts have been raised about it, though. I test for this, using a near VAR approach. The 32 country sample for the period 1980 - 2001 was split according to the degree of openness of the economy. The results show that for relatively open economies the common wisdom holds; on the contrary, for relatively <b>closed</b> <b>economies</b> it does not.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a political economy {{explanation for the}} occurrence of fiscal consolidation {{by looking at the}} distributional effects of preceding real exchange rate depreciations across and within countries. Existing studies show that successful fiscal consolidation episodes tend to be preceded by downwards exchange rate movements (Giavazzi and Pagano 1990; Hjelm 2002; Lambertini and Tavares 2005). We show that the mechanism through which this happens differs across open and <b>closed</b> <b>economies.</b> In the former, there is a “good-times effect” following depreciation that induces the public to accept fiscal reform {{in the form of a}} social pact that contains budgetary provisions, provided it has similar distributional implications. By contrast, in <b>closed</b> <b>economies,</b> real depreciations impact differently on different socio-economic groups. That way, they open up room for a political exchange between competing interests that is likely to lead to a social pact and to fiscal reform, the wider its distributional implications.

This procedure preserves the role played by foreign nominal frictions in the way as international monetary policy shocks are conveyed into the small domestic economy. Using the Bayesian approach, the small-economy case is estimated with Brazilian data and impulse-response functions are build to analyse the dynamic effects of structural shocks. ...|$|R
