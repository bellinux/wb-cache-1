5|$|During the <b>company-wide</b> {{crossover}} Infinite Crisis (2005), Oracle {{teams with}} the Martian Manhunter in Metropolis to coordinate a counterstrike against the Secret Society's global jailbreak. The renewed romance between Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson is also {{cut short by}} the Infinite Crisis storyline.|$|E
5|$|Coca-Cola {{promoted}} Odwalla {{products in}} 2006 {{when the company}} aimed at removing carbonated soda products in schools. Odwalla continued to have good growth in 2007, when Coca-Cola, squeezed by poor growth in its North American markets, issued a <b>company-wide</b> hiring freeze; Odwalla, because of its good performance, {{was one of the}} few exceptions to the rule.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>company-wide</b> {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial {{prototype}} received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools entered {{development}} in August 2005 under the code name White Engine. It {{was intended for}} the then PlayStation 3-exclusive role-playing game Final Fantasy XIII. The decision to expand Crystal Tools' compatibility to other game projects and systems marked the official project start for a <b>company-wide</b> engine. Development {{was carried out by}} the Research and Development Division headed by Taku Murata, which was specifically established for this purpose. As Square Enix's biggest project to date, the creation of Crystal Tools caused substantial problems in the simultaneous production of several flagship titles; various critics cited the engine as the primary cause of significant delays in the release of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E
5|$|After a long hiatus, Batwoman was reintroduced to DC {{continuity}} in 2006 {{in the seventh}} week of the publisher's year-long 52 weekly comic book. Reintroduced as Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman began operating in Gotham City in Batman's absence following {{the events of the}} <b>company-wide</b> crossover Infinite Crisis (2005). The modern Batwoman is written as being of Jewish descent and as a lesbian in an effort by DC editorial staff to diversify its publications and better connect to modern-day readership. Described as the highest-profile gay superhero to appear in stories published by DC, Batwoman's sexual orientation drew wide media attention following her reintroduction, as well as both praise and criticism from the general public.|$|E
5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a <b>company-wide</b> engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|The troubled {{development}} of Final Fantasy XIII {{that had been}} caused by the simultaneous creation of the <b>company-wide</b> engine Crystal Tools gave reason to rethink the production process for high-budget games at Square Enix. For Final Fantasy XIII-2, the team consulted the European subsidiary Eidos to more closely adapt a Western approach to game development. As a consequence, monthly schedules and project milestones were introduced to better monitor the staff members' progress. Furthermore, unlike its predecessor, Final Fantasy XIII-2 was not entirely developed in-house; Japanese studio tri-Ace was contracted to help out with aspects of the game design, art and programming. This was done to keep the number of internal staff members on the game lower. The contributions of external developers were planned and clearly divided beforehand to achieve a more structured team organization. Concept videos and frequent test playing during production helped constantly engage the staff and keep to the original vision of the game.|$|E
5|$|Following the public's {{positive}} {{reaction to the}} graphics of the Final Fantasy VII Technical Demo for PS3 presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2005, {{it was decided to}} release the role-playing video game Final Fantasy XIII on the PlayStation 3 rather than the PlayStation 2 as originally planned. In August 2005, the Technology Division began working on the White Engine, a PlayStation 3 engine {{that was supposed to be}} exclusively used for Final Fantasy XIII. Eight months later, however, it was decided to repurpose the engine to further make it compatible with other projects such as the action RPG Final Fantasy Versus XIII (later rebranded and repurposed into Final Fantasy XV) and the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Final Fantasy XIV. In order for the company to stay competitive in a multi-platform environment, support of the engine was extended from the PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, both of which were successful in Western markets. This marked the official development start of a <b>company-wide</b> engine for whose purpose the Technology Division was expanded into the Research and Development Division in September 2006. Murata remained the division's general manager with a full-time staff at his disposal.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} <b>company-wide</b> {{narrative}} {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to listen and continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end that type of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, {{the revival}} of the Justice Society in JSA allowed the {{character}} to be reworked again. In addition to appearing in JSA, DC published a self-titled, five-issue limited series in 2003. The character was killed in the Day of Vengeance limited series in 2005 as part of the lead in to the 2005 <b>company-wide</b> event story, Infinite Crisis.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his time}} at Marvel, Byrne was hired by DC Comics to revamp its {{flagship}} character Superman. This was part of a <b>company-wide</b> restructuring {{of the history of the}} DC Universe and all of its characters following the limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. Byrne's reworking of Superman in particular gained widespread media coverage outside the comic book industry, including articles in Time and The New York Times.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{functional}} units often {{perform with}} a high level of efficiency, their level of cooperation with each other is sometimes compromised. Such groups may have difficulty working well with each other as they may be territorial and unwilling to cooperate. The occurrence of infighting among units may cause delays, reduced commitment due to competing interests, and wasted time, making projects fall behind schedule. This ultimately can bring down production levels overall, and the <b>company-wide</b> employee commitment toward meeting organizational goals.|$|E
25|$|For the 2006 {{fiscal year}} they had {{revenues}} of $309 {{million and a}} profit of $1.4 million. In January 2008, Merix announced the closing of their Wood Village, Oregon, factory they opened in 2004. The company laid off 180 people <b>company-wide</b> {{as part of a}} restructuring plan at that time. Another 230 people were laid off in early 2009, and the company then lost $8.4 million on nearly $60 million in revenues in the quarter that ended in May 2009.|$|E
25|$|In a {{third round}} of cuts {{announced}} on December 6, 2005, ATA {{announced that it would}} discontinue service to three additional cities. ATA would suspend flights from Chicago Midway International Airport to San Francisco, Orlando, and Fort Myers in late April 2006. Following these cancellations, ATA would have only 18 daily scheduled departures from its former Chicago hub and 52 scheduled departures <b>company-wide.</b> Moreover, the company would be left with only 1 gate at Midway, down from its previous total of 14, surrendering the balance to Southwest or the city.|$|E
25|$|During {{the events}} of the 2005 <b>company-wide</b> Infinite Crisis {{crossover}} the Justice League Watchtower was destroyed by Superboy-Prime, leaving the JLA without a base of operations. To that end, the team established the Hall of Justice in Washington, D.C. to act as an embassy for the team and an emergency base of operations if needed. In the continuity of the comics, the Hall was designed by Green Lantern and Wonder Woman. In Justice League of America #46 (2010) Samurai made his first appearance in the DC Universe, where he was shown as one of the heroes driven temporarily insane by Alan Scott.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{the parent}} company was renamed Diamond Aircraft GmbH to better align with the naming {{convention}} of the North American operation. The company also purchased the Wiener Neustadt East Airport in that same year. The firm continued to work on multiple new aircraft types {{in order to further}} grow its product line; these were developed in line with a <b>company-wide</b> philosophy of seeking to offer aircraft that lacked any equivalent in terms of performance to any existing major product being produced from any of its competing manufacturers; this was an measure to consciously avoid instances of direct head-to-head competition.|$|E
25|$|Vista V50 is {{significant}} because it's {{one of the first}} fruits of Toyota's <b>company-wide</b> platform renewal efforts known as the MC. Studies for new front-wheel drive (FWD) platform and packaging layout began in 1993 and appeared on market in February 1997 in the Toyota Prius, but the Vista is the first mass-production, FWD Toyota with a new platform. Toyota claims this is the first true redesign and re-think of its FWD platforms since the 1982 Camry/Vista. With this platform, Toyota trades rear MacPherson Struts for a torsion beam axle setup. A double-wishbone setup is available for all-wheel drive. Toyota also flipped the engine orientation so that the intake manifold is in front, improving space efficiency.|$|E
25|$|According to Interbrand, {{the value}} of the Harley-Davidson brand fell by 43 percent to $4.34billion in 2009. The fall in value is {{believed}} to be connected to the 66 percent drop in the company profits in two quarters of the previous year. On April 29, 2010, Harley-Davidson stated that they must cut $54million in manufacturing costs from its production facilities in Wisconsin, and that they would explore alternative U.S. sites to accomplish this. The announcement came {{in the wake of a}} massive <b>company-wide</b> restructuring, which began in early 2009 and involved the closing of two factories, one distribution center, and the planned elimination of nearly 25 percent of its total workforce (around 3,500 employees). The company announced on September 14, 2010 that it would remain in Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|Norsk Data engaged {{a number}} of {{consultancy}} companies to analyze the firm in 1989. One important finding was that the customers' perception of ND's strengths and weaknesses was completely different from the employees' perception. Another was that the customers did not understand ND's strategy and a general dissatisfaction with software and the high turnover in the sales force. Also administrative routines {{were found to be}} a shortcoming and one consultant company stated that ND was the company they had investigated which had the most room for improvement. Management introduced a <b>company-wide</b> program to increase all employees' focus on market orientation, but the top management carried out several public blunders in poor customer management through the press. Terje Mikkelsen started negotiations to sell ND to a major competitor, but no deal was ever made.|$|E
25|$|Several {{phishing}} {{attacks have}} been directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets within businesses, and the term whaling has been coined for {{these kinds of}} attacks. In the case of whaling, the masquerading web page/email will take a more serious executive-level form. The content will be crafted to target an upper manager and the person's role in the company. The content of a whaling attack email is often written as a legal subpoena, customer complaint, or executive issue. Whaling scam emails are designed to masquerade as a critical business email, sent from a legitimate business authority. The content is meant to be tailored for upper management, and usually involves some kind of falsified <b>company-wide</b> concern. Whaling phishers have also forged official-looking FBI subpoena emails, and claimed that the manager needs to click a link and install special software to view the subpoena.|$|E
500|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, IBM had a {{decision-making}} process called [...] "non-concur" [...] in which any department head could veto a <b>company-wide</b> strategy {{if it did}} not fit in with his department's outlook. That effectively turned IBM into several independent fiefdoms. [...] "Non-concur" [...] was eliminated by CEO Louis Gerstner, who was brought in to revive the declining company.|$|E

Operations in Norway were branded SAS Braathens between 2004 and 2007, receiving a distinct livery based on the main SAS scheme.|$|E
500|$|From 2010, the {{character}} began {{appearing in the}} self-titled series Batwoman. After an introductory [...] "zero" [...] issue in 2010, the series launched fully in 2011 with Batwoman #1 along with DC's <b>company-wide</b> renumbering of its titles that year. Writers J.H. Williams III and W. Haden Blackman chose to expand Kate's supporting cast {{both in terms of}} her family (the Kanes, including Elizabeth, Bette and other relatives), and the [...] "Batman Family" [...] she is more loosely connected to. Issue seventeen was also a milestone as it featured Kate proposing to her girlfriend, Maggie Sawyer.|$|E
500|$|Don Anderson, a sign painter {{hired by}} Harman, coined the name [...] "Kentucky Fried Chicken". For Harman, the {{addition}} of KFC {{was a way of}} differentiating his restaurant from competitors; a product from Kentucky was exotic, and evoked imagery of Southern hospitality. Harman trademarked the phrase [...] "It's finger lickin' good", which eventually became the <b>company-wide</b> slogan. He also introduced the [...] "bucket meal" [...] in 1957 (14 pieces of chicken, five bread rolls and a pint of gravy in a cardboard bucket). Serving their signature meal in a paper bucket was to become an iconic feature of the company.|$|E
500|$|When Romney took over, he reorganized upper management, {{brought in}} younger executives, and pruned and rebuilt AMC's dealer network. Romney {{believed}} {{that the only way}} to compete with the [...] "Big Three" [...] (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) was to stake the future of AMC on a new smaller-sized car line. [...] Together with chief engineer Meade Moore, by the end of 1957 Romney had completely phased out the Nash and Hudson brands, whose sales had been lagging. The Rambler brand was selected for development and promotion, as AMC pursued an innovative strategy: manufacturing only compact cars. The company struggled badly at first, losing money in 1956, more in 1957, and experiencing defections from its dealer network. [...] Romney instituted <b>company-wide</b> savings and efficiency measures, and he and other executives reduced their salaries by up to 35percent.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1998, the company's show {{installed}} {{into new}} stores, {{referred to as}} [...] "Studio C", consists of a single animated Chuck E. Cheese character created by Garner Holt alongside large television monitors, lighting effects, and interactive elements. The other characters appear as puppets on the TV screens. The control system dubbed [...] "Cyberstar" [...] was re-designed {{from the ground up}} and produced by Dave Philipsen. In some markets, the company has also tried a new store concept that omits the animated show entirely. This is the Circle of Lights stage which either consists of a live Chuck E. Cheese costume character or an animatronic in a futuristic light stage with large television monitors. In 2017, the Chuck E. Cheese announced that animatronic shows would be removed in favor of a modernized dance floor. The move is being piloted in a handful of locations prior to being implemented <b>company-wide.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the 1999 storyline [...] "No Man's Land", the {{character}} Helena Bertinelli, known as Huntress, briefly assumes {{the role of}} Batgirl until she is stripped of the identity by Batman for violating his stringent codes. Within the same storyline, {{the character}} Cassandra Cain is introduced. Cain is written {{as the daughter of}} assassins David Cain and Lady Shiva and takes the mantle of Batgirl under the guidance of Batman and Oracle. In 2000, she became the first Batgirl to star in an eponymous monthly comic book series, in addition to becoming {{one of the most prominent}} characters of Asian descent to appear in American comics. The series was canceled in 2006, at which point during the <b>company-wide</b> storyline [...] "One Year Later", she is established as a villain and head of the League of Assassins. After receiving harsh feedback from readership, she is later restored to her original conception. However, the character Stephanie Brown, originally known as Spoiler and later Robin, succeeds her as Batgirl after Cassandra Cain abandons the role.|$|E
500|$|Spurred by <b>company-wide</b> changes {{beginning}} {{late the}} next year and Square Enix's decision to designate a studio to focus on mobile games, Square Enix Montreal pivoted to mobile game development with an emphasis on the Hitman franchise and tablet computers in June 2013. Patrick Naud became its director. The studio quietly cancelled its work on the Hitman console game, and many employees left to work on AAA titles elsewhere. Those who stayed became vested in the ethos of a smaller studio, and left their siloed specialty areas to work as generalists across specialties, as necessitated by smaller teams. The company spent two weeks designing proposals for mobile Hitman series games, which led to Hitman Go (2014) and [...] (2015). The former began the Go series of highly manicured, turn-based, board game-style puzzle video games, while the latter more closely resembled a traditional mobile game in which players competitively shoot targets through a sniper rifle scope. Though Hitman Go and the subsequent Lara Croft Go (2015, based on the Tomb Raider series) received awards, critical acclaim, and modest sales, Hitman: Sniper became the studio's revenue generator.|$|E
500|$|In September, 2011, {{following}} the <b>company-wide</b> relaunch, Barbara Gordon {{stars in a}} new Batgirl series—one of The New 52 titles featuring the company's most iconic characters. The conclusion of the limited series Flashpoint (2011) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to a younger age and earlier stage in their careers, while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting to issue #1, [...] "our creative teams {{have the ability to}} take a more modern approach—not only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters." [...] Wayne also stated that [...] "The Killing Joke still happened and she was Oracle. Now she will go through physical rehabilitation and become a more seasoned and nuanced character because she had these incredible and diverse experiences. Public reaction to the change has been mixed, and has included criticism that DC has reduced the diversity of their character lineup, as well as [...] "being disrespectful of the power the character had gained as a symbol to the disabled community in her role as Oracle." ...|$|E

In 2012, Daunt stated that future expansion was being considered, based {{on the performance of}} the company. The accounts for the year to 2012 showed Waterstones, prior- and post-acquisition had made losses of £37.3 million2013 saw the start of an overhaul of the company's business strategy, with centralised decision making giving way to store-based decisions and a renewed emphasis on traditional bookselling techniques. Waterstones embarked on a major restructuring of staffing levels, with a <b>company-wide</b> consultation with 560 managerial staff to subsequently reduce roles within the company. This consultation led to Head Office staff departures and around 200 branch and regional managers leaving their posts. Waterstones launched a number of new partnerships through the year, including with the University of Derby to launch a professional qualification programme for its staff, with the Folio Society to extend customer reach and stock selection in London-based bookshops, and partnering with a new charity, BookTrust. By the end of 2013, Waterstones had cut its losses to £12.2 million, opened 12 further Café W and embarked on a capital investment in its store portfolio of £29.5 million.|$|E
500|$|In November 2003, gymnast Matthew Cusick (represented by the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund) filed a {{discrimination}} {{complaint against}} Cirque du Soleil in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging {{a violation of}} the Americans With Disabilities Act. Cusick (a trainee performer who was scheduled to begin working at Mystère) alleged that in April 2002, Cirque du Soleil fired him because he tested HIV-positive, even though company doctors had already cleared him as healthy enough to perform. Cirque du Soleil alleged that {{due to the nature of}} Cusick's disease coupled with his job's high risk of injury, there was a significant risk of his infecting other performers, crew or audience members. [...] Cirque du Soleil said that they had several HIV-positive employees, but in the case of Cusick, the risk of him spreading his infection while performing was too high to take the risk. A boycott ensued and Just Out ran a story on it (with the headline [...] "Flipping off the Cirque"). Cirque du Soleil settled with Cusick in April 2004; under the settlement, the company began a <b>company-wide</b> anti-discrimination training program, changed its employment practices pertaining to HIV-positive applicants; paid Cusick $60,000 in lost wages, $200,000 in front pay, and $300,000 in compensatory damages; and paid $40,000 in attorney fees to [...] Lambda Legal.|$|E
