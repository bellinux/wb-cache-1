5000|$|European Rail Shuttle B.V. {{was founded}} in 1994 as {{a joint venture between}} the {{companies}} Sealand Service, P & O Containers, Nedlloyd and NS Cargo. These four companies were aiming to cooperate in order {{to take full advantage of}} the liberalization process in Europe which started the same year. Pretty soon after the start of the joint venture NS Cargo decided to step out being replaced by Mærsk Line joining the three other shipping lines. At the very first beginning European Rail Shuttle started offering container shuttles between Rotterdam and a couple of destinations along the Rhine river in Germany as well as Melzo Terminal in Italy. During the first years of European Rail Shuttle, the company was [...] "only" [...] acting as an intermodal operator whilst traction services were still bought from state owned railway companies. The added value the company offered at that time to its shareholders was based on organizing intermodal shuttle solutions based on gathering enough volumes from its shareholders and taking care about purchasing tractions services from a few suppliers and controlling their performance. In 2002 European Rail Shuttle changed its name into ERS Railways B.V. and the container shuttles were run with locomotives which were leased. With this strategic move ERS Railways positioned itself as a fully independent player by acquiring railway licenses in The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. With its shareholders having gained appetite for expansion within the European railway scene ERS Railways became a major shareholder in the company boxXpress.de GmbH which had been launched in 2000 already. In 2007 ERS Railways BV (at time being fully owned by Maersk Line) had leased 17 so called Class 66 diesel locomotives running on the respective long distance corridors. This set-up changed in the years to come as ERS Railways decided to start reducing the number of diesel locomotives and replace them by electric locomotives. Since December 2012 ERS Railways does not use the diesel locomotives for long-distance transports and is ERS Railways running all its long distance trains in the Europe, with electric locomotives only. ERS Railways is one of the first railway companies who have joined the Dutch-based VIVENS electricity consortium which will supply 100% CO2-free electric energy by 2018. In August 2013 Freightliner Group announce the acquisition of leading European intermodal rail operator and railway undertaking ERS Railways B.V. from Maersk Line. On the 25th of June 2014 in honor of the second anniversary of the direct rail shuttle service Rotterdam - Poznan a festive event was organized at <b>CLIP</b> <b>terminal</b> in Swarzedz. This joyful event was celebrated in the presence of His Royal Highness King Willem - Alexander and Her Royal Highness Queen Máxima.|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{identifying}} the mechanisms {{of the emergence of}} positive changes in the formation of students’ consciousness, factors determining natural conformity of perceiving reality are considered. A number of features of shifting from sinistrocerebral to holistic thinking are considered. It is shown that the introduction of noospheric consciousness into the realization of individual basic functions displays his/her ability to self-awareness of an integrated system of structural-functional dynamics of the psyche. The problem of bringing the education system into line with the major trends in the development of scientific research is set up. In this regard, a mental image {{in the shape of a}} holographic form is considered as a holistic holographic image of an event, phenomenon, and subject filled with information and perceived by all senses individually. It is shown that consideration of dynamics of forming mental images in educational processes is a factor of ensuring psychological health. It is shown that nature-aligned consciousness is emergent in the organization of cognition and comprehension, when it unexpectedly arises from the gross properties of consciousness and is projected onto each individual consciousness able to engage in a global neural network – the noosphere, the information layer, the collective unconscious and superconscious. It is shown that instead of a trained sinistrocerebral, <b>clip,</b> <b>terminal</b> way of thinking, when human capabilities are limited and health is exhausted, a nature-aligned, holistic, neural network, emergent way of thinking is possible that opens up new possibilities of the pupil, and, most importantly, saves health. Such feature of the brain as its permanent activity is considered, which is presented by specific cerebral oscillations of the brain rhythms: delta rhythms (0. 5 to 4 Hz), theta rhythms (4 – 8 Hz), alpha rhythms (8 – 13 Hz), beta rhythms (14 – 40 Hz) and gamma rhythms (over 40 Hz) and sigma-rhythms (10 – 16 Hz from 13 to 14 cycles per second). Each of the rhythms is a symptom of a certain state of consciousness. The importance of changing the mode of operation of the brain and nervous system is shown: activity – relaxation in the learning process. It is discussed that the modern system of education and personal development faces the task, the solution of which noospheric psycho-pedagogy offers: how to shape nature-aligned consciousness of the individual, which allows discovering unlimited resources of a person’s alpha theta, sigma and gamma states. It is argued that in the light of the latest scientific discoveries on the modern stage of society development the teacher should know and use in their activities to nature-aligned educational technologies, aimed at forming nature-aligned noospheric consciousness of the individual. A teacher can and should contribute to the harmonious work of a brain of the student in the learning process. This is possible if the teacher applies bioadequate methods of teaching and uses bioadequate textbooks. It is recommended for the teacher to take a refresher course “Holistic thinking” and “Nature-aligned methods of teaching academic disciplines. ”  </p...|$|E

We used an experimental approach to document a trade-off {{associated with the}} {{evolution of}} the long hook {{at the tip of the}} bill of birds belonging to the genus Diglossa (flowerpiercers). In Diglossa, the more derived flower-robbing nectarivorous species have maxillae (upper jaws) that termin-ate in enlarged curved hooks. The ancestral frugivorous species have maxillae with relatively small hooks. We mimicked bill evolution by <b>clipping</b> the <b>terminal</b> bill hook of nectarivorous Cinnamon-bellied Flower-piercers (Diglossa baritula) to resemble the frugivorous condition. We found that birds with experimentally shortened bills ingested fruit more efficiently, but had a reduced ability to rob flowers. Birds with intact bills, by contrast, were good flower robbers but poor frugivores. The evolution of a hooked bill endowed flowerpiercers with the ability to efficiently pierce flowers and extract nectar, but hindered their efficiency to feed on fruit...|$|R

Diseases of kudzu were also surveyed in southern China. A total of 116 phytophagous insect species in 31 families and 5 orders were collected from kudzu in China, in six feeding guilds: foliage, sap, stem, terminal, seed and root feeders. The impact of foliage feeders varied from site to site and year to year, and {{over the course of}} the growing season. The mean percent defoliation of kudzu over all plots and years was 13. 3 § 1. 9 %, but ranged as high as 34 %. Two insect species fed on shoots and <b>clipped</b> oV <b>terminals.</b> Infestation of new shoots was high, with nearly half of all shoots clipped. Nearly half of the vines showed damage from stem borers, again varying through the season. Two species of insects attacked kudzu roots, mainly the cerambycid beetle Paraleprodera diophthalma (Pascoe), which caused considerable damage to both small (young, 6 cm diameter) roots. Insects also caused substantial seed damage. Imitation rust, caused by Synchytrium minutum [D S. puerariae (P. Henning) Miyabe], was the most commonly observed disease of kudzu.

Glucosidase II belongs to family 31 glycosidases. These enzymes act by the acid-base catalytic mechanism. The cDNA of the wild-type and several mutant forms of the fusion protein of the enzyme in which mutations were introduced in the conserved motif D 564 MNE 567 were expressed in Sf 9 cells, and the proteins were purified on Ni-NTA matrix. The cata-lytic activity of the purified proteins was determined with radioactive Glc 2 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 substrate. The {{results show that the}} aspartate and glutamate within the D 564 MNE 567 motif can serve for catalysis, most likely as the acid-base pair within the active site of the enzyme. The developmental regulation of glucosidase II was studied during the ontogeny of the mouse mammary gland for its growth and differentia-tion. The mRNA of both a and b subunits of the enzyme, immunoreactive a and b subunits, and enzyme activity were measured over the complete developmental cycle. The changes in all the parameters were consistent with similar fluctuations with several other enzymes of the N-glycosylation machinery reported earlier, reaching a three- to fourfold increase over the basal level in the virgin gland at the peak of lactation. Altogether it appears that there is a coordinated regulation of the enzymes involved in protein N-glycosylation during the development of the mouse mammary gland.

40|$| to the romanization of the {{indigenous}} population of Cuccium. This group consists of Early Roman import artifacts, which arrived at Limes by the well-known Sava valley trade route from the northern Italic region. The dark gray bowl with thin walls and two horizontal ribs (Pl. 2, 6), the ceramic lamp with a voluted nose and a rosette ornament (Pl. 2, 5), and a glass vessel, most probably a funnel or a glass (Pl. 2, 4) represent imported grave goods which are not only chronologically sensitive but also point to {{the direction of the}} cultural and economic effects of the Roman conquest of the Drava, Sava and Danube interfluve. Ceramic ware with thin walls appeared in the eastern Alps and the middle Danube in the Tiberian period along with Padanian sigillata {{at the time of the}} first military conquests. Different shapes and ornamentation methods were identified, of which bowls decorated in barbotine technique are the largest in number. Typical of southern Pannonia is intensive import in the Claudius-Flavius period, when the peak of production was achieved. With the Flavian period, the production in the local workshops of Sirmium, Emona and on Gomolava began, in which shapes, ornaments and facture of the imported specimens were imitated. At the end of the 1 st century the quality and the number of vessels with thin walls declined, but their production continued until the middle of the 2 nd century. The ceramic lamp with reddish-brown coating and voluted nose, two grooves on its shoulder and a rosette ornament (Pl. 2, 5) is also of northern Italic origin; its fragments were found at the eastern margin of the grave. The lamp find, along with other imports, suggests the acceptance of Roman lifestyle traditions and funeral customs. The described lamp belongs to the Iványi I type, which encompasses specimens with voluted triangle-shaped nose, a relief figure in the middle concentric grooves on the rim. According to D. Iványi’s classification, the lamp from Ilok belongs to the third type, its basic feature being a broader voluted nose dated to about the middle and the last quarter of the 1 st century or to the 2 nd century. According to Loeschcke’s classification of ceramic lamps with an angular nose and volutes, the Ilok find corresponds to type I, variation b, characterized by a somewhat narrower top of the nose than with lamps having volutes, whereas the shoulder profile with two grooves is of type IIb. The angular ceramic lamps with volutes of the Iványi I, or Loeschcke I type, from Pannonian sites, represent a northern Italic import from the beginning of the 1 st century, when they arrived along with the Arentino and northern Italic sigillata of the Augustan and Tiberian periods. The finds of voluted lamps, as well as of ceramic ware with thin walls, in military camps on the Danube (Zemun, Novi Banovci, Surduk) prove that they were imported to satisfied the needs of the army, but also for the higher social class of the autochtonous population, as indicated by the richly cremation grave from Ilok. Production in local Pannonian workshops began in the second half of the 1 st century, as finds of moulds in Sirmium, Mursa and Poetovio suggest. Their occurrence in south Pannonian sites can be followed also in the 2 nd century, up to the beginning of the 3 rd. The smaller vessel, probably a funnel or a glass, made of greenish glass with a horizontally inverted rim (Pl. 2, 4), the fragments of which were found along the eastern margin of the grave, also suggests northern Italic origin. Just like the voluted lamp and the bowl with thin walls, the vessel came to the Danube limes through Aquileia, which in the 1 st- 2 nd centuries was an important production center, but at the same time it was a commercial port for goods coming from other production centers, from where it was imported into the eastern Alpine and Danube regions. In the northeastern corner of the grave there was also a play-token made of dark blue glass paste (Pl. 2, 1), which is supposed to have served for playing and which was dated to the 1 st century. In the grave, a greenish glass bead was found as well (Pl. 2, 3). Metal grave goods and coin were preserved (Fig. 4) in the southeastern excavated part of the grave, on the remains of poorly preserved wooden planks. The little bronze 74 ring with an irregular rectangular cross-section has its one terminal looped, whereas its other terminal is missing (Pl. 1, 3). Its description corresponds with the type of Roman bronze earrings in the shape of wired annulets with different crosssections, with looped or <b>clipped</b> <b>terminals.</b> Simple earrings in the form of a wired ring that used to close by inserting the small hook through the loop were documented in a longer period, and they differ according to the shape of the pendant hanging from the ring, whose shape remained almost unchanged. The fragment of a bronze needle (Pl. 1, 5) was probably part of a bronze fibula. In the immediate vicinity of the earring there was another object, the function of which is not sufficiently clear. It might have been a handle fastening system of a bronze vessel (Pl. 1, 4) consisting of a leaned ring with an oval outline and a round cross-section, beneath which there is trifoliate sheet metal with rectangular terminals and a rivet hole in the upper part. The ring is separated from the bottom part by a rib, on which there are two horizontal grooves. In the immediate vicinity, a smaller iron rivet (Pl. 2, 8) was found with a short spike with a rectangular cross-section that might have served for fastening a handle. Apart from the described finds, another import in the grave are also the remains of the fig and the melon, found along with other archaeobotanical samples in the northeastern part of the grave and in the fillings of both pots. The figs could not be cultivated in the southern Pannonian area due to inclement climatic conditions. Since figs could not have been kept fresh for a long time, it was not possible to transport the fruits across larger distances, therefore probably the figs arrived to Cuccium dried. The figs, along with the remaining ceramic and glass finds, were imported for the needs of the settled Italic, but also indigenous population, who were not unfamiliar with Italic goods. The largest part of archaeobotanical artifacts accounts for wine grape seeds. The question of the origin and cultivation of wine among the Illyrians with the mentioned antique sources was thoroughly analyzed by M. Zaninović. The Pannonian production of small quantities of wine and the bad quality of its production is mentioned by Dion Cassius (49. 36. 2), which is also confirmed by Strabo’s quote (VII. 5. 10) that the regions above Dalmatia are mountainous and cold and that vineyards can seldom be found there. The finds of amphorae dated in the beginning of the 1 st century, which came along with the wine across Aquileia, testify to imports of wine to Sirmium, which was supported by settled Italics and by {{the indigenous}} population. Wine cultivation in Pannonia was intensified in the second half of the 3 rd century, in the period of Probus, when soldiers planted selected grapes on the slopes of Fruška gora (Almus Mons). The discovery of grape seeds in pots in the grave in Ilok prove the earlier existence of vineyards on the western slopes of Fruška gora already in the 1 st century, although it is possible that the tradition of wine cultivation in the Ilok region is considerably older. The laying of different kinds of cereals and fruits combined with ceramic and glass vessels of twofold origin into the grave suggests the existence of a complex funeral rite, which is still inadequately understood in the southern Pannonian territory in the Early Roman period. Numerous parallels to all described finds from the grave in Ilok were documented in the Danube region, which enable the dating of the grave in the middle of the 1 st century. This is also confirmed by the find of Claudius coin (Pl. 1, 6). Although the grave has not been completely excavated, the grave goods and remains of grave architecture enriched the existing understanding of the process of romanization of the Croatian Danube region, testifying to the relation {{of the indigenous}} population towards the newly arrived achievements of the Roman culture. Of particular importance for the ethnic determination of the burial are three ceramic vessels from the northeastern corner of the grave, two hand-made pots with a rounded body (Pl. 1, 1 - 2) and the S-profiled, wheel-made bowl (Pl. 2, 1). The described vessels can be compared with the material heritage of the La Tène culture, which in the middle Danube is connected with the Scordiscs. In the described shapes, the continuation of pottery traditions of the indigenous mixed Celtic- Pannonian population is visible, which in the 1 st century formed an important ethnic component of the southern part of Roman Pannonia. The second group of finds that suggests northern Italic origin points to the direction of the new ethnic, cultural and economic influences on the eastern part of the the Sava-Drava-Danube interfluve in the process of early romanization. Numerous parallels with Early Roman cremation burials from Syrmia, in which ceramic finds produced following La Tène traditions were found, indicate a strong tradition of the autochthonous population up until the end of the 1 st century. This means that the mixed Celtic-Pannonian population living in the territory of the middle Danube played an important role in the process of early romanization and formed a constituent part of the ethnic corps of the newly conquered part of southern Pannonia. The indigenous population in larger centers that emerged from Late La Tène protourbane centers, was exposed to more intensive and rapid romanization by the settling Italic population and veterans and common imports, which was accompanied by the achievements of the Roman way of life. Rural Late La Tène communities long held the features of their own material culture, accepting only some of the achievements of the newly founded Roman provincial culture. In the grave in Ilok, imported objects suggesting northern Italic origin were found as well, and they came to the middle Danube by a trade route that was in function earlier - along the Sava River, where in the 1 st century BC certain goods were transported for the Scordiscs. This is shown by numerous finds of bronze vessels of northern Italic origin, which in the sites of La Tène culture in eastern Slavonia occur in graves and in the most important fortified settlements such as Dalj, Sotin, Vinkovci and Orolik. The import of bronze vessels took place from Aquileia through Nauportus and Emona, from where along the Sava over Segestica it came to the middle Danube. Strabo (4. 6. 10; 5. 1. 8; 7. 5. 2) described this important prehistoric communication, and the described trade route is also supported by finds of coins from Appolonia and Dyrrhachion, as well as of Roman Republican coins. The use of the well-known trade route, along the Sava towards the East, continued also in the Early Roman period, when Aquileia was the most significant center of the export of pottery with thin walls, terra sigillatae and glass vessels on the markets of Pannonia and Noricum. It can be claimed with certainty that Tiberius’ conquest of the eastern part of the Interfluve came running across the Sava valley. The understanding of events after the Roman conquest of eastern Slavonia and western Syrmia is weak due to a lack of site excavations, on which the process of romanization that had started could be followed. Although there were significant military bases of the Danube Limes in the described territory, as well as larger civic settlements in its hinterland, such as Mursa and Cibalae, the material heritage of the first decades of the 1 st century is little known.
