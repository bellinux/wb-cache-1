5000|$|The Unna (sometimes called [...] "Unna's") Boot {{itself is}} a <b>compression</b> <b>dressing,</b> usually made of cotton, that {{contains}} zinc oxide paste. The zinc oxide paste in the Unna Boot helps ease skin irritation and keeps the area moist. The zinc promotes healing within wound sites, making it useful for burns and ulcers. Zinc oxide paste is superior to gelatins used in other dressings, {{because it does not}} harden or cake. Some Unna Boots also contain calamine lotion and glycerin. For venous stasis ulcers, the paste-impregnated wrap is covered by an elastic layer, generally an elastic wrap ("ACE" [...] bandage) or self-adherent elastic bandage such as Coban; this is referred to as a 2-layer compression bandage. An alternative treatment is a 4-layer, graduated compression wrap (Pro-Fore is an example). Evidence indicates that both are equally effective in healing venous stasis ulcers — a slow process in the best of circumstances, often taking 2-6 months.|$|E

40|$|Johannesson A, Larsson G-U, Ramstrand N, Lauge-Pedersen H, Wagner P, Atroshi I: Outcomes of a {{standardized}} surgical and rehabilitation program in transtibial amputation for peripheral vascular disease: A prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE:: To study {{the outcomes of}} a new surgical and rehabilitation program for initial unilateral transtibial amputation in patients with peripheral vascular disease. The program consists of sagittal incision, rigid <b>dressing,</b> <b>compression</b> therapy using silicone liner, and direct manufacturing prosthetic technique. DESIGN:: A prospective cohort study with 1 -yr follow-up. RESULTS:: Of the 217 consecutive patients with peripheral vascular disease who underwent transtibial amputation (mean age, 77 yrs; 51 % diabetic; 116 could walk before amputation), 119 (55 %) were fitted with a prosthesis at a median time of 41 (range, 12 - 147) days after amputation. Of the prosthetic recipients, 76 (64 %) obtained good function with the prosthesis within 6 mos. Within 1 yr, reamputation was performed on 8. 2 %, and contralateral amputation was performed on 5. 5 %. The 90 -day mortality was 24 % (53 patients). The total 1 -yr mortality was 40 % (86 patients) : 17 % among patients who received a prosthesis and 67 % among {{those who did not}} receive a prosthesis or had undergone reamputation. CONCLUSIONS:: Following this standardized surgical and rehabilitation program, prosthetic fitting was achieved in more than half of transtibial amputees, almost two-thirds of prosthetic recipients obtained good function, and the reamputation rate was low.

40|$|Objective 　To {{observe the}} {{therapeutic}} effect of bone cement injectable pedicle screw system combined with intervertebral fusion for lumbar spondylolysis and osteoporosis. Methods 　The clinical {{data were analyzed}} retrospectively of 21 patients with lumbar spondylolysis and osteoporosis who received treatment of bone cement injectable pedicle screw system and intervertebral fusion from Aug. 2013 to Nov. 2015. The 21 patients (9 males and 12 females) aged from 60 to 80 years (mean 64 years old); 6 of them presented degenerative spondylolysis, 15 with isthmic spondylolisthesis; 2 cases had I degree slippage, 13 had Ⅱdegree slippage, 6 had Ⅲdegree slippage, and all the cases were unisegmental slippage including 9 cases in L 4 and 12 cases in L 5. Bone mineral density of lumbar vertebrae (L 2 -L 5) was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and T values conforming to the diagnostic criteria of osteoporosis were {{less than or equal}} to - 2. 5; All patients were operated with whole lamina resection for decompression, bone cement injectable pedicle screws system implantation, propped open reduction and fixation intervertebral fusion. The clinical outcomes were determined by the radiographic evaluation including intervertebral height, height of intervertebral foramen, slip distance, slip rate and slip angle, and Oswestry disability index (ODI) on preoperative, 3 months after operation and the end of the time, and the interbody fusion were followed up. Results 　Cerebrospinal fluid leakage of incision was observed in two cases after operation, <b>compression</b> and <b>dressing</b> to incision, Trendelenburg position, dehydration and other treatments were taken, and the stitches of incisions were taken out on schedule. Slips in the 21 patients were reset to different extent, and lumbar physiological curvatures were recovered. The intervertebral height and height of intervertebral foramen were obviously higher 3 months after operation than that before operation (P 0. 05). Based on the ODI score, the excellent/fine rate was 90. 6 % and 92. 5 % for 3 months after operation and the last follow-up, respectively. During the period of following up, no loss of the correction degrees, no loosening of the screws, and 19 cases were noted bony fusion with the fusion success rate of 90. 5 %. Conclusion 　The treatment effect of bone cement injectable pedicle screw system and intervertebral fusion for lumbar spondylolysis and osteoporosis is satisfied.

Although this technique was adopted slowly, it is now considered the standard method for treating varicose veins. The procedure is performed on an ambulatory patient under local anesthesia with little, if any, recovery time.

40|$|Surgical site {{infection}} {{continues to}} be a major source of morbidity following operative procedures. It is considered that the dressing protects the wound against bacterial contamination, foreign material, trauma, absorbs exudates and provides <b>compression,</b> so wound <b>dressing</b> of the primarily sutured surgical wound with a sterile dressing till the stitches are removed represents the current practice among surgeons. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the risk of infection for surgical wounds when the wound dressing was removed or not after 48 hours. Three hundred forty-eight patients were prospectively studied, 165 receiving dressing till the stitches were removed (group I) and 183 patients having their wounds left exposed after 48 hours after wound suture (group II). There were 23 thoracic wounds, 302 abdominal wounds and 23 lower limb wounds. All wounds were considerate clean or clean-contaminated and were stitched per primam. The clinical features were comparable between the two groups. Fourteen wounds (4 %) were infected-six in group I (3. 6 %) and eight in group II (4. 3 %), which was statistically not significant (p= 0. 940). Adverse skin reactions were present in 11 patients in group I and none in group II (p= 0. 001). The degree of satisfaction with these two methods was high, 93. 3 % in group I and 91. 8 % in group II. Wound dressing seems to be unnecessary after 48 hours for surgical wounds and the rate of surgical site infection is not influenced by that.

Clinical data, anticoagulation regimen, sheath size, delay of sheath removal, aPTT at the removal were not statistically different in both groups. Pts were randomized immediately before the sheath removal. A serial clinical follow-up was done until 24 hours and a systematic vascular ultrasonography (with pulsed and color doppler examination) was performed before hospital discharge. In the HPCD group, device placement was successful in all but one. Hemostasis was immediate in 67 %; in 8 pts (15 %) a light manual pressure was necessary (15 ± 10 min.) to stop the bleeding.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This study {{compared}} 3 {{years of}} nonoperative therapy in a vascular clinic (1991 to 1993) with a proactive approach to diagnosis and operative treatment (1994 to 1995). Methods: In the first period, 11 compliant men 48 to 69 {{years of age}} (average, 55 years) were treated without surgery using Unna's boot <b>dressing,</b> <b>compression</b> wound care, and patient education. In the second period, after duplex scans and venographic examinations when appropriate, operative interventions were performed in 10 patients. Results: In period 1 there were 44 occurrences of ulceration (range, 3 to 8 per individual), with an average time to heal of 13 weeks (range, 7 to 28 weeks per individual). Beginning in January 1994 (period 2), 11 patients who had current active ulceration underwent duplex scans and venographic examinations to detect correctable lesions, including deep, superficial, or perforator incompetence, or deep venous occlusions. Ten became candidates for surgery. One patient was not a candidate for venous surgery because of extensive caval thrombosis. Operations included extrafascial perforator division in nine patients; long saphenous stripping with submalleolar saphenous and perforator interruption in seven; one Palma crossover venous graft; and one superficial femoral valvuloplasty. In period 2 (24 months), there were two recurrent ulcers, one related to failure to use adequate compression and one related to infection of an incision. Nine of 10 patients remained healed at 24 months. Average time to heal was 4 weeks. Clinical severity score {{as described in the}} Consensus Statement of the American Venous Forum was reduced from 12 (range, 9 to 17) in period 1 to a mean of 3. 5 (range, 2 to 8) in period 2 (p < 0. 01 by paired t test). Conclusion: Improved diagnostic and operative techniques make possible more active approaches to venous ulceration. Nonoperative treatment, even in skilled hands, is associated with prolonged disability and ulcer recurrence. The condition of selected patients in whom nonoperative treatment fails can be improved substantially with operative intervention. (J Vasc Surg 1996; 24 : 788 - 92. ...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{disadvantage}} of maintaining the skin over the pedicle while lifting the flap is that it leaves a large donor area defect on the posterior calf that requires a split skin graft. This was unavoidable considering the large defects intended to be covered in this series, which prevented direct skin suturing. Hence, this technique {{may appear to be}} cosmetically unappealing as compared to the current technique. This donor defect can be aesthetically covered using full-length trousers. The other disadvantage of using the reverse sural fasciocutaneous flap with a cutaneous pedicle is that it leads to a dog-ear formation after flap rotation at the pivot point. But this dog-ear can be reduced gradually by post-operative <b>compression</b> <b>dressing.</b> We also observed that the more proximal the defect, the less prominent was the dog-ear.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We aim to {{optimize}} surgical strategy to decrease relapse of tubercular abscess {{in the chest}} wall (TACW). METHODS: The records of 120 patients who underwent surgical treatment for TACW from May 2005 to March 2011 were retrospect-ively reviewed. We conducted the following surgical treatment as ‘ 6 C + A ’ by abbreviating the first alphabet of each step: (i) careful exploration of the abscess; (ii) complete resection; (iii) cavity washing using sodium bicarbonate solution; (iv) coverage using muscle flap; (v) continuous suction and drainage; (vi) <b>compression</b> <b>dressing</b> and (vii) anti-tuberculosis medication. RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen cases were discharged for rehabilitation with the first stage wound healing (113 / 120). Four cases postoperatively suffered from subcutaneous fistula which was healed after dressing changes for 1 – 2 months. Three patients with an abscess relapse underwent the second operation 2 months after the first operation. Follow-ups ranged from 2 months to 6 years and demonstrated no recurrence.

5000|$|The Imperial Gazetteer {{defined the}} {{architectural}} {{design of the}} cathedral as [...] "Indo-Gothic", to mean a Gothic architectural style built to meet the climatic conditions of India. It was also called a [...] "spurious gothic adapted to the exigencies of the Indian climate." [...] The cathedral's design, otherwise known as Gothic Revival style, includes three stained glass windows and two frescoes in the Florentine Renaissance style; the West Window was created by Morris & Co. to a design by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. The nave of the cathedral is very long at 247 ft, and its width is 81 ft. The nave is fitted with well-crafted wooden pews and chairs. The central spire rises to a height of 201 ft, and the tower on which it stands is square in shape and was patterned on {{the lines of the}} 12th-century Canterbury Cathedral, England. The tower was fitted with five clocks, each of which weighed about three tons. The stained glass windows on the western side were the creation of Sir Edward Burne-Jones, a pre-Raphaelite master, which were fitted in half-sunk arches; these were designed in 1880 in memory of Lord Mayo who was assassinated in the Andaman Islands. When completed in 1847, the cathedral as a whole was compared to the Norwich Cathedral of England. The East window, which had original stained glass, was destroyed by a cyclone in 1964. It was replaced with a new one in 1968. The roof of the cathedral is {{in the shape of a}} [...] "shallow curve" [...] arching over iron trusses decorated with [...] "Gothic tracery" [...] (it was the largest span when built). The hall of the cathedral is built spaciously without any aisles on its flanks. The materials used in the construction of the cathedral consisted of special bricks, light in weight and with good <b>compression</b> strength. The <b>dressed</b> stones used were Chunar stones. The external and internal surfaces of the cathedral were plastered with fine chunam (lime plaster) in the form of a stucco.|$|R
40|$|Keloid, a {{rare disease}} for humans, infests {{the skin around}} the initial wound and extends. Since 1700 BC {{when it was first}} described, many {{researches}} have been trying to explore a deeper understanding of this disease and the mission never stops, for its still unknown etiopathogenesis. Electronic search, performed in PubMed, Embase and HKU Library, has identified 230 eligible studies reporting a total of 533 cases of keloid in literature. The analysis shows that the weighted mean of patients’ age is 36. 19, between the range of 13 and 62. Most studies report a mean/median age of patients between the 18 s and the 30 s. The weighted proportion of male patients to female patients is 0. 83, indicating that females are more likely to catch the disease. Two fifths (40 %) of keloid are in craniofacial areas while 15 % take place in thoracodorsal areas. Furthermore, the reports prove that TNF-α, IF-β, IL- 6, IL- 18, CTGF and SCF contribute to the formation of keloid. The receptors and inhibitors of P 13 K, MAPK, Sp 13, mTOR and c-KIT are therapeutic potentialities. Surgery is the most fundamental way to relieve the symptoms of this disease, but adjuvant irradiation therapy is considered a more effective approach, considering its high recurrence rate. Besides, injection, laser, occlusive <b>dressing,</b> <b>compression</b> therapy and cryotherapy are also viable options. We conducted a research of keloid in Hong Kong, Chinese on infected people from the age 1 to 86. The research results reveal that the ratio of male patients to females ones is 1 : 1. 96. Keloid is most likely to happen from age 20 to 39 and from 60 to 69 among males and 40 to 59 among females. The mean ± SD age is 42. 17 ± 19. 75 years in males and 41. 02 ± 19. 20 years in females (p= 0. 583 > 0. 005). Moreover, the mean is 41. 5 in males and 42. 0 in females (p = 0. 548 > 0. 005). For males, keloid occurs mainly on the chest and limbs, while for females, it is usually on the chest and head, suggesting a statistically significant difference（x^ 2 = 22. 282 ，P= 0. 004 < 0. 05 ）. Additionally, there is a significant difference between male and female patients who have keloid on their limbs (T= 2. 178, P= 0. 033 < 0. 05). The mean age of onset of males much older than females, which was 39. 7 and 31. 94, respectively. Surgery was {{the most common cause of}} keloid in Hong Kong, followed by skin injury, burn and inflammation. In terms of treatment, most patients choose injections, followed by sheet dressing, excisional surgery and cream therapy. Laser removal of keloid is the least favoured choice. As for the treatment period, most patients are treated more than a year. In conclusion, these findings provide more information of keloid and hopefully will serve as an indicator of prognosis and diagnosis for Hong Kong patients in the future. More investigations and researches should be conducted to offer a more thorough and profound understanding of this disease. published_or_final_versionSurgeryMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R

Pain relief is very important in the early post-operative period as a patient with pain is not able to be cope with physiotherapy and mobilization; to this end, we prefer to use adequate doses of narcotics instead of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) as NSAIDs can affect the osteotomy healing process. Correction of the deformity starts on the third post-operative day while leg lengthening, if this is part of treatment, on the fifth (the day of surgery is being considered as day 0). The process of loosening and tightening threaded rods should be performed four times a day (0.25  mm per time).

40|$|Review of {{clinical}} and operative records of 86 {{patients at the}} Minneapolis VA Medical Center and Mount Sinai Hospital undergoing peritoneovenous (PV) shunt for intractable ascites revealed a subgroup of patients (n = 9) who developed leaking ascites prior to shunting. The etiology of leaking ascites was as follows: 1) ruptured umbilical hernia (UH) (four patients), 2) repeated paracentesis (three patients), and 3) postoperative incisional ascitic fluid leak (two patients). Initial therapy included local sterile <b>compression</b> <b>dressing,</b> intravenous antibiotics, and management of fluid and electrolytes. All nine patients underwent subsequent closure of the fascial defect and PV shunt to prevent reaccumulation of ascites (simultaneous procedures were performed in five patients). No patient developed postoperative septic complications, organ failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or encephalopathy. There were no early deaths; however, three late deaths (18 months, 2, and 4 years) were due to variceal bleeding and/or liver failure. Ascites was well controlled in seven patients with PV shunt alone, the other two ultimately responding to medical therapy. We conclude that peritoneal fluid leaks can be treated successfully by repairing the fascial defect and placing a PV shunt. In the absence of infected ascites and clinical peritonitis, PV shunt may be performed simultaneously with closure of UH, thus preventing the reaccumulation of ascites during the immediate postoperative period...|$|E

Pre-biopsy medication restriction guidelines and routine post-biopsy care (manual <b>compression,</b> <b>dressing,</b> ice pack, and elastic band application) were also identical {{for these two}} groups. Stereotactic biopsy was used for calcifications without definite mass on MMG and no definite lesion on US. All biopsy targets were BI-RADS category 4 or 5 lesions and some 3 lesions which the patients want to biopsy. Lesion size and density of breast parenchyma were not used as criteria for exclusion from SVAB. Informed consent for biopsy was obtained from each patient. Images were obtained {{before and after the}} biopsy device were activated to document accurate needle position in the targeted lesion. Retargeting was performed if necessary. Biopsy specimens were typically obtained in a 360 ° rotation with the directional biopsy instrument, particularly when needle placement was within the lesion. When MMG obtained after the instrument was activated showed the needle to be immediately adjacent to the lesion, cores were obtained with the bowl of the needle directed toward the lesion. Standard practice at our institution {{at the time of the}} study was to obtain sufficient specimens to acquire adequate calcifications on routine specimen radiography. The radiologist assessed the specimen radiograph and obtained additional cores as needed. Post-biopsy MMGs were routinely obtained for the evaluation of residual calcification. Lesion type, number of cores obtained, and pathology results were recorded by the radiologist performing the procedure. Acute complications such as hematoma or bleeding also were recorded.|$|E
40|$|Background: Routine {{circumcision}} of boys is {{a common}} practice in Tanzania. Because sometimes it is performed by persons with no surgical training, complications, including urethro-cutaneous fistula (UCF), are not uncommon. Methods: Five boys whose ages ranged between 4 and 12 years with UCF were seen at four Dar es Salaam hospitals between 2002 and 2005. Personal particulars, the personnel doing the circumcision, description of the repair and follow up were recorded on a data sheet. Intravenous Augmentin was given at induction of anaesthesia for the fistula repair. A urethral catheter was inserted, and then a tourniquet was applied {{at the base of}} the penis. After incision and development of skin flaps the urethra was closed, a layer of dartos fascia interposed, followed by closure of the skin, all with 6 / 0 Vicryl. A <b>compression</b> <b>dressing</b> was applied, and the catheter was left in for 5 - 7 days. Results: The boys ranged in age between 5 and 12 years, and had undergone circumcision at age 2 to 12 years. All patients were circumcised by paramedical personnel or a traditional practitioner. Urine leakage commenced 2 days to 2 weeks after circumcision. Four boys had coronal while one had a glandular UCF. No post repair complication was reported after follow up of 3 to 20 weeks.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Preauricular sinuses are benign {{congenital}} malformations of preauricular soft tissues. Complete excision using either sinectomy or supra-auricular approach is advised to prevent recurrence. Reported recurrence varies between 0 and 42 %. We evaluated which surgical technique resulted in lowest complication and recurrence rates. Study Design: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science. Methods: Two authors appraised studies on directness {{of evidence and}} risk of bias. Original data were extracted and pooled when I 2 was smaller than 50 %. Results are reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Results: Fourteen high directness of evidence studies were included. Reported complication rates were similar: sinectomy [0 - 31. 4 %] and supra-auricular approach (SAA) [0 - 18. 2 %]. Pooled recurrence rates showed that sinectomy resulted in significantly (P =. 04) more recurrence 5. 5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 6 - 8. 3 %) than SAA 2. 2 % (95 % CI 0. 7 - 7. 0). Sinectomy using the microscope resulted in the lowest sinectomy recurrence rates (1. 9 %). SAA in combination with a Penrose drain resulted in 0 % recurrence in revision cases. Drain use resulted in the lowest SAA recurrence rates; however, drain application was not advised due to higher complication rates (frequent wound infection [P =. 003] and more [P =. 002] and longer [P =. 001] <b>compression</b> <b>dressing</b> use). Conclusion: SAA could be the preferable technique for preauricular sinus removal.

40|$|Abstract Background Suction drains are {{routinely}} used after {{modified radical mastectomy}} and are an important factor contributing to increased hospital stay as the patients are often discharged only after their removal. Amongst various factors that influence the amount of postoperative drainage, the negative suction pressure applied to the drain {{has been reported to}} be of great significance. While a high negative suction pressure is expected to drain the collection and reduce the dead space promptly, it may also prevent the leaking lymphatics from closing and lead to increased drainage from the wound. Against this background a prospective randomized clinical study was conducted to compare the amount and duration of drainage between a half negative suction and full vacuum suction drainage in patients following modified radical mastectomy. The associated postoperative morbidity was also compared between the two groups. Methods 85 FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) proven cases of locally advanced breast cancer were randomized. (Using randomly ordered sealed envelops, which were opened immediately before the closure of the wound) in to 50 patients with full vacuum suction (pressure = 700 g/m 2) and 35 cases in to half vacuum suction drainage (pressure = 350 g/m 2) groups. The two groups were comparable in respect of age, weight, and technique of operation and extent of axillary dissection. Surgery was performed by the same surgical team comprising of five surgeons (two senior and three resident surgeons) using a standardized technique with electrocautery. External <b>compression</b> <b>dressing</b> was provided over the axilla for first 48 hrs and following that patients were encouraged to do active and passive shoulder exercises. The outcomes measured were postoperative morbidity and the length of hospital stay. Statistical methods used: Descriptive studies were performed with SPSS version 10 and group characteristics were compared using student t-test. Results Half vacuum suction drains were removed earlier than the full suction vacuum suction drains. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of seroma formation in the two groups and there was a significant reduction in the total hospital stay in patients with half vacuum suction drainage systems as compared to the full suction drainage group (p Conclusions Half negative suction drains provide an effective compromise between no suction and full or high suction drainage after modified radical mastectomy by reducing the hospital stay and the post operative morbidity including post operative seromas. </p...|$|E
