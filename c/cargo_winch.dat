40|$|In November 1936, when I {{arrived at}} Port Kembla, {{accompanied}} by my brother, we were {{shocked at the}} absence of any working conditions. In these days {{there was not a single}} condition in the Port. There was no meal money, no minimum period of engagement, nowhere to have meals, 24 hour shifts, a bull system, brutalisation of labour in many ways by handling pig iron, 80 or 90 pound ingots of pig iron, 90 pound ingots of lead. These all had to be stacked into large buckets, lead into large sling loads, and this work was demanding because the hook was always in single gear, was racing in and out and the hook was always waiting on the men below; and so it means that whilst one tub went out, the other tub commenced being filled by a section of the labour force down below and by the time the other tub came in the tub had to be filled. And so it was continuously in and out with the <b>cargo</b> <b>winches</b> running at full speed. We were able to institute many campaigns on the job itself, either for safety or for insisting on the break down of the workload, and as a consequence we were victimised regularly...|$|R

50|$|The NR-4 variant {{was like}} the Mack EXBX, a special version for tank transport. On August 21, 1941 an order was placed for 200 units.

The empty weight was about 11.7 metric tons, and the total weight load was less than 22.7 tons. The vehicle was designed to transport the M3 Stuart light tank, which weighed almost 13 tons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ship was}} built by William Dobson and Company in Walker Yard {{as one of a}} trio of ships {{including}} [...] and [...] for the Goole Steam Shipping Company and launched on 10 July 1884. She was described in the Shields Daily Gazette of 12 July 1884 as constructed with a topgallant forecastle fitted for the crew, long bridge house extending over the engine and boiler room, and poop which will be handsomely fitted up for the comfortable accommodation of first-class passengers. The machinery to be supplied by R and W Hawthorn, and will develop 600 hp, being greatly in excess of that usually fitted.

50|$|Larger {{helicopters}} became {{commercially available}} after the Vietnam War as helicopter manufacturers focused on selling commercial versions of their military aircraft. For instance, Boeing Vertol Model 107 and Model 234 aircraft {{have been used}} to carry even heavier payloads than their lighter predecessors. But the heaviest loads required a pure aerial crane. The answer came from Sikorsky's S-64 Skycrane. Originally produced for the military as the CH-54 Tarhe for heavy lifting of downed aircraft and artillery pieces, the S-64 Skycrane was nothing more than just enough airframe to attach two powerful engines, the main and tail rotors and transmissions, a cockpit, and a <b>cargo</b> hook and <b>winch</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|Harlan County carried 900000 usgal L {{of marine}} diesel, 141600 usgal L of vehicle fuel, 20000 usgal L of {{gasoline}} (mogas), and 10000 usgal L of JP-5 aviation fuel. The ship also had below deck berthing {{in the forward}} hull for a small battalion of Marine ground forces. A bow thruster and stern anchor was used for ship positioning during bow ramp operations, stern gate launchings, and beaching evolutions. The bow ramp itself was 112 ft long, and weighs 20 short ton t constructed from aluminum. The ramp was rated at 75 short ton t capacity (an M1A1 Tank weighs 70 short ton t) and when deployed, the aft end fits onto a [...] "king post", upon which it could swivel to a limited degree. The bow ramp (when deployed) {{is supported by a}} set of derrick arms, giving the ship its distinctive cross section. Aft of the bow ramp (when extended) is a vehicle ramp (known as the [...] "'tween decks ramp") which allows vehicles to proceed directly from the tank deck to the bow ramp, thence to the deployment site, beach or causeway. When the bow ramp is retracted, the 'tween decks ramp is located directly below and is raised and sealed to ensure water tight integrity between the main deck and the tank deck. A forward turntable facilitates maneuvering of various Marine and Seabee vehicles. At the aft end of the tank deck, another turntable likewise facilitates maneuvering of these vehicles and allows AAV (Marine [...] "LVTs"-Tracked Landing Vehicles) to launch directly into the water via the sterngate, which opens directly to the sea during [...] "launching operations". Four causeway sections could be mounted aft (two on the port side and two on the starboard) of the superstructure directly adjacent the flight deck; these were linked together to form a pontoon bridge which allowed offloading of vehicles when the ship was not to beach herself. These causeway sections were also lashed to the stern gate as needed; [...] "steel beach" [...] was a popular recreational activity for the crew while she was deployed. Causeway sections were married to the stern gate and the crew could enjoy barbecue, beer, and an occasional swim call. For helicopter operations, the ship had a 250 sqyd m2 landing pad aft of the smoke-stacks and twin 10 short ton t capacity <b>cargo</b> <b>winches.</b> A power-driven <b>cargo</b> hatch leads from the flight deck to the tank deck.|$|R
50|$|Although {{replacement}} of the midsection was the single largest change in the $15,000,000 process, many other important improvements were made during the conversion. A major modification was made to the stern, including a new counterbalanced rudder, new stern casting and struts, and new shorter propeller shafts and stern tubes. The latest in fueling and replenishment at sea equipment was also added, including kingposts with outriggers, ram tensioned span wires and high lines, electric hydraulic <b>winches,</b> <b>cargo</b> elevators, helicopter pickup area, and sliding blocks and cargo drop reels at replenishment stations. New electric pumps, larger cargo piping, and double-hose fueling rigs were also added, {{as well as a}} 4,500-kilowatt auxiliary diesel generator plant, and more enclosed stowage space. Habitability was also improved.|$|R
50|$|When Mal and Zoe {{board the}} train, they {{discover}} that an entire squad of Alliance troops is also aboard, though not specifically guarding the cargo. After the pair {{break into the}} locked train car and secure the crates, Jayne is lowered on a winch while Serenity maintains station over the speeding train. While they attach the <b>cargo</b> to the <b>winch,</b> a curious Fed trips a smoke trap Zoe set up at the car door. In the resulting chaos, a wounded Jayne is hoisted {{back to the ship}} along with the crates, Mal knocks out the Fed before he can see what is happening, and Mal and Zoe take advantage of another smoke bomb to reenter the passenger car without anyone the wiser.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{equipment}} on board ships is common. It assists in the work of: steering gear, pitch propellers, watertight doors, cargo hatch covers, <b>cargo</b> and mooring <b>winches,</b> deck cranes, stern ramps etc. The damage caused by transient flows (which include among others water hammer) are often impossible to repair at sea. Hence, {{it is very important}} to estimate the correct pressure runs and associated side effects during their design. The presented study compares the results of research on the impact of a simplified way of modeling the hydraulic resistance and simplified effective weighting functions build of two and three-terms on the estimated results of the pressure changes. As it turns out, simple effective two-terms weighting functions are able to accurately model the analyzed transients. The implementation of the presented method will soon allow current automatic protection of hydraulic systems of the adverse effects associated with frequent elevated and reduced pressures...|$|R
