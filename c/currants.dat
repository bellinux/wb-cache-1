5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, <b>currants</b> and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa {{as it is in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{were once}} {{popular in the}} United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of white pine blister rust, were {{considered}} {{a threat to the}} U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing <b>currants</b> was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market.|$|E

25|$|According to wine expert Oz Clarke, {{well made}} {{examples}} of Blaufränkisch will have notes of red <b>currants</b> and blackberry fruit. The grape {{does have the}} potential to have high tannins and acidity levels which can be moderated by harvest decisions and some oak aging. However, Clarke notes that wines from Blaufränkisch can take on too much oak flavoring and come across as excessively oaky. When blended with other varieties, Blaufränkisch often contributes acidity and structure to the blend.|$|E
25|$|At the time, scurvy was well-recognized, {{but there}} was a lack of clear {{understanding}} of how to prevent the disease. Nevertheless, pioneers' consumption of the wild berries (including chokeberry, gooseberry, and serviceberry) and <b>currants</b> that grew along the trail (particularly along the Platte River) and were consumed, helped make scurvy infrequent. Marcy's guide correctly suggested that the consumption of wild grapes, greens, and onions could help prevent the disease and that if vegetables were not available, citric acid could be drunk with sugar and water.|$|E
25|$|Apples, plums, and pears, which grow well in Lithuania, are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used fruit. Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas, and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews (kompots). Gooseberries (agrastai) and <b>currants</b> (serbentai) are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the health status of primary resources of 4 red <b>currant</b> cultivars, 1 white <b>currant</b> cultivar and 3 black <b>currant</b> cultivars and research of thermotherapy in 39 °C as a method of sanitation from viral diseases. BRV (Black <b>currant</b> reversion virus) and GVBaV (Gooseberry vein banding associated virus) were detected in some primary resources by PCR. SLRSV (Strawberry latent ringspot virus) was detected by ELISA testing in one bush of a red <b>currant.</b> Phytoplasmas were not present in tested plants. Based on the preliminary results of testing, one clone of red <b>currant</b> cultivar ´Rubigo´ was sanitated from GVBaV, one clone of red <b>currant</b> cultivar ´Detvan´ from mixed infection of two viruses SLRSV and BRV and two clones of white <b>currant</b> cultivar ´Orion´ from mixed infection of two viruses BRV and GVBaV. Both clones of red <b>currant</b> cultivar ´Vitan´ remained infected with one of two viruses (BRV or GVBaV), which were detected in initial bush before the beginning of thermotherapy...|$|R

25|$|The liquid used in Snap-dragon was {{typically}} brandy, although similar flammable liquors {{could also be}} used. Traditionally, raisins were the treat to be snatched; William Sandys specifies Málaga raisins. Other treats, however, could also be used. Of these, almonds were the most common alternative or addition, but <b>currants,</b> candied fruit, figs, grapes, and plums also featured. Salt could also be sprinkled in the bowl.

25|$|The {{abundant}} agave (mescal) {{was also}} important to the Mescalero, who gathered the crowns in late spring after reddish flower stalks appeared. The smaller sotol crowns were also important. Both crowns of both plants were baked and dried.

25|$|Greek cuisine is {{characteristic}} of the healthy Mediterranean diet, which is epitomized by dishes of Crete. Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients {{into a variety of}} local dishes such as moussaka, pastitsio, classic Greek salad, fasolada, spanakopita and souvlaki. Some dishes {{can be traced back to}} ancient Greece like skordalia (a thick purée of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), lentil soup, retsina (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki, grilled octopus and small fish, feta cheese, dolmades (rice, <b>currants</b> and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various pulses, olives and cheese. Olive oil is added to almost every dish.|$|E
25|$|Often {{the making}} of conserves can be trickier than making a {{standard}} jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for {{just enough time to}} allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and liquify. This process can also be achieved by spreading the dry sugar over raw fruit in layers, and leaving for several hours to steep into the fruit, then just heating the resulting mixture only to bring to the setting point. As a result of this minimal cooking, some fruits are not particularly suitable for making into conserves, because they require cooking for longer periods to avoid issues such as tough skins. <b>Currants</b> and gooseberries, and a number of plums are among these fruits.|$|E
25|$|With time, the {{shortage}} economy led to scarcity of meat, coffee, tea and other ingredients of daily use. Many products like chocolate, sugar and meat were rationed, {{with a specific}} limit depending on social class and health requirements. Physical workers and pregnant women were generally entitled to more food products. Imports were restricted, {{so much of the}} food supply was domestic. Cuisine became homogeneous, to be a chef was no longer a prestigious profession and for decades the country became basically disconnected from any foreign cuisine. Tropical fruits (citrus, banana, pineapple, etc.) were available during holidays and local fruits and vegetables were mostly seasonal but were available at private stands. For most of the year the Poles had to get by with only domestic winter fruit and vegetables: apples, plums, <b>currants,</b> onions, potatoes, cabbage, root vegetables and frozen products. Other food products (of foreign origins) were available at markets at high prices.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} characteristics of fruit spirits produced from three black <b>currant</b> cultivars (Malling Juel, Ometa and Ben Sarek) and two red <b>currant</b> cultivars (Rondom and Versailles) grown in Serbia were examined using gas chromatography.

Fruit spirits produced from black <b>currant</b> cultivars displayed the highest contents of methanol (267. 2 – 595. 0 g/hl A. A.) and amyl alcohols (74. 2 – 204. 8 g/hl A. A.). Total sensory scores of <b>currant</b> brandies ranged between 17. 60 and 18. 40, while <b>currant</b> brandy produced from the Ben Sarek black <b>currant</b> cultivar received the highest score (18. 40).
