S. is not well focused as it concentrates exclusively on control, and is thus totally marginal to the contemporary debates on the use of force to achieve national goals. He illustrates this point by looking to the most serious national defense reform initiatives from the Goldwater – Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 up until the current major effort, the Project on National Security Reform. He then applies this framework to the use of private security contractors (PSC) and finds that they are problematic both in terms of control and effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release: Distribution is unlimitedAfter {{the attacks of}} September 11, 2001, {{officials}} of the United States government {{realized that this was}} a new type of war that would be fought on all fronts, including inside the United States. For this reason, the Bush Administration reorganized {{a large part of the}} bureaucracy and spent billions of dollars to protect its citizens. This problem of terrorism, however, is a global problem and one that the United States shares with countries all over the world. The People's Republic of China and Singapore are the focus of this thesis in order to determine what if any homeland security policies developed by their governments could be used to better protect citizens of the United States. Several policies such as legislation, education and internal security measures were evaluated for the United States to institute. Each chosen policy is followed by a brief description of how these laws might come into being within the U. S. governmental system.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedSince 1989 {{the study of}} democratic <b>civil</b> <b>military</b> <b>relations</b> has undergone {{a revival of the}} formation of new theory. These concepts deal with civilian control of armed forces at a national level. Since {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the European employment of military forces within a multinational framework became a regularity, it is now pertinent to ask whether and how these concepts fit at the international level.
