In G-B, 1 <b>case</b> (III) died. In G-C, 1 <b>case</b> (I) died and 2 <b>cases</b> (I) deteriorated. Long-term follow-up result was as follow; excellent : 6 <b>cases,</b> good : 1 <b>case,</b> dead : 1 <b>case</b> in G-A, excellent : 3 <b>cases</b> in G-B, excellent : 20 <b>cases,</b> good : 1 <b>case,</b> poor : 5 <b>cases,</b> dead : 1 <b>case</b> in G-C.

Surgical results were not affected by division of PComA, intraoperative bleeding and use of temporary clip. Surgical results were not affected by the timing of the operation. Even though incidence of necessity of division of PComA and appearance of ifird nerve palsy was higher in early operation group than in delayed operation group. From these result, we can conclude that early operation will be indicated in <b>cases</b> with ruptured basilar aneurysms...|$|R

5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. The winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often for one or more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as the trout. The fish acquire them by two means, either plucking them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move about, or during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some <b>cased</b> caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may drift in great numbers either close to the bottom, in mid-water or just below the surface. The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{establishing}} his Hartford factory, Colt set out {{to establish}} a factory in Europe and chose London. He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park, London and ingratiated himself by presenting <b>cased</b> engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain's Master General of the Ordnance. At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns. As the world's leading proponent of mass production techniques, Colt went on to deliver a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in London. The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Silver Telford Medal. With help from ICE secretary, Charles Manby, Colt established his London operation near Vauxhall Bridge on the Thames River and began production on January 1, 1853. On {{a tour of the}} factory, Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he recorded his favorable comments of Colt's revolvers in an 1852 edition of Household Words. The factory's machines mass-produced its parts that were completely interchangeable and could be put together on assembly lines using standardized patterns and gauges by unskilled labor as opposed to England's top gun makers making each part by hand. Colt's London factory remained in operation for only four years. Unwilling to alter his open-top single-action design for the solid frame double-action revolver that the British asked for; Colt scarcely sold 23,000 revolvers to the British Army and Navy. In 1856 he closed the London plant and had the machinery, tooling, and unfinished guns shipped to Hartford.|$|E

They deployed to the Baghdad area, and took responsibility for the training of the Iraqi Police. The brigade is supporting Iraqi police logistics, personnel management, maintenance, budget, operations, training, leadership and judicial integration. Other training for Police units included proper search of vehicles, providing medical assistance to Iraqi civilians, as well as expanding the number of Iraqi police and improving their training overall. In theater, the brigade commanded over 5,000 soldiers. Units that the Brigade assumed control of included the 153rd Military Police Company of the Delaware Army National Guard and the 223rd Military Police Company of the Kentucky Army National Guard.

There were 16 <b>cases</b> (30 %) without any complications. All 6 epilepsy <b>cases</b> were diagnosed as primary enuresis with a normal level of arginine vasopressoin (AVP), but 2 <b>cases,</b> antiepileptic drugs (sodium valproate, carbamazepine) increased enuresis. Of the 52 <b>cases</b> studied, 19 <b>cases</b> (36. 5 %) had allergic complications such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis...|$|R
