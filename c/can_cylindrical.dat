40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a versatile closed, light (0, 9 kg), high temperature furnace adapted {{to the needs of}} a neutron four-circle diffractometer is reported. It operates between 330 and 1 200 K with a long term stability of better than 0. 05 K. There are few restrictions on the movement of the circles; only the Φ-range is limited to 200 °. The furnace operates under high vacuum (typically ∼ 10 - 5 mbar) with a water-cooled base. The temperature is controlled by 3 chromel-alumel thermocouples, one of which is flexible to allow it to be fixed directly at the sample. The maximum electrical power requirement is ∼ 60 W. Only 2 thin-walled (0. 1 mm) vanadium reflectors and an outer spherical aluminium <b>can</b> (<b>cylindrical</b> Al can in a former version) are in the neutron beam. The furnace was used successfully e. g. to collect data of the incommensurate phase at the α-β transition of quartz...|$|E

In general, a {{triangular array}} shows a better economical way for loading <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cans</b> in a box.

However, human limbs may be conically-shaped (i.e. tapered), particularly in extremely muscular or obese individuals. Applying a cylindrical cuff on a tapered limb can result in poor fit, sliding of the cuff distally on the limb during the procedure, and inability to achieve a bloodless field at normal pressures.|$|R

The branches <b>can</b> be <b>cylindrical</b> or flattened, with a pointed or rounded apex, and {{the texture of}} the flesh can be brittle or fairly tough, and in various colours. Hyphae are more or less swollen, with clamps. The basidia are mostly four-spored. Spores are broadly ellipsoid or roughly spherical, with a maximum length of 5.5 μm. They are hyaline, finely echinulate or warted, and each contains a large oil-drop or guttule.|$|R

50|$|In three {{dimensions}} we <b>can</b> distinguish <b>cylindrical</b> symmetry and spherical symmetry (no change when rotating about one axis, or for any rotation). That is, no {{dependence on the}} angle using cylindrical coordinates and no dependence on either angle using spherical coordinates. The fundamental domain is a half-plane through the axis, and a radial half-line, respectively. Axisymmetric or axisymmetrical are adjectives which refer to an object having cylindrical symmetry, or axisymmetry. An example of approximate spherical symmetry is the Earth (with respect to density and other physical and chemical properties).|$|R
50|$|In the {{developed}} world, sewers are pipes from buildings {{to one or}} more levels of larger underground trunk mains, which transport the sewage to sewage treatment facilities. Vertical pipes, usually made of precast concrete, called manholes, connect the mains to the surface. Depending upon site application and use, these vertical pipes <b>can</b> be <b>cylindrical,</b> eccentric or concentric. The manholes are used for access to the sewer pipes for inspection and maintenance, and as a means to vent sewer gases. They also facilitate vertical and horizontal angles in otherwise straight pipelines.|$|R

50|$|Cave pearls {{are usually}} spherical, {{but can also}} have other shapes. The reason cave pearls tend to be round is not their rotation, but rather that their growth is steady and uniform. Because a spherical shape allows the {{greatest}} amount of deposition for the smallest surface area, a cave pearl tends to end up spherical even if its nucleus is highly irregular. Sometimes several cave pearls stick together to form a shape that resembles a bunch of grapes. In addition to the typical spherical shape, cave pearls <b>can</b> be <b>cylindrical,</b> elliptical, cubical, hexagonal, discoid, or irregular.|$|R

These non-cylindrical castings include ball valve balls, gear blanks, and conical shaped parts. Unlike the horizontal method, no slip occurs between the metal and mold due to the constant resultant force applied during rotation.|$|R

Each end carries a [...] "force" [...] along the asymptotic axis of the unduloid (where n is the circumference of the necks), the sum of which must be balanced for the surface to exist. Current work involves classification of families of embedded CMC surfaces in terms of their moduli spaces.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of a non-rotating single-component jet using two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. By assuming translational invariance along the jet axis, we exclude the destabilization effect by Kelvin-Helmholtz mode. The nonlinear evolution of the transverse structure of the jet with a normal jet velocity is highlighted. An intriguing finding in our study is that Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmeier-Meshkov type instabilities <b>can</b> destroy <b>cylindrical</b> jet configuration {{as a result of}} spontaneously induced radial oscillating motion. This is powered by in-situ energy conversion between the thermal and bulk kinetic energies. The effective inertia ratio of the jet to the surrounding medium η determines a threshold for the onset of instabilities. The condition η < 1 should be satisfied for the transverse structure of the jet being persisted. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letter...|$|R
50|$|Fullspot {{developed}} the O clock in 2010, a watch with a silicone strap and interchangeable faces. The original {{face of the}} watch, now called 'O clock Classic' consisted of a plain white face without numbers. The face can {{be removed from the}} strap allowing the colour of the strap or face to be changed. There were originally 15 straps but this has grown to 29 which are still in production. Fullspot’s watch packaging takes inspiration from the tin <b>can,</b> a <b>cylindrical</b> tin with a ring pull. O clock developed into a series with the Tone on Tone range consisting of 21 watch face colours to mix and match with 21 straps making a total of 441 possible combinations with Tone on Tone. Other O clock ranges include Camouflage, 80’ clock, Disney, Gold & Silver, Mirror, Numbers, Flower Power and Safari.|$|R
40|$|Classical {{lamination}} theory {{predicts that}} the room-temperature shapes of all elevated-temperature cure, unsymmetrically laminated composites are saddles. However, experimental observation indicates that the shapes are often cylindrical. In addition, a second <b>cylindrical</b> <b>can</b> sometimes {{be obtained from the}} first by a simple snap-through action. A geometrically nonlinear extension to classical lamination theory is used to explain this behavior. Approximate solutions to the nonlinear extension are obtained by using a Rayleigh-Ritz minimization of the laminate's total potential energy.

40|$|History is {{a dynamic}} {{tapestry}} of facts and perceptions, dates and personalities. This work attempts to capture the events and rational of those who {{contributed significantly to the}} use of gyratory compaction in the design and field management of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) and discusses the challenges ahead. Throughout the evolution of asphalt mix design; several different types of laboratory compaction devices have been developed. In general, the goal of these laboratory devices is to fabricate a specimen for volumetric and/or physical characterization. Depending on the system, specimens <b>can</b> be <b>cylindrical,</b> trapezoidal, or rectangular in shape and compaction can be achieved through impact, kneading, or vibration. Gyratory compaction applies a kneading effort to fabricate cylindrical specimens. Gyratory compaction has undergone an evolution resulting in several unique devices and a variety of methods, (Table 1).

50|$|The fiddle wiener is {{widespread}} in the Gobi areas of central Mongolia and among Eastern Mongols, the Khuuchir and Dorvon Chikhtei Khuur being a two and four stringed spiked fiddle respectively. The resonator <b>can</b> be <b>cylindrical</b> or polygonal and made of either wood or metal. The face is covered with sheep or snakeskin with the belly or back left open to act as the sound hole. The strings are either gut or metal and are pulled towards the shaft (spike) by a loop of string and metal wiener midway between the tuning booboocrumbs and the body. A horse-hair bow is threaded between the strings which are tuned a fifth apart. The Darhats of Hövsgöl province, north-west Mongolia, call it hyalgasan huur, and by predominantly female ensemble-performers. The 12th-century Yüan-Shih describes the two-string fiddle, xiqin, bowed {{with a piece of}} bamboo between the strings, used by Mongols.
