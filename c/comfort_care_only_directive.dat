50|$|Hospice is a {{group that}} {{provides}} care {{at the home of}} a person that has an advanced illness with a likely prognosis of less than 6 months. As most treatments for cancer involve significant unpleasant side effects, a patient with little realistic hope of a cure or prolonged life may choose to seek <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> <b>only,</b> forgoing more radical therapies in exchange for a prolonged period of normal living. This is an especially important aspect of care for those patients whose disease is not a good candidate for other forms of treatment. In these patients, the risks related to the chemotherapy may actually be higher than the chance of responding to the treatment, making further attempts to cure the disease impossible. Of note, patients on hospice can sometimes still get treatments such as radiation therapy if it is being used to treat symptoms, not as an attempt to cure the cancer.|$|R
40|$|Anhydrous ammonia is a {{toxic gas}} widely {{used as a}} fertilizer. In 2016 about 12 million tons of ammonia {{were used in the}} {{production}} of fertilizers. We are reporting a case of severe pulmonary toxicity from anhydrous ammonia fertilizer exposure. An 80 -year-old male farmer was accidentally exposed to anhydrous ammonia released from a pressurized fertilizer tank. He was intubated due to upper airway inhalation injury. Bronchoscopy showed extensive lower airway mucosal damage. The sloughed bronchial mucosa was removed from obstructed bronchi using a cryoprobe. He developed acute respiratory distress managed with lung protective mechanical ventilation. He did not improve and tracheostomy was recommended. The patient’s family opted for <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> <b>only.</b> Anhydrous ammonia can cause pulmonary toxicity. Symptoms range from mild to severe and can be fatal at doses greater than 5, 000 parts per million. Early inspection of the upper respiratory tract and securing an airway are lifesaving. Management is supportive with oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Education, the use of protective gear, and proper equipment handling are key steps in the prevention of accidental toxicity...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Physicians {{often fail}} to use lung-protective {{ventilation}} (LPV) in patients with acute lung injury. OBJECTIVE: To use physician documentation to identify why physicians did not initiate or continue LPV in patients with acute lung injury. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study in a university hospital. The study period was September 2000 through November 2002. In our primary analysis, LPV was defined as use of a tidal volume < 7. 5 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we defined LPV as use of a tidal volume < 6. 0 mL/kg PBW. RESULTS: In our primary analysis, in 42 (56 %) of 75 cases, physicians used or intended to use LPV. Of these 42 subjects, 12 received LPV transiently, and 6 never received LPV, {{despite the fact that}} the physician ordered or documented LPV use. In 21 of the 33 remaining cases the physicians documented concerns or clinical criteria that may explain why LPV was not used: relative contraindications to LPV (n 2), change of <b>care</b> goal to <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> <b>only</b> (n 1), rapid resolution of hypoxemia (n 4), and consideration of alternative diagnoses for which LPV was not indicated (n 14). Of the 12 cases where LPV was used transiently, diagnostic uncertainty (n 6) was a common finding. The sensitivity analysis yielded explanations in similar proportions. CONCLUSIONS: LPV, once initiated, is often discontinued. Uncertainty in the diagnosis of acute lung injury appears to be an important barrier to initiating and continuing LPV, whereas concerns regarding metabolic acidosis and clinical changes (hypoxemia improved) may prevent the initiation of LPV. Even when physicians believe they are using LPV, they may not be, which suggests that protocol-implementation failure is an important barrier to use of LPV.

Methods: Surveyed 295 obstetricians on their likelihood (0 – 10) of offering induction for periviable PPROM across 10 vignettes. 22 -week vignettes were analyzed, stratified by parental resuscitation preference. Bivariate analyses identified physician characteristics associated with reported likelihood ratings. Results: Obstetricians (N= 205) were {{not likely to}} offer induction.

40|$|Multiple {{fusiform}} aneurysms {{occurring in}} a single patient are very uncommon. Fusiform aneurysms affecting the anterior circulation are extremely rare and reported cases involve the middle cerebral artery and internal carotid artery. We report here {{a case of a}} 55 -year-old African American male who had a history of multiple strokes and who was found unresponsive prior to his latest hospital admission. Neuroimaging was remarkable for multiple fusiform aneurysms involving segments of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries as well as subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Unfortunately even after aggressive medical management, the patient did not show any signs of recovery and further management entailed <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> measures <b>only.</b> The patient passed away shortly thereafter. Post-mortem examination confirmed the presence of multiple fusiform aneurysms with involvement of both the posterior and anterior circulation including the anterior cerebral artery as well as subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Interestingly, there was no apparent site of aneurysm rupture identified to explain the hemorrhage. Our case is unusual in that the multiple fusiform aneurysms were found to extensively involve both the anterior and posterior circulation. Furthermore, our case demonstrates involvement of the anterior cerebral artery by fusiform aneurysms, which is also a very rare event...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a video decision support tool on the preferences for future medical care in older people if they develop advanced dementia, and the stability of those preferences after six weeks. Design Randomised controlled trial conducted between 1 September 2007 and 30 May 2008. Setting Four primary care clinics (two geriatric and two adult medicine) affiliated with three academic medical centres in Boston. Participants Convenience sample of 200 older people (≥ 65 years) living in the community with previously scheduled appointments at one of the clinics. Mean age was 75 and 58 % were women. Intervention Verbal narrative alone (n= 106) or with a video decision support tool (n= 94). Main outcome measures Preferred goal of care: life prolonging care (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation), limited care (admission to hospital, antibiotics, but not cardiopulmonary resuscitation), or <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> (treatment <b>only</b> to relieve symptoms). Preferences after six weeks. The principal category for analysis was the difference in proportions of participants in each group who preferred <b>comfort</b> <b>care.</b> Results Among participants receiving the verbal narrative alone, 68 (64 %) chose <b>comfort</b> <b>care,</b> 20 (19 %) chose limited care, 15 (14 %) chose life prolonging care, and three (3 %) were uncertain. In the video group, 81 (86 %) chose <b>comfort</b> <b>care,</b> eight (9 %) chose limited care, four (4 %) chose life prolonging care, and one (1 %) was uncertain (χ 2 = 13. 0, df= 3, P= 0. 003). Among all participants the factors associated with a greater likelihood of opting for <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> were being a college graduate or higher, good or better health status, greater health literacy, white race, and randomisation to the video arm. In multivariable analysis, participants in the video group were more likely to prefer <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> than those in the verbal group (adjusted odds ratio 3. 9, 95 % confidence interval 1. 8 to 8. 6). Participants were re-interviewed after six weeks. Among the 94 / 106 (89 %) participants re-interviewed in the verbal group, 27 (29 %) changed their preferences (κ= 0. 35). Among the 84 / 94 (89 %) participants re-interviewed in the video group, five (6 %) changed their preferences (κ= 0. 79) (P< 0. 001 for difference). Conclusion Older people who view a video depiction of a patient with advanced dementia after hearing a verbal description of the condition are more likely to opt for comfort as their goal of care compared with those who solely listen to a verbal description. They also have more stable preferences over time. Trial registration Clinicaltrials. gov NCT 00704886.

40|$|ObjectivesOur {{institution}} treats about 30 patients {{per year}} with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA). Between 2002 and 2007, our 30 -day mortality averaged 58 %. In July 2007, we implemented an algorithm to promote endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) when feasible. This report describes the outcome with this approach. MethodsData on patients presenting with rAAA between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2007, were reviewed {{and used for}} comparison to prospectively collected data. Data on patients presenting between July 1, 2007, and April 30, 2009, were collected on all patients after implementation of a structured protocol. The primary outcome measure was 30 -day mortality. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a log-rank test were performed to compare survival times for three groups (pre-protocol, post-protocol with open surgery, and post-protocol with EVAR). ResultsDuring the study period, 187 patients with rAAA presented to our institution. Before implementation of the algorithm, 131 patients with rAAA presented and 128 were treated. The 30 -day mortality rate was 57. 8 %. After implementation of the protocol, 56 patients with rAAA were managed. Twenty-seven patients (48 %) underwent successful EVAR, and 24 patients (43 %) underwent open repair. Five patients (9 %) underwent <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> <b>only.</b> In the post-protocol period, 5 patients in the EVAR group (18. 5 %) and 13 patients in the open group (54. 2 %) died during the follow-up period for an overall 30 -day mortality rate of 35. 3 % (P =. 008 vs 57. 8 % pre-protocol). After implementation of a structured protocol for managing rAAA, there was a relative risk reduction in 30 -day mortality of 35 % compared to the time before implementation of the protocol (95 % confidence interval [CI], 14 %- 51 %) corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 22. 5 % (95 % CI, 6. 8 %- 38. 2 %) and an odds ratio of 0. 40 (95 % CI, 0. 20 - 0. 78; P =. 007). After adjusting for key factors predicting mortality, the odds ratio is 0. 25 (95 % CI, 0. 10 - 0. 57; P =. 001). ConclusionUse of an algorithm favoring endovascular repair resulted in a highly significant reduction in rAAA mortality in our urban hospital. Thirty-day mortality for open repair was no different between pre- and post-protocol eras. With modern techniques of resuscitation and surgical management, a majority of patients presenting with rAAA can survive...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundLow {{birth weight}} and {{prematurity}} and are known risks for mortality in congenital heart lesions. It {{is not known}} whether risks of delayed intervention are offset by benefits of growth and maturation. We explored this question. MethodsAll 1618 infants admitted to our institution within 30 days after birth for a congenital heart defect since 2000 were analyzed. Birth details and admission progress notes were detailed on all. For infants requiring cardiac interventions, clinical conference records and progress notes enabled their management to be classified as either USUAL (normal timing and mode of intervention) or DELAYED (intentional delay for growth/maturation). The survival implications of birth weight and prematurity were examined via parametric multiphase methodology with bootstrap resampling. Subsequently, the impact of DELAYED management was sought in propensity-adjusted and multivariable time-related models. ResultsLow birth weight is a strong, robust and independent predictor of death within {{the first year of}} life (P < . 0001; 99. 6 % bootstrap resamples). The relationship is nonlinear with an inflection point at approximately 2. 0 kg, below which decrements in survival are increasingly pronounced. Prematurity is also associated with poor outcome but less reliably so (P < . 0001; 53 % resamples); its variance appears partially mitigated by colinearity with multiple factors including diagnosis and chromosomal aneuploidy. Of the 149 infants with birth weight less than 2. 0 kg (highest risk and most likely to receive delayed care in this cohort), care was USUAL in 34 and DELAYED in 46. The remaining children received <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> <b>only</b> (27), were not considered for intervention owing to severe noncardiac problems (12) or were routinely observed for nonurgent lesions (30). Survival between the children weighing less than 2. 0 kg and receiving USUAL or DELAYED care was identical (78 % ± 2 % at 1 year; P = . 88), even when adjusted via propensity score (P =  0. 65) or multivariable analysis (P =  0. 55). Major determinants of death in this very low-birth-weight population were antenatal diagnosis (P = . 01), presence of congenital gastrointestinal defects (P = . 07), or lesion type (all higher risk: anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, P = . 03; pulmonary atresia and intact septum, P = . 05; and truncus, P = . 01). ConclusionsFor very low-birth-weight neonates (< 2. 0 kg) with congenital heart defects, imposed delays in intervention neither compromise nor improve survival. Other factors instead appear to account for survival differences, including lesion type, associated noncardiac congenital defects, and antenatal diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{end of life}} practices among hospitalised {{children who}} died of HIV/AIDS. Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: A public, secondary and tertiary children's teaching hospital in a developing country. Patients: A consecutive series of in-patient deaths among HIV-infected children. Main Outcome Measures: Identification of patients as dying, presence of do not resuscitate (DNR) orders, documentation of <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> plans, whether end of life decisions were discussed with parents or caretakers, nature of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the last 24 hours of life, and presence of pain and distress in the last 48 hours of life. Results: 165 out of 167 in-patient deaths were reviewed. 79 % of patients died in the general wards. The median age of patients was 4 months. The median length of hospitalisation was 6 days. 30 % of patients fell in Category B. Patients with shorter lengths of stay {{were more likely to}} fall in Category B (median 4 days versus 7 days, P= 0. 0000). About 1 quarter of patients had a median length of stay of 25 days. 84 % of patients had a DNR order, with a median of 4 days between admission and documentation of the order. DNR orders appeared simultaneously in only 41 % of medical and nursing entries. 39 % and 63 % respectively of doctors did not document their justification for the DNR order or whether it had been discussed with parents. 50 % of patients were identified as dying. Terminology such as 'TLC' and 'keep comfortable' designated 44 % of patients to receive <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> <b>only.</b> The median time between admission and identifying a patient as dying and documenting a comfort plan was 5 days and 7 days respectively. In 44 % of folders there was no indication of whether the comfort plan had been discussed with parents. 73 % and 62 % respectively of patients with comfort plans received IV fluids and IV antibiotics in their last 24 hours of life. 55 % of patients who died in general wards experienced pain and distress in the last 48 hours of life. Respiratory symptomatology and oral and oesophageal candidiasis accounted for most discomfort. 2 in 5 patients with a comfort plan failed to receive analgesia, despite pain and distress. Conclusions: Despite extreme diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty, doctors made key end of life decisions. Doctors' practices often failed to meet procedural and ethical requirements in professional guidelines. Failure to discuss DNR orders or comfort plans with parents ignores their role as principal decision makers for their children. The low rate of comfort plans, compared to DNR orders, suggests doctors had difficulty making the transition from curative to palliative <b>care.</b> Many <b>comfort</b> plans were incoherent and included interventions neither meant for, nor likely to promote patients' comfort. Whilst fear of hastening death may explain doctors' reluctance to prescribe adequate analgesia, undertreating pain and distress in a dying child is of more concern morally and medically than the risk of suppressing respiratory effort. To achieve better end of life care for HIV-infected children, {{it will be necessary to}} improve practice patterns.

40|$|Background: Many {{people with}} {{dementia}} die in long-term care settings. These patients {{may benefit from}} a palliative care goal, focused on comfort. Admission {{may be a good}} time to revisit or develop care plans. Objective: To describe care goals in nursing home patients with dementia and factors associated with establishing a <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> goal. Design: We used generalized estimating equation regression analyses for baseline analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses for longitudinal analyses. Setting: Prospective data collection in 28 Dutch facilities, mostly nursing homes (2007 - 2010; Dutch End of Life in Dementia study, DEOLD). Results: Eight weeks after admission (baseline), 56. 7 % of 326 patients had a <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> goal. At death, 89. 5 % had a <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> goal. Adjusted for illness severity, patients with a baseline <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> goal were more likely to have a religious affiliation, to be less competent to make decisions, and to have a short survival prediction. Their families were less likely to prefer life-prolongation and more likely to be satisfied with family-physician communication. Compared with patients with a <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> goal established later during their stay, patients with a baseline <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> goal also more frequently had a more highly educated family member. Conclusions: Initially, over half of the patients had a care goal focused on comfort, increasing to the large majority of the patients at death. Optimizing patient-family-physician communication upon admission may support the early establishing of a <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> goal. Patient condition and family views play a role, and physicians should be aware that religious affiliation and education may also affect the (timing of) setting a <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> goal...|$|R

40|$|Background: Families of {{patients}} with advanced dementia need to be informed about {{the course of the}} dementia and <b>comfort</b> <b>care.</b> Conditional for health care providers educating families is their knowledge and comfort in family education. Methods: Perceived usefulness and acceptability of a Canadian family booklet explaining possible complications and <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> in dementia was assessed by physicians and nurses caring for dementia patients in 14 nursing homes in Lombardy, Italy and 21 in the Netherlands. The practitioners received a questionnaire and translated versions adapted to local practice where needed. In 10 of 21 Dutch homes, physicians evaluated only the original Canadian version in English. A 15 -item scale assessed the booklet's acceptability, for example, to inform families, or for educational purposes. Perceived usefulness referred to proportion of families of dementia patients for whom the booklet would be useful. A total of 168 evaluations were available for multivariable regression analyses. Results: The practitioners anticipated that the booklet would be useful for most families. Evaluation of the Dutch translation of the booklet was similar to the English version. Country (Netherlands) and profession (nurses) were independently associated with better acceptability. Usefulness was perceived as better by Italian respondents and nurses, but only in analyses unadjusted for the higher educational needs of these respondents. Conclusion: Overall, the concept of written information on <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> was appreciated by practitioners of European countries differing in attitudes toward end-of-life care.

In the past two decades, palliative surgery and cardiac transplantation have become management options, in addition to <b>comfort</b> <b>care</b> for the infant. These innovations have forced parents and physicians to make difficult decisions because the long term results of the additional treatment options are not known. This article describes the current risk factors, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Prenatal diagnosis provides families with time for counselling and for becoming more informed about management options. Surgical therapy provides hope for the survival of these infants, but their long term outcomes are not well defined. <b>Comfort</b> <b>care</b> in either the home or hospital remains an acceptable management option. More investigations to determine the long term outcome following palliative surgery and transplantation are needed before they become the standards of care...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{aimed to}} {{describe}} management strategies for neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome {{over the past}} 18 years in the United States and to identify determinants of institutional management decisions. MethodsNeonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were retrospectively identified by use of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 1988 – 2005. Treatment was categorized as (1) transplantation, (2) Norwood operation (as defined by Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery), (3) transfer to another facility, or (4) no surgical intervention (<b>comfort</b> <b>care).</b> ResultsA total of 3286 neonates were identified, yielding a national estimate of 16, 781 ± 586 cases. Of these, 2 % (348 ± 47) underwent transplantation, 16 % (2767 ± 286) had Norwood operations, 25 % (4143 ± 156) were transferred to another facility, and 57 % (9523 ± 436) had <b>comfort</b> <b>care.</b> Changes in practice patterns occurred over time, with {{an increasing number of}} neonates undergoing Norwood, concomitant with decreasing numbers undergoing transplantation (P <. 001). Bias toward the Norwood operation over time paralleled a significant, nearly linear decrease in the in-hospital mortality rate for the Norwood operation, from 86 % in the earliest sextile to 24 % in the most recent sextile (P <. 001). Prevalence of transfer to definitive care hospitals remained constant over time, as did the number of infants (approximately half) who received no surgery (<b>comfort</b> <b>care).</b> ConclusionsDespite improved surgical outcomes, the majority of infants continue to receive no surgical care. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of infants offered the Norwood operation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome over the past 2 decades, which seems to have come mostly owing to a decrease of transplants. The advent of prenatal diagnosis has not decreased the proportion of neonates born at institutions unequipped to provide definitive care...|$|R
