An early relative dominance of the components was observed for the stimuli whose components were <b>closed</b> <b>figures.</b> These results suggest that uniform connectedness is not necessary for the designation of entry-level units. Disconnected line segments are rapidly organized into configurations, provided the presence of collinearity and/or closure.

The novel aspect of the work described in this paper is the presentation of a new integrated methodology for employing multiple interpretations from different analytical levels of images for image retrieval. In achieving this objective, we extract local features as well as features of the <b>closed</b> <b>figures</b> of images. In deriving alternative interpretations of the images, a segment level gestalt grouping method based on a modification of Sarkar and Boyer’s method is used.

50|$|The second {{experiment}} {{tested the}} watercolor effect versus good continuation. In good continuation, the smooth continuation areas {{tend to be}} grouped together. With different variations of a square-wave pattern and basic contours with fringes, the good continuation of the stimuli was studied. It was determined that the uniform watercolor illusion is seen in only closed space. The third experiment studied the watercolor illusion stimulus against the idea of closure and surroundness. According to the closure principle, piece creating a <b>closed</b> <b>figure</b> are grouped together. When one region encompasses another region completely, the surrounding region is perceived as ground, and the feature that is perceived as figure according to the surroundness principle. When the four purple rectangles were surrounded by a larger rectangle, the large rectangle was rarely perceived as figure while the four rectangles were seen as figures. When orange contours bordered {{the inside of the}} large rectangle, but outside the four smaller rectangles, the larger rectangle was perceived as figure while the small rectangles were perceived as holes. This showed that the closure and surroundness were weaker than the watercolor illusion.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the exchange's index {{provides}} a standard case example of large errors arising from seemingly innocuous floating point calculations. In January 1982 the index was initialized at 1000 and subsequently updated and truncated to three decimal places on each trade. Such a thing was done about 3000 times each day. The accumulated truncations led to an erroneous loss of around 25 points per month. Over the weekend of November 25-28, 1983, the error was corrected, raising {{the value of the}} index from its Friday <b>closing</b> <b>figure</b> of 524.811 to 1098.892.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively {{think of}} {{configurations}} {{of objects and}} materials {{that could have been}} differently arranged. E.g. the tea is on the top shelf and the coffee is on a lower shelf, but {{it might have been the}} case that both were on the lower shelf, or both on the top shelf, or the tea on the lower shelf and the coffee on the top shelf. Moreover, there might have been nothing on the top shelf (at that time), or there might have been nothing but a mouse there. Anyone who considers rearranging contents of a cupboard, or furniture of a room, or possible items to serve for a meal is using this concept of alethic possibility. If you try to draw a planar convex <b>closed</b> <b>figure</b> with four sides and exactly three corners you will find that is impossible: an example of alethic impossibility. Such a figure with four sides necessarily has four corners: that's an example of alethic necessity. Ordinary uses of these concepts do not seem to require the ability to think about collections of complete possible universes, merely rearrangements of portions of this universe.|$|E

Our solution works by using a simulated annealer to optimize over a parameterization of the "isohedral" tilings, a class of tilings that is flexible enough to encompass nearly all of Escher's own tilings, and yet simple enough to be encoded and explored by a computer. We also describe a representation for isohedral tilings that allows for highly interactive viewing and rendering. We demonstrate the use of these tools [...] -along with several additional techniques for adding decorations to tilings [...] -with a variety of original ornamental designs.

40|$|The {{circumstances}} under which the shapes of figure versus ground regions are perceived and remembered were investigated in three experiments that replicate, extend, and clarify Rubin’s (1921) classic study on this topic. In Experiment 1, observers reported which of two regions they perceived as figure within ambiguous, bipartite, 2 -D displays. In a later shape recognition test, the shapes of regions previously seen as figures were remembered well, but the shapes of regions previously seen as grounds were remembered no better than novel distracter regions. Experiment 2 examined the same question about memory for the shape of figure versus ground regions in nested displays in which the central region could be perceived either as a <b>closer</b> <b>figure</b> surrounded by a farther ground (i. e., as a solid object) or as a farther ground surrounded by a <b>closer</b> <b>figure</b> (i. e., as an empty hole). Unlike Experiment 1, the shapes of regions initially perceived as grounds (holes) were remembered {{as well as those}} of regions initially perceived as figures (solid objects), and much better than those of novel distracter regions. Experiment 3 further demonstrated that this outcome did not depend on the figure-ground instructions employed in Experiment 2, because the same result was obtained using unambiguous 3 -D cardboard displays of objects versus holes with no figure-ground instructions at all.

50|$|Ethnohistorian Susan Gillespie {{has argued}} that the Nahua {{understanding}} of history as repeating itself in cycles also led to a subsequent rationalization of the events of the conquests. In this interpretation the description of Moctezuma, the final ruler of the Aztec Empire prior to the Spanish conquest, was tailored to fit the role of earlier rulers of ending dynasties—for example Quetzalcoatl, the mythical last ruler of the Toltecs. In any case it is within the realm of possibility that the description of Moctezuma in post-conquest sources was colored by his role as a monumental <b>closing</b> <b>figure</b> of Aztec history.|$|R
