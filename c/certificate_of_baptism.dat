25|$|The {{birthplace of}} Howard Hughes is {{recorded}} as either Humble or Houston, Texas. The date remains uncertain due to conflicting dates from various sources. He repeatedly claimed that his birthday was on Christmas Eve. A 1941 affidavit birth certificate of Hughes that {{was signed by}} his aunt Annette Gano Lummis and Estelle Boughton Sharp states that he was born on December 24, 1905, in Harris County, Texas. However, his <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>baptism</b> recorded on October 7, 1906, in the parish register of St. John's Episcopal Church in Keokuk, Iowa, listed his birth as September 24, 1905 without any reference {{to the place of}} birth.|$|E

[...] The Baronet was made to become a reformed character. But in all those days at the lonely Towers, and in the intervals of arguing with the poor Duchess, I could not but meet Gwyneth Birkenhead. We met, not as cousins, for Miss Birkenhead had only too clearly appreciated the situation from the moment she first met me. The old seneschal, too, was in the secret; I don't know {{what the rest of the}} menials thought. They were accustomed to the Duchess. But if Gwyneth and I did not meet as cousins, we met as light-hearted young people, in a queer situation, and in a strange, dismal old house.|$|E

50|$|In France, {{the first}} general {{hospitals}} were established during the 17th century. Paris established its general hospital in 1656, and it contained three divisions for men, women, and children - the Bicêtre, the Saltpêtrière, and Pitié respectively. The Saltpêtrière became famous, especially for its patient population of mostly prostitutes, {{and also for}} becoming the largest hospital {{in the world by}} 1789. The original purpose of these general hospitals was for them to function as form of social control over the poor, and encouraged by their success, Louis XIV mandated that all cities of a certain population in France have a general hospital. Historians debate as to these institutions effectiveness in actually controlling the population. Though hospitals were used to house specific groups of people (orphans, the poor, prostitutes, immigrants), they were also legitimately involved in their care, and were not just another form of penitentiary. At this point in time hospital medicine was still fundamentally spiritual institutions, focused on nursing, general and spiritual care. Oftentimes a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>baptism</b> and a confession were entry requirements for French hospitals.|$|E

Masłowski's grandfather from his mother, Wincenty Danilewicz, (Ostoja coat of arms, born in 1787 in Mińsk Lit. - former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth territory), was involved - as light-cavalryman - in the Napoleonic campaign, for which he was awarded the French Order of Legion of Honour.

5000|$|In 1791 Antoinette {{returned}} to Paris for a while, ostensibly {{to attend to}} various business matters which still needed to be settled. She remained there until early 1792, when, around {{the time she was}} entering the second trimester of a pregnancy, she left for Milan. On 26 June 1792 she gave birth to a son, who was baptized Pierre-Antoine-Emmanuel-Jules at a church in Greco (which nowadays forms part of Milan, but in 1792 was a separate municipality) two days later. The actual birthplace of Jules (as he was known) is uncertain, but it is reasonable to suppose that it was either Milan itself, or somewhere in its immediate neighbourhood. One view is that, during her confinement, Antoinette took lodgings at the house of a Dr Moscati, who lived in a small village outside Milan. D'Antraigues's presence in the Milan area did not pass unobserved - on 11 February 1792 the Archduke Ferdinand notified Vienna that d'Antraigues was [...] "visiting M.lle Saint-Huberti"(sic), who was believed to be recovering from an illness, and it had been thought prudent to place him under surveillance. Because of d'Antraigues's wish that their marriage should still remain a secret, Antoinette's chamber-maid, Madame Sibot, was declared to be the mother of the child, although on the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>baptism</b> d'Antraigues acknowledged paternity and gave Jules his surname. Mme. Sibot and her husband were asked to attend to the child's upbringing, and were requested to pass the boy as their own. As soon as Antoinette was fit enough to travel, the family and the servants {{returned to}} the Villa Turconi. D'Antraigues and Antoinette were destined to have no further children, although Pingaud contends that an earlier child, who lived only briefly, had been born to the couple soon after their relationship started.|$|E
40|$|Demographic studies {{repeatedly}} {{indicate that}} human births tend to fluctuate in a seasonal pattern, particularly in agricultural groups.

The data set consists <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>baptisms</b> from 1851 to 1901 collected at the Parish of San Miguel de Escazú, Costa Rica. The data are an accurate reflection of the actual number of births in the population because even new born infants who appeared to be in imminent danger of dying (and who subsequently did) were baptized. The baptism series was analyzed by fitting an ARIMA model (0, 1, 1) and cross-correlating it with two climatic series: rainfall and temperature. The autocorrelation analysis <b>of</b> the <b>baptism</b> data fails to demonstrate any cyclical pattern of births in Escazú. Moreover, {{there is no indication that}} temperature or rainfall influences the frequency of births. This lack of seasonality is unexpected in an agrarian population such as Escazú. The results of this analysis indicate that human fertility cycles might not be as prevalent as previously thought...|$|R
