5|$|According to the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA) {{installed}} geothermal <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States grew by 5%, or 147.05 MW, ce {{the last}} annual survey in March 2012.

5|$|By 17 August 1942, {{production}} {{had climbed}} rapidly after Blohm & Voss BV 138 production was scaled down and licence work had shut down at WFG.

During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier.

The Confederate army launched a daring and successful flank attack against the Army of the Potomac at Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, during which the 22nd saw little action. The Union army, badly defeated, retreated back across the Rappahannock and the 22nd returned to Camp Gove on May 8.|$|E

5|$|The Corn Exchange, {{situated}} at the junction of Bank Street and Elwick Road, opened on 3 December 1861.

5|$|The {{crossing}} {{is problematic}} because passing freight trains often result in delays both on Route 126, {{as well as}} Route 135 which crosses it {{just south of the}} tracks. The frequent blockage of the crossing by passing trains reduces <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intersection by 21% during the morning rush and 16% in the afternoon, resulting in delays and traffic jams in the downtown area. Increased service levels planned by the MBTA would result in morning capacity reduction of 34% and afternoon reduction of 28%.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the cylinder <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> USA.

It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder. If the working pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.|$|E

From 2009 to 2013, it experienced a 42% growth in international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of nearly 70% for Chinese visitors.

5|$|World wind {{generation}} capacity {{more than}} quadrupled between 2000 and 2006, doubling about every three years. The United States pioneered wind farms {{and led the}} world in installed <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s and into the 1990s. In 1997 installed capacity in Germany surpassed the U.S. and led until once again overtaken by the U.S. in 2008. China has been rapidly expanding its wind installations in the late 2000s and passed the U.S. in 2010 {{to become the world}} leader. As of 2011, 83 countries around the world were using wind power on a commercial basis.|$|E
5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost {{per unit of}} energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E

5|$|As a young officer, Rowell {{served at}} Gallipoli but was invalided back to Australia with typhoid fever in January 1916. The {{end of the}} war found Rowell junior in rank to his contemporaries with more {{distinguished}} war records, but he managed to catch up in the post-war period. Rowell spent five years with the British Army or at British staff colleges, establishing valuable contacts with his British counterparts. In 1939 he was appointed {{chief of staff of the}} 6th Division and later I Corps, serving in that <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Greece and the Syria-Lebanon campaign. In 1942 he commanded I Corps in the Kokoda Track campaign but was sacked. His subsequent rise to become Chief of the General Staff demonstrated that the circumstances of his dismissal in 1942 were indeed extraordinary.|$|E
5|$|Brummer {{was ready}} for service with the fleet by May 1916, though she did not steam {{with the rest of}} the High Seas Fleet for the Battle of Jutland at the end of the month. Despite the fact that they had been built as minelaying cruisers, Brummer and Bremse were never used in this <b>capacity.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> autumn of 1917, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the chief of the Admiralstab, decided to {{supplement}} the U-boat campaign with surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia. In addition to damaging British shipping, Scheer sought to divert escorts from the Atlantic theater, where his U-boats were concentrated. Brummer, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Leonhardi, and Bremse, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Westerkamp, were selected for the first such operation. Their high speed and large radius of action, coupled with their resemblance to British light cruisers, made them suited to the task. In preparation for the raid, their crews painted the ships dark gray to further camouflage them as British vessels.|$|E
5|$|In early 2002, Qwest {{approached}} the City of Bellevue about purchasing the building from them, as office vacancies had been high in recent years.

On November 25, 2002, the City of Bellevue agreed to purchase the Qwest building for $29 million, primarily to house the police and fire departments after $33 million in renovations. The city council approved a preliminary plan to move other city offices into the Qwest building in March 2003, citing lower maintenance costs and plentiful <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new building. The plan was finalized in July, estimating the total cost of renovation at $102.4 million (including $29 million used to purchase the building in 2002), and returning the city hall to downtown {{for the first time in}} 25 years. To finance the project, the city issued $103 million in 40-year municipal bonds, which were partially refunded in 2012.|$|E
