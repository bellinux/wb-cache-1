5|$|The main visual {{difference}} between the Kand K1classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve gear assembly from the elements. It also featured a new <b>cab</b> <b>design</b> with redesigned single front spectacle plates, {{and a pair of}} substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the Kclass locomotives had allowed the provision of a footplate that curved from the buffers to the water tanks. The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No.A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos.A891-A900) alongside a batch of five N1class 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No.A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931.|$|E

2500|$|The O1 {{class was}} a light {{passenger}} type. Eight of these engines were built from June 1930 to December 1931. The P5 class was also introduced, with two of this class being placed in service during July and August 1931. Following these came the P5A, a slightly heavier design capable of traveling [...] and with a tractive force of 56,250 pounds. In all, 89 of these locomotives were built. The first had a box <b>cab</b> <b>design</b> and were placed in service in 1932. The following year, the last 28 under construction were redesigned to have a streamlined type of cab. Some engines underwent regearing for freight service.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} earlier SD70 units, the SD70ACe rides {{on a new}} underframe and uses mostly new sheet metal above the frame. [...] Electrical cables and air lines have been routed beneath the walkways on opposite sides, allowing easier access for maintenance. Continuing the designs of the SD80 and SD90 series, the radiator on the locomotive is nearly {{as wide as the}} cab, the center hood section is a step down below the roofline, and the dynamic brakes have been moved {{to the rear of the}} hood. The SD70ACe uses the <b>cab</b> <b>design</b> of late-model SD90MAC-H units, which uses rectangular window glass and is externally different from the two cab variations used on earlier SD70M and SD70MAC units. In 2008, EMD standardized the isolated cab on subsequent SD70ACe's after non-isolated cab units were restricted from leading on BNSF Railway due to excessive cab vibration.|$|E
