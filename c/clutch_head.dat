50|$|Ace {{then joined}} Totz and Flamesword {{to form the}} unchanging core of Status Quo for 2009. They {{attended}} both Meadowlands and Columbus with Strongside, placing 7th in both events. Strongside was swapped for <b>Clutch</b> <b>heading</b> into Dallas, where they finished 10th. They played the final two tournaments {{of the year in}} Anaheim and Orlando with LegendPimps, finishing top 8 and then 9th respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2015 Yamaha {{introduced}} a revised FJR for 2016, with, among other changes, a 6-speed transmission (both in standard and automated versions), slipper/assist <b>clutch,</b> LED <b>head</b> and tail lights and LED cornering lights.|$|R
50|$|Up ahead, Schwantz {{is enjoying}} a large lead with 5 laps {{to go when}} he throws it away, <b>clutching</b> his <b>head</b> in disbelief as he walks through the gravel. Lawson is handed the win, {{followed}} by Rainey and Mackenzie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Without you!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Oh, Grizel, do {{you think}} I could find {{happiness}} apart from you for a day? And could you let me go?" [...] And he looked with agonized reproach at her, and sat down, <b>clutching</b> his <b>head.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the past, Harmful has toured with {{bands like}} Slayer, Machine <b>Head,</b> <b>Clutch,</b> Paradise Lost, Therapy?, LaFaro, and Helmet.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grewgious saw the ghastly figure {{throw back}} its <b>head,</b> <b>clutch</b> its hair with its hands, and turn with a writhing action from him.|$|R
50|$|The film {{opens with}} {{a man in a}} medical {{containment}} suit running through the forest. He is chased by another man who is covered in blood and screaming. The man in the hazard suit falls and hides behind a log, watching as the bloodied man <b>clutches</b> his <b>head</b> before the back of his skull explodes.|$|R
60|$|BLUNTSCHLI (quietly, as Sergius, in an {{agony of}} mortification, rinks on the ottoman, <b>clutching</b> his averted <b>head</b> between his fists). I told you {{you were getting}} the worst of it, Saranoff.|$|R
5|$|On the {{left-hand}} {{side of the}} painting, in the background, {{the structure of the}} temple crumbles and burns {{in the wake of the}} angel's path, while figures in varying stages of undress flee the approaching daemons. In the foreground a drunken man mimics the pose of the Barberini Faun as he <b>clutches</b> his <b>head,</b> alert enough to realise his fate if he does not escape but too intoxicated to flee.|$|R
30|$|The {{players who}} were {{medically}} diagnosed with a concussion {{were significantly more likely}} (1.52 times) to exhibit unresponsiveness and a vacant stare (2.35 times) than {{players who were}} removed from play under the CIR, not diagnosed with a concussion, and were returned to play. <b>Clutching</b> the <b>head</b> and gait ataxia were not significantly different signs between those who were and were not medically diagnosed with a concussion (see Table 1).|$|R

60|$|The {{old woman}} looked at him, {{as though she}} had a strong impulse upon her to make another <b>clutch</b> at his <b>head</b> and throat, but was {{restrained}} by a certain dogged mystery in his face.|$|R
6000|$|And then unseen, uneasy, {{flapping}} above them, {{trying to}} make noises, his Forsyte spirit watched her balanced on the log, her pretty figure swaying, smiling down at that young man gazing up with such strange, shining eyes, slipping now--a--ah! falling, o--oh! sliding--down his breast; her soft, warm body <b>clutched,</b> her <b>head</b> bent back from his lips; his kiss; her recoil; his cry: [...] "You must know--I love you!" [...] Must know--indeed, a pretty...? Love! Hah! ...|$|R
50|$|The {{head of the}} samurai Namakubi hears of Shura {{falling into}} Darc Seed's <b>clutches.</b> He then <b>heads</b> to the United States to destroy Darc Seed, free the American people from the looming zombification and reclaim the samurai sword Shura.|$|R
2500|$|Such play-acting can {{be carried}} to extremes. GM Nikolai Krogius writes that Najdorf, in his game against Gligorić at the 1952 Helsinki Olympiad, [...] "left a pawn [...] in time trouble, and then desperately <b>clutched</b> his <b>head</b> and reached out as if wanting to take the pawn back. ... Gligorić took the pawn, and soon {{thereafter}} lost the game. It transpired that Najdorf had staged the whole pantomime to blunt his opponent's watchfulness. This can hardly be called ethical." ...|$|R
50|$|According to the hagiography, Romard {{discovered}} Helier’s body on {{the beach}} still <b>clutching</b> his <b>head</b> in his hands, placed it in a boat and set off for the mainland. The boat, guided by the hand of God, arrived at Bréville-sur-mer (Manche) where a reputedly miraculous healing spring arose on the spot where Helier’s body rested overnight. A church was founded next to the spring, which is now topped by a statue and still attracts those seeking a cure.|$|R

5000|$|Suddenly remembering everything, Ashik Kerib <b>clutches</b> his <b>head</b> in {{his hands}} with shame, and {{immediately}} gets on his horse to ride back to Tiflis. But he has only {{three days before the}} seven years are up, and it is at least three months to Tiflis. Everything looks hopeless. In despair, Ashik Kerib cries out to the heavens: [...] "O mighty Allah! If you don't help me now, then there is nothing left for me on Earth!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The UP story related: [...] "The {{show had}} been on {{only a few minutes}} when she Ryan <b>clutched</b> her <b>head</b> and swayed. She was helped to a chair and two other actresses {{alternately}} read her lines. Before the program ended she had recovered enough to resume her part, but still complained of an extremely severe headache." [...] The next morning, her husband found her dead in their apartment. Her death was attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage.|$|R
60|$|Hour {{after hour}} went by, {{and he sat}} there, {{alternately}} nursing his wounds and <b>clutching</b> his aching <b>head,</b> and wondering why {{the two men had}} treated him so cruelly. Never once did he suspect that they were the hirelings of Squire Paget.|$|R
50|$|Elaine's {{dislike for}} The English Patient alienates her from everyone. Not wishing to upset J. Peterman, she claims {{not to have}} seen the film. Her plan backfires, however, when he {{immediately}} takes steps to correct the situation by dropping everything and taking Elaine to see it. While watching the movie with him, she becomes increasingly rude to the audience members by playing with her popcorn, sighing heavily, <b>clutching</b> her <b>head,</b> and shifting melodramatically in her seat until she finally can't stand it anymore.|$|R
50|$|One {{problem with}} the spot-bellied eagle-owl being the Devil Bird is that in most legends {{involving}} the bird, the original Devil Bird was a person in anguish who fled into the forest <b>clutching</b> their <b>head</b> with one hand only indicating that the bird had a crest as opposed to two ear-tufts. Since the spot-bellied eagle-owl has very prominent ear-tufts, {{it may not be}} the Devil Bird. However, all the legends may have stemmed from one, and all may have got that detail incorrect.|$|R
60|$|I hadn't {{expected}} {{dear old}} Freddie {{to sing with}} joy {{when he found out}} what had happened, but I did think he might have shown a little more manly fortitude. He leaped up, glared at the kid, and <b>clutched</b> his <b>head.</b> He didn't speak for a long time, but, on the other hand, when he began he did not leave off for a long time. He was quite emotional, dear old boy. It beat me where he could have picked up such expressions.|$|R
60|$|We now {{proceeded}} to the Pitti Palace, and spent several hours pleasantly in its saloons of pictures. I never enjoyed pictures anywhere else as I do in Florence. There is an admirable Judith in this gallery by Allori; a face of great beauty and depth, {{and her hand}} <b>clutches</b> the <b>head</b> of Holofernes by the hair {{in a way that}} startles the spectator. There are two peasant Madonnas by Murillo; simple women, yet with a thoughtful sense of some high mystery connected with the baby in their arms.|$|R
5000|$|The manager (Eric Idle) arrives, tells Gilberto to relax, then {{sits down}} at the table and apologizes [...] "humbly, deeply, and sincerely" [...] for the dirty fork. He becomes {{emotional}} when explaining the problems the restaurant staff has been suffering, and bursts into tears. Mungo the cook (John Cleese) enters, berating the couple for criticizing such a vulnerable man, and swings his cleaver onto their table. Gilberto <b>clutches</b> his <b>head,</b> complaining about his [...] "war wound". The manager stabs himself in the stomach with the dirty fork, screaming [...] "It's the end! The end!" [...] and collapses to the ground dead.|$|R
60|$|I can see {{the little}} gentleman as he spoke, his black {{broadcloth}} coat and lace ruffles, his hand <b>clutching</b> the gold <b>head</b> of his cane, his face screwed up with indignation under his white wig. It was on a Sunday, and he {{was standing by the}} lilac bushes on the lawn in front of his square brick house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you read}} that again?" [...] the author {{prominently}} before the public demanded, but when we had read it a second time it seemed only to plunge him deeper into despair. He <b>clutched</b> his revered <b>head</b> with both hands, and but for an opportune baldness would probably have torn his hair. He murmured, huskily, [...] "Do {{you think you have}} got it right?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{scene is}} set on a gray winter morning in the Bois de Boulogne, trees bare and snow {{covering}} the ground. A man dressed as a Pierrot has been mortally wounded in a duel and has collapsed {{into the arms of}} a Duc de Guise. A surgeon, dressed as a doge of Venice, tries to stop the flow of blood, while a Domino <b>clutches</b> his own <b>head.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, {{the rebel}} group is {{attacked}} by the Machines and unplug themselves to defend their headquarters, along with other captured machines (indicated by the machine's mechanical eye changing from red to green) however all are killed or disabled, except the single Runner robot. The robot plugs the dying Alexa into their matrix with itself, the only two things left surviving. Much to the machine's dismay, when the rebel realizes she is trapped inside the matrix with the robot, she turns horrified and her avatar dissolves screaming as she <b>clutches</b> her <b>head,</b> and the robot exits from the rebels' matrix to see a motionless Alexa {{in front of him}} in the real world.|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{concussion}} signs, slow {{to get up}} had {{the best}} level of agreement between expert and naïve raters of all possible concussion signs (strong and moderate agreement, respectively), whereas a blank or vacant stare had the worst agreement (both rater groups had a ‘weak’ level of agreement). <b>Clutch</b> or shake <b>head,</b> gait ataxia (or having wobbly legs), unresponsiveness, and post-impact seizure-like features had moderate agreement for both expert and naïve raters.|$|R
50|$|Songwriter Gordon Schwinn {{works at}} his piano {{to meet a}} deadline, irritated because he must write a song about spring for the children's {{television}} host Mr. Bungee, who dresses as a frog ("Frogs Have So Much Spring Within Them"). Gordon takes a break from his writing and meets his agent Rhoda at a restaurant ("Calamari"). During lunch, he <b>clutches</b> his <b>head</b> and falls face first into his meal. Rhoda calls an ambulance, and Gordon is taken to the hospital, where he's administered an MRI ("Sitting Becalmed in the Lee of Cuttyhunk"). His neurosurgeon tells him that he has an arteriovenous malformation, and needs an operation ("Craniotomy"). If he doesn't have it, he could die or never regain {{the use of his}} faculties.|$|R
2500|$|The York Revolution wear caps {{produced}} by OC Sports and uniforms by New Balance. The caps are navy blue throughout with a stylized white [...] "Y" [...] topped with an eagle's <b>head</b> <b>clutching</b> a baseball. The entire cap logo is outlined in silver. The Revolution wordmark {{is centered on}} the back, lower edge of the cap. There is also an all yellow hat featuring the York [...] "Y" [...] being grasped by an eagle talon.|$|R
60|$|When {{the truth}} dawned upon {{him that he}} was being killed the {{instinct}} of self-preservation was born in him. The ferocity with which he had fought before paled into insignificance beside the mad fury with which he now attacked the three terrible creatures upon him. Shaking himself like a great lion he freed his arms for a moment from the clinging embrace of his foemen, and seizing the neck of the nearest in his mighty <b>clutch</b> wrenched the <b>head</b> completely around.|$|R
6000|$|... [He thrusts {{the paper}} into the fire, stamps {{it down with}} his [...] foot, watches it writhe and blacken. Then {{suddenly}} <b>clutching</b> [...] his <b>head,</b> {{he turns to the}} bodies on the couch. Panting and like [...] a man demented, he recoils past the head of the couch, and [...] rushing to the window, draws the curtains and throws the window [...] up for air. Out in the darkness rises the witch-like skeleton [...] tree, where a dark shape seems hanging. KEITH starts back.] ...|$|R
50|$|The 507th began {{operations}} on July 1, 1945. Perdomo was assigned P-47N-2-RE number 146 aircraft (serial number 44-88211), maintained by crew chief S/Sgt. F. W. Pozieky. Perdomo nicknamed his airplane Lil Meaties Meat Chopper with the nose art depicting a diapered baby chomping a cigar {{in his mouth}} and derby hat on his <b>head,</b> <b>clutching</b> a rifle. The name referred to his first son, Kenneth, then {{a year and a half}} old. Perdomo flew his first combat mission on July 2, while escorting a B-29 to Kyushu.|$|R
