500|$|Instead {{of being}} hidden [...] "unmentionables", Wonderbras became more visible icons of female sex-appeal.

This {{strategy}} also provided greater profits in a very <b>competitive</b> <b>industry.</b> The goal was to have women see their Wonderbras as a cosmetic—a beauty enhancer—rather than a functional garment.

500|$|This {{arrangement}} of allowing <b>competitive</b> <b>industry</b> to flourish {{in some regions}} while setting up its opposite of strict government-regulated and monopolized production and trade in others was not exclusive to iron manufacturing. In {{the beginning of the}} Song, the government supported competitive silk mills and brocade workshops in the eastern provinces and in the capital city of Kaifeng. However, {{at the same time the}} government established strict legal prohibition on the merchant trade of privately produced silk in Sichuan province. This prohibition dealt an economic blow to Sichuan that caused a small rebellion (which was subdued), yet Song Sichuan was well known for its independent industries producing timber and cultivated oranges. [...] The reforms of the Chancellor Wang Anshi (10211086) sparked heated debate amongst ministers of court when he nationalised the industries manufacturing, processing, and distributing tea, salt, and wine. [...] The state monopoly on Sichuan tea was the prime source of revenue for the state's purchase of horses in Qinghai for the Song army's cavalry forces. Wang's restrictions on the private manufacture and trade of salt were even criticized in a famous poem by Su Shi, and while the opposing politically charged faction at court gained advantage and lost favor, Wang Anshi's reforms were continually abandoned and reinstated. Despite this political quarrel, the Song Empire's main source of revenue continued to come from state-managed monopolies and indirect taxes. As for private entrepreneurship, great profits could still be pursued by the merchants in the luxury item trades and specialized regional production. For example, the silk producers of Raoyang County, Shenzhou Prefecture, southern Hebei province were especially known for producing silken headwear for the Song emperor and high court officials in the capital.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{concern is}} that monopolistic {{competition}} fosters advertising {{and the creation of}} brand names. Advertising induces customers into spending more on products because of the name associated with them rather than because of rational factors. Defenders of advertising dispute this, arguing that brand names can represent a guarantee of quality and that advertising helps reduce the cost to consumers of weighing the tradeoffs of numerous competing brands. [...] There are unique information and information processing costs associated with selecting a brand in a monopolistically competitive environment. In a monopoly market, the consumer is faced with a single brand, making information gathering relatively inexpensive. In a perfectly <b>competitive</b> <b>industry,</b> the consumer is faced with many brands, but because the brands are virtually identical information gathering is also relatively inexpensive. In a monopolistically competitive market, the consumer must collect and process information on a large number of different brands to be able to select the best of them. In many cases, the cost of gathering information necessary to selecting the best brand can exceed the benefit of consuming the best brand instead of a randomly selected brand. The result is that the consumer is confused. Some brands gain prestige value and can extract an additional price for that.|$|E

40|$|In this article, I {{consider}} {{the interaction between}} product market competition and investment {{in research and development}} (R&D) to tackle two asset pricing puzzles: the positive R&D-return relation and the positive competition-return relation. Using a standard model of R&D return dynamics, I establish that competition and R&D investments have a strong interaction effect on stock returns. It is more likely that firms with high R&D expenditures will end up with very low returns on their ventures because rival firms win the innovation race. Because there are more potential rival firms in <b>competitive</b> <b>industries,</b> R&D intensive firms in <b>competitive</b> <b>industries</b> are riskier. Consistent with the predictions of the model, I find a robust empirical relation between R&D intensity and stock returns, but only in <b>competitive</b> <b>industries.</b> This finding suggests that the risk derived from product market competition has important asset pricing implications and potentially drives {{a large portion of the}} positive R&D-return relation. Furthermore, firms in <b>competitive</b> <b>industries</b> earn higher returns than firms in concentrated industries only among R&D-intensive firms. My second finding therefore provides a risk-based explanation for the heretofore puzzling competition premium...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first to {{investigate}} the association between market competition, the choice between dividends and stock repurchases as payout methods, and dividend smoothing. Using a sample of U. S. firms in the period 1963 - 2009, I find that firms in highly <b>competitive</b> <b>industries</b> prefer to pay out through repurchases rather than dividends, perhaps because they are less capable of maintaining stable future profitability. Before 1982, regulatory constraints prevented firms from aggressive repurchase programs. In the post- 1982 period, as the introduction of Rule 10 b- 18 removed the regulatory constraints on repurchases, firms in highly <b>competitive</b> <b>industries</b> demonstrated significantly decreased preferences for paying out dividends and increased preferences for repurchases, which implied substitution of dividends with repurchases. I also show that dividend payers in highly <b>competitive</b> <b>industries</b> tend to keep dividends at a relatively persistent level and distribute increases in earnings through repurchases, thus their dividend levels are smoother than those in less <b>competitive</b> <b>industries.</b> Further, I also confirm the hypothesis of Grullon and Michaely (2007) that high competition is associated with high payout levels...|$|R

The light of education and culture has shone full on every face and illuminated it into all that it might be. The cheerful hours of easy labor vary but do not destroy the pursuit of pleasure and of recreation. Youth in such a Utopia is a very springtime of hope: adult life a busy and cheery activity: and age itself, watching from its shady bench beneath a spreading tree the labors of its children, is but a gentle retrospect from which material care has passed away.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this has}} been said of {{industry}} under monopoly. But it will be seen to apply in its essentials to what we call <b>competitive</b> <b>industry.</b> Here indeed certain new features come in. Not one employer but many produce each kind of article. And, as far as each employer can see by looking at his own horizon, {{what he does is}} merely to produce as much as he can sell at a price that pays him. Since all the other employers are doing this, there will be, under competition, a constant tendency to cut the prices down to the lowest that is consistent with what the employer has to pay as wages and interest. This point, which was called by the orthodox economists the [...] "cost," [...] is not in any true and fundamental sense of the words the [...] "cost" [...] at all. It is merely a limit represented by what the other parties to the bargain are able to exact. The whole situation is in a condition of unstable equilibrium in which the conflicting forces represented by the interests of the various parties pull in different directions. The employers in any one line of industry and all their wage earners and salaried assistants have one and the same interest as against the consumer. They want the selling price to be as high as possible. But the employers are against one another as wanting, each of them, to make as many sales as possible, and each and all the employers are against the wage earners in wanting to pay as low wages as possible. If all the employers unite, the situation turns to a monopoly, and the price paid by the consumer is settled on the monopoly basis already described. The employers can then dispute it out with their working men as to how much wages shall be. If the employers are not united, then at each and every moment they are in conflict both with the consumer and with their wage earners. Thus the whole scene of industry represents a vast and unending conflict, a fermentation in which the moving bubbles crowd for space, expanding and breaking one against the other. There is no point of rest. There is no real fixed [...] "cost" [...] acting as a basis. Anything that any one person or group of persons--worker or master, landlord or capitalist--is able to exact owing to the existing conditions of demand or supply, becomes a [...] "cost" [...] {{from the point of view}} of all the others. There is nothing in this [...] "cost" [...] which proportions to it the quantity of labor, or of time, or of skill or of any other measure physical or psychological of the effort involved. And there is nothing whatever in it which proportions to it social justice. It is the war of each against all. Its only mitigation is that it is carried on under the set of rules represented by the state and the law.|$|E

40|$|The folk {{wisdom is}} that {{competition}} reduces agency costs. We provide indirect empirical support for this view. We argue that the temptation to retain cash and engage in less productive activities is more severe for firms in less <b>competitive</b> <b>industries.</b> Hence an unanticipated increase in cash-flow due to higher past returns {{is more likely to}} lead to a reduction in leverage as well as a lowering of future returns for firms in less competitive environments.

In contrast, for firms in more <b>competitive</b> <b>industries,</b> the negative relation between past returns and current leverage will be attenuated. Theory suggests that the relation between current leverage and future returns for such firms will be zero or negative.
