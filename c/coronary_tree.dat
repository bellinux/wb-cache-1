40|$|International audienceThe newly {{introduced}} cardiac rotational angiography (RA) {{can provide}} {{a large amount of}} projections from different angles which greatly improve the 3 D <b>coronary</b> <b>tree</b> reconstruction. However, the reconstruction methods are difficult to be objectively evaluated due to the complicated topology of <b>coronary</b> <b>tree</b> and non-linear cardiac motion.

A 3 D+t <b>coronary</b> <b>tree</b> model reconstructed from MSCT sequence is employed to enhance the reality of simulation. A simulation environment of X-ray coronary angiography is developed based on distance-driven projection algorithm. The static angiography is firstly simulated to verify the dynamic model by comparing the displacements of landmarks with the real static angiography of the same patient.

40|$|<b>Coronary</b> {{arterial}} <b>tree</b> extraction in angiograms is {{an essential}} component of each cardiac image processing system. Once physicians decide to check up coronary arteries from x-ray angiograms, extraction must be done precisely, fast, automatically and including whole arterial tree to help diagnosis or treatment during the cardiac surgical operation. This application is very helpful for the surgeon on deciding the target vessels prior to coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Some techniques and algorithms are proposed for extracting coronary arteries in angiograms. However, most of them suffer from some disadvantages such as time complexity, low accuracy, extracting only parts of main arteries instead of the full <b>coronary</b> arterial <b>tree,</b> need manual segmentation, appearance of artifacts and so forth. This study presents a new method for extracting whole <b>coronary</b> arterial <b>tree</b> in angiography images using Starlet wavelet transform. To this end, firstly we remove noise from raw angiograms and then sharpen the coronary arteries. Then <b>coronary</b> arterial <b>tree</b> is extracted by applying a modified Starlet wavelet transform and afterwards the residual noises and artifacts are cleaned. For evaluation, we measure proposed method performance on our created data set from 4932 Left Coronary Artery (LCA) and Right Coronary Artery (RCA) angiograms and compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. To {{obtain the}} size of {{regional}} myocardial mass for individual coronary arteries in vivo. Background. The anatomic site of occlusion in a coronary artery does not predict {{the size of}} the risk area because location of the occlusion does not account for {{the size of the}} artery or of its dependent myocardial bed. Methods. Intracoronary radiolabeled microspheres were injected and coronary arteriograms were quantitatively analyzed by semiautomated methods. The coronary artery lumen areas and the sum of epicardial coronary artery branch lengths distal to the points where radiomicrospheres had been injected were determined from both in vivo and postmortem coronary arteriograms. Regional myocardial mass distal to the point of each microsphere injection was correlated with corresponding distal summed coronary branch lengths and with coronary artery lumen areas. Results. 1) Regional myocardial mass was closely and linearly related to sum of coronary artery branch lengths distal to any point in the <b>coronary</b> artery <b>tree</b> and therefore could be determined for any location on a coronary arteriogram. 2) The fraction of total left ventricular mass at risk distal to a stenosis could be determined from the corresponding fraction of total <b>coronary</b> artery <b>tree</b> length independently of the scale or X-ray magnification used to measure absolute branch lengths. 3) Cross-sectional lumen area at any point in the left <b>coronary</b> artery <b>tree</b> was closely related {{to the size of the}} dependent vascular bed with a curvilinear relation similar to that observed in humans with normal coronary arteriograms. Conclusions. On coronary arteriograms, the anatomic area at risk for myocardial infarction distal to any point in the <b>coronary</b> artery <b>tree</b> can be determined from the sum of distal coronary artery branch lengths. There is a curvilinear relation between coronary artery lumen area and dependent regional myocardial mass comparable to that in humans, reflecting fundamental physical principles underlying the structure of the <b>coronary</b> vascular <b>tree...</b>|$|R

40|$|Detection of non-calcified plaques in the <b>coronary</b> <b>tree</b> is a {{challenging}} problem {{due to the}} nature of comprising substances. Hard plaques are easily discernible in CTA data cloud due to apparent bright behaviour, therefore many approaches have been proposed for automatic segmentation of calcified plaques. In contrast soft plaques show very small difference in intensity with respect to surrounding heart tissues & blood voxels. This similarity in intensity makes the isolation and detection of soft plaques very difficult. This work aims to develop framework for segmentation of vulnerable plaques with minimal user dependency. In first step automatic seed point has been established based on the fact that coronary artery behaves as tubular structure through axial slices. In the following step the behaviour of contrast agent has been modelled mathematically to reflect the dye diffusion in respective CTA volume. Consequently based on detected seed point & intensity behaviour, localized active contour segmentation has been applied to extract complete <b>coronary</b> <b>tree.</b> Bidirectional segmentation has been applied to avoid loss of coronary information due to the seed point location whereas auto adjustment feature of contour grabs new emerging branches.
