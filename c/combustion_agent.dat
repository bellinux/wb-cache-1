The steel was of very good quality, and was even exported to Great Britain where it was used, notably, {{in the construction of}} the Menai Suspension Bridge and the Britannia Bridge, across the Menai Straits between mainland Wales and Anglesey (Ynys Môn). But the business ran at a loss, because of management failings, technical inexperience, lack of funding and the sole use of charcoal as a <b>combustion</b> <b>agent.</b> (A buyer had previously suggested to Heath that he move his factory to the Burdwan district of Bengal, where coal was abundant, but he did not act on the suggestion.) ...|$|E

30|$|Recently, a {{new form}} of {{intumescent}} fire retardant coatings for wood-based materials was introduced (Chou et al. 2009). The authors investigated the usefulness of an artificial graphite powder and a sericrite (Al 4 (OH) 4 (KAl-Si 3 O 10) 2), and a mixture of the two on plywood. The intumescent fire retardant coating contained 19.8 % of the fire retardant, 15 % of the dehydration agent, 18 % of the foaming agent, 7.2 % of the resin binder and 40 % of the solvent, was prepared and applied to the surface of plywood. They showed that when sericrite was in excess of 75 % in the fire retardant composition, the mixture obtained the lowest flammability grade possible in Taiwan Standard CNS 7614. Furthermore, for sericrite to be effective in inhibiting <b>combustion,</b> carbonising <b>agents,</b> such as graphite powder, are not required.|$|R

The electronic structure in conjunction with the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect is argued to make water buckyballs catalysts and oxygenates for fuel <b>combustion</b> and active <b>agents</b> in biological systems. The broad electronic and unique low-frequency vibronic spectra of water buckyballs may explain certain diffuse interstellar bands, far-infrared, ultraviolet, and x-ray cosmic background radiation, and some "missing cosmic baryonic matter".

40|$|Metal oxide photocatalysts {{often lead}} to partial or {{complete}} mineralization of organic pollutants. On irradiation with UV-visible light, metal oxides catalyze redox reactions {{in the presence of}} air and O 2 and water. Using ascorbic acid as a new <b>combustion</b> <b>agent,</b> ZnO was rapidly synthesized. Nano-Zn/CeO 2 composites were prepared by a heterogeneous-precipitation method using (NH 4) 2 CO 3 as precipitation agent. X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and differential thermal analysis were used to analyse the microstructures of the synthesized materials. Differential thermal analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses indicated that ZnO was coated by CeO 2. Herein, a nano-Zn/Ce composite was explored as a catalyst for Rhodamine B photodegradation with a 125 -W lamp as the UV radiation source in a batch reactor.

40|$|A new {{lithiated}} NASICON-type polyanion material, Li 2 Ni 2 (MoO 4) (3) was synthesized for {{the first}} time by means of a low temperature approach involving glycine as a mild <b>combustion</b> <b>agent.</b> The synthesized product, Li 2 Ni 2 (MoO 4) (3), was found to crystallize in an ortborhombic structure (space group Pmcn) with cell parameters a = 10. 424 (4) Angstrom, b = 17. 525 (1) Angstrom and c = 5. 074 (3) Angstrom. The electronic state of each element present in the new material was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis. The metals content present in the new material was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Fiber-like submicrometre grains were evident from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the annealed powders. The electrochemical performance of the new material was examined in a half-cell configuration against lithium metal employing a conventional Li+ non-aqueous electrolyte. Slow scan cyclic voltammetry (SSCV) revealed the electrochemical reversibility of the material between the potential window of 4. 9 V (charge cutoff) and 1. 5 V (discharge cutoff). Reversible extraction/insertion of Li+ from and into the framework structure delivered a reversible capacity of similar to 115 mA h/g (4. 9 - 1. 5 -V window) after the first charge/discharge cycle.

40|$|Dust {{explosion}} is {{a serious}} hazard in process industries where combustible dust is handled. Dust explo-sion commonly occurs in a confi ned space such as a silo, a vessel or a warehouse. Based on industrial accidents involving dust explosion, it may cause fatality, injury and property damage. Therefore, a practical approach for integrated risk management of dust explosion hazards is required. This research focuses {{on the development of}} a spreadsheet tool for predicting the severity of dust explosion. The consequence modelling is required to enable the assessment of risk associated with dust explosion. Various published models were studied for initial work of consequence modelling. Parameters con-sidered were the dust defl agration index (K st), the maximum explosion pressure (Pmax), the maximum rate of pressure rise (dP/dt) max and the laminar burning velocity (Slbv). Reliable value for these dust explosion parameters has been tabulated based on closed vessel laboratory tests. A case study of dust explosion involving maize starch in closed vessel was used to test and validate the developed conse-quence modelling tool. The modelling result was discussed by comparing the predicted value against experimental value. The spreadsheet tool that was developed in this work can be used for the purpose of risk management of a facility associated with dust explosion hazards. It can be used to assist the application to <b>combustion</b> suppressant <b>agent</b> and design of explosion venting to prevent and mitigate the consequence of dust explosion...|$|R
40|$|Irregular {{precipitation}} {{associated with}} {{global climate change}} had been causing various problems in urban regions. Besides the runoff due to rainfall in summer, the snowmelt runoff in early spring could also {{play an important role}} in deteriorating the water quality of the receiving waters. Due to global climate change, the snowfall has increased gradually in individual regions, and snowstorms occur more frequently, which leads to an enhancement of snowmelt runoff flow during the melting seasons. What is more, rivers just awaking from freezing cosntitute a frail ecosystem, with poor self-purification capacity, however, the urban snowmelt runoff could carry diverse pollutants accumulated during the winter, such as coal and/or gas <b>combustion</b> products, snowmelting <b>agents,</b> automotive exhaust and so on, which seriously threaten the receiving water quality. Nevertheless, most of the research focused on the rainfall runoff in rainy seasons, and the study on snowmelt runoff is still a neglected field in many countries and regions. In conclusion, due to the considerable water quantity and the worrisome water quality, snowmelt runoff in urban regions with large impervious surface areas should be listed among the important targets in urban nonpoint source pollution management and control...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the influence of}} water vapor in combustion atmosphere on NOx emission from oxygen-enriched combustion of air-dried distilled spirit lees and its char in a laboratory fluidized bed of 760 mm high and 68 mm in inner diameter. Steam was added into the fluidizing gas to vary the vapor content in the combustion atmosphere. At a combustion temperature of 950 degrees C and a steam-to-fuel mass ratio (S/F) of 0. 5, the presence of water vapor reduced the NOx concentration in the flue gas for low O- 2 contents (= 40 vol. %). The possible causes were clarified for this shift from suppression to promotion of fuel-N conversion into NOx with raising O- 2 concentration in the <b>combustion</b> <b>agent.</b> Varying temperature from 850 degrees C to 1150 degrees C resulted in a peak conversion of fuel-N to NOx in the temperature range of 950 - 1050 degrees C for all the tested O- 2 concentrations. Increasing the O- 2 concentration tended to lower the critical temperature corresponding to such a peak fuel-N conversion. Testing results also suggested {{that the presence of}} excessive water vapor in the combustion atmosphere would inhibit the release of fuel-N in the devolatilization stage and promote the formation of some reducing gases. In addition to the anticipated diluting effect, the steam addition also shortened the reaction time for homogeneous and heterogeneous NOx reduction by the reducing gases and char. It is postulated that the formation of OH radicals at high O- 2 content and high temperature could cause the observed increase in the NOx emission. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
