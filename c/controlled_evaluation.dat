The correct definition of health benefit, backed with solid scientific evidence, is a strong element for the proper identification and assessment of the effect of a probiotic. This aspect represents a major challenge for scientific and industrial investigations because several difficulties arise, such as variability in the site for probiotic use (oral, vaginal, intestinal) and mode of application.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} internal audit outsourcing and internal audit’s involvement in consulting on external auditors’ reliance {{on the work of}} internal audit. We test whether these factors influence (i) reliance on internal audit work already undertaken and (ii) the use of internal auditors as assistants. In each case, we distinguish between <b>control</b> <b>evaluation</b> and substantive testing. We find that involvement in consulting impacts reliance on work undertaken and the use of internal auditors as assistants for <b>control</b> <b>evaluation.</b> External auditors make greater use of internal auditors as assistants for substantive testing when internal audit is provided in-house. Overall, external auditors use internal audit more for <b>control</b> <b>evaluation</b> tasks than for substantive testing. ...|$|R

30|$|Said and Bellogín [126] {{stress the}} {{importance}} of having clear guidelines in comparison of recommender systems to allow for reproducibility and comparison of results. They note that a true comparison of results from different recommender systems is difficult due to the many different designs available, as well as myriad differences in implementation strategies from modification and tuning. With that in mind, they looked at three popular frameworks which include Mahout, LensKit, and MyMediaLite, and compared various research papers based on the reproducibility of the results. For each framework, a <b>controlled</b> <b>evaluation</b> was performed as well as one using the framework’s internal evaluation methods. The results of the <b>controlled</b> <b>evaluation</b> showed Mahout’s performance to be consistent and fast for all algorithms, but its performance was still slightly slower than Lenskit. The authors note that these results are specific to the datasets used and may differ when running on datasets with different characteristics. When considering root-mean-squared error, Mahout was the worst of the three. This study only used non-distributed implementations from Mahout for fair comparisons, so their observations should not be extrapolated to the distributed implementations offered.|$|E

40|$|Internal <b>control</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{traditionally}} {{has been an}} integral part of an audit to provide an opinion on an entity's financial statements. Essentially, internal <b>control</b> <b>evaluation</b> is used to determine the substantive testing necessary to render an opinion on the financial statements. With the passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and recent proposals of the SEC, internal <b>control</b> <b>evaluation</b> has gained new impetus. These events may lead to the independent auditor being required to provide an internal control opinion separate from a financial statement audit. Consequently, the auditor may be required to aggregate the evaluation of system parts into a statement as to the performance of the system or major subsystem as a whole in addition to the reports currently made to management on the adequacy of internal control. Although mathematical models for internal <b>control</b> <b>evaluation</b> have been proposed, these have failed to receive acceptance by auditors. As an alternative to these models, this paper proposes the use of a procedure for aggregating the evaluation of parts of an internal control system employing the linguistic values commonly in use by auditors such as "strong," "weak," and "adequate. " The linguistic model (1) uses the theory of fuzzy sets to aggregate these common linguistic values and (2) returns a linguistic aggregate <b>evaluation</b> of the <b>control</b> system under review.

This case presents documentation organized by con-trol objective for internal control of a company’s purchasing cycle. The case includes dis-cussion and objective format questions and is relatively short, which means it can be used as an in-class or out-of-class exercise or an in-class testing or assessment device on internal <b>control</b> <b>evaluation...</b>|$|R
