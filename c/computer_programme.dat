It developed an ambitious specification for a BBC computer, and discussed the project with several companies including Acorn Computers, Sinclair Research, Newbury Laboratories, Tangerine Computer Systems, and Dragon Data.|$|E

To Sinclair's dismay, the contract to produce the BBC Microcomputer went to Acorn, which launched the machine in January 1982. Paul Kriwaczek, the producer of The <b>Computer</b> <b>Programme,</b> explained his reservations in a March 1982 interview with Your Computer: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{learned from}} an ex-MI5 officer {{that it is}} common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people {{to fall in love with}} civilians through just their voices. This story was the basis of Ruth wanting to go out with John in [...] "Love and Death". Khoury based [...] "Outsiders" [...] on Internet security. He already became intoned with the area, as he once worked with an internet company. Although the story is dramatised, Khoury did research on what was feasible, such as if one man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees. Also in the episode, the G algorithm is based on an actual <b>computer</b> <b>programme.</b> [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects. As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we're ahead of the game. It's just we know stuff that's happening, and it'll come out in the news a bit later on." [...] In the same episode, the weapons caches came from a true story that the Russians hid weapons in Britain during the Cold War, according to Collins.|$|E
