I've knowed thet tree all the years I've navigated this river, an' it seems natural like to me thet it now droops dyin', fer it shades the grave of as young, an' sweet, an' purty a lass as yerself, Miss Nell. Rivermen called this island George's Island, 'cause Washington onct camped here; but of late years the name's got changed, an' the men say suthin' like this: 'We'll try an' make Milly's birch afore sundown,' jest as Bill and me hev done to-day. Some years agone I was comin' up from Fort Henry, an' had on board my slow old scow a lass named Milly--we never learned her other name. She come {{to me at the}} fort, an' tells as how her folks hed been killed by Injuns, an' she wanted to git back to Pitt to meet her sweetheart. I was ag'in her comin' all along, an' fust off I said 'No.' But when I seen tears in her blue eyes, an' she puts her little hand on mine, I jest wilted, an' says to Jim Blair, 'She goes.' Wal, jest as might hev been expected--an' fact is I looked fer it--we wus tackled by redskins. Somehow, Jim Girty got wind of us hevin' a lass aboard, an' he ketched up with us jest below here. It's a bad place, called Shawnee Rock, an' I'll show it to ye termorrer. The renegade, with his red devils, attacked us thar, an' we had a time gittin' away. Milly wus shot. She lived fer awhile, a couple of days, an' all the time wus so patient, an' sweet, an' brave with thet renegade's bullet in her--fer he shot her when he seen he couldn't capture her--thet thar wusn't a blame man of us who wouldn't hev died to grant her prayer, which wus that she could live to onct more see her lover." ...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the current}} {{legislation}} on the marketing of forest reproductive material, tree clones marketed in the EU must have certain traits which make them identifiable, and these traits must have been accepted and registered by an official body. Due to this obligation, {{there is a need}} for reliable, functional and practicable methods for specifying these distinctive characters. We have developed a clone identification method for European and hybrid aspens and <b>curly</b> <b>birch,</b> based on nuclear microsatellites, which can be used for determining the distinctive characters mentioned in the directive. For aspens, we have used 18 loci, of which nine were developed earlier for P. tremuloides and nine for P. nigra. For <b>curly</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula var. carelica), we have used seven loci developed for B. pendula and three loci developed for B. platyphylla var. japonica. Most of the aspen clones were easily identifiable using only part of the loci. In the case of <b>curly</b> <b>birch,</b> however, two clones could not be separated from each other despite the relatively high number and polymorphism of the loci, which suggests that these two clones were actually samples from the same clone. These kinds of mistakes further emphasise the urgent need for a reliable clone identification method...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{measured}} data on Ψ diurnal and seasonal variations, the additive model of water potential (Ψ) seasonal dynamics in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and curly (Karelian) birch (Betula pendula Roth var. carelica) was developed using cosinor- analysis. The analysis of Ψ time series revealed that diurnal Ψ biorhythms in silver birch and <b>curly</b> <b>birch</b> shoots changed unidirectionally over the growing season although the scope of variability differed significantly. More substantial changes of the studied parameter {{during the growing season}} were noted in <b>curly</b> <b>birch.</b> It was shown that the modeling of biorhythms of water status parameters enables to understand better the processes of water regime regulation in plants, as it allows detecting specific intra-species differences, which are difficult to determine using conventional methods of statistical data treatment...|$|E
40|$|Cherry {{leaf roll}} virus, CLRV, is a plant {{pathogen}} that infects {{a variety of}} deciduous trees and shrubs in temperate regions. Little is known about its occurrence at high latitudes and especially in Finnish birch species. Still, symptoms {{that seemed to be}} associated with CLRV such as vein banding, leaf roll and decline have been observed in birch trees throughout the country since the summer of 2002. Six different birch species, subspecies or varieties, i. e. Betula pubescens subsp. pubescens (downy birch), B. pendula (silver birch), B. nana (dwarf birch), B. pubescens var. appressa (Kiilopää birch), B. pubescens subsp. czerepanovii (moun-tain birch) and B. pendula var. carelica (<b>curly</b> <b>birch)</b> originating from all over Finland were assessed by immunocapture-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) for CLRV infection. It was shown that CLRV is widely distributed in B. pendula and B. pubescens throughout the country. Furthermore, dwarf birch, mountain birch, Kiilopää birch and <b>curly</b> <b>birch</b> were confirmed to be previously unkown hosts of CLRV. Genetic analysis of virus sequence variants originating from Finnish birch trees revealed atypical phylogenetic relationships. In contrast to CLRV isolates from birches growing in the United Kingdom and Germany which clustered exclusively within group A, Finnish CLRV isolates belonged either to group B, D or E. Thus, virus population structure in Finnish birches seems to be more variable and host plant dependency seems not to apply for Finnish CLRV isolates...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{multiple}} {{models were}} developed to describe diurnal and seasonal dynamics of water potential (Ψ) of the foliated shoots in the plants of Betula genus related to air temperature and relative humidity in the middle taiga (southern Karelia). The {{results of the study}} revealed unidirectional changes, but different effect strength of air temperature and relative humidity on Ψ of the foliated shoots of common silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and curly (Karelian) birch (Betula pendula Roth var. carelica). It was shown that increasing air temperature 1 °С results in similar decreasing of Ψ value equal to 0. 037 – 0. 038 MPa in both of the birches (p > 0. 05). Since the diurnal air temperature range achieves 10 – 15 °С, the contribution of this factor may be up to 0. 57 MPa. On the contrary, the contribution of relative air humidity to Ψ value differs significantly in distinct birch forms (p < 0. 05). In this case the change range of Ψ value in silver birch and <b>curly</b> <b>birch</b> may be up to 0. 46 (0. 015 MPa/ 1 % RH) and 0. 52 МПа (0. 017 MPa/ 1 % RH), respectively. The results indicate that <b>curly</b> <b>birch</b> responds to the increase of relative air humidity with higher magnification of Ψ in comparison with common silver birch...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of liquid}} instead of solid culture medium for the {{micropropagation}} of plants offers advantages such as {{better access to}} medium components and scalability through possible automation of the processes. The objective of this work was to compare a new temporary immersion bioreactor (TIB) to solid medium culture for the micropropagation of a selection of tree species micropropagated for commercial use: Nordmann fir (Abies nordmanniana (Steven) Spach), Eucalyptus (E. grandis x E. urophylla), Downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh), and <b>Curly</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula var. carelica). Cultivation of explants in the TIB resulted in a significant increase of multiplication rate and fresh weight of Eucalyptus and B. pendula, but not Betula pubescens. In addition, the fresh weight of embryogenic tissue and the maturation frequency of somatic embryos increased significantly when an embryogenic cell line of A. nordmanniana was cultivated in the TIB compared to solid culture medium. These results demonstrate the potential for scaling up and automating micropropagation by shoot multiplication and somatic embryogenesis in commercial tree species using a temporary immersion bioreactor...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{hydraulic}} conductivity {{of the stem}} {{is a major factor}} limiting the capability of trees to transport water from the soil to transpiring leaves. During drought conditions, the conducting capacity of xylem can be reduced by some conduits being filled with gas, i. e. embolized. In order to understand the dynamics of embolism formation and repair, considerable attention has been given to developing reliable and accurate methods for quantifying the phenomenon. In the past decade, non-destructive imaging of embolism formation in living plants has become possible. Magnetic resonance imaging has been used to visualize the distribution of water within the stem, but in most cases {{it is not possible to}} resolve individual cells. Recently, high-resolution synchrotron x-ray microtomography has been introduced as a tool to visualize the water contents of individual cells in vivo, providing unprecedented insight into the dynamics of embolism repair. We have investigated the potential of an x-ray tube -based microtomography setup to visualize and quantify xylem embolism and embolism repair in water-stressed young saplings and shoot tips of Silver and <b>Curly</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula and B. pendula var. carelica). Results From the microtomography images, the water-filled versus gas-filled status of individual xylem conduits can be seen, and the proportion of stem cross-section that consists of embolized tissue can be calculated. Measuring the number of embolized vessels in the imaged area is a simple counting experiment. In the samples investigated, wood fibers were cavitated in a large proportion of the xylem cross-section shortly after watering of the plant was stopped, but the number of embolized vessels remained low several days into a drought period. Under conditions of low evaporative demand, also refilling of previously embolized conduits was observed. Conclusions Desktop x-ray microtomography is shown to be an effective method for evaluating the water-filled versus embolized status of the stem xylem in a small living sapling. Due to its non-destructive nature, the risk of inducing embolisms during sampling is greatly reduced. Compared with synchrotron imaging beamlines, desktop microtomography offers easier accessibility, while maintaining sufficient resolution to visualize the water contents of individual cells...|$|E
