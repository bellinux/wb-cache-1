50|$|Books on Tape (sometimes {{abbreviated}} BoT) is an audiobook publishing {{imprint of}} Random House which emphasized unabridged audiobook recordings for schools and libraries. Prior to the acquisition by Random House in October 2001, {{the company was}} founded in California by Olympic gold medalist Duvall Hecht in 1975 as a direct to <b>consumer</b> <b>mail</b> order rental service for unabridged audiobooks on cassette tape. It {{was one of the}} pioneering companies in the fledgling audiobook business along with Recorded Books.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{instructional}} recordings {{were among the}} first commercial products sold on cassette. There were 8 companies distributing materials on cassette with titles such as Managing and Selling Companies (12 cassettes, $300) and Executive Seminar in Sound on a series of 60-minute cassettes. In libraries, most books on cassette were still made for the blind and handicap, however some new companies saw the opportunity for making audiobooks for a wider audience, such as Voice Over Books which produced abridged best-sellers with professional actors. Early pioneers included Olympic gold medalist Duvall Hecht who in 1975 founded the California-based Books on Tape as a direct to <b>consumer</b> <b>mail</b> order rental service for unabridged audiobooks and expanded their services selling their products to libraries and audiobooks gaining popularity with commuters and travelers. In 1978, Henry Trentman, a traveling salesman who listened to sales tapes while driving long distances, had the idea to create quality unabridged recordings of classic literature read by professional actors. His company, the Maryland-based Recorded Books, followed the model of Books on Tape but with higher quality studio recordings and actors. Recorded Books and Chivers Audio Books were the first to develop integrated production teams and to work with professional actors.|$|E

5000|$|Cereal box {{prizes and}} {{premiums}} have been distributed in four ways. The first, not frequently used now, was an in-store (or point-of-sale) prize that was handed {{to the customer}} with the purchase {{of one or more}} specified boxes of cereal. The second method of distribution is to include the prize in the box itself, usually outside the liner bag—often called an [...] "in-pack promotion" [...] in retail marketing. The third method is attaching the prize to the box - [...] "on-pack" [...] promotion - (as with plastic records laminated {{to the back of the}} box) or printing the prize on the box (as with numerous games and trading cards) or simply attaching the prize to the box with tape or shrink wrap. Some prizes include a gameboard or other interactive activity printed on the box that corresponds with the prize inside the box, which is used as a gamepiece. The fourth method of distribution is to have the <b>consumer</b> <b>mail</b> in the UPC proof-of-purchase labels cut from a specified number of boxes, sometimes with a cheque or money order to defray the cost of shipping, and the premium is sent to the consumer by mail (rarely first-class), usually from a third-party source.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} long-term {{ability of the}} consumers’ need for uniqueness measure to predict consumers’ valued possessions, shopping behaviors, and experiences. Consumers’ need for uniqueness reflects individual differences in counterconformity motivation (i. e., the pursuit of differentness relative to others) that is manifest in consumer responses. This research reports on 2 longitudinal assessments of the scale 2 ̆ 7 s predictive validity using data collected at 4 stages from a consumer mail-survey sample. One year following initial responses to the trait measure, respondents participated in a second survey in which they photographed and rank ordered their valued possessions. In a third survey, the photographs served as cues to obtain responses to ratings of possession benefits and to questions regarding acquisition of the possession. Overall, the results support a number of hypotheses regarding the relation of consumers’ need for uniqueness to salient possession benefits, types of goods comprising consumers’ valued possessions, and shopping behaviors associated with acquiring valued possessions. Two years following initial responses to the trait measure, members of the <b>consumer</b> <b>mail</b> panel completed a fourth survey, indicating their participation in various uniqueness-enhancing consumer activities. Results support the stability and predictive validity of the measure over the 2 -year period. Because the design of possessions and endorsed uniqueness-enhancing activities considered in the <b>consumer</b> <b>mail</b> panel studies varied across individuals, an additional study was conducted that demonstrated the scale 2 ̆ 7 s ability to predict individuals’ counterconformity responses to the same choice situation. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess usage patterns of wearable activity monitors among US adults and how user characteristics might influence physical activity estimates from this type of sample. We analyzed data on 3367 respondents to the 2015 HealthStyles survey, an annual <b>consumer</b> <b>mail</b> panel survey conducted on a nationwide sample. Approximately 1 in 8 respondents (12. 5 %) reported currently using a wearable activity monitor. Current use varied by sex, age, and education level. Use increased with physical activity level from 4. 3 % for inactive adults to 17. 4 % for active adults. Overall, 49. 9 % of all adults met the aerobic physical activity guideline, while this prevalence was 69. 5 % among current activity monitor users. Our findings suggest that current users of wearable activity monitors are not representative of the overall US population. Estimates of physical activity levels using data from wearable activity monitors users may be an overestimate and therefore data from users alone may have a limited role in physical activity surveillance. 2016 - 10 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 28101443 PMC 523469...|$|E

40|$|This study compares fashion {{leaders and}} market mavens by {{examining}} the demographic characteristics of fashion leaders and market mavens and how they differ in their evaluation of store and shopping related attributes. Data originated from a national <b>consumer</b> <b>mail</b> survey in the United States. The survey included items measuring market mavenism, fashion leadership, store evaluative attributes, and personal information. Responses from 380 consumers were used for data analysis. Female consumers {{were found to be}} more active in word-of-mouth activities in general. Young consumers were more inclined to express fashion leadership while age was not related to market mavenism. A lower level of education increased tendencies for both market mavenism and fashion leadership. In terms of store evaluative criteria, the majority of items in the survey were more important as fashion leadership and market mavenism tendencies increased. Interestingly, the need for knowledgeable or helpful salespeople did not increase with fashion leadership tendencies. Also, fashion leaders were interested in easy return of merchandise and were likely to spend more time in the stores. This study sheds important light on how fashion leadership differ compared to market mavenism. By simultaneously examining fashion leadership and market mavenism using a strong sample base, this study provides sound evidence of how consumers interested in fashion may have differing needs for shopping...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{mail survey}} {{was used to}} gather {{information}} from the main food buyer in random households in southeast Missouri to analyze consumer preferences for locally grown food. A majority of shoppers in the region {{were not aware of}} the state's AgriMissouri promotion program. Consumers de®ned locally grown not as a statewide concept but as a narrower regional concept that could cross state boundaries. Most important when purchasing produce were quality and freshness, and most consumers perceived local produce at farmers ' markets to be of higher quality and lower price. Farm households were not signi®cantly different from other households in the region and did not show a preference or willingness to pay a price premium for local food products. Food buyers who were members of an environmental group had higher education and income and were more likely to purchase organic food and more willing to pay a higher price for local produce. Households in which someone was raised on a farm, or had parents who were raised on a farm, had a preference for locally grown food and were willing to pay a price premium for it. Marketing local products should stress quality, freshness, and price competitiveness, and appeal to environmentalists and those with a favorable attitude towards family farms.
