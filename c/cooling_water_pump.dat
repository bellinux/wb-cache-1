5000|$|The field {{windings}} are supplied with {{power from the}} battery via the ignition switch and regulator. A parallel circuit supplies the [...] "charge" [...] warning indicator and is earthed via the regulator (which is why the indicator is on when the ignition is on but the engine is not running). Once the engine is running and the alternator is generating power, a diode feeds the field current from the alternator main output equalizing the voltage across the warning indicator which goes off. The wire supplying the field current {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "exciter" [...] wire. The drawback of this arrangement is that if the warning lamp burns out or the [...] "exciter" [...] wire is disconnected, no current reaches the {{field windings}} and the alternator will not generate power. Some warning indicator circuits are equipped with a resistor in parallel with the lamp that permit excitation current to flow if the warning lamp burns out. The driver should check that the warning indicator is on when the engine is stopped; otherwise, there might not be any indication of a failure of the belt which may also drive the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump.</b> Some alternators will self-excite when the engine reaches a certain speed.|$|E

40|$|The {{appearance}} and explosive population growth of zebra mussels have impacted many facilities near water, such as electricity-generating power plants. These mussels can congregate at plant-water-intake structures where proactive maintenance actions, such as mussel kills, must be performed. However, once dead, the mussel debris {{is a potential}} contaminant drawn into the plant via <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> suctions; this may affect piping and components downstream of the pump suctions. Thus, it becomes necessary to establish whether sufficient water velocity, from the suction action of a pump, exists to entrain shell debris. Although entrainment data for zebra mussel shells and shell fragments are lacking, this study employs a generalized empirical method based on other types of bivalve shells. Basic pump-suction considerations yield an entrainment volumetric zone in which any shells would be drawn into the pump. A calculated sample zone extends slightly less than one meter from the centerline of the pump-suction pipe and is cylindricalin shape. This approach can be generalized to various pump intake configurations and bivalves, providing a predictive means for evaluating plant system contaminants.

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{regards the}} design {{outlines}} and cost analysis, {{of a low}} temperature solar organic Rankine cycle system for Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination. The thermal processing taking place is described briefly below: Thermal energy produced from the solar collectors array evaporates the working fluid (HFC- 134 a) in the evaporator surface, changing the fluid state from sub-liquid to super heated vapour. The super-heated vapour is then driven to the expanders where the generated mechanical work produced by the processing drives the High Pressure pump of the RO unit, circulation pumps of the Rankine cycle (HFC- 134 a, <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump),</b> and the circulator of the collectors. The saturated vapour at the expanders ’ outlet is directed to the condenser and condensates. HFC- 134 a condensation is necessary in the Rankine process. On the condenser’s surface, seawater is pre-heated and directed to the seawater reservoir. Seawater pre-heating is applied to increase the fresh water recovery ratio. The saturated liquid at the condenser outlet is then pressurised by the HFC- 134 a pump.
