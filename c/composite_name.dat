2500|$|In Spain, {{legal and}} illegal foreign {{immigrants}} retain use of their cultural naming customs, yet upon becoming Spanish citizens, they are legally obliged to assume Spanish-style names (a name and two surnames). [...] If the naturalised person is from a one-surname culture, the actual surname is duplicated; [...] therefore, the English name [...] "George Albert Duran" [...] becomes the Spanish name [...] "George Albert Duran Duran", yet the law optionally allows him to adopt his mother's maiden name (her surname), as his maternal (second) surname. Formally, Spanish naming customs conflate his name [...] "George" [...] and his middle-name [...] "Albert" [...] to the <b>composite</b> <b>name</b> [...] "George Albert", and his sole surname, [...] "Duran", is duplicated as his paternal and maternal surnames. The repetition of the mother's surname was also adopted in Chile to give the children of single mothers a double surname to avoid discrimination in school.|$|E
2500|$|Prepositions {{that can}} be used in Portuguese {{surnames}} are da, das, do, dos and de, such as in Maria da Cunha, José das Neves, Joana do Rosário, Luís dos Santos, Gabriela de Sousa, etc. and mean [...] "from" [...] or [...] "of." [...] Da, dos, etc. are contractions of the preposition de and a definite article (o, as, etc.), meaning [...] "from the" [...] or [...] "of the." [...] The current convention in Portuguese is that they be written in lower case [...] Different from in Italian surnames, these conjunctives are usually not part of a <b>composite</b> <b>name,</b> i.e., [...] "Sousa" [...] is not different from [...] "de Sousa," [...] and both are ordered under 'S' in an alphabetical list. Therefore, one should not refer to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as Mr. Da Silva but rather Mr. Silva. The conjunction [...] "e" [...] (and) is also common, e.g. [...] "Maria Costa e Silva." [...] Most commonly this would be a composite surname; in this case the person should be addressed as [...] "Ms. Costa e Silva", and not as Ms. Silva.|$|E

2500|$|The Zohar {{found in}} God's Attributes as {{expressed}} in [...] components of God's essential Name. In the Zohar, Rabbi Simeon taught from the Book of Mystery that the Divine Name has both a revealed and a concealed form. In its revealed form, it is written as the four-letter Name of God, the Tetragrammaton, but in its undisclosed form it is written in other letters, and this undisclosed form represents the most Recondite of all. In the Zohar, Rabbi Judah taught that even the revealed form of the Name is hidden under other letters (as the name ADoNaY, , is hidden within ADNY, [...] ) in order to screen the most Recondite of all. In the letters of God's Name are concealed 22 attributes of Mercy, namely, the 13 attributes of God in [...] and nine attributes of the Mikroprosopus, the lesser revealed aspect of God. They all combine in one <b>composite</b> <b>Name.</b> When people were more reverent, the priests openly enunciated the Name in the hearing of all, but after irreverence became widespread, the Name became concealed under other letters. At {{the time when the}} Name was disclosed, the priest would concentrate his mind on its deep and inner meaning, and he would utter the Name {{in such a way as}} to accord with that meaning. But when irreverence became common in the world, he would conceal all within the written letters. The Zohar taught that Moses uttered the 22 letters in two sections, first in [...] in the attributes of God, and second in [...] when he uttered nine attributes of Mercy that are inherent in the Mikroprosopus, and which are radiated from the light of God. All this the priest combined together when he spread forth his hands to bless the people pursuant to [...] so that all the worlds received God's blessings. It is for this reason that [...] says simply [...] "saying" [...] ( [...] , amor), instead of the imperative form [...] "say" [...] ( [...] , imri), in a reference to the hidden letters within the words of the Priestly Blessing. The word , amor has in its letters the numerical value of 248 minus one ( [...] equals 1; [...] equals 40; [...] equals 6; [...] equals 200; and 1 + 40 + 6 + 200 = 247), equal to the number of a man's bodily parts, excepting the one part on which all the rest depend. All these parts thus receive the Priestly Blessing {{as expressed in}} the three verses of ...|$|E
60|$|Two towns {{stand on}} the shores of the lake less than a mile apart. What Lloyd's is to shipping, or the College of Surgeons to medicine, that they are to the Wheat. Its honour and {{integrity}} are in their hands; and they hate each other with the pure, poisonous, passionate hatred which makes towns grow. If Providence wiped out one of them, the survivor would pine away and die--a mateless hate-bird. Some day they must unite, and the question of the <b>composite</b> <b>name</b> they shall then carry already vexes them. A man there told me that Lake Superior was 'a useful piece of water,' in that it lay so handy to the C.P.R. tracks. There is a quiet horror about the Great Lakes which grows as one revisits them. Fresh water has no right or call to dip over the horizon, pulling down and pushing up the hulls of big steamers; no right to tread the slow, deep-sea dance-step between wrinkled cliffs; nor to roar in on weed and sand beaches between vast headlands that run out for leagues into haze and sea-fog. Lake Superior is all the same stuff as what towns pay taxes for, but it engulfs and wrecks and drives ashore, like a fully accredited ocean--a hideous thing to find in the heart of a continent. Some people go sailing on it for pleasure, and it has produced a breed of sailors who bear the same relation to the salt-water variety as a snake-charmer does to a lion-tamer.|$|E

The microstructure and mechanical properties were {{compared with those of}} the spherical β-phase reinforced <b>composite</b> <b>named</b> as <b>composite</b> S 2. It was found that the composite D 2 contains β-phase dendrites up to 56 % in volume-fraction, and exhibits a ductile compressive behavior with plastic strain of 12. 7 %. As the high-volume-fractioned β-phase dendrites transferred to coarse spherical particles of about 20 μm in diameter in the composite S 2, a much improved plastic strain up to 20. 4 % can be achieved. Micrographs of the fractured samples reveal different interaction modes of the propagating shear bands with the dendritic and spherical β phase inclusions, resulting in different shear strains in the composite samples. The matrix of composite S 2 undergoes a significantly larger shear strain than that of the composite D 2 before ultimate failure, which is thought to be mainly responsible for the greatly increased global plastic strain of the S 2 relative to D 2...|$|R

There is lack of consensus in the expert dental community as to whether a biodegradable root canal filling material, such as Resilon or Real Seal is desirable.|$|R
