5|$|Italian {{folk songs}} include ballads, lyrical songs, lullabies and children's songs, {{seasonal}} songs based around holidays such as Christmas, life-cycle songs that celebrate weddings, baptisms {{and other important}} events, dance songs, cattle calls and occupational songs, tied to professions such as fishermen, shepherds and soldiers. Ballads (<b>canti</b> epico-lirici) and lyric songs (<b>canti</b> lirico-monostrofici) are two important categories. Ballads are most common in northern Italy, while lyric songs prevail further south. Ballads are {{closely tied to the}} English form, with some British ballads existing in exact correspondence with an Italian song. Other Italian ballads are more closely based on French models. Lyric songs are a diverse category that consist of lullabies, serenades and work songs, and are frequently improvised though based on a traditional repertoire.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro <b>Canti</b> is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E

25|$|The {{first edition}} of the Odhecaton (Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A) does not survive complete, and the exact {{publication}} date is not known, but it includes a dedication dated May 15, 1501. The second and third editions were printed on January 14, 1503 and May 25, 1504, respectively. Each corrected several errors of the previous editions. Petrucci published two further anthologies, the <b>Canti</b> B and <b>Canti</b> C, in 1502 and 1504, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Quattro <b>Canti</b> {{is a small}} square at the {{crossing}} of the ancient main roads (now: Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Via Maqueda) dividing the town into its quarters (mandamenti). The buildings at the corner have diagonal baroque façades so the square has an almost octagonal form.|$|E
25|$|While Reingot's music may {{once have}} been more abundant, only two pieces survive {{attributed}} to him: a four-voice motet setting of the Marian antiphon Salve regina, and a four-voice chanson, Fors seulement, based on the tune by Johannes Ockeghem. Reingot's version, published in Petrucci's <b>Canti</b> C, uses Ockeghem's superius transposed down an octave in the tenor voice and has three florid, quick-moving contrapuntal voices around it.|$|E
25|$|Ariosto {{continued}} to write more {{material for the}} poem and in the 1520s he produced five more cantos, marking a further development of his poetry, which {{he decided not to}} include in the final edition. They were published after his death by his illegitimate son Virginio under the title Cinque <b>canti</b> and are highly regarded by some modern critics. The third and final version of Orlando Furioso, containing 46 cantos, appeared in 1532.|$|E
25|$|It was {{morning and}} Belacqua {{was stuck in}} the first of the <b>canti</b> in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither {{backward}} nor forward.

She had it from God, therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular.|$|E
25|$|Many Corsican authors (who {{wrote in}} Italian) were {{influenced}} by {{the ideals of the}} Italian Risorgimento {{during the second half of}} the 19th century, such as Giuseppe Multado, Gian Paolo Borghetti, Francesco Ottaviano Renucci (Storia della Corsica dal 1789 al 1830 and Novelle storiche corse). Even the Italian Nicolo Tommaseo collected the <b>Canti</b> popolari corsi (with points of view of Italian irredentism) and made a compilation of the letters (Lettere di Pasquale de Paoli) of Pasquale Paoli.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{example of}} Baroque {{on the island}} is Giulio Lasso's Quattro <b>Canti,</b> an octagonal piazza, or circus, constructed around 1610 {{at the crossroads of}} the city's two principal streets. [...] Around this intersection are four open sides, being the streets, and four matching buildings with identical canted corners. The sides of the four buildings are curved, further heightening the Baroque design of the buildings lining the circus. These four great buildings dominating the circus are each enhanced by a fountain, reminiscent of those of Pope Sixtus V's [...] "Quattro Fontane" [...] in Rome. However, here in Palermo the Baroque theme continues up three storeys of the buildings, which are adorned with statues in recessed niches depicting the four seasons, the four Spanish kings of Sicily, and the four patronesses of Palermo: Saints Cristina, Ninfa, Olivia, and Agata.|$|E

2500|$|Cellavenia's music shows {{a mixture}} of Italian {{elements}} and stylistic traits of the Franco-Flemish composers from the north. Many of his motets are based on pre-existing material: <b>canti</b> firmi are drawn from composers such as [...] Richafort and Andreas da Silva, composers who are, not surprisingly, represented in the same manuscripts which contain his work – he was familiar with their music from {{his work at the}} cathedral. Others of his motets are based on Gregorian chants.|$|E
2500|$|Her violin concerto, Due <b>Canti</b> e Finale, was {{commissioned}} by Yehudi Menuhin, who performed it at the 1977 Edinburgh Festival with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Charles Groves. Menuhin described Rainier as [...] "having a musical imagination of a colour and variety scarcely to be believed". On the other hand, after hearing her music, William Walton commented that she [...] "must have barbed-wire underwear". Concertante for Two Winds and Orchestra was written for, and dedicated to, Janet Craxton and Thea King and was premiered at the Proms in 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Ivy Priaulx Rainier (3 February 190310 October 1986) was a South African-British composer. [...] Although {{she lived}} {{most of her}} life in England and died in France, her {{compositional}} style was strongly influenced by the African music remembered from her childhood. She never adopted 12-tone or serial techniques, but her music shows a profound understanding of that musical language. She can be credited with the first truly athematic works composed in England. [...] Her Cello Concerto was premiered by Jacqueline du Pré in 1964, and her Violin Concerto Due <b>Canti</b> e Finale was premiered by Yehudi Menuhin in 1977.|$|E
2500|$|The Divine Comedy is {{composed}} of 14,233 lines that are divided into three canticas (Italian plural cantiche)– Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise)– each consisting of 33 cantos (Italian plural [...] <b>canti).</b> An initial canto, serving as {{an introduction to the}} poem and generally considered {{to be part of the}} first cantica, brings the total number of cantos to 100. It is generally accepted, however, that the first two cantos serve as a unitary prologue to the entire epic, and that the opening two cantos of each cantica serve as prologues to each of the three canticas.|$|E
2500|$|During the 15th century, Italy {{entered a}} slow period in native composition, with the {{exception}} of a few bright lights such as the performer and anthologist Leonardo Giustinian. [...] As the powerful northern families such as the d'Este and Medici built up powerful political dynasties, they brought northern composers of the Franco-Flemish school such as Josquin and Compère to their courts. [...] Starting in the last decades of the century, Italian composers such as Marchetto Cara and Bartolomeo Tromboncino wrote light, courtly songs called frottole for the Mantuan court of Isabella d'Este. [...] With the support of the Medici, the Florentine Mardi Gras season led to the creation of witty, earthy carnival songs called <b>canti</b> carnascialeschi.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s, Nono's musical {{activities}} {{became increasingly}} explicit and polemical in their subject, whether {{that be the}} warning against nuclear catastrophe (<b>Canti</b> di vita e d'amore: sul ponte di Hiroshima of 1962), the denunciation of capitalism (La Fabbrica Illuminata, 1964), the condemnation of Nazi war criminals {{in the wake of}} the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials (Ricorda cosi ti hanno fatto in Auschwitz, 1965), or of American imperialism in the Vietnam War (A floresta é jovem e cheja de vida, 1966). Nono began to incorporate documentary material (political speeches, slogans, extraneous sounds) on tape, and a new use of electronics, that he felt necessary to produce the [...] "concrete situations" [...] relevant to contemporary political issues [...] The instrumental writing tended to conglomerate the 'punctual' serial style of the early 1950s into groups, clusters of sounds—broadstrokes that complimented the use of tape collage [...] In keeping with his Marxist convictions as 'reinterpreted' through the writings of Antonio Gramsci ( [...] ; [...] ), he brought this music into universities, trade-unions and factories where he gave lectures and performances.
