5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the <b>chemoreceptor</b> trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are measured by the peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are more sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central <b>chemoreceptor</b> is particularly sensitive to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{sensory organs}} of {{bivalves}} {{are not well}} developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The <b>chemoreceptor</b> cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the siphons, but in some species, they fringe the entire mantle cavity. The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with {{the structure of the}} same name found in snails and slugs. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity. In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of peripheral vs. central <b>chemoreceptors</b> in causing apnea/unstable breathing during sleep is unresolved. This has never been tested in an unanesthetized preparation with intact carotid bodies. We studied three unanesthetized dogs during normal sleep in a preparation in which intact carotid body <b>chemoreceptors</b> could be reversibly isolated from the systemic circulation and perfused. Apneic thresholds and the CO 2 reserve (PETCO 2 eupneic- PETCO 2 apneic threshold) were determined using a pressure support ventilation (PSV) technique. Dogs were studied when both central and peripheral <b>chemoreceptors</b> sensed transient hypocapnia induced by the PSV and again with carotid body isolation such that only the central <b>chemoreceptors</b> sensed the hypocapnia. We observed that the CO 2 reserve was 4. 5 Torr when the carotid <b>chemoreceptors</b> sensed the transient hypocapnia but more than doubled (> 9 Torr) when only the central <b>chemoreceptors</b> sensed hypocapnia. Furthermore, the TE prolongations observed when only central <b>chemoreceptors</b> were exposed to hypocapnia differed from those obtained when both the central and peripheral <b>chemoreceptors</b> sensed the hypocapnia in that they: a) were substantially shorter for a given reduction i...|$|R

25|$|The {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} plays {{a central role in}} maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis via pressure, volume, and <b>chemoreceptor</b> signals. It does this by regulating the peripheral vasculature, and kidney function, which in turn affect cardiac output, vascular resistance, and fluid retention. Excess activity of the sympathetic nervous system increases blood pressure and contributes to hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting {{is due to}} gastric stasis (large volume vomiting, brief nausea {{relieved}} by vomiting, oesophageal reflux, epigastric fullness, early satiation), besides direct action on the <b>chemoreceptor</b> trigger zone of the area postrema, the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents (e.g. domperidone or metoclopramide). If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route (e.g. subcutaneous for metoclopramide, rectally for domperidone).|$|E
5000|$|The {{vagus nerve}} {{also has a}} {{sympathetic}} function via the peripheral <b>chemoreceptors.</b> [...] Peripheral <b>chemoreceptors</b> are activated primarily due to hypoxemia.

5000|$|The {{carotid body}} <b>chemoreceptors</b> are {{primarily}} sensitive to decreases in the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). This {{is in contrast}} to the central <b>chemoreceptors</b> in the medulla that are primarily sensitive to changes in pH and PCO2 (a decrease in pH and an increase in PCO2). The carotid body <b>chemoreceptors</b> are also sensitive to pH and PCO2, but only secondarily. More specifically, the sensitivity of carotid body <b>chemoreceptors</b> to decreased PO2 is greater when pH is decreased and PCO2 is increased.|$|R
25|$|Respiratory stimulants: carotid <b>chemoreceptor</b> {{agonists}} (e.g. doxapram), 5-HT4 agonists (e.g. BIMU8), δ-opioid agonists (e.g. BW373U86) and AMPAkines (e.g. CX717) can all reduce {{respiratory depression}} caused by opioids without affecting analgesia, {{but most of}} these drugs are only moderately effective or have side effects which preclude use in humans. 5-HT1A agonists such as 8-OH-DPAT and repinotan also counteract opioid-induced respiratory depression, {{but at the same time}} reduce analgesia, which limits their usefulness for this application.|$|E
25|$|Many {{pharmacological}} treatments {{which are}} effective for nausea and vomiting in some medical conditions {{may not be}} effective for motion sickness. For example, metoclopramide and prochlorperazine, although widely used for nausea, are ineffective for motion-sickness prevention and treatment. This {{is due to the}} physiology of the CNS vomiting centre and its inputs from the <b>chemoreceptor</b> trigger zone versus the inner ear. Sedating anti-histamine medications such as promethazine work quite well for motion sickness, although they can cause significant drowsiness.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron is {{a highly}} {{specific}} and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The 5-HT3 receptors are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the <b>chemoreceptor</b> trigger zone of the area postrema. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. It is thought that ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated mostly via antagonism of vagal afferents with a minor contribution from antagonism of central receptors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{response}} to stimulation of <b>chemoreceptors</b> {{on the heart}} rate is complicated. <b>Chemoreceptors</b> in the heart or nearby large arteries as well as <b>chemoreceptors</b> in the lungs can affect heart rate. Activation of these peripheral <b>chemoreceptors</b> from sensing decreased O2, increased CO2 and a decreased pH is relayed to cardiac centers by the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the medulla of the brainstem. This increases the sympathetic nervous stimulation on the heart and a corresponding increase in heart rate and contractility in most cases. [...] These factors include activation of stretch receptors due to increased ventilation {{and the release of}} circulating catecholamines.|$|R
50|$|Peripheral <b>chemoreceptors</b> work {{in concert}} with central <b>chemoreceptors,</b> which also monitor blood CO2 but {{do it in the}} {{cerebrospinal}} fluid surrounding the brain. A high concentration of central <b>chemoreceptors</b> is found in the ventral medulla, the brainstem area that receives input from peripheral <b>chemoreceptors.</b> Taken together, these blood oxygen monitors contribute nerve signals to the vasomotor center of the medulla which can modulate several processes, including breathing, airway resistance, blood pressure, and arousal, with central chemoformation about medullary oxygen levels and peripheral <b>chemoreceptors</b> about arterial oxygen. At an evolutionary level, this stabilization of oxygen levels, which also results in a more constant carbon dioxide concentration and pH, was important to manage oxygen flow in air-vs.-water breathing, sleep, and to maintain an ideal pH for protein structure, since fluctuations in pH can denature a cell's enzymes.|$|R
40|$|Kinney and Thach (Aug. 20 issue) {{review the}} {{putative}} terminal respiratory pathway {{associated with the}} {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS), and they indicate a life-threatening event and failure of arousal as the first steps in the respiratory pathway to SIDS. The authors mention only central cortical and subcortical structures involved in arousal mechanisms, without referring to peripheral arterial <b>chemoreceptors</b> as the carotid body, the role of which in arousal from asphyxial events is widely accepted. Prematurity and exposure to smoke also increase the risk of SIDS and adversely affect the response of the peripheral arterial <b>chemoreceptors.</b> These <b>chemoreceptors</b> undergo structural and functional development during the postnatal period, with a gradual increase in hypoxic sensitivity. Prematurity causes intrinsic abnormalities of the response of the peripheral arterial <b>chemoreceptors,</b> which may be further worsened by prematurity-associated intermittent hypoxic events or oxygen therapy. Intermittent hypoxia may cause hypersensitivity of the peripheral arterial <b>chemoreceptors,</b> which may increase the risk of SIDS, precipitating unstable respiration through apneic responses after sighs or brief arousals. 2 - 4 Conversely, exposure to hyperoxia has been reported to cause hyposensitivity of the peripheral arterial <b>chemoreceptors,</b> possibly leading to an ineffective response. Perinatal exposure to nicotine also blunts the function of the peripheral arterial <b>chemoreceptors</b> through changes in expression of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators...|$|R
25|$|Chemical senses {{include the}} use of chemoreceptors, related to taste and smell, {{affecting}} mating, habitat selection, feeding and parasite-host relationships. Taste is usually located on the mouthparts of the insect but in some insects, such as bees, wasps and ants, taste organs can also be found on the antennae. Taste organs can also be found on the tarsi of moths, butterflies and flies. Olfactory sensilla enable insects to smell and are usually found in the antennae. <b>Chemoreceptor</b> sensitivity related to smell in some substances, is very high and some insects can detect particular odours that are at low concentrations miles from their original source.|$|E
25|$|If {{irritants}} {{are present}} in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates 5-HT3 receptors in the <b>chemoreceptor</b> trigger zone that stimulate vomiting. The enterochromaffin cells not only react to bad food but are also very sensitive to irradiation and cancer chemotherapy. Drugs that block 5HT3 are very effective in controlling the nausea and vomiting produced by cancer treatment, and are considered the gold standard for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|The 5-HT3 receptors {{are present}} in several {{critical}} sites involved in emesis, including vagal afferents, the solitary tract nucleus (STN), and the area postrema itself. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists suppress vomiting and nausea by inhibiting serotonin binding to the 5-HT3 receptors. The highest concentration of 5-HT3 receptors in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) are found in the STN and <b>chemoreceptor</b> trigger zone (CTZ), and 5-HT3 antagonists may also suppress vomiting and nausea by acting at these sites. The 5-HT3 antagonists are greatly selective and have little affinity for other receptors, such as dopamine, histamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, hypoxia is {{detected}} by the peripheral <b>chemoreceptors</b> in the carotid body and aortic body, with the carotid body <b>chemoreceptors</b> being the major mediators of reflex responses to hypoxia.

40|$|The localization, {{distribution}} and orientation of O <b>chemoreceptors</b> {{associated with the}} control of cardio-respiratory responses were investigated in the neotropical, Hoplias lacerdae. Selective denervation of the cranial nerves (IX and X) was combined with chemical stimulation (NaCN) to characterize the gill O <b>chemoreceptors,</b> and the fish were then exposed to gradual hypoxia to examine the extent of each cardio-respiratory response. Changes in heart rate (f) and ventilation amplitude (V) were allied with <b>chemoreceptors</b> distributed on {{both internal and external}} surfaces of all gill arches, while ventilation rate (f) was allied to the O <b>chemoreceptors</b> located only in the internal surface of the first gill arch. H. lacerdae exposed to gradual hypoxia produced a marked bradycardia (45 %) and 50 % increase in V, but only a relatively small change in f (32 %). Thus, the low f response yet high V were in accord with the characterization of the O <b>chemoreceptors.</b> Comparing these results from H. lacerdae with hypoxia-tolerant species revealed a relationship existent between general oxygenation of the individual species environment, its cardio-respiratory response to hypoxia and the characterization of O <b>chemoreceptors...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{medullary}} inspiratory neuron is a neuron in the inspiratory {{centre of}} the medulla of the brain. Inputs to this neuron come from the peripheral <b>chemoreceptors,</b> carotid body, aortic body, and central <b>chemoreceptors.</b> It regulates breathing.|$|R
25|$|Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, {{during which}} antiemetics (e.g. low dose {{haloperidol}} once at night) are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine {{is more often}} used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as ondansetron or tropisetron are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as domperidone and metoclopramide. Domperidone does not cross the blood–brain barrier and produce adverse central antidopaminergic effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the <b>chemoreceptor</b> trigger zone. (The drug is not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (e.g. orphenadrine or diphenhydramine) may also be effective. The first-generation antihistamine hydroxyzine is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol relieves nausea and vomiting; it also produces analgesia that may allow lower doses of opioids with reduced nausea and vomiting.|$|E
500|$|When the spiny scallop's valves are parted {{for feeding}} and respiration, many tentacles {{protrude}} from each {{edge of the}} mantle. The longer ones have sensitive <b>chemoreceptor</b> cells at their tip which can taste the water and allow the mollusc to react appropriately to, for example, the [...] "smell" [...] of a starfish, by taking evasive action. The shorter ones, forming a ring all the way round {{the edge of the}} mantle, have simple eyes at their tips. Each eye contains a lens, two retinas and a concave spherical mirror. The eyes cannot see objects but can detect the difference between light and darkness, enabling the valves to be snapped shut if some large, threatening object looms nearby. They also {{seem to be able to}} detect the size and speed of particles moving past the bivalve in the current, enabling it to open its valves wide to feed when conditions are suitable.|$|E
2500|$|Through {{studies using}} {{mammalian}} model organisms, {{there are two}} main hypotheses for the location of oxygen sensing in <b>chemoreceptor</b> cells: the membrane hypothesis and the mitochondrial hypothesis. [...] The membrane hypothesis was proposed for the carotid body in mice, and it predicts that oxygen sensing is an ion balance initiated process. [...] The mitochondrial hypothesis was also proposed for the carotid body of mice, but it relies on the levels of oxidative phosphorylation and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as a cue for hypoxia. [...] Specifically, the oxygen sensitive K+ [...] currents are inhibited by H2O2 and NADPH oxidase activation. [...] There is evidence for both of these hypotheses depending on the species used for the study. [...] For the neuroepithelial cells in the zebrafish gills, there is strong evidence supporting the [...] "membrane hypothesis" [...] due to their capacity to respond to hypoxia after removal of the contents of the cell.

40|$|A {{description}} is given of crustacean chemosensory {{systems and the}} neurophysiological procedures used to study them. Their response properties and tuning characteristics are discussed. A review is then provided of specific crustacean <b>chemoreceptors</b> that are stimulated selectively by either purine nucleotides, taurine, glutamate, or glycine, {{all of which have}} neuroactive properties in internal tissues. Two distinctly different types of purinergic <b>chemoreceptors</b> occur on the antennules of the spiny lobster. P 1 -like <b>chemoreceptors</b> have a potency sequence of AMP greater than ADP greater than ATP greater than adenosine and show a strict structural requirement for the ribose phosphate moiety. P 2 -like <b>chemoreceptors</b> have a potency sequence of ATP greater than ADP greater than AMP or adenosine and show a broad sensitivity to nucleotide triphosphates with modifications in both the purine and ribose phosphate moieties. Sensilla containing the dendrites of chemosensory neurons also possess an ectonucleotidase(s) that inactivates excitatory nucleotides to yield adenosine which is subsequently internalized by a sensillar uptake system. Narrowly tuned taurinergic <b>chemoreceptors</b> are present on both the antennules and legs of lobsters. Although taurine itself is the most effective stimulant, the taurine analogs hypotaurine and beta-alanine are also very excitatory. Structure-activity studies indicate these <b>chemoreceptors</b> have marked similarities to taurine-sensitive systems in internal tissues of vertebrates. By contrast, comparative studies of glutamatergic <b>chemoreceptors</b> on the legs of lobsters indicate response spectra {{different from those of the}} glutamate receptors in lobster neuromuscular junctions and the three classes of excitatory amino acid receptors identified internally in vertebrates. Crustacean <b>chemoreceptors</b> for glycine, ecdysteroids, and pyridine are also described.

2500|$|Neuroepithelial cells (NEC) {{are thought}} to be neuron-like <b>chemoreceptor</b> cells because they rely on {{membrane}} potential changes for the release of neurotransmitters and signal transmission onto nearby cells. [...] Once NEC of the zebrafish gills come in contact with either environmental or aortic hypoxia, an outward K+ [...] "leak" [...] channel is inhibited. [...] It remains unclear how these K+ channels are inhibited by a shortage of oxygen because there are yet to be any known direct binding sites for [...] "a lack of oxygen", only whole cell and ion channel responses to hypoxia. [...] K+ [...] "leak" [...] channels are two-pore-domain ion channels that are open at the resting membrane potential of the cell and {{play a major role in}} setting the equilibrium resting membrane potential of the cell. [...] Once this [...] "leak" [...] channel is closed, the K+ is no longer able to freely flow out of the cell, and the membrane potential of the NEC increases; the cell becomes depolarized. [...] This depolarization causes voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to open, and for extracellular Ca2+ to flow down its concentration gradient into the cell causing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration to greatly increase. [...] Once the Ca2+ is inside the cell, it binds to the vesicle release machinery and facilitates binding of the t-snare complex on the vesicle to the s-snare complex on the NEC cell membrane which initiates the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.|$|E
