40|$|A recent {{conjecture}} in cyber-insurance research {{states that}} for compulsory monopolistic insurance scenarios, <b>charging</b> fines and <b>rebates</b> on fair premiums will incentivize network users {{to invest in}} self-defense investments, thereby making cyber-space more robust. Assuming {{the validity of the}} conjecture in this paper, we adopt a topological perspective in proposing a mechanism that accounts for (i) the positive externalities posed (through self-defense investments) by network users on their peers, and (ii) network location (based on centrality measures) of users, and provides an appropriate way to proportionally allocate fines/rebates on user premiums. We mathematically justify (via a game-theoretic analysis) that optimal fine/rebates per user should be allocated in proportion to the Bonacich or eigenvector centrality value of the user.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the sustainability of}} vertical contracts between airports and airlines. We focus {{on the case of}} Quantity Forcing contracts, with a theoretical model that accommodates changes to the contracts' clauses or environments in a two period game, since contracts often include clauses that determine obligations for airlines and airports to be accomplished in more than a single period. We find that contracts - by which airlines commit to carry to the airport the quantity that maximizes joint profits and airports commit to advertise the airlines and to <b>rebate</b> <b>charges</b> - are not sustainable. The relationship holds for both the finite periods and a two period game, a situation similar to a Prisoner's Dilemma. Nevertheless, when there is uncertainty from demand fluctuations the Nash equilibrium of the game depends on the magnitude of the expected fall on demand and on the probability of the state of nature. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The Rule of 78s {{deals with}} precomputed loans, which are loans whose finance charge is {{calculated}} before the loan is made. Finance charge, carrying charges, interest costs, {{or whatever the}} cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the finance charge has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the finance <b>charge</b> to be <b>rebated</b> (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only owes the lender the principal amount borrowed, but the borrower owes the finance charge as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed finance charge is $3,000, the borrower owes the lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower owes the lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal.|$|R
40|$|California {{will need}} {{widespread}} consumer adoption of electric vehicles {{in order to}} achieve the state’s environmental and energy goals. Governor Brown set a goal of reaching 1. 5 million zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) on California’s roadways by 2025, and as of June 2017, Californians were driving almost 300, 000 electric vehicles. Achieving the state’s electric vehicle goals will require a significant boost to charging infrastructure. This need is particularly acute for residents who do not live in single family detached homes, where more than 80 percent of current electric vehicle owners reside. Overall, approximately 40 percent of Californians live in multi-unit dwellings (with even higher percentages in the state’s urban areas), such as apartments, townhouses, and condominiums, with impeded or no access to charging. This infrastructure deployment is unlikely to occur without policy action. Charging stations and installation and maintenance typically entail high costs, with often uncertain revenues from various potential sources, which deters investment. For example, a recent California Energy Commission charging program found that a dual standard fast charger, coupled with a single “Level 2 ” (240 volt) charger and additional stub, averaged $ 135, 000 in equipment costs. Even the total costs of installing “make-ready” infrastructure, which covers all the electrical wiring needed to support a customer-purchased charger, for Level 2 <b>charging</b> (including customer <b>rebates</b> for the <b>charging</b> stations) were at $ 13, 734 per port and $ 219, 424 per site with 16 ports on average, as Southern California Edison recently found. To address these costs and spur the needed investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, UC Berkeley and UCLA Schools of Law convened experts from the private and public sectors for two separate discussions in June 2016 at UCLA Law and November 2016 at Berkeley Law (all participants are listed in the appendix). The first convening focused on general barriers and solutions to increasing charging deployment, while the second covered the specific topic of reforming commercial electricity rates to boost the infrastructure. This report is informed by both discussions, offering a vision for deployment and commercial electricity rate reform and identifying the top barriers and solutions to electric vehicle charging in California...|$|R
