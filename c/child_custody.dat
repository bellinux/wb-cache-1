40|$|The court {{decisions}} on <b>child's</b> <b>custody</b> - summary The upbringing {{of children is}} one of the basic institutes of parenthood. As every legal institute even this one can be approached from different perspectives of legal regulation. This thesis is focused on aspects and consequences of court proceedings and decisions on the <b>child's</b> <b>custody</b> issues in relation with the divorce or separation of parents - as regulated in Sections 26 and 50 of the Act no. 94 / 1963 Coll., Family Act, as amended. I have chosen this particular topic for personal reasones. From the formal point of view, the thesis is divided into six chapters. In the first chapter, sources of the law and main terms are defined. Furthermore, the current legal regulation of the court's decision on the <b>child's</b> <b>custody</b> is compared to the legal framework, which is yet to come into effect, and in a more details the judicial application of the regulation is analyzed considering the legal and factual relations with the divorce and the parents separation. The second chapter and the third chapter are focused on the outline of the substantive law - the second chapter on the current legal framework, the third chapter on the rules set down in the new civil code. The fourth chapter contains the overview of the procedural regulations and institutions. The fifth chapter [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In {{a divorce}} or <b>child</b> <b>custody</b> case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights of the parents. In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to only one of the parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E
5|$|Although Islam is the {{official}} religion of the federation, Sarawak has no official state religion. However, during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, the Constitution of Sarawak was amended to make the Yang di-Pertuan Agong {{as the head of}} Islam in Sarawak and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs. With such provisions, Islamic policies can be formulated in Sarawak and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is possible. The 1978 Majlis Islam Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in Sarawak with jurisdictions over matrimonial, <b>child</b> <b>custody,</b> betrothal, inheritance, and criminal cases in the state. An appeals court and Courts of Kadi were also formed.|$|E

5|$|First-wave {{feminism}} was {{a period}} of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK Custody of Infants Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for <b>child</b> <b>custody</b> arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar legislation in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed legislation in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.|$|E

The firm was well known for its support of {{constitutional}} rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members); Rodham worked on <b>child</b> <b>custody</b> and other cases. Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California; the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.

25|$|International child {{abduction}} occurs when one parent takes (or retains) a child before <b>child</b> <b>custody</b> ends at age 18, {{to a foreign}} country (example China, India and Japan) and keeps him or her there without the other parent’s permission. If that parent refuses to bring the child {{under the age of}} 16 back to the United States, it’s considered a federal crime in the United States. It does not matter if the child does not want to return to the United States, or if the courts in the other country (example China, India and Japan) allow the taking parent to keep the child in the other country (example China, India and Japan). The taking parent can face up to three years in United States Federal prison, even when the child is over the age of 18, does not want to ever see the left behind parent again and does not want the taking parent to face criminal charges or go to jail. According to law, the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the child is not returned before <b>child</b> <b>custody</b> ends at age 18. This is because <b>child</b> <b>custody</b> does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights. This is because the courts in other country's (example China, Japan and India) do not enforce a US <b>child</b> <b>custody</b> order.|$|E
25|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, a rebuttable {{presumption}} (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless someone comes forward to contest it and prove otherwise.

According to law, in an International child abduction the left behind parent is legally the only victim, if the child is not returned before <b>child</b> <b>custody</b> ends at age 18.
