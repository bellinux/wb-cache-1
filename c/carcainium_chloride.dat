40|$|The anti-tussive effects, of {{the local}} anaesthetic, {{lidocaine}} and <b>carcainium</b> <b>chloride</b> (RSD 931) have been investigated in guinea-pigs and rabbits. Pre-treatment of guinea-pigs with aerosols of lidocaine or RSD 931 at 0. 1, 1. 0 and 10 mg ml− 1 {{reduced the number of}} citric acid-induced coughs by 9. 3, 32. 6 and 40. 9 % (P> 0. 05) for lidocaine and by 25. 3 % (P> 0. 05), 40. 4 % (P> 0. 05) and 97. 6 % (P 0. 05) (lidocaine) and by 25 % (P> 0. 05) and 76. 9 % (P 0. 05) effects on discharges in bronchial C-fibres originating from bronchial C-fibre endings, capsaicin-evoked discharges of either pulmonary or bronchial C-fibre endings or on capsaicin-evoked bronchoconstriction. In contrast, lidocaine (10. 0 mg ml− 1) significantly (P< 0. 05) inhibited spontaneous and capsaicin-induced discharges in both pulmonary and bronchial C-fibres respectively. Lidocaine also significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced capsaicin-evoked bronchoconstriction. These studies suggest that the anti-tussive actions of RSD 931 are mediated via inhibition of discharges in Aδ-fibres originating from airway RARs. The mechanism of action of RSD 931 is distinct from that {{of the local}} anaesthetic lidocaine and RSD 931 may represent a novel class of anti-tussive agent...|$|E
