Other drugs that interact with fluoroquinolones include sucralfate, probenecid, cimetidine, theophylline, warfarin, antiviral agents, phenytoin, cyclosporine, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and <b>cycloserine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|It is {{believed}} that certain neurodegenerative disorders, particularly schizophrenia and epilepsy, may be partially caused by varying levels of gliotransmission and calcium excitability. [...] One theory, called the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, suggests that glutamate deficiency, {{which leads to the}} dysfunction of NMDARs at the presynaptic terminal, {{is believed}} to cause symptoms of schizophrenia. According to research, this hypofunctionality of NMDARs {{has been shown to be}} caused by lower amounts of gliotransmission facilitated by D-serine. More recently, it has been shown that D-serine and serine racemase occur almost exclusively in neurons, which do not support a role of D-serine as a gliotransmitter. The fact that <b>cycloserine,</b> which acts as an agonist for the NMDAR’s binding site, is used in the treatment for patients with schizophrenia further supports the glutamate hypothesis. [...] In the case of epilepsy, it is known that glutamate plays a role in synchronous depolarizations. [...] This has led researchers to believe that excitation of epileptic discharges may be caused by the glutamate-mediated gliotransmission. [...] Although that some studies show that the all excitations caused by gliotransmission lead to epileptic discharges, but it could possibly increase the intensity of length of epileptiform activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cycloserine</b> is {{a second}} line drug against tuberculosis. Note that <b>cycloserine,</b> while {{technically}} an oxazolidone, has a different mechanism of action and substantially different properties from the aforementioned compounds.|$|E
5000|$|Under mildly acidic conditions, <b>cycloserine</b> hydrolyzes to give {{hydroxylamine}} and D-serine. [...] <b>Cycloserine</b> can {{be thought}} of a cyclized version of serine, with an oxidative loss of dihydrogen to form the nitrogen-oxygen bond.|$|E
50|$|For the {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, <b>cycloserine</b> is classified as a second-line drug, i.e. its use is only considered if one or more first-line drugs cannot be used. Hence, <b>cycloserine</b> is restricted for use only against multiple drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. Another reason for limited use of this drug is the neurological side effects it causes, since {{it is able to}} penetrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and cause headaches, drowsiness, depression, dizziness, vertigo, confusion, paresthesias, dysarthria, hyperirritability, psychosis, convulsions, and shaking (tremors). Overdose of <b>cycloserine</b> may result in paresis, seizures, and coma, while alcohol consumption may increase the risk of seizures. Coadministration of pyridoxine can reduce the incidence of some of these CNS side effects (e.g. convulsions) caused by <b>cycloserine.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Cycloserine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Seromycin, is an {{antibiotic}} used to treat tuberculosis. Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, for active drug resistant tuberculosis. It is given by mouth.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., {{the price}} of <b>cycloserine</b> {{increased}} from $500 for 30 pills to $10,800 in 2015 after the Chao Center for Industrial Pharmacy and Contract Manufacturing changed ownership to Rodelis Therapeutics in August 2015.|$|E
50|$|Terizidone {{is a drug}} used in the {{treatment}} of tuberculosis. Terizidone is used mainly used in multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in conjunction with other second-line drugs. It is a derivate of <b>cycloserine</b> and it is bacteriostatic.|$|E
50|$|Cycloserine/lurasidone (proposed {{brand name}} Cyclurad) is a {{combination}} formulation of <b>cycloserine</b> (D-cycloserine), a partial agonist of the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, and lurasidone, an atypical antipsychotic, which is under development {{for the treatment of}} bipolar depression by NeuroRx.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cycloserine</b> {{works as}} an {{antibiotic}} by inhibiting cell-wall biosynthesis in bacteria. [...] As a cyclic analogue of D-alanine, <b>cycloserine</b> acts against two crucial enzymes important in the cytosolic stages of peptidoglycan synthesis: alanine racemase (Alr) and D-alanine:D-alanine ligase (Ddl). The first enzyme is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme which converts the L-alanine to the D-alanine form. [...] The second enzyme is involved in joining two of these D-alanine residues together by catalyzing {{the formation of the}} ATP-dependent D-alanine-D-alanine dipeptide bond between the resulting D-alanine molecules. If both of these enzymes are inhibited, then D-alanine residues cannot form and previously formed D-alanine molecules cannot be joined together. This effectively leads to inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis.|$|E

The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 29.7 to 51.30 USD per month. In the United States in 2015 the cost was increased to 3,150 USD a month.|$|E
50|$|Ethionamide may worsen {{the adverse}} effects of other {{antituberculous}} drugs being taken at the same time. It boosts levels of isoniazid when taken together {{and can lead to}} increased rates of peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. When taken with <b>cycloserine,</b> seizures have been reported. High rates of hepatotoxicty have been reported when taken with rifampicin. The drug's labeling cautions against excessive alcohol ingestion as it may provoke a psychotic reaction.|$|E
50|$|In the laboratory, C. botulinum {{is usually}} {{isolated}} in tryptose sulfite <b>cycloserine</b> (TSC) growth medium in an anaerobic environment {{with less than}} 2% oxygen.

C. botulinum is a lipase-positive microorganism that grows between pH of 4.8 and 7.0 and cannot use lactose as a primary carbon source, characteristics important for biochemical identification.|$|E
5000|$|His {{career was}} mainly spent at Merck. He played a {{prominent}} role in the isolation of vitamin B12, {{which is one of the}} most structural complex of the vitamins. As a Merck Pharmaceuticals research team, Folkers, Fern P. Rathe, and Edward Anthony Kaczka were the first to isolate the antibiotic cathomycin in 1955. His team also isolated the antibiotic <b>cycloserine.</b> In 1958 his Merck team determined the structure of coenzyme Q10.|$|E
50|$|A {{deficiency}} of vitamin B6 alone is relatively uncommon and often occurs {{in association with}} other vitamins of the B complex. The elderly and alcoholics have {{an increased risk of}} vitamin B6 deficiency, as well as other micronutrient deficiencies. Evidence exists for decreased levels of vitamin B6 in women with type 1 diabetes and in patients with systemic inflammation, liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and those infected with HIV. Use of oral contraceptives and treatment with certain anticonvulsants, isoniazid, <b>cycloserine,</b> penicillamine, and hydrocortisone negatively impact vitamin B6 status. Hemodialysis reduces vitamin B6 plasma levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{cells of}} Aeropyrum pernix are spherical {{in shape and}} {{approximately}} 1 µm in diameter. The envelope surrounding the cells of Aeropyrum is about 25 nm wide. The organisms grows at temperature between 70 and 100 °C (optimum, 90 to 95 °C), at pH 5 to 9 (optimum, pH 7), and at a salinity of 1.8 to 7% (optimum, 3.5% salinity). The growth of the organisms is not detected at 68 or 102 °C. Below 1.5% salinity, cells lyse by low osmotic shock. The cells of the organisms are sensitive to chloramphenicol and insensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin, and <b>cycloserine.</b> It grows well on proteinaceous substances, with a doubling time under these conditions of about 200 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} of MDR-TB must be undertaken by physicians {{experienced in the}} {{treatment of}} MDR-TB. Mortality and morbidity in patients treated in non-specialist centers are significantly higher to those of patients treated in specialist centers. Treatment of MDR-TB must be done on the basis of sensitivity testing: it is impossible to treat such patients without this information. When treating a patient with suspected MDR-TB, pending the result of laboratory sensitivity testing, the patient could be started on SHREZ (Streptomycin+ isonicotinyl Hydrazine+ Rifampicin+Ethambutol+ pyraZinamide) and moxifloxacin with <b>cycloserine.</b> There is evidence that previous therapy with a drug {{for more than a month}} is associated with diminished efficacy of that drug regardless of in vitro tests indicating susceptibility. Hence, a detailed knowledge of the treatment history of each patient is essential. In addition to the obvious risks (i.e., known exposure to a patient with MDR-TB), risk factors for MDR-TB include HIV infection, previous incarceration, failed TB treatment, failure to respond to standard TB treatment, and relapse following standard TB treatment.|$|E
