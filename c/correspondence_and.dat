5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve {{in a manner consistent with}} quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT <b>correspondence,</b> <b>and</b> any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so {{the black hole}} must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT <b>correspondence,</b> <b>and</b> he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.|$|E

5|$|After 1900, the {{financial}} and official records from Henry's reign began to become accessible to historians, including the pipe rolls, court records, <b>correspondence</b> <b>and</b> records of administration of the royal forests. Thomas Tout made extensive use of these new sources in the 1920s, and post-war historians brought a particular focus on the finances of Henry's government, highlighting his fiscal difficulties. This wave of research culminated in Sir Maurice Powicke's two major biographical works on Henry, published in 1948 and 1953, which formed the established history of the King {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E
5|$|After Dorothy's wedding {{much of the}} {{documentation}} of Olivia's life ceases.

Hope Shakespear died on 5 July 1923; within months Olivia moved to an apartment in West Kensington, taking with her two maids {{who had been with}} the family for decades. Her life continued unchanged, filled with social events. In September 1926, Dorothy gave birth to a son, Omar Pound, who in 1927 was brought from France to be raised in England. Olivia became his guardian and Dorothy spent summers with her mother and son.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{typewriter}} received an unenthusiastic reception from the public. Lack of an established market, high cost, {{and the need}} for trained operators slowed its adoption. Additionally, recipients of typewritten messages found the mechanical, all upper-case writing to be impersonal and even insulting. The new communication technologies and expanding businesses of the late 19th century, however, had created a need for expedient, legible <b>correspondence,</b> <b>and</b> so the Sholes and Glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures. The typewriter is credited with assisting the entrance of women into the clerical workplace, as many were hired to operate the new devices.|$|E

Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.|$|E

40|$|This Master’s thesis {{describes}} how a classic schema matcher is enhanced to a sophisticated schema mapper that allows complex <b>correspondences</b> (many-to-manycorrespondences) <b>and</b> general functions between two schemas, {{as well as}} their semiautomatic detection in addition to the classic (1 : 1) -correspondence detection. With the latter aspect, this thesis is dedicated to a field in data integration, which has hardly been investigated yet, and offers an approach valuable for many schema matchers. For this purpose, {{the first part of this}} study will explain precisely what complex <b>correspondences</b> <b>and</b> functions in the context of schema matching are, how they are connected among each other, what different types exist, under which circumstances they become necessary, and how they are used in real-word scenarios. Throughout the entire first part, examples will be given to underline the meaning and importance of complex <b>correspondences</b> <b>and</b> functions. Besides this, studies and existing solutions about complex <b>correspondences</b> <b>and</b> functions, {{as well as their}} detection, will be introduced. In the second part, the actual implementation will be the center of interest, starting with the general extension of the schema matche...|$|R

40|$|We generalize Lagrangian Floer {{theory to}} {{sequences}} of Lagrangian <b>correspondences</b> <b>and</b> establish an isomorphism between the Floer homology groups of sequences {{that are related}} by the geometric composition of Lagrangian correspondences. On these Floer homologies, we define relative invariants arising from “quilted pseudoholomorphic surfaces”: Collections of pseudoholomorphic maps to various target spaces with “seam conditions” in Lagrangian <b>correspondences</b> <b>and</b> boundary conditions in Lagrangian submanifolds. Using these new invariants, we define a composition functor for categories of Lagrangian <b>correspondences</b> in monotone <b>and</b> exact symplectic Floer theory. We show that this functor agrees with geometric composition in {{the case that the}} composition is smooth and embedded. As a consequence we obtain “categorification commutes with composition...|$|R
