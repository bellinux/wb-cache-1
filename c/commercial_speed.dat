40|$|AbstractVarious {{technologies}} {{have recently been}} developed for high-speed railways, in order to boost <b>commercial</b> <b>speeds</b> from 300 km·h− 1 to 400 km·h− 1. Among these technologies, this paper introduces the 400 km·h− 1 class current collection performance evaluation methods {{that have been developed}} and demonstrated by Korea. Specifically, this paper reports details of the video-based monitoring techniques that have been adopted to inspect the stability of overhead contact line (OCL) components at 400 km·h− 1 without direct contact with any components of the power supply system. Unlike conventional OCL monitoring systems, which detect contact wire positions using either laser sensors or line cameras, the developed system measures parameters in the active state by video data. According to experimental results that were obtained at a field-test site established at a commercial line, it is claimed that the proposed measurement system is capable of effectively measuring OCL parameters...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a methodology for solving the bus network design problem, covering network design and frequency setting and {{taking into consideration}} that <b>commercial</b> <b>speeds</b> of buses {{vary depending on the}} aggregated frequency of buses on each corridor. This methodology, referred to as Variable Speed Methodology, uses a variation of an algorithm proposed by Baaj and Mahmassani that assumes speeds remain constant (denoted Fixed Speed Methodology). Both methodologies were applied to the street network of Barcelona. Outputs were compared, and {{it was found that the}} Variable Speed Methodology produces a bus network with faster average travel speeds, shorter travel times, smaller fleet size, less route kilometer, and fewer buses per link while still serving the same level of demand. These results demonstrate that taking variability of bus speeds into consideration when performing route generation and frequency setting can significantly improve the performance of the bus network produced.
