40|$|Abstract Food {{access is}} one of the food {{security}} pillars. Food security encompasses physical and economic access to food. For most Mediterranean people affordability is a key factor determining access to food. Food affordability is dependent not only on food cost but also on the disposable income that can be spent on food. The paper aims at analysing food accessibility and affordability at household and country levels in the Mediterranean region. The paper uses secondary data from different sources (e. g. FAO, World Bank, the Economist, LABORSTA) to analyse the trends of different indicators: food affordability; food consumer price index; household food expenditure; <b>cereals</b> <b>imports</b> dependency; and Values of food imports over total merchandise exports. In March 2013, food affordability score of the Global Food Security Index ranged from 34. 8 in Syria to 86. 5 in France. The share of food consumption expenditure in total household expenditure is high e. g. 67. 3 % in Albania and 43. 9 % in Algeria. During the period 2005 - 2011, the highest increase of the FAO food consumer price index was recorded in Egypt followed by Turkey and Algeria. FAO consumer cereal price index increased more than meat price index in the period 2004 - 2012. <b>Cereals</b> <b>import</b> dependency is high in all Mediterranean Arab countries; up to 80 % in drought years in Algeria. In the Palestinian Territories and Montenegro more than four-fifths of merchandise exports are dedicated to food imports.

Its general responsibilities focused on planning rural agricultural programs, including building and operating irrigation projects, training farmers in new techniques required for improved irrigation cropping, and providing credit and such inputs as fertilizers and pumping equipment. Organized in 1982 from two other agencies, CSA became responsible for stabilizing grain prices, maintaining a security food stock through market intervention, monitoring production and food deficits, and distributing food aid. SONIMEX began operations in 1966 as a government-controlled joint venture. The company held a monopoly on the imports of basic commodities (principally rice, tea, sugar, and tomato paste), which it resold to private interests for the retail trade. The private sector's role in <b>cereal</b> <b>imports</b> was legally restricted to wheat and flour. Numerous private traders in the marketing chain, however, were not covered (or were covered only partially) by CSA and SONIMEX.

40|$|The {{impact of}} global climate change on {{developing}} countries is analyzed using CGE-multimarket models for three archetype economies representing the poor <b>cereal</b> <b>importing</b> nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The objective is to compare the effects of climate change on the macroeconomic performance, sectoral resource allocation, and household welfare across continents. Simulations help identify those underlying structural features of economies which are the primary determinants of differential impacts; these are suggestive of policy instruments to countervail undesirable effects. Results show that all these countries will potentially suffer income and production losses. However, Africa, with its low substitution possibilities between imported and domestic foods, fares worst in terms of income losses and the drop in consumption of low income households. Countervailing policies to mitigate negative effects should focus on integration in the international market and the production of food crops in Africa, and on the production of export crops in Latin America and Asia.

40|$|The {{properties}} of duality were exploited in developing an integrated system consistent with endogenous behavior of producers, consumers, and government for Moroccan agriculture. A multi-output, multi-input normalized quadratic profit function {{was used to}} derive product supply equations for crops and livestock products and variable input demand equations for fertilizer, grain feed, and other feed products. For domestic demand and import share equations, an AIDS framework was applied to derive demand elasticities.

The analyses reveal no evidence of widespread adverse price effects of the drought in cereal and labor markets. Real prices of major cereals were lower in January 2017 compared to three years earlier, especially for maize, sorghum, and wheat – the crops that are {{the major source of}} calories in areas that were most hit by drought. The decline in the cost of cereals in the food basket in January 2017 compared to three years earlier was estimated at 13. 3 percent at the national level. Moreover, this decline in cereal costs was highest in areas most affected by the drought, possibly indicating the effect of major <b>cereal</b> <b>imports</b> and food aid directed to these areas. Considering crop and livestock prices jointly, the analysis reveals that livestock-cereal terms of trade improved. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} although livestock prices declined during this period, as is usually seen in droughts, this decline was less than the decline in prices of cereals in such areas. The fluctuating behavior of cereal prices since January 2015 strikingly contrasts with the El Niño triggered major drought during 1997 / 98 in Ethiopia. During that period, cereal production declined by 25 percent compared to the year before, with significant increases in the real price of cereals, ranging between 15 and 45 percent. In contrast, in 2016 real cereal prices declined, which appears consistent with the relatively larger <b>cereal</b> <b>imports</b> and lower impacts of the drought on national cereal production in 2015 / 16.

Meeting the challenges of food security and water scarcity in Africa will require both selective development and exploitation of new water supplies and comprehensive policy reform that encourages efficient use of existing supplies. The most significant reforms will involve changing the institutional and legal environment in which water is supplied to one that empowers water users {{to make their own decisions}} regarding the resource.

40|$|A {{number of}} general {{circulation}} model (GCM) experiments {{have shown that}} changes in vegetation in the Sahel can cause substantial reductions in rainfall. In some studies, the climate sensitivity {{is large enough to}} trigger drought of the severity observed since the late 1960 s. The extent and intensity of vegetation changes are crucial in determining the magnitude of the atmospheric response in the models. However, there is no accurate historical record of regional vegetation changes extending back to before the drought began. One important driver of vegetation change is land use practice. In this paper the hypothesis that recent changes in land use have been large enough to cause the observed drought is tested. Results from a detailed land use model are used to generate realistic maps of vegetation changes linked to land use. The land use model suggests that cropland coverage in the Sahel has risen from 5 % to 14 % in the 35 yr prior to 1996. It is estimated that this process of agricultural extensification, coupled with deforestation and other land use changes, translates to a conversion of 4 % of the land from tree cover to bare soil over this period. The model predicts further changes in the composition of the land surface by 2015 based on changes in human population (rural and urban), livestock population, rainfall, <b>cereals</b> <b>imports,</b> and farming systems.

Meat, milk, and fish consumption per capita has barely grown {{in the developed countries}} as a whole over the past 20 years. Yet poor people everywhere clearly desire to eat more animal protein products as their incomes rise above poverty level and as they become urbanized. Growth in per capita consumption and production has in fact occurred in regions such as developing Asia, and most particularly China. Per capita consumption of animal proteins and use of cereals as feed in Asia have both grown in the 3 to 5 percent per annum range over the past 20 years. By 2020, according to IFPRI’s IMPACT model projections, the share of developing countries in total world meat consumption will expand from 47 percent currently to 63 percent. IMPACT projections under various technical and economic assumptions suggest that there is enough production supply response in world systems to accomplish these production increases smoothly. Sensitivity analysis of the impact of restrictions on China’s ability to produce more feedgrains illustrates that in a system of linked global markets for cereals and livestock products, such restrictions are not effective at lowering Chinese livestock consumption, which is driven by global trade in manufactures, although they do lower Chinese livestock production. The resulting imbalance raises world feed costs by one-third in 2020 over anticipated levels, encourages increased livestock exports from Latin America, discourages livestock exports from the U.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{has long been}} the focal point of food and agricultural policy planners. The major problems do not necessarily result from inadequate food supplies but from a lack of purchasing power on the part of nations and households. As the previous President of the World Bank has stated, 'supporting economic growth with an equitable distribution of income is therefore the first priority'. In the foreword of the World Bank's policy study on 'Poverty and hunger', A. W. Clausen explains that efforts to ensure food security can be seen as an investment in human capital. A properly fed, healthy and active population participates more effectively in economic development. No nation can obtain absolute food security and there is no single solution to the problems of both food security and poverty. But in order to help developing countries improve their food security, the World Bank suggests that the international community should intensify its efforts to accelerate growth through adjustment assistance and productive investment and help countries coordinate food aid.

For any given year, the land demand is calculated under the assumption that there should be an equilibrium between the production and consumption of basic resources derived from different land-uses. The exogenous variables of the model are human population (rural and urban), livestock, rainfall and <b>cereals</b> <b>imports.</b> The output are the areas allocated to fuelwood extraction, crops, fallow and pasture for every year. Pressure indicators are also generated endogenously by the model (rate of overgrazing and land degradation, labour productivity, average household "budget"). The parameters of the model were derived on the basis of a comprehensive review of the literature, mostly of local scale case studies of land-use changes in the Sahel. In agreement with farming system research, the model simulates two processes of land-use change: agricultural expansion at the most extensive technological level, followed by agricultural intensification once some land threshold is reached. The model was first tested at a national scale using data from Burkina Faso. Results simulate land-use changes at two time frequencies: high frequency, as driven by climatic variability, and low frequency, as driven by demographic trends. The rates of cropland expansion predicted by the model are consistent with rates measured for several case studies, based on fine spatial resolution remote sensing data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.

500|$|Danish bacon {{exports to}} the UK were {{interrupted}} during both world wars. During World War One the cause was the shortage of <b>imported</b> <b>cereals</b> with which to feed the pigs. [...] In World War Two Danish ships supplying Britain had their cargo confiscated by the Germans or were even sunk. [...] 6,500 tonnes of bacon were lost in this way. [...] The occupation of Denmark by the Germans in 1940 {{put a stop to}} exporting to Britain altogether.|$|R
