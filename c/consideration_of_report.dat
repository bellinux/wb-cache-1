SleepTight is a device that vibrates the infant's crib to simulate the action of a car traveling at 55 mph. A multiple baseline design across 6 infants was used.

30|$|In {{the present}} patient, the delayed anastomotic leak was {{detected}} 3 [*]cycles after beginning an irinotecan-based regimen. Irinotecan is also suspected {{to be associated}} with the development of delayed anastomotic leaks, but usually causes a range of toxicities including diarrhea and neutropenia, and the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation is much less than with bevacizumab-based treatment [5, 21, 22]. In addition, no previous <b>report</b> <b>of</b> delayed anastomotic leak due to irinotecan was identified. After creating the transverse colostomy for treatment of the leak, irinotecan plus anti EGF receptor drug has been given. There is no evidence of further leak. In <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> previous <b>reports,</b> bevacizumab is the most likely drug {{to be associated with}} development of the delayed anastomotic leak in the present patient.|$|R

After receiving this report, prime minister Lionel Jospin addressed the Assemblée Nationale on 10 October 1998 and announced his decision to withdraw. He said the Lalumière Report had {{identified a number of}} fundamental problems with the agreement, particularly relating to matters of national sovereignty. Madame Lalumière had also concluded that so many reservations were being incorporated into the agreement that any value for French investors would be limited. M. Jospin noted that, in February 1998, the French government had identified respect for cultural differences as a requirement for French support for the agreement. In particular, he was concerned that the French film industry needed protection against US imports.|$|R

40|$|The Altman (1968) {{bankruptcy}} {{prediction model}} (BPM) utilised financial statement data from manufacturing {{firms in the}} USA and has been applied worldwide without <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> the differences in accounting practices for intangible assets (IAs). The primary {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the effect of the conservative accounting treatment of intangible assets on accounting ratios in Altman's (1968) BPM pre and post IFRS - specifically in Australia. A paired sample design was employed resulting in 46 bankrupt firms matched to 46 non-bankrupt firms on the basis of size, GICS Industry and principal activity. We use three strategies to measure bankruptcy risk using Australian financial data between 1996 and 2004 including (i) original unadjusted data; (ii) data adjusted excluding all IAs; and (iii) data adjusted for exclusion of all IAs except goodwill which is added back. The results support <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> these <b>reporting</b> changes in future modelling of bankruptcy.
