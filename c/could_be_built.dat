5|$|The {{mountain}} had {{a circular}} pathway to the summit. The top offered {{a panoramic view}} of each of the existing sections. Strollers were not permitted. The walk-way was permanently closed in 1984 so that Vortex <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built.</b>|$|E
5|$|A non-safety fougasse <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> {{by simply}} burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to}} be left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E

5|$|If built, {{the light}} rail would have as its western {{terminus}} a maintenance facility across Highway 82 from the airport. It {{would include a}} stop at Buttermilk and parallel the highway, using the old Maroon Creek Bridge, until it reached Monarch Street downtown. There it would turn south to its eastern terminus at Rubey Park. If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> as bus lanes at first.|$|E
5|$|In the {{electromagnetic}} process, {{a magnetic field}} deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because {{it was based on}} proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> in stages, and would rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|Plans were {{announced}} in February 2016 which proposed a new £200M road <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> through Rimrose Valley to link {{directly into the}} A5758 road {{in an effort to}} reduce the heavy congestion on the A5036 road; Sefton Council rejected the proposal in March 2017, citing the desire to instead build a tunnel to overcome the congestion concerns.|$|E

5|$|The United States adopted half-tracks {{in large}} numbers as they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> more quickly and cheaply by {{civilian}} vehicle producers than vehicles from the established armored vehicle manufacturers. The M2 Half Track Car had first been intended as an artillery tractor, but was also used for carrying the machine gun squads of armored infantry regiments and for reconnaissance units until faster and better-armed M8 Greyhound armored cars were available.|$|E
5|$|The first statehouse, {{located in}} Corydon, Indiana, is still {{standing}} and is maintained as a state historic site. The second building was the old Marion County courthouse which was demolished and replaced in the early 20th century. The third building was a structure modeled on the Parthenon, but was condemned in 1877 because of structural defects and razed so the current statehouse <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> on its location.|$|E
5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{research}} prototype of Lumitrack currently uses visible light, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> adapted to utilize invisible infrared light. According to the university, the sensors require little power {{and should be}} cheap to mass-produce. They <b>could</b> even <b>be</b> <b>built</b> into smartphones.|$|R

5|$|According to a 2011 study {{conducted}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium {{should not be}} a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles because an estimated 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> with current reserves - about 10kg of lithium per car. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found sufficient resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread transportation use. The study estimated global reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.|$|E
5|$|After Janet passed Barbados, {{the island}} was {{declared}} a state of emergency. Relief workers on Barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local government made requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, which created the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E
5|$|Although such megastructures may be {{theoretically}} possible, all {{plans to}} build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. However, parts of the technology, like orbiting satellites and solar sails, have already been developed. Deployment of spacecraft and satellites using photovoltaics might be seen as the first small steps towards building a Dyson swarm. However, the number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. George Dvorsky has advocated use of self-replicating robots to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term. Some have suggested that such habitats <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> around white dwarfs and even pulsars.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the oldest}} of the Stanley girls, Mimi was the last of them to die. Cynthia, Sean and Ono {{attended}} her funeral on 12 December 1991: McCartney, Harrison, and Starr all sent floral arrangements. Despite the animosity between Cynthia and Mimi, Varcoe remembered Cynthia crying throughout the whole funeral, and said that Mimi had always spoken positively about her. Mimi was cremated at the Poole Crematorium and the reception was at the Harbour Heights Hotel. The whereabouts of her ashes is unknown. Ono put Mimi's house up for sale on the same day as the cremation, but it was demolished in 1994, so a four-bedroomed house <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> on the site.|$|E
5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill and building a large hill in Rødkleiva, or building a new hill in Holmenkollen and building a small hill in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> at the location of the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported building a large hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1942 and November 1943, Groves paid monthly {{visits to}} the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Reports {{indicated}} that compared to the alternatives of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic plant would take longer and require more scarce materials to build, and need more manpower and more electricity to operate. The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater. On the other hand, while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles, the electromagnetic process was proven to work, and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built</b> in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material. Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November, in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>built.</b> An updated model was installed one block away {{on the side of}} a Durst building at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, facing Sixth Avenue near the southeast corner of the intersection with West 44th Street. The new clock is located next to an Internal Revenue Service office. The new clock, which can run backward, is outfitted with a brighter seven-segment display with multiple LEDs per segment, allowing the numbers to be read more easily.|$|E
