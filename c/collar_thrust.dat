They were ordered to embark. But as they were slow to obey, and as some, indeed, hung back wailing and interceding, he and Jolly took them by their <b>collars,</b> <b>thrust</b> them to the edge, and bundled them neck and crop down into the hold, recking nothing of broken limbs. Finding this method of embarkation more expeditious, the use of the ladder was neglected thenceforth.|$|R

50|$|Kingsbury’s {{research}} at the University of New Hampshire led him to conceive an early Kingsbury bearing that consisted of several stationary arc segments facing a <b>thrust</b> <b>collar</b> on the rotating shaft. Each segment would have a boss on the side away from the <b>thrust</b> <b>collar,</b> allowing it to tilt and form an oil wedge that would carry the thrust. Kingsbury tested this new bearing with {{a modified version of}} his earlier screw thread testing machine. The bearing was successful with pressures of up to 4,000 psi at speeds of 285 rpm. This pressure exceeded that for common collar-type bearings by a factor of 80 to 100, thus proving the promise of the Kingsbury bearing.|$|R

40|$|Integrally geared {{compressors}} (IGCs) {{comprise of}} single stage impellers {{installed on the}} ends of pinion shafts, all driven by a main bull gear (BG) and shaft system. When compared to single shaft multistage centrifugal compressors, the benefits of IGCs include better thermal efficiency, reduced footprint and simple foundation, dispensing with a high speed coupling, as well as better access for maintenance and overhauls. In IGCs the compression of the process gas induces axial loads on the pinion shafts that are transmitted via <b>thrust</b> <b>collars</b> (TCs) to the main drive shaft and balanced by a single thrust bearing. The TCs, located on either side of pinion gears, slightly overlap with the BG outer diameter to form lentil-shaped lubricant-wetted regions. A numerical model, based on classical thin film lubrication theory, predicts the force response of lubricated <b>thrust</b> <b>collars</b> for use in integrally geared compressors. The predictive model determines performance parameters such as lubricant flow rate, mechanical power loss, peak pressure, lubricant temperature rise, as well as rotordynamic stiffness and damping coefficients for a lubricated TC and bull gear pair. A Newton-Raphson based iterative procedure determines an equilibrium operating position for a given set of TC and BG operating conditions and geometry. Periodic, dynamic displacements from the equilibrium position renders complex dynamic stiffnesses (H = K+i?C), from which the fluid film force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients are determined. In a lubricated <b>thrust</b> <b>collar</b> and bull gear, a hydrodynamic pressure builds in {{the lower half of the}} lubricated zone and lubricant cavitation occurs in the upper half. The minimum film thickness and peak pressure in the lubricated zone shift location due to the difference in taper angles between the TC and BG surfaces. For a given applied load, a study on the differences in taper angle between the TC and BG surfaces reveals that current angular tolerances of ? 0. 1 produce TC/BG pairs with similar performance parameters (power loss, lubricant temperature rise, etc.) and dynamic force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients. Increasing the taper angles of both the TC and BG decreases mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise, but also decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. In addition, static angular misalignments of the TC and BG about the horizontal (x) axis joining the BG and TC centers alters the shape and extent of the lubricant cavitation region. This change alters the load carrying capacity and mechanical power losses of the lubricated element. For the specific TC/BG pair investigated herein, there exists a maximum difference between the two taper angles for which the mechanical element can support an imposed thrust load. Increasing the speed of the BG (and proportionally the TC speed) increases the mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise and decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. As with most fluid film bearings, increasing the applied load increases the power loss, lubricant temperature rise, and axial stiffness and damping coefficients. The thesis delivers a predictive tool, yet to be benchmarked against experimental data, that provides insight to both the static and dynamic force performance of a lubricated <b>thrust</b> <b>collar,</b> not currently in the archived literature...|$|R
40|$|A gas {{lubricated}} {{thrust bearing}} is described which employs relatively rigid inwardly cantilevered spokes carrying a relatively resilient annular member or annulus.

The resilience of the beam mount causes the pads to accept the load and, with proper design, responds to a rotating thrust-transmitting collar by creating a gas film between the pads and the <b>thrust</b> <b>collar.</b> The bearing may be arranged for load equalization thereby avoiding the necessity of gimbal mounts or the like for the bearing.

30|$|The TC is {{a typical}} double {{overhung}} rotor with a steel turbine and an attached aluminum compressor impeller. That is, the turbine and compressor impellers are outboard of two bearings. The rotor shaft, FRB, shaft seal, <b>thrust</b> <b>collar,</b> shaft nut and other parts {{are included in the}} TC. All rotor components should be taken into account in the rotordynamic computation to investigate the rotor vibration response, such as the stability analysis and the frequency components in the waterfall plot. The compressor and turbine impellers are generally regarded as rigid disk to model. Due to its complex structure, the mass of rotating components, moment of inertia, and the center of gravity position can be obtained by using CAE 3 -dimensional software to model and calculate, and then add to the rotor-shaft regarded as a rigid disk.|$|R

Fatigue failure of temperature sensor lead wires to the inactive thrust pads are due to abnormal wear at the pad contact points. This case study will show how the repeated damage of RTD elements of hydrodynamic thrust bearings (JJ type) can occur in both the active and inactive side. We try to determine the main reason causing this failure, many trials had been done, {{and all of it}} failed. After deep analysis we discovered the main reason causing the failure, it was related to oil flow inside bearing housing.

40|$|The {{variations}} of the supporting condition, which change the stiffness of tilting pad thrust bearing, may alter the dynamic behavior of the rotor system. The effects of supporting condition of thrust pad on the lateral vibration of a hydroelectric generating set are investigated in this paper. The action of a thrust bearing is described as moments acting on the <b>thrust</b> <b>collar,</b> and the tilting stiffness coefficients of thrust bearing are calculated. A model based on typical beam finite element method is established to calculate the dynamic response, {{and the effects of}} supporting conditions such as elastic oil tank support, different heights of the thrust pads with rigid support are discussed. The results reveal that the influence of thrust bearing is small when the elastic oil tanks work normally. When the supporting conditions turn to be rigid due to the oil leakage, the differences of thrust pad heights have evident influence on the load distribution of the thrust pads; while the effects on the tilting stiffness of the thrust bearing and the amplitude of the lateral shaft vibration is small when the maximum load on thrust pads is smaller than the allowable value...|$|R

Meanwhile, the effects of different concentrations of aluminum nanoparticles, SDS, and deionized water in glycerol on tribology properties of iron to iron friction were studied. The experimental parameters were set up according to the Taguchi technique, their influence on the coefficient of friction (COF) and wear rate were examined by response surface methodology (RSM) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. The analysis results were employed to optimize the parameters to obtain the best lubricant effects. The optimal combination of the parameters for both minimum COF and wear rate was found to be 0. 6667 weight percent (wt %) of aluminum nanoparticles, 2 wt % of SDS, and 10 wt % of deionized water content of glycerol. The wear surface topography and the average roughness of the surface were also examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a Mitutoyo Surftest SJ- 400 instrument. The results show that aluminum nanoparticles used as an additive in lubricant reduce the surface roughness of a collar remarkably.

40|$|LecturePg. 133 - 140 The {{advantage}} of operating a thrust bearing in an evacuated cavity {{has been well}} documented in the literature. By draining the oil {{from the bottom of the}} housing and eliminating standing oil around the <b>thrust</b> <b>collar,</b> horsepower reductions of up to 50 percent can be realized. The decision to operate in an evacuated cavity is the first step in designing a low loss bearing. The recent trend in the industry has been to further reduce thrust losses by lowering the quantity of oil supplied to the bearing. This study investigates the impact of the oil injection method on thrust bearing performance when operating in an evacuated housing under low oil supply conditions. Several bearings were tested with identical geometry under duplicate operating conditions with the method of oil injection varied in each test to isolate its influence on performance. Tests were done to determine the starved film flow at various speeds for each lubrication method. Based on the results of the starved flow test, the bearings were evaluated at full flow, incipient starvation, and fully starved conditions. The performance of the bearings tested was nearly identical around a sliding velocity of 12, 300 ft/min. At sliding velocities above and below this speed, there was a load at which the temperature of the nozzle, pocket, and groove bearing was identical. The coolest configuration to the left of the crossover tended to be the hottest to the right of this point...|$|R
40|$|The {{uppermost}} superficial {{surface layer}} of articular cartilage, the ‘lamina splendens’ {{which provides a}} very low friction lubrication surface in articular joints, was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Complementary specimens were also observed under SEM at − 10 °C without dehydration or sputter ion coating. Fresh adult pig osteochondral specimens were prepared from the patellas of pig knee joints and digested with the enzymes, hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC and alkaline protease. Friction coefficients between a pyrex glass plate and the osteochondral specimens digested by enzymes as well as natural (undigested) specimens were measured, using a <b>thrust</b> <b>collar</b> apparatus. Normal saline, hyaluronic acid (HA) and a mixture of albumin, globulin, HA (AGH) were used as lubrication media. The surface irregularities usually observed in SEM studies were not apparent under AFM. The articular cartilage surface was resistant to hyaluronidase and also to chondroitinase ABC, but a fibrous structure was exhibited in alkaline protease enzymes-digested specimens. AFM analysis revealed that {{the thickness of the}} uppermost superficial surface layer of articular cartilage was between 800 nm and 2 μm in adult pig articular cartilage. The coefficient of friction (c. f.) was significantly higher in chondroitinase ABC and alkaline protease enzymes digested specimens. Generally, in normal saline lubrication medium, c. f. was higher in comparison to HA and AGH lubrication media.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this thesis is to study {{stresses}} in high speed turbo machine. A turbo machine used for current investigation {{is a small}} turboexpander which include rotor, compressor and turbine wheel. Rotor is a common component used in variety of applications across the industries. When the rotor is subjected to a very high angular velocity, a large centrifugal force acts on the various element of the rotor. It tries to pull the material out. Due to the high rotational speed not only high stress but also deformation comes into picture. Because of the high rotational speed, components like the <b>thrust</b> <b>collar</b> on the shaft and the compressor operate close to their failure stress. Ductile materials {{are more prone to}} fatigue failure than the brittle materials because the stress concentrations can’t be compensated by local deformations that occur in case of static loading, leading material to fail. Therefore it is essential to analyse the stress and deformation of all the elements before using it in applications. This project concentrates on analysis of rotor, compressor and turbine wheel of a high speed turbomachinery. Main focus was to find stress and deformation of rotor, blades of turbine wheel and compressor wheel. The analysis has been done using ANSYS software and the solid models are created using SolidWorks. The analysis revels come of the critical areas in different component of turbo machine. Also this thesis gives the detail steps on how to do analysis of turbo machines arts using ANSYS. The author expects the analysis and conclusion will help the engineering society of the world to analysis, design and fabricate turbomachinery for better reliability and efficiency. Current study can be future extend to analytical analysis of high speed rotor using Finite Element Method...|$|R
60|$|The {{political}} emancipation {{of women}} is {{likely to lead to}} a comparatively stringent enforcement by law of sexual morality (that is why so many of us dread it); and this will soon compel us to consider what our sexual morality shall be. At present a ridiculous distinction is made between vice and crime, in order that men may be vicious with impunity. Adultery, for instance, though it is sometimes fiercely punished by giving an injured husband crushing damages in a divorce suit (injured wives are not considered in this way), is not now directly prosecuted; and this impunity extends to illicit relations between unmarried persons who have reached what is called the age of consent. There are other matters, such as notification of contagious disease and solicitation, in which the hand of the law has been brought down on one sex only. Outrages which were capital offences within the memory of persons still living when committed on women outside marriage, can still be inflicted by men on their wives without legal remedy. At all such points the code will be screwed up by the operation of Votes for Women, if there be any virtue in the franchise at all. The result will be that men will find the more ascetic side of our sexual morality taken seriously by the law. It is easy to foresee the consequences. No man will take much trouble to alter laws which he can evade, or which are either not enforced or enforced on women only. But when these laws take him by the <b>collar</b> and <b>thrust</b> him into prison, he suddenly becomes keenly critical of them, and of the arguments by which they are supported. Now we have seen that our marriage laws will not stand criticism, and that they have held out so far only because they are so worked as to fit roughly our state of society, in which women are neither politically nor personally free, in which indeed women are called womanly only when they regard themselves as existing solely for the use of men. When Liberalism enfranchises them politically, and Socialism emancipates them economically, they will no longer allow the law to take immorality so easily. Both men and women will be forced to behave morally in sex matters; and when they find that this is inevitable they will raise the question of what behavior really should be established as moral. If they decide in favor of our present professed morality they will have to make a revolutionary change in their habits by becoming in fact what they only pretend to be at present. If, on the other hand, they find that this would be an unbearable tyranny, without even the excuse of justice or sound eugenics, they will reconsider their morality and remodel the law.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 1 For {{applications}} that involved fluids {{with a high}} rate of change of vapor pressure or low specific heat, it was found that there could be inadequate flow through the thrust bearing. This effect was compounded by the heat generation due to the eddy currents that occur in magnetic drive pumps with metallic shells. This paper describes a computer simulation to predict the flows, pressures, and temperatures in magnetic drive sealless pumps. The program has been developed using both theoretical and test work. The objective of the program was to provide reliable selection of magnetic drive pumps; this was accomplished by taking into account the effects of viscosity, vapor pressure, and other liquid properties on the local pressures in the pump. The goal of this program was thus to simulate a customer?s desired application of a particular fluid at an operating pressure, temperature, NPSH, and speed. The resulting conclusion would be whether the customer?s fluid and operating conditions were applicable for sealless pumps. Warnings are output through the graphical user interface of the program at the various points, should flashing occur using the particular fluid. The testing involved a wide range of pump sizes. Within each size, an extensive matrix involved running at different speeds, different cut impeller diameters, and from shutoff through runout condition. The units were tested with different shell configurations and different materials. These included polyetheretherketone (known as PEEK), Alloy C- 276, and a dual containment consisting of both materials. The design of the back shroud influences the magnitude of the hub factor. This is because the traditional affinity laws cannot be applied to the calculation of the axial load for semiopen impeller with a scalloped back shroud, pump out vanes, or pump out slots. One of the important findings was that the impeller hub factor, which is required for the computation of the axial load, changed as a function of speed and cut impeller diameter. It was also found that pump out vanes or pump out slots significantly enhanced the lubrication through the bearings and across magnets. Part of the verification involved performing tests with different bushing clearances and grooving configurations. These were analyzed empirically to confirm the coefficients that were obtained from experimental methods. In order to examine the possible operation of the pump when handling the user?s particular fluid, the flow is simulated in the program using a graphical user interface. A graphical output is given of all the pertinent locations in the systems, such as the <b>thrust</b> <b>collar</b> face or the gap between the driven magnets and the shell. The program currently calculates the pressure, flow, and temperature within the flowpath, along with the axial thrust, at five pump operating flow conditions expressed {{as a percentage of the}} best efficiency point...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{advances}} {{progress on}} the validation against measurements of linear and nonlinear rotordynamic models for predicting the dynamic shaft response of automotive turbochargers (TCs) supported on floating ring bearings. Waterfall spectra of measured shaft motions at the compressor and turbine ends of a test TC rotor evidences a complex response, showing synchronous (1 X) and multiple subsynchronous frequencies along the entire operating speed range (maximum shaft speed ~ 65 krpm). Postprocessing of the raw test data by mathematical software allows filtering the synchronous and subsynchronous vibration components for later comparisons to predicted shaft motions. The static performance of the floating ring bearings is analyzed with in-house software (XLSFRBThermal??), which considers thermal expansion of the shaft and bearing components as well as static loading on the bearing due to lubricant feed pressure. In addition, the program calculates rotordynamic force coefficients for {{the inner and outer}} films of the floating ring bearing. The turbocharger Finite Element (FE) structural model for the linear and nonlinear analyses includes lumped masses for the compressor and turbine wheels and the <b>thrust</b> <b>collar.</b> The mass imbalance distribution on the TC rotor is estimated from the test data using a procedure derived from the two-plane balancing method with influence coefficients. The linear model yields predictions of rotor synchronous (1 X) response to imbalance and damped eigenvalues. The analysis evidences that the rotor cylindrical-bending mode is unstable at all shaft speeds while the rotor conical model becomes more unstable as lubricant feed pressure decreases. The predicted synchronous (1 X) motions agree well with the test data, showing a critical speed at approximately 20 krpm. The linear stability results indicate the existence of three critical speeds occurring at 4, 20 and 50 krpm. The second critical speed corresponds to the rotor cylindrical-bending mode, showing larger amplitudes of motion at the compressor nose than at the turbine end. The third critical speed associated to the rotor first bending modes is well damped. In the nonlinear transient analysis, the nonlinear equations of motion of the system (rotor-FRB) are integrated, and the bearing reaction forces are calculated at each time step in a numerical integration procedure. The model then yields predictions of total motion which is decomposed into synchronous (1 X) and subsynchronous motions, amplitudes and frequencies. The nonlinear analysis predicts synchronous (1 X) amplitudes that correlate well with the test data at high shaft speeds (> 30 krpm) but underpredicts the imbalance response at low shaft speeds (< 30 krpm). The time transient simulations predict multiple frequency subsynchronous motions for shaft speeds ranging from 10 krpm to 55 krpm, with amplitudes and frequencies that are in good agreement with the measurements. Finally, the shaft motion measurements and predictions demonstrate that the turbocharger dynamic response does not depend greatly on the lubricant feed pressure and inlet temperature for the conditions tested...|$|R
