25|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanisms of}} <b>commotio</b> cordis are still poorly understood, but probably {{related to the}} activation of mechanosensitive proteins, ion channels. These trigger extra electrical excitation waves which, if occurring right at {{the trailing edge of}} a previous electrical cycle, can give rise to ventricular fibrillation. Since the trailing edge of the preceding electrical cycle travels over the ventricular surface, the critical window for mechanical induction of ventricular fibrillation varies locally - i.e. the <b>commotio</b> cordis risk window exists in time and in space. This helps to explain why precordial impacts tend to have benign consequences.|$|E
25|$|<b>Commotio</b> cordis occurs {{mostly in}} boys {{and young men}} (average age 15), usually during sports, most {{frequently}} baseball, often despite a chest protector. It is usually caused by a projectile, but can also be caused by the blow of an elbow or other body part. Being less developed, the thorax of an adolescent is likely more prone to this injury given the circumstances.|$|E
25|$|<b>Commotio</b> cordis {{may also}} occur in other situations, {{such as in}} {{children}} who are punished with blows over the precordium, cases of torture, and frontal collisions of motor vehicles (the impact of the steering wheel against the thorax, although this has decreased substantially {{with the use of}} safety belts and air bags). In one fatality, the impact to the chest was the result of an exploding whipping cream canister.|$|E

25|$|Several {{people have}} been convicted of {{involuntary}} manslaughter in cases involving insufficient and slow medical help to athletes who experienced <b>commotio</b> cordis during sports events, as well as in cases of intentional delivery of contusive blows. In 1992, Italian hockey player Miran Schrott died after a blow to his chest from the stick of Canadian-Italian player Jimmy Boni. Boni was charged with culpable homicide, and eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter, paying a $1,300 fine and $175,000 restitution to Schrott's family.|$|E
25|$|The risk would {{probably}} be reduced by improved coaching techniques, such as teaching young batters {{to turn away from}} the ball to avoid errant pitches, according to doctors. Defensive players in lacrosse and hockey are now taught to avoid using their chest to block the ball or puck. Chest protectors and vests are designed to reduce trauma from blunt bodily injury, but this does not offer protection from <b>commotio</b> cordis and may offer a false sense of security. Almost 20% of the victims in competitive football, baseball, lacrosse and hockey were wearing protectors. This ineffectiveness has been confirmed by animal studies. Development of adequate chest protectors may prove difficult.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's final {{large-scale}} orchestral {{works were}} his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: [...] "If {{ever there was}} music from another planet, this is surely it.

500|$|The Hippocratic Corpus, {{collection}} of medical works from ancient Greece, mentions concussion, later translated to <b>commotio</b> cerebri, and discusses loss of speech, hearing and sight {{that can result}} from [...] "commotion of the brain". This idea of disruption of mental function by [...] "shaking of the brain" [...] remained the widely accepted understanding of concussion until the 19thcentury. The Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi {{was the first to}} write about concussion as distinct from other types of head injury in the 10thcentury AD. He may have been the first to use the term [...] "cerebral concussion", and his definition of the condition, a transient loss of function with no physical damage, {{set the stage for the}} medical understanding of the condition for centuries. In the 13thcentury, the physician Lanfranc of Milan's Chiurgia Magna described concussion as brain [...] "commotion", also recognizing a difference between concussion and other types of traumatic brain injury (though many of his contemporaries did not), and discussing the transience of post-concussion symptoms as a result of temporary loss of function from the injury. In the 14thcentury, the surgeon Guy de Chauliac pointed out the relatively good prognosis of concussion as compared to more severe types of head trauma such as skull fractures and penetrating head trauma. In the 16thcentury, the term [...] "concussion" [...] came into use, and symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and memory problems were described. [...] The 16thcentury physician Ambroise Paré used the term <b>commotio</b> cerebri, as well as [...] "shaking of the brain", [...] "commotion", and [...] "concussion".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Commotio</b> cordis is a {{very rare}} event, but {{nonetheless}} is often considered when an athlete presents with sudden cardiac death. Some of the sports which have a risk for this cause of trauma are baseball, American football, association football, ice hockey, polo, rugby football, cricket, softball, pelota, fencing, lacrosse, boxing, karate, kung fu, and other martial arts. Children are especially vulnerable, possibly due to the mechanical properties of their thoracic skeleton. [...] From 1996 to spring 2007, the USA National <b>Commotio</b> Cordis Registry had 188 cases recorded, with about half occurring during organized sports. [...] Almost all (96%) {{of the victims were}} male, {{the mean age of the}} victims during that period was 14.7 years, and fewer than one in five survived the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{cases are}} fatal. Automated {{external}} defibrillators have helped increase the survival rate to 35%.

2500|$|In contrast, the {{precordial}} thump (hard blows {{given over}} the precordium with a closed fist [...] to revert cardiac arrest) is a sanctioned procedure for emergency resuscitation by trained health professionals witnessing a monitored arrest when no equipment is at hand, {{endorsed by the}} latest guidelines of the [...] It has been discussed controversially, as—in particular in severe hypoxia—it may cause the opposite effect (i.e., a worsening of rhythm—commotio cordis).

2500|$|<b>Commotio</b> cordis (Latin, [...] "agitation of the heart") is {{an often}} lethal {{disruption}} of heart rhythm that occurs {{as a result}} of a blow to the area directly over the heart (the precordial region), at a critical time during the cycle of a heart beat causing cardiac arrest. It is a form of ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib), not mechanical damage to the heart muscle or surrounding organs, and not the result of heart disease. The fatality rate is about 65% even with prompt CPR and defibrillation, and more than 80% without.|$|E

5000|$|In {{connection}} with the Lübeck performance, Nielsen was invited to provide programme notes. First explaining in a footnote that <b>Commotio</b> meant [...] "Movement, also spiritual", he continued (translated from Nielsen's German): [...] "The Latin word <b>Commotio</b> really applies to all music, but the word is used more specifically here {{as an expression of}} self-objectification. In a major work for the mighty instrument that is called the organ, whose sound is determined by the natural element we call air, the composer must attempt to suppress all personal, lyrical feelings. The expression becomes great and rigorous and demands a kind of dryness instead of the emotional, and must rather be gazed at with the ear than embraced by the heart. The work is borne up by two fugues, to which an introduction, intervening movements and coda cling like climbing plants to the tree-trunks of the forest; however, the composer thinks that further analysis is superfluous." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Commotio</b> cordis {{may also}} occur in other situations, {{such as in}} {{children}} who are punished with blows over the precordium, cases of torture, and frontal collisions of motor vehicles (the impact of the steering wheel against the thorax, although this has decreased substantially {{with the use of}} safety belts and air bags).

50|$|After {{news of the}} new organ work reached Germany, Erwin Zillinger, an organist from Schleswig, asked Bangert and Nielsen whether <b>Commotio</b> {{could be}} played at the Nordic-German Organ Week {{to be held in}} Lübeck that October. Nielsen had hoped to be present but {{weakness}} resulting from poor health prevented him from travelling. Bangert. who had been selected as the organist, travelled alone to Lübeck where, a day or two later, he heard of Nielsen's death. The concert therefore suddenly became a valedictory performance.|$|E
