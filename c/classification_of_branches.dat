The aim {{of this paper is to}} go beyond generality and show how one could describe the equisingularity classes of (general) polars of all branches in a given equisingularity class, making use of the analytic <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> as described in previous work by the first two authors.

40|$|We {{propose the}} new Top-Dog-Index to {{quantify}} the historic deviation of the supply data of many small branches for a commodity group from sales data. On the one hand, the common parametric assumptions on the customer demand distribution in the literature could not at all be supported in our real-world data set. On the other hand, a reasonably-looking non-parametric approach to estimate the demand distribution for the different branches directly from the sales distribution could only provide us with statistically weak and unreliable estimates for the future demand. Based on real-world sales data from our industry partner we provide evidence that our Top-Dog-Index is statistically robust. Using the Top-Dog-Index, we propose a heuristics to improve the branch-dependent proportion between supply and demand. Our approach cannot estimate the branch-dependent demand directly. It can, however, classify the branches into a given number of clusters according to an historic oversupply or undersupply. This <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> can iteratively be used to adapt the branch distribution {{of supply and demand}} in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at {{identifying}} and describing the key tendencies in the cyclical development of the world economy. In order to allocate the cyclical component in {{the dynamics of the}} world-wide GDP growth, a time series decomposition was performed using the Hodrick-Prescott filter and the relationship of economic cycles to the dynamics of different indicators of economic conditions was analyzed. The persistent relationship between inflation, unemployment and the current phase of the economic cycle have been identified and described. The truth of the Phillips curve has been empirically demonstrated: existence of an inverse relationship between the rate of inflation and the level of unemployment. A new <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> of economy has been provided according to their susceptibility to the current phase of the economic cycle.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A simple tiling on {{a sphere}} {{can be used}} to {{construct}} a tiling on a d-fold <b>branched</b> cover <b>of</b> the sphere. By lifting a so-called equatorial tiling on the sphere, the lifted tiling is locally kaleidoscopic, yielding an attractive tiling on the surface. This construction is via a correspondence between loops around vertices on the sphere and paths across tiles on the cover. The branched cover and lifted tiling give rise to an associated monodromy group in the symmetric group on d symbols. This monodromy group provides a beautiful connection between the cover and its base space. Our investigation of will focus on consideration of all possible low genus branched covers for a sphere, and therefore all locally kaleidoscopic tilings of low genus surfaces. It will be carried out through the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> their associated monodromy groups. To this end, the relationship between <b>classifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>branched</b> covers and <b>classifications</b> <b>of</b> monodromy group...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a continuous-time Markov chain with a finite or countable state space. For a site y and subset H {{of the state}} space, the hitting time of y under taboo H is defined to be infinite if the process trajectory hits H before y, and the first hitting time of y otherwise. We investigate the probability that such times are finite. In particular, if the taboo set is finite, an efficient iterative scheme reduces the study to the known case of a singleton taboo. A similar procedure applies {{in the case of}} finite complement of the taboo set. The study is motivated by <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>branching</b> processes with finitely many catalysts.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{have demonstrated that}} continuous-time branching random walks on multidimensional lattices give an important example of stochastic models in which the evolutionary processes depend {{on the structure of}} a medium and the spatial dynamics.

The structure of a medium is defined by the offspring repro-duction law at a finite number of generation centers situated on the lattice points. We consider models <b>of</b> <b>branching</b> random walks under different assumptions about under-lying random walks: symmetric or non-symmetric, with or without the finite variance of jumps.

40|$|Abstract. I propose an {{algebraic}} {{framework in}} which to study measures of informa-tion. One immediate consequence is a new proof <b>of</b> the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>branching</b> entropies on a Boolean algebra. Common constructions {{in the theory of}} entropy such as the conditional entropy and the mutual information arise naturally in this frame-work. A generalized theory of information can be interpreted in a category-theoretic context as a natural transformation between two functors. In 1948, Claude E. Shannon established the statistical theory of entropy (Shannon 1948), which offered deep insights into coding theory and compression. Since then re-searchers have been generalizing the axiomatic structure of the Shannon entropy so that they might bring it to bear on other mathematical questions. One such generalization is the notion <b>of</b> a <b>branching</b> inset entropy (Kannappan & Sander 2004). In 1983, J.
