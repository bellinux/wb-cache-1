50|$|The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> model {{expresses the}} forward price (or, as an approximation, the futures price) as a {{function}} of the spot price and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry.</b>|$|E
50|$|If long, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> is {{the cost}} of {{interest}} paid on a margin account. Conversely, if short, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> {{is the cost}} of paying dividends, or rather the opportunity cost; the cost of purchasing a particular security rather than an alternative. For most investments, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> generally refers to the risk-free interest rate that could be earned by investing currency in a theoretically safe investment vehicle such as a money market account minus any future cash flows that are expected from holding an equivalent instrument with the same risk (generally expressed in percentage terms and called the convenience yield). Storage costs (generally expressed {{as a percentage of the}} spot price) should be added to the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> for physical commodities such as corn, wheat, or gold.|$|E
50|$|The carry of {{an asset}} is the return {{obtained}} from holding it (if positive), or {{the cost of}} holding it (if negative) (see also <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry).</b>|$|E

40|$|Prospective memory (PM), {{the memory}} for future intentions, is an {{essential}} component of many day-to-day activities. PM accuracy has consistently been found to decline as a function of age and is further impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, subjective PM failures, PM accuracy, and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> a PM were recorded in 42 healthy elderly, 34 younger old, and 45 older old AD participants. It was found that PM deficits across the AD cohort did not change as a function of age. In addition, while PM accuracy was impaired compared to age-matched controls, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> a PM intention did not differ across the three groups. Evidence that AD participants show a reaction time (RT) <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> PM intention alongside an impaired PM accuracy indicates that the PM intention is held, but is not implemented effectively. The fact that the <b>cost</b> is independent <b>of</b> age and dementia suggests that it may not index working memory (WM) resource. At a practical level, the study suggests that for a comprehensive evaluation <b>of</b> PM competence <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> a PM intention should be measured alongside PM accuracy...|$|R
5000|$|Parity of implied volatility: In {{the absence}} of {{dividends}} or other <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> (such as when a stock is difficult to borrow or sell short), the implied volatility of calls and puts must be identical.|$|R

50|$|A {{convenience}} yield is {{an implied}} return on holding inventories. It is an {{adjustment to the}} <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> in the non-arbitrage pricing formula for forward prices in markets with trading constraints.|$|E
50|$|For example, a US {{investor}} {{buying a}} Standard and Poor's 500 e-mini futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange could expect the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> {{to be the}} prevailing risk-free interest rate (around 5% as of November, 2007) minus the expected dividends that one could earn from buying each of the stocks in the S&P 500 and receiving any dividends that they might pay, since the e-mini futures contract is a proxy for the underlying stocks in the S&P 500. Since the contract is a futures contract and settles at some forward date, the actual values of the dividends may not yet be known so the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> must be estimated.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991 the NSF allowed Advanced Network and Services (ANS), a {{non-profit}} company {{established by the}} Merit Network, IBM, and MCI to carry commercial traffic over the ANSNet backbone, the same infrastructure that carried traffic for the NSFNET Backbone Service. [...] NSF required ANS to (i) charge at least the average <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> the commercial traffic, (ii) to set aside any revenue in excess <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> the commercial traffic in an infrastructure pool that would be allocated to enhance and extend national and regional networking infrastructure and support, and (iii) to ensure that carrying commercial traffic did not diminish the NSFNET service.|$|R

50|$|In {{the chapter}} The Perfect Storm, the authors give an {{overview}} of the economic effects of the kind of transactions Web 2.0 permits. According to the authors, Coase's Law (see Ronald Coase) governs the expansion of a business:A firm will tend to expand until the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> out the same transaction on the open market.However, because of the changing usage patterns of Internet technologies, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> transactions has dropped so significantly that the authors assert that the market is better described by an inversion of Coase's Law. That is:A firm will tend to expand until the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> out an extra transaction on the open market become equal to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> organizing the same transaction within the firm. Thus, the authors think that with the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> communicating dramatically dropping, firms who do not change their current structures will perish. Companies who utilize mass collaboration will dominate their respective markets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between the spot and forward price of an asset reflects the net cost of holding (or carrying) that asset relative to holding the forward. Thus, all of {{the costs and benefits}} above can be summarised as the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry,</b> [...] Hence, ...|$|E
50|$|A {{backwardation}} starts {{when the}} difference between the forward price and the spot price is less than the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> (when the forward price is less than the spot plus carry), or when there can be no delivery arbitrage because the asset is not currently available for purchase.|$|E
50|$|The {{interest}} collected or paid {{every night}} {{is referred to}} as the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry.</b> As currency traders know roughly how much holding a currency position will make or cost on a daily basis, specific trades are put on based on this; these are referred to as carry trades.|$|E
5000|$|The {{controversy}} {{is still not}} fully resolved, {{in part because the}} financial and other <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> out language-training experiments with apes make replication studies difficult to mount. The definitions of both [...] "language" [...] and [...] "imitation", and the question of how language-like Nim's performance was, remain controversial.|$|R
50|$|However, as {{the size}} of basic fighters grew, along with their engine power, the {{relative}} <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> night-fighting equipment fell until most designs carried such equipment. Lightweight fighters without full night equipment such as the F-5 Freedom Fighter/Tiger II are still used by nations that lack the money to acquire advanced fighter aircraft.|$|R
50|$|According to a 1995 U.S. {{government}} estimate, {{the energy}} <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> one ton <b>of</b> freight {{a distance of}} one kilometer averages 337 kJ for water, 221 kJ for rail, 2,000 kJ for trucks, and nearly 13,000 kJ for air transport. Many environmental organizations favor laws and incentives to encourage the switch from road to rail, especially in Europe.|$|R
50|$|The arbitrage-free {{price for}} a {{derivatives}} contract can be complex, {{and there are many}} different variables to consider. Arbitrage-free pricing is a central topic of financial mathematics. For futures/forwards the arbitrage free price is relatively straightforward, involving the price of the underlying together with the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> (income received less interest costs), although there can be complexities.|$|E
5000|$|For {{liquid assets}} ("tradeables"), spot-forward parity {{provides}} {{the link between}} the spot market and the forward market. It describes the relationship between the spot and forward price of the underlying asset in a forward contract. While the overall effect can be described as the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry,</b> this effect can be broken down into different components, specifically whether the asset: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{contango}} {{should not}} exceed the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry,</b> because producers and consumers can compare the futures contract price against the spot price plus storage, and choose the better one. Arbitrageurs can sell one and buy the other for a theoretically risk-free profit (see rational pricing—futures). The EU describes {{the two groups of}} players in the commodity futures market, hedgers (commodity producers and commodity users) or arbitrageurs/speculators (non-commercial investors).|$|E

40|$|The {{handicap}} principle {{suggests that}} individuals of superior quality {{can more easily}} bear the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> developing extravagant ornaments. Consequently, ornament size should provide reliable information about quality or condition. Previous models have largely ignored the process of ornament growth, focusing only on final ornament size. We model ornament growth schedules for individuals of different qualities, where higher quality individuals experience lower <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> energy reserves <b>of</b> a given size, but where all individuals pay a net <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> ornaments <b>of</b> a given size. If the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> ornament production ensure that final ornament size reliably signals quality, the information conveyed by the signal can change dramatically during growth. Higher quality individuals should delay growth until closer to breeding. Taking a snapshot of partially developed ornaments prior to breeding would show them to be larger in poorer quality individuals. The claim that costly ornaments honestly signal quality thus needs to be understood in a dynamic context, and may only hold during some phases of growth. © 2011 Rands et al.

50|$|This may be {{simplified}} {{depending on}} the nature of the asset applicable; it is often seen in the form below, which applies for an asset with no dividends, storage or convenience costs. Alternatively, r can be seen as the net total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> (that is, the sum of interest, dividends, convenience and storage). Note that the formulation assumes that transaction costs are insignificant.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> or {{carrying}} {{charge is}} cost of storing a physical commodity, such as grain or metals, {{over a period}} of time. The carrying charge includes insurance, storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs. In interest rate futures markets, it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument.|$|E
5000|$|Basis {{trading is}} done when the {{investor}} {{feels that the}} two instruments are mispriced relative to one other and that the mispricing will correct itself so that the gain {{on one side of}} the trade will more than cancel out the loss on the other side of the trade. In the case of such a trade taking place on a security and its related futures contract, the trade will be profitable if the purchase price plus the net <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> is less than the futures price.|$|E
50|$|A {{contango}} {{is normal}} for a non-perishable commodity {{that has a}} <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry.</b> Such costs include warehousing fees and interest forgone on money tied up (or the time-value-of money, etc.), less income from leasing out the commodity if possible (e.g. gold). For perishable commodities, price differences between near and far delivery are not a contango. Different delivery dates are in effect entirely different commodities in this case, since fresh eggs today will not still be fresh in 6 months' time, 90-day treasury bills will have matured, etc.|$|E

50|$|Forward {{prices of}} equity indices are {{calculated}} by computing the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> of holding a long {{position in the}} constituent parts of the index. This will typically bethe risk-free interest rate, since the cost of investing in the equity market {{is the loss of}} interestminus the estimated dividend yield on the index, since an equity investor receives the sum of the dividends on the component stocks. Since these dividends are paid at different times, and are difficult to predict, estimation of the forward price can be difficult, particularly if there are not many stocks in the chosen index.|$|E
50|$|If {{short-term}} interest rates were expected to fall in a contango market, this would narrow the spread between a futures contract and an underlying asset in good supply. This is because the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> will fall due to the lower interest rate, which in turn results in {{the difference between the}} price of the future and the underlying growing smaller (i.e. narrowing). An investor would be advised to buy the spread in these circumstances: this is a calendar spread trade where the trader buys the near-dated instrument and simultaneously sells the far-dated instrument (i.e. the future).|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the item}} being traded, spot prices can {{indicate}} market expectations of future price movements in different ways. For a security or non-perishable commodity (e.g. silver), the spot price reflects market expectations of future price movements. In theory, {{the difference in}} spot and forward prices should be equal to the finance charges, plus any earnings due to the holder of the security, according to the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>carry</b> model. For example, on a share the difference in price between the spot and forward is usually accounted for almost entirely by any dividends payable in the period minus the interest payable on the purchase price. Any other cost price would yield an arbitrage opportunity and riskless profit (see rational pricing for the arbitrage mechanics).|$|E
