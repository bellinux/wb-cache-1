5000|$|Many Kielians {{were skeptical}} {{in regard to}} the design. There were {{repeated}} malfunctions of the mechanism upon startup, hence one of its nicknames, the [...] "Klappt-Nix-Brücke" [...] (Folds-not Bridge). In order to ensure <b>crossing</b> <b>for</b> pedestrians and <b>cyclists,</b> a hydraulically operated retractable bridge was built directly adjacent as an interim solution and is still used during repair and maintenance of the folding bridge. The Hörn Bridge is now accepted as a technical masterpiece and has become a tourist attraction.|$|R
50|$|A new rail <b>crossing</b> <b>for</b> {{pedestrians}} and <b>cyclists</b> {{was opened}} in 2012. The crossing links {{the northern part}} of the town with the leisure centre and the main complex of schools. Two options were proposed, a bridge with an estimated cost of £1.5m and the eventually successful subway option estimated at £3.25m. Two locations were also under consideration; one at the ‘Coombes Hole’ allotment gardens area and a second connecting Green Street and Morton Street. Sustrans elected to build a subway at Coombes Hole allotment gardens.|$|R
40|$|In 2016, {{there were}} 189 road deaths among cyclists in the Netherlands. This is {{approximately}} 30 % {{of the total}} number of road deaths. The number of seriously injured cyclists is not exactly known. Their number in 2015 was estimated to be more than 60 % {{of the total number}} of serious road injuries, which would be over 13 thousand. A large proportion of the seriously injured cyclists is the result of a single bicycle crash, a crash in which no other road user is directly involved. Whereas over the past few years road safety has improved for most modes of transport, this has not been the case <b>for</b> <b>cyclists.</b> Unsafe behaviour by cyclists themselves can increase their risk. Risk factors are cycling through the red light, smartphone use, cycling under the influence, and cycling without good bicycle lights. Unsafe behaviour of other road users — speeding, distraction, driving through the red light, drink-driving — is also dangerous <b>for</b> <b>cyclists.</b> Further improvements to the infrastructure (e. g. separate and sufficiently wide bike paths) and new ICT applications, both for the bike itself as well as for cars and the traffic system in general can improve the safety of cyclists.

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Swedish Road Administration, VTI has carried out a review of the {{experiences}} gained by local authorities and the Swedish Road Administration in relation to the regulation obliging traffic to give way to pedestrians at zebra crossings, and {{of the way in which}} groups of road users or, as the Swedish Road Administration calls them, groups of customers, have interpreted the regulation and the experiences they have gained. The investigation also focused on the procedures adopted by the local authorities and the regional agencies of the Swedish Road Administration to create a safe <b>crossing</b> <b>for</b> pedestrians and <b>cyclists,</b> and on the guidelines and criteria that have been applied. The investigation has been mainly conducted in the form of interviews. These interviews were held with municipal and State road management authorities and groups of customers such as elderly pedestrians, the visually impaired, drivers of heavy vehicles and drivers of emergency vehicles. Around twenty of the municipal road management authorities were selected for interviews. The objective was to investigate both local authorities who have been active, and those that have been less active, as regards action in connection with the introduction of the regulation, such as removing zebra crossings and making crossings safe...|$|R

40|$|Executive Summary: Completion of the Veloway 1 (V 1) {{will provide}} a {{dedicated}} and safe route <b>for</b> <b>cyclists</b> between the Brisbane CBD and the Gateway Motorway off-ramp at Eight Mile Plains alongside the South East Motorway. The V 1 is being delivered in stages and when completed {{will provide a}} dedicated 3 m wide cycleway 17 km in length. Two stages (D and E) remain to be constructed to complete the V 1. Major trip attractors along the V 1 include the Mater, Princes Alexandra and Greenslopes Hospitals, two campuses of Griffith University, Garden City shopping centre and the Australian Tax Office. This report assesses the available evidence on the impacts on cycling behaviour of the recently completed V 1 Stage C. The data sources informing this review include three intercept surveys, motion activated traffic cameras and travel time surveys on the V 1 and adjoining South East Freeway Bikeway (SEFB), Strava app data, and cyclist crash data along Logan Road. The key findings from the evidence are that the completed V 1 Stage C has: a	Attracted cyclists from Holland Park, Holland Park West, Mt Gravatt and southern parts of Tarragindi onto the V 1 Stage C. b	Reduced the crash exposure of pedestrians to cyclists by attracting higher speed cyclists off the adjoining SEFB onto the cycling dedicated V 1 Stage C. c	Reduced the potential crash exposure of cyclists to motor vehicles by attracting cyclists off Logan Road on to the V 1. d	Provided travel time benefits to cyclists and reduced road crossings (eight down to two). e	Predominantly attracted adults commuting alone {{to and from work}} and university. The evidence shows that the two traffic crossings across Birdwood Road (required as a temporary measure until the V 1 is completed) negate much of the travel time gains of the V 1 Stage C compared to the adjoining SEFB <b>for</b> southbound <b>cyclists.</b> Many cyclists accessing the V 1 Stage C from the south are cycling in high-volume vehicular traffic lanes to reduce their travel time along Birdwood Road, but in the process are increasing their exposure to crashes with motor vehicles. Based on these findings this report recommends that TMR: a. 	Continue with plans to complete the V 1 Veloway b. 	Undertake an engineering feasibility assessment to determine the viability of constructing a section of the V 1 Stage E from the intersection Weller and Birdwood Roads over Marshall Road and along Bapaume Road on the western side of the Motorway to the intersection of Bapaume and Sterculia Roads. c. 	In the interim, improve signage and Birdwood Road <b>crossing</b> points <b>for</b> <b>cyclists</b> accessing and egressing {{the southern end of the}} V 1 Stage C. d. 	Work with Brisbane City Council to identify the safest and most practical bicycle facilities to facilitate cycle travel between Logan Road and the V 1 south of Birdwood Road. e. 	Improve the awareness of the V 1 Stage C through signage <b>for</b> <b>cyclists</b> approaching from the north with the aim of providing a better understanding of the route of the V 1 to the south. f. 	Refine the use of motion activated traffic cameras to improve the capture rate of useable images and obtain an ongoing collection over time of V 1 usage data. g. 	Undertake discussions with Strava, Inc. to refine the presentation of Strava data to improve visual understanding of maps showing before and after cycle route volumes along and on roads leading to the V 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the risk of}} traffic injuries as the ratio of amount of casualties and mobility. Crash data come from a road trauma Registry, including outpatients and inpatients, on the Rhône county (1. 6 M inhabitants, including Lyon). These data are far more complete than police data, in particular <b>for</b> <b>cyclist</b> crashes. Mobility comes from travel surveys. Compared with car occupants and with regards to time spent travelling, the all-injury rate was twice lower for pedestrians, 8 times higher <b>for</b> <b>cyclists,</b> and 42 times higher for powered two-wheel (PTW) riders. For serious injuries, compared to car occupants, the risk is respectively 2, 16 and 120 times higher <b>for</b> pedestrians, <b>cyclists</b> and PTW users. For car occupants, pedestrians and cyclists, the age group 18 - 25 years had the highest all-injury rate. <b>For</b> <b>cyclists,</b> the injury rates seemed higher in non-dense areas than in dense areas. Between 1996 - 1997 and 2005 - 2006 and with regards to time spent travelling, the all-injury, and serious-injury rates seems to have decreased for car occupants and cyclists, {{and even more so}} <b>for</b> <b>cyclists...</b>|$|R
