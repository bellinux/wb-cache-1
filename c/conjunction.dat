5000|$|Coordinating <b>conjunctions,</b> {{also called}} coordinators, are <b>conjunctions</b> that join, or coordinate, {{two or more}} items (such as words, main clauses, or sentences) of equal {{syntactic}} importance. In English, the mnemonic acronym FANBOYS {{can be used to}} remember the coordinators for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. These are not the only coordinating conjunctions; various others are used, including [...] "and nor" [...] (British), [...] "but nor" [...] (British), [...] "or nor" [...] (British), [...] "neither" [...] ("They don't gamble; neither do they smoke"), [...] "no more" [...] ("They don't gamble; no more do they smoke"), and [...] "only" [...] ("I would go, only I don't have time"). Types of coordinating <b>conjunctions</b> include cumulative <b>conjunctions,</b> adversative <b>conjunctions,</b> alternative <b>conjunctions,</b> and illative <b>conjunctions.</b>|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to investigate the}} distribution pattern of <b>conjunctions</b> and their ranking in two different corpora, namely the Malaysian school English language Textbook Corpus (Textbook Corpus) and the British National Corpus (BNC). An additional objective {{of the study was}} to find out how <b>conjunctions</b> had been presented in the Malaysian school English language textbooks (Forms 1 - 5). The method applied was qualitative content analysis. The findings indicated that coordinating <b>conjunctions</b> were the most frequent <b>conjunctions</b> that occurred in the five textbooks followed by subordinating and correlative <b>conjunctions.</b> The ranking of the different types of <b>conjunctions</b> in the Textbook Corpus was similar to that of the reference corpus, BNC.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to work out {{criteria}} for selection of Russian <b>conjunctions</b> for the Swedish-Russian and Russian-Swedish dictionary Mini+ and to suggest a list of <b>conjunctions</b> to be included in it. The present study aims at collecting information, classifying it and examining Russian <b>conjunctions</b> in present-day Russian. The study also systemizes gathered material according to its diachronic features and makes corpus-based co-occurrence analysis, using Russian National Corpus (RNC) and Google Scholar. The paper presents a list of <b>conjunctions</b> to be included into the Russian part of the lexicon, based primarily on their grammatical and stylistic criteria as well as the results of the corpus-based frequency analysis. The choice takes into consideration limitations in size of the given dictionary. Out of a total 272 <b>conjunctions,</b> 55 were chosen for the Russian Swedish Mini+ dictionary. The major group (35) is simple <b>conjunctions</b> that frequently occur in corpus-based search and that are necessary to build basic grammar structures as well as other compound <b>conjunctions,</b> ex. а, даже, едва, если, чтобы, хотя.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} sorts of {{problems}} Libyan Learners of English as a foreign Language (LLsEFL) learners have in using <b>conjunctions,</b> and seeks {{to find out whether}} or not teaching <b>conjunctions</b> in the context of reading can help improve these learners' use and variation of these devices. In so doing, Halliday and Hasan's (1976) definition and classification of <b>conjunctions</b> is adopted as the framework for the study. A quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-intervention control group (CG) and treatment group (TG) was used to collect data. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the pre- intervention results of both groups showed that the problems LLsEFL experience in using <b>conjunctions</b> can be classified into three categories: misuse, underuse and overuse. Misuse was found to be the most common, followed by underuse and overuse. Adversatives were found to be the most misused whereas additives were the most overused. Moreover, the results show that these learners seem to have a limited repertoire of <b>conjunctions</b> and therefore tend to often rely on a small set of <b>conjunctions</b> such as 'and', 'but' to link their writing. An intervention course was then conducted where the treatment group was taught <b>conjunctions</b> {{in the context of their}} use in texts, while the control group was taught <b>conjunctions</b> in the traditional way (i. e. the way <b>conjunctions</b> are taught in the Libyan context). The results for the control group showed little or no improvement in using <b>conjunctions.</b> However, post-intervention results for the treatment group showed significant improvements in the use and variation of <b>conjunctions.</b> This improvement was reflected in greater properties of correct use and fewer cases of misuse, underuse, and overuse. More diversity in using <b>conjunctions</b> was also evident, including in the treatment group participants' use of <b>conjunctions</b> which had not been used before.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{verify the}} use of <b>conjunctions</b> in narratives, and to {{investigate}} the influence of stimuli's complexity over the type of <b>conjunctions</b> used by children with specific language impairment (SLI) and children with typical language development. METHODS: Participants were 40 children (20 with typical language development and 20 with SLI) with ages between 7 and 10 years, paired by age range. Fifteen stories with increasing of complexity were used to obtain the narratives; stories were classified into mechanical, behavioral and intentional, {{and each of them}} was represented by four scenes. Narratives were analyzed according to occurrence and classification of <b>conjunctions.</b> RESULTS: Both groups used more coordinative than subordinate <b>conjunctions,</b> with significant decrease in {{the use of}} <b>conjunctions</b> in the discourse of SLI children. The use of <b>conjunctions</b> varied according to the type of narrative: for coordinative <b>conjunctions,</b> both groups differed only between intentional and behavioral narratives, with higher occurrence in behavioral ones; for subordinate <b>conjunctions,</b> typically developing children's performance did not show differences between narratives, while SLI children presented fewer occurrences in intentional narratives, which was different from other narratives. CONCLUSION: Both groups used more coordinative than subordinate conjunctions; however, typically developing children presented more <b>conjunctions</b> than SLI children. The production of children with SLI was influenced by stimulus, since more complex narratives has less use of subordinate <b>conjunctions...</b>|$|R
