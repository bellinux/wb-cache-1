5|$|One of {{the first}} major {{promoters}} of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, <b>Cole</b> <b>Porter,</b> and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's legacy, {{aside from}} {{building}} the Garrick Theatre and writing the Savoy Operas and other works {{that are still}} being performed or in print over a hundred and twenty-five years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the works that he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced {{the development of the}} modern musical throughout the 20th century. Gilbert's lyrics employ punning, as well as complex internal and two and three-syllable rhyme schemes, and served as a model for such 20th century Broadway librettists and lyricists as P.G. Wodehouse, <b>Cole</b> <b>Porter,</b> Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II.|$|E
5|$|Holtzmann {{initially}} wanted <b>Cole</b> <b>Porter</b> {{to write}} the score, but he declined. She was going to approach Noël Coward next, but happened to meet Dorothy Hammerstein (Oscar's wife) in Manhattan. Holtzmann told Dorothy Hammerstein that she wanted Rodgers and Hammerstein to create a show for Lawrence, {{and asked her to}} see that her husband read a book that Holtzmann would send over. In fact, both Dorothy Rodgers and Dorothy Hammerstein had read the novel in 1944 and had urged their husbands to consider it as a possible subject for a musical. Dorothy Hammerstein had known Gertrude Lawrence since 1925, when they had both appeared in André Charlot's London Revue of 1924 on Broadway and on tour in North America.|$|E

5|$|Several actors of {{film and}} video games lent their voices to Fallout 3, {{including}} Liam Neeson as James, Ron Perlman as the game's narrator, Malcolm McDowell as President John Henry Eden, Craig Sechler as Butch DeLoria, Erik Todd Dellums as Three Dog, and Odette Yustman as Amata Almodovar. Veteran voice actors Dee Bradley Baker, Wes Johnson, Paul Eiding, and Stephen Russell also provided voice-overs for the game. The Fallout 3 soundtrack continued the series' convention of featuring sentimental 1940s American big band music, including the main theme, {{and a few other}} incidental songs recorded by The Ink Spots and The Andrews Sisters, as well as other artists like Roy Brown, Billie Holiday, Billy Munn, <b>Cole</b> <b>Porter,</b> and Bob Crosby.|$|E
5|$|Imported operettas and {{domestic}} productions by both whites like Cohan and blacks like Cook, Europe and Johnson {{all had a}} formative influence on Broadway. Composers like Gershwin, Porter and Kern made comedic musical theater into a national pastime, with a feel that was distinctly American and not dependent on European models. Most of these individuals were Jewish, with <b>Cole</b> <b>Porter</b> the only major exception; they were the descendants of 19th century immigrants fleeing persecution in the Russian Empire, settled most influentially in various neighborhoods in New York City. Many of the early musicals were influenced by black music, showing elements of early jazz, such as In Dahomey; the Jewish composers of these works may have seen connections between the traditional African American blue notes and their own folk Jewish music.|$|E
5|$|The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a {{total of}} 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini suites, while the Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. Several of the luxury suites are named after celebrities who lived or stayed in them such as The <b>Cole</b> <b>Porter</b> Suite, The Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the MacArthur Suite and the Churchill Suite. The most {{expensive}} room, the Presidential Suite, is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It was the residence of Herbert Hoover from his retirement for over 30 years, and Frank Sinatra kept a suite at the Waldorf from 1979 until 1988. The hotel has three main restaurants, Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and La Chine, a new Chinese restaurant that replaced Oscar's Brasserie in late 2015.

25|$|By the mid-1920s, Durante {{had become}} a {{vaudeville}} star and radio personality in a trio called Clayton, Jackson and Durante.

25|$|Vélez {{made her}} final {{appearance}} on Broadway in the 1938 musical You Never Know, by <b>Cole</b> <b>Porter.</b> The show received poor reviews from critics but received {{a large amount}} of publicity due to the feud between Vélez and fellow cast member Libby Holman. Holman was also irritated by the attention Vélez garnered from the show with her impersonations of several actresses including Gloria Swanson, Katharine Hepburn and Shirley Temple. The feud came to a head during a performance in New Haven, Connecticut after Vélez punched Holman in between curtain calls and gave her a black eye. The feud effectively ended the show.|$|E

25|$|His first {{exhibition}} {{took place}} at La Plume d'Or in Paris in 1932. It was reviewed by Janet Flanner in The New Yorker, and this review, which appeared after the exhibition ended, made Horst instantly prominent. Horst made a portrait of Bette Davis the same year, {{the first in a}} series of public figures he would photograph during his career. Within two years, he had photographed Noël Coward, Yvonne Printemps, Lisa Fonssagrives, Count Luchino Visconti di Madrone, Duke Fulco di Verdura, Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg, Princess Natalia Pavlovna Paley, Daisy Fellowes, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, <b>Cole</b> <b>Porter,</b> Elsa Schiaparelli, and others.|$|E
25|$|The early 20th century {{also saw}} the growth of Broadway theatre, a group of theatres specializing in musicals. Broadway became on the preeminent {{locations}} for musical theater in the world, and produced a body of songs that led Donald Clarke to call the era (ca. 1914 to 1950), {{the golden age of}} songwriting. The need to adapt enjoyable songs to the constraints of a theater and a plot enabled and encouraged a growth in songwriting and the rise of composers such as George Gershwin, <b>Cole</b> <b>Porter,</b> Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern. Most of these songwriters were Jewish, descended from Jews who immigrated from Russia.|$|E
25|$|Bate married Hugh Joseph Chisholm at the Chisholm family home, Strathgrass in Port Chester, New York on October 14, 1939.
