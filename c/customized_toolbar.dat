I chose MapObjects to display the data points. A polygon can represent a property or a lake on a county map whereas a polyline could represent a border or a route. The thesis explores polyline and polygon plotting on a map using Map Objects. It enables users to plot polyline and polygon on a map. This thesis makes use of a recent technology which enables users to plot data without buying expensive software. Moreover using a computer simulation rather than referring to a paper map is much more engaging and better aligned {{to the interests of}} modern users. User can save the plotted polygon and polyline as a shape file or a text file. A user can easily load their data points from a text file and the application will plot a polyline or polygon based on the co-ordinates provided in the file. The application also computes the total distance of the polyline as well as the perimeter of the polygon plotted by the user. A <b>customized</b> <b>toolbar</b> has been added to make the GUI of the application more users friendly. Help System has been embedded into the application to guide the user. The application utilizes Map Objects Java Edition and Java programming language. ESRI provides Map Objects Java Edition for free. Every attempt has been made to present subject in depth using a user friendly interface...|$|E

It {{is one of the}} oldest in the country and the largest of 88 such districts in Texas. Established in 1951 the HPWD managed their wells and permit applications using USGS quad maps and an extensive cross-filing system. In 2004 the HPWD began implementing a new GIS database and their first application to manage well permits. The purpose of this paper is to describe the procedures developed to automate the maps used by the District to manage wells. The Permit Management Application (PeMA) and GIS database integrates a web-based interface for MS Access and ArcGIS for non-GIS staff to efficiently manage well permits for compliance with district regulations. A groundwater database design was developed and a database of over 72, 000 wells was created over a period of 10 months. The wells were digitized from 328 scanned and registered USGS quads. A <b>customized</b> ArcGIS <b>toolbar</b> automatically updates well permit records and allows wells to be added, edited or removed from the database. A buffering tool enables District staff to determine compliance with distance requirements. The PeMA application generates eight letters and five reports communicating District information to the Texas Water Development Board, District board of directors, county appraisal districts and stakeholders. In this regard the GIS has allowed the District to more effectively and efficiently communicate and disseminate well data among staff, other agencies and their constituents. In addition to water well permitting, the GIS is being used to analyze water level changes in the southern Ogallala aquifer, and is being considered for updating their water atlas’. Moreover the incorporation of GIS into the District has been instrumental in inspiring policy management decisions for conserving water in the southern Ogallala Aquifer...|$|R
