30|$|The {{current in}} phase A of MMC- 1 AC side {{increases}} to {{a peak of}} 6.2  kA, as shown in Fig.  13 a. MMC- 1 DC side current at T 1 reverses and eventually stabilizes at − 1.1 kA. Therefore, it is indicated that, due to the blocking failure of the upper arm of phase A, the AC and DC side of MMC- 1 are not fully isolated. This leads to the result that the MMC DC side current of T 1 does not reduce to zero after the protection operation, but flows through MMC- 1 and injects into the faulted point. Therefore, the blocking failure of one arm of the converter and the whole <b>converter</b> <b>blocking</b> failure are both considered as emergency condition, necessitating the fault isolation with the special control and protection strategy proposed in Section  4.1.|$|E
30|$|The China Southern Power Grid (CSG) {{is known}} as one of the largest AC/DC hybrid {{transmission}} systems in the world. As the receiving-end power grid of CSG, Guangdong provincial grid is characterized by highly clustered load and high proportions of power transmitted from other provincial grids. Especially in the Pearl River Delta grids, the 500  kV networks are in close mutual proximity, and there are multi-infeed HVDC systems: four ±  500  kV DC links and one ±  800  kV DC link, namely TG-HVDC, SG-HVDC, GZ-HVDC, XA-HVDC, and YG-HVDC. The impacts of a severe fault in the 500  kV grids can be transmitted almost unimpeded to more than one inverter station, thus causing concurrent CF in inverter stations. If the fault cannot be tripped in time, more than one HVDC system is likely to suffer successive CF, even <b>converter</b> <b>blocking,</b> raising the risk of widespread blackouts. Therefore, establishing a quick and efficient method for CF assessment is critical.|$|E
40|$|A power {{converter}} now undergoing development {{is required to}} operate at a DC input potential ranging between 5. 5 and 10 kV and a DC output potential of 400 V at a current up to 25 A. This {{power converter}} is also required to be sufficiently compact and reliable to fit and operate {{within the confines of}} a high-pressure case to be lowered to several miles (approx. 5 km) {{below the surface of the}} ocean.

The series connection of inputs would also enforce a requirement that all the <b>converter</b> <b>blocks</b> operate at the same input current. The outputs of the <b>converter</b> <b>blocks</b> would be connected in a matrix comprising 6 parallel legs, each leg being a cascade of eight outputs wired in series (see figure). All the <b>converter</b> <b>blocks</b> would be identical within the tolerances of the values of their components. A single voltage feedback loop would regulate the output potential. All the <b>converter</b> <b>blocks</b> would be driven by the same PWM waveform generated by this feedback loop. The power transformer of each <b>converter</b> <b>block</b> would have a unity turns ratio and would be capable of withstanding as much as 10 kVDC between its primary and secondary windings. (Although, in general, the turns ratio could be different from unity, the simplest construction for minimizing leakage and maximizing breakdown voltage is attained at a turns ratio of unity. ...|$|R

40|$|A new modular {{multilevel}} DC-DC converter (MMC) {{with high}} power density and simplified localized voltage balancing control is proposed. <b>Converter</b> building <b>block</b> and controller module are built separately considering level propagation for each row. In the proposed configuration, the <b>converter</b> building <b>blocks</b> {{with the same}} power handling capability are connected in parallel in each row.

An optimized control algorithm with voltage feedback PI loop is proposed, resulting in the elimination of current sensors. Thus, the overall system complexity is reduced and the cost-effectiveness is increased. Significant ripple reduction of the inductor current and capacitor voltages is observed based on the simulation and prototype of a 5 -level system.

Fast circuit breakers have been proposed, however their implementation on a network is undecided. The protection requirements are likely to depend on both the AC/DC converter and network topologies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) switched-capacitor (SC) dc–dc converter that only uses the parasitic capacitance already present in fully integrated SC power converters to generate multiple dc voltages. When {{used in an}} SC converter together with the scalable parasitic charge redistribution technique, the presented MIMO converter provides additional voltage rails, {{which can be used}} to power gate drivers or control blocks without any area overhead. Moreover, because the proposed converter only makes use of elements, which are already present in fully integrated SC converters, only conductive losses are introduced. This means that, for low output powers, efficiencies arbitrarily close to 100 % can be achieved. The presented type of converter is characterized using an MIMO model, which is, in turn, used to prove the efficiency of the converter compared with regular SC MIMO converters, particularly for a large number of inputs or outputs.

An auto-connected flyback converter topology processing less than full power is used to provide high gain and perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT). These dc-dc converters interface with cascaded H-bridge inverter modules operating on feed forward control for dc-link voltage ripple rejection. By means of feed forward control, a significant reduction in dc link capacitance is achieved by enduring higher dc link ripple voltages. The dc link electrolytic capacitors are replaced with film capacitors thus offering an improvement in the reliability of the smart PV module. The proposed configuration is capable of producing 120 V/ 240 V AC voltage. The PV module now becomes a smart AC module by virtue of embedded intelligence to selectively actuate the individual dc-dc converters and control the output AC voltages directly, thus becoming a true plug and power energy system. Such a concept is ideal for curved surfaces such as building integrated PV (BIPV) system applications where gradients of insolation and temperature cause not only variations from PV module-to-PV module but from group-to-group of cells within the module itself.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel harmonic domain approach {{for assessing the}} steady state performance of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices. Existing harmonic analysis techniques are reviewed and {{used as the basis}} for a novel iterative harmonic domain model for PWM FACTS devices. The unified Newton formulation adopted uses a combination of positive frequency real valued harmonic and three-phase fundamental frequency power-flow mismatches to characterise a PWM converter system. A dc side mismatch formulation is employed {{in order to reduce the}} solution size, something only possible because of the hard switched nature of PWM converters. This computationally efficient formulation permits the study of generalised systems containing multiple FACTS devices. This modular PWM <b>converter</b> <b>block</b> is applied to series, shunt and multi-converter FACTS topologies, with a variety of basic control schemes. Using a three-phase power-flow initialisation and a fixed harmonic Jacobian provides robust convergence to a solution consistent with time domain simulation. By including the power-flow variables in the full harmonic solution the model avoids unnecessary assumptions regarding a fixed (or linearised) operating point, fully modelling system imbalance and the associated non-characteristic harmonics. The capability of the proposed technique is illustrated by considering a range of harmonic interaction mechanisms, both within and between FACTS devices. In particular, the impact of transmission network modelling and operating point variation is investigated with reference to ac and dc side harmonic interaction. The minor role harmonic distortion and over-modulation play in the PWM switching process is finally considered with reference to the associated reduction in system linearity...|$|R
