I was piloting the Question Mark and I realized that General Spaatz had probably been drenched in high octane gasoline.|$|E

25|$|However, negotiators {{need not}} {{sacrifice}} effective negotiation {{in favor of}} a positive relationship between parties. Rather than conceding, each side <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> that the other has emotions and motivations of their own and use this to their advantage in discussing the issue. In fact, perspective-taking can help move parties toward a more integrative solution. Fisher et al illustrate a few techniques that effectively improve perspective-taking in their book Getting to Yes, and through the following, negotiators can separate people from the problem itself.|$|E

His early death took out of the game a man of the kind we can ill afford to lose and no tribute that I could pay him would be high enough.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture and {{forestry}} {{is an area}} {{of opportunity}} for the country. “Angola requires 4.5 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55% of the corn it needs, 20% of the rice and just 5% of its required wheat”(African economic Outlook) but “less than 3 percent of Angola's abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited” (World Bank). From this fact we <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> the capacity that Angola has to increase production for not only for the national market but also the international one. Investing in this sector can help reduce unemployment and more specifically in the rural areas. This will undoubtedly have consequences on the living standard of rural civilians.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E

25|$|As time {{permits a}} more nuanced, post-feminist view of Freud, {{feminism}} and Deutsch, so too one <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> that her central book 'is replete with sensitive {{insight into the}} problems women confront at all stages of their lives'. Indeed, it has been claimed of Deutsch that 'the ruling concerns of her life bear {{a striking resemblance to}} those of women who participated in the second great wave of feminism in the 1970s: early rebellion...struggle for independence and education...conflict between the demands of career and family, ambivalence over motherhood, split between sexual and maternal feminine identities'. In the same way, one may see that 'to cap the parallel, Deutsch's psychoanalytic preoccupations were with the key moments of female sexuality: menstruation, defloration, intercourse, pregnancy, infertility, childbirth, lactation, the mother-child relation, menopause...the underlying agenda of any contemporary women's magazine — an agenda which her writings helped in some measure to create'.|$|E

The New York World-Telegram called the film [...] "good entertainment of its kind". The New York Post described it as [...] "a grotesque, gruesome tale which, of its kind, is swell". The Hollywood Reporter similarly called the film [...] "a joy for those who <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> it".|$|E

Brett Molina of USA Today gave the game 3.5 stars out of 4, stating that [...] "NetherRealm [...] created an impressive video game package with Injustice, combining superheroes and villains comic book fans <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> with a fighting style that should appeal to players at any level." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{narrative}} of the School Rumble anime is designed to mirror that of the manga, which results in multiple short story segments with no significant connection. Shown {{from the perspective of}} its characters—notably Tenma and Harima as they attempt similar ploys to get their crush to notice their affection—the anime uses absurdist humor which often combines elements of popular culture to explore the love-triangle, with jokes that work on multiple levels. One such example, highlighted by Lisa Marie, reviewer for Anime Today, is the bike chase scene in episode1 of season one. She notes that while anyone <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> the chase's inherent humor, those familiar with Initial D will find another level of appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference. Lisa Marie comments [...] "I certainly admit watching an insane bike chase cross paths with Initial Ds famous AE86 has a bit more [...] when you know why there's a cheesily rendered race car in slow moving Eurobeat." ...|$|E

[...] Ramsey Isler of IGN reiterated his own enjoyment of the premise {{of the episode}}, but went on to state, [...] "While I <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> the point that good comedy does take a certain degree of wit and cleverness, this just wasn't a very satisfying end to an idea that had so much potential." [...] In a much more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the underuse of cutaways, going on to note, [...] "Reducing the reliance on cutaways seems to be the continuing trend for the series, and I think it's a good move [...] It forces smarter writing, and creates a better narrative structure." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{discovery}} that Alleca and Brown would be releasing the album, Aguilera started developments {{to sue the}} pair {{in an effort to}} stop the release. Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the affiliates Platinum Recordings and JFB Music for [...] "improper use of her name and license on the upcoming album Just Be Free". Carla Christofferson, her lawyer at the time, explained that [...] "We're trying to stop them from releasing these early recordings which is not the quality she is associated with right now." [...] However, Warlock Records president Adam Levy felt that despite Aguilera disliking the material, he found it to be a look into her life at the time of recording. He stated [...] "It's a great look at what she was doing, We're pleased [...] I'm more pleased for the album's producers who wanted to get it out. I hope the fans <b>can</b> <b>appreciate</b> it." [...] Christofferson responded by alleging that Warlock Records tried to [...] "boot strap" [...] on Aguilera's success. In response to the lawsuit, Warlock Records filed their own lawsuit in an attempt to ensure the release of the record. During the proceedings, Aguilera agreed to let Warlock Records release Just Be Free after reaching a settlement with the company and its affiliates. [...] She allowed the release under the condition that the label would have to include a letter written by Aguilera in each album released. Since November 13, 2015, the album is available to stream on Spotify and Deezer.|$|E

Paula Edelstein of AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, praising the performer skills [...] "leading his own ensembles or playing with renowned jazz masters, Paquito D'Rivera {{continues to make}} a decidedly fresh imprint on Latin and Brazilian jazz." [...] William Grim of All About Jazz wrote that Brazilian Dreams [...] was [...] "a very satisfying album" [...] hoping that D'Rivera, Roditi and the New York Voices record another album based on Brazilian music due to the large extension of the musical catalog of the country. C. Michael Bailey, also of All About Jazz, stated that the album [...] "is superb and fantastic in every way." [...] Morrice Blackwell of Jazz Review named the album a [...] "musical match made in heaven", praising the performers and the sound quality, considering {{that it is a}} live performance. Blackwell also commented on the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild which [...] "continually offer a complete jazz experience." [...] On a second review by Jazz Review, Lee Prosser referred to the album as a [...] "classic Brazilian music collection... something all jazz listeners <b>can</b> <b>appreciate,</b> enjoy, and want to have in their CD library collections", to finally declare that it was [...] "one of the very finest collections of music released in the year 2002." [...] Maurice Bottomley of PopMatters wrote that the record is [...] "gentle, cultured, and perhaps overly refined, but it is very accomplished and does actually swing," [...] further commenting that [...] "it is also truer to the spirit of bossa nova in its first North American flowering than some will care to admit." ...|$|E
