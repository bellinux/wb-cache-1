40|$|Objectives This article {{considers}} {{the development of}} research competencies in professional psychology and how that movement might be applied to training in pediatric psychology. The field of pediatric psychology has a short but rich history, and experts have identified critical competencies. However, pediatric psychology has not yet detailed a set of research-based competencies. Methods This article initially reviews the com-petency initiative in professional psychology, including the <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> {{as it relates to}} research training. Next, we review and adapt the knowledge-based/foundational and applied/functional research competencies proposed by health psychology into a <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> for pediatric psychology. We focus especially on graduate-level training but allude to its application throughout professional development. Results We present the <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> as it is currently being applied {{to the development of a}} systematic research competency evaluation for graduate training at our medical/clinical psychology doctoral program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Based on the review and synthesis of the literature on research competency in professional psychology we propose future initiatives to develop these competencies for the field of pediatric psychology. Conclusions The <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> can be successfully applied to the development of research training competencies in pediatric psychology.

40|$|Abstract. The multidimensional {{analysis}} {{based on}} data cube has been growing interest. However existing data <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> usually {{does not have the}} semantics of attributes and hence the analysis usually provides results with raw numbers and ignores the real meanings of these numbers. An example result is that the total sales of PC in this year are above 2000. The semantics of sale performance, high or low, is not clear and that is not easy to be understood for decision makers. The semantic data <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> with linguistic semantics is presented in this paper. The semantic data cube uses fuzzy set to represent the linguistic semantics of the dimensions and measures of data cube. The computation of semantic data cube is studied and the serial and parallel computation algorithms are presented.

40|$|The rapid {{telescoping}} of {{the need}} to communicate cross-culturally in an ever widening range of contexts sets the basic circumstances for this study. Private and public sector interviewing become more important as cultural and cross-cultural factors emerge in coventuring enterprises. Standard interviewing programs and procedures do not usually focus on cross-cultural variables. A model is necessary through which to orchestrate the interview in a generic form and into which substantive illustrations for cross-cultural interviews can be placed. The <b>Cube</b> <b>model</b> designed by Dr. T. Frank Saunders, in his Double Think book, was adapted to this purpose and provides a comprehensive and exhaustive format for this study. The advent of CD ROM, high storage and easy retrieval computer technology, makes the design presented here an effective and efficient system for the collection and collation of demographic and ethnographic data.

40|$|Nonreactive surface {{scattering}} of atoms, molecules and clusters can be almost universally described by two mechanisms: trapping-desorption and direct-scattering. A hard <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> with an attractive square well provides a zeroth order {{description of the}} branching ratio between these two mechanisms {{as a function of}} the incidence energy. However, the trapping process is likely to be enhanced by excitation of internal degrees of freedom during the collision. In this molecular beam surface scattering study, we characterize formaldehyde/Au(111) scattering using angle resolved time-of-flight techniques. The two mechanisms are found to compete in the range of the investigated normal incidence energies between 0. 1 and 1. 3 eV. Whereas at low incidence energies trapping-desorption dominates, direct-scattering becomes more likely at incidence energies above 0. 37 eV. This incidence energy is slightly higher than the desorption energy which is found to be 0. 32 +/- 0. 03 eV by temperature programmed desorption techniques.

40|$|The Discrete Wavelet Transform {{has emerged}} as an elegant tool for data {{analysis}} queries. It {{was not until the}} time we proposed a new wavelet technique, ProPolyne, for fast exact, approximate, or progressive polynomial aggregate query processing that data {{did not have to be}} compressed, unlike most of the prior studies in this area. In this paper, after reviewing our ProPolyne technique in more depth with more intuitive and practical discussions, we address its inefficiency in dealing with scientific datasets due to the cube sparseness, subsequently, we propose a new <b>cube</b> <b>model,</b> CFM, to enhance ProPolyne’s both space and query efficiency. While ProPolyne assumed storing the data as large data frequency distribution cubes, CFM organizes the data as a collection of smaller fixed measure cubes to reduce the overall query and storage costs. We combine both <b>cube</b> <b>models</b> in an integrated framework, called WOLAP, for efficient polynomial aggregate query processing. We further enhance WOLAP by proposing practical solutions for real-world deployment in scientific applications.

To reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings, {{it is necessary to}} develop effective methods for analyzing building energy use.

Based on the data <b>cube</b> <b>model,</b> a multidimensional commercial sector building energy analysis was performed based upon on-line analytical processing (OLAP) operations to assess the energy efficiency according to building factors with various levels of abstraction. Furthermore, the proposed analysis system provided useful information that represented a set of energy efficient combinations by applying the association rule mining method.

40|$|Abstract. On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a {{trend in}} {{database}} technology, based on the multidimensional view of data. Multidimensional data (called multicubes) form the basic logical data model for OLAP applications and {{a significant number of}} proposals exist for <b>cube</b> <b>models,</b> without – in most cases – the distinct description of an equivalent “presentational ” layer or model for the presentation of multidimensional data and their hierarchies. In this paper we show how a formal presentation model for multidimensional data, namely the <b>Cube</b> Presentation <b>Model</b> (CPM) can be modeled using an extension of UML, by means of stereotypes, to more elegantly represent the most common presentational aspects of OLAP. Further more, we exploit the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to capture the necessary semantics of the presentation model {{that can be used in}} OLAP visualization applications. Finally, we demonstrate all these using Rational Rose. ...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{modeling}} in fractured reservoirs {{is largely}} {{confined to the}} so-called sugar <b>cube</b> <b>model.</b> Here, however, we consider vertically fractured reservoirs, i. e., the situation that the reservoir geometry can be approximated by fractures enclosed columns running from the base rock to the cap rock (aggregated columns). This article deals with {{the application of the}} homogenization method to derive an upscaled equation for fractured reservoirs with aggregated columns. It turns out that vertical flow in the columns plays an important role, whereas it can be usually disregarded in the sugar <b>cube</b> <b>model.</b> The vertical flow is caused by coupling of the matrix and fracture pressure along the vertical faces of the columns. We formulate a fully implicit three-dimensional upscaled numerical model. Furthermore, we develop a computationally efficient numerical approach. As found previously for the sugar <b>cube</b> <b>model,</b> the Peclet number, i. e., the ratio between the capillary diffusion time in the matrix and the residence time of the fluids in the fracture, plays an important role. The gravity number plays a secondary role. For low Peclet numbers, the results are sensitive to gravity, but relatively insensitive to the water injection rate, lateral matrix column size, and reservoir geometry, i. e., sugar cube versus aggregated column. At a low Peclet number and sufficiently low gravity number, the effective permeability model gives good results, which agree with the solution of the aggregated column model. However, ECLIPSE simulations (Barenblatt orWarren and Root (BWR) approach) show deviations at low Peclet numbers, but show good agreement at intermediate Peclet numbers. At high Peclet numbers, the results are relatively insensitive to gravity, but sensitive to the other conditions mentioned above. The ECLIPSE simulations and the effective permeability model show large deviations from the aggregated column model at high Peclet numbers. We conclude that at low Peclet numbers, it is advantageous to increase the water injection rate to improve the net present value. However, at high Peclet numbers, increasing the flow rate may lead to uneconomical water cuts. GeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Attributed graphs are {{becoming}} important tools for modeling information networks, {{such as the}} Web and various social networks (e. g. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter). However, it is computationally challenging to manage and analyze attributed graphs to support effective decision making. In this paper, we propose, Pagrol, a parallel graph OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) system over attributed graphs. In particular, Pagrol introduces a new conceptual Hyper Graph <b>Cube</b> <b>model</b> (which is an attributed-graph analogue of the data <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> for relational DBMS) to aggregate attributed graphs at different granularities and levels. The proposed model supports different queries {{as well as a}} new set of graph OLAP Roll-Up/Drill-Down operations. Furthermore, on the basis of Hyper Graph Cube, Pagrol provides an efficient MapReduce-based parallel graph cubing algorithm, MRGraph-Cubing, to compute the graph cube for an attributed graph. Pagrol employs numerous optimization techniques: (a) a self-contained join strategy to minimize I/O cost; (b) a scheme that groups cuboids into batches so as to minimize redundant computations; (c) a cost-based scheme to allocate the batches into bags (each with a small number of batches); and (d) an efficient scheme to process a bag using a single MapReduce job. Results of extensive experimental studies using both real Facebook and synthetic datasets on a 128 -node cluster show that Pagrol is effective, efficient and scalable. I...|$|R

Clustering and sequential analysis are two primary techniques for mining navigational patterns from Web and application server logs. The characteristics of the log data and mining tasks require new data representation methods and analysis algorithms to be tested in the e-commerce environment. In this paper we present a <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> to represent Web access sessions for data mining. The <b>cube</b> <b>model</b> organizes session data into three dimensions. The COMPO-NENT dimension represents a session as a set of ordered components {c 1,c 2, [...] ., cP}, in which each component ci indexes the ith visited page in the session. Each component is associated with a set of attributes describing the page indexed by it, such as the page ID, category and view time spent at the page. The attributes associated with each component are defined in the ATTRIBUTE dimension. The SESSION dimension indexes individual sessions. In the model, irregular sessions are converted to a regular data structure to which existing data mining algorithms can be applied while the order of the page sequences is maintained. A rich set of page attributes is embedded in the model for different analysis purposes. We also present some experimental results of using the partitional clustering algorithm to cluster sessions. Because the sessions are essentially sequences of categories, the k-modes algorithm designed for clustering categorical data and the clustering method using the Markov transition frequency (or probability) matrix, are used to cluster categorical sequences. ...|$|R
