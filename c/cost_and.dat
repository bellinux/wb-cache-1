The price differential/margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> value of used goods are in direct relationship to the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> value of the new goods. Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden effect on prices, it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease production costs from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.|$|E

40|$|Provider payment {{systems for}} mental health care that incentivise <b>cost</b> control <b>and</b> quality {{improvement}} have been a policy focus {{in a number of}} countries. In England, a new prospective provider payment system is being introduced to mental health that should encourage providers to control <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> improve outcomes. The aim of this research is to investigate the relationship between <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> outcomes to ascertain whether there is a trade-off between controlling <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> improving outcomes. The main data source is the Mental Health Minimum Data Set (MHMDS) for the years 2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13. Costs are calculated using NHS Reference Cost data while outcomes are measured using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). We estimate a bivariate multi-level model with <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> outcomes simultaneously. We calculate the correlation and plot the pairwise relationship between residual <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> outcomes at the provider level. After controlling for a range of demographic, need, social and treatment variables, residual variation in <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> outcomes remains at the provider level. The correlation between residual <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> outcomes is negative, but very small suggesting that cost-containment efforts by providers should not undermine outcome-improving efforts under the new payment system...|$|R

5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> value of used goods are in direct relationship to the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> value of the new goods.|$|E

Part II {{examines the}} approaches used by international arbitral tribunals in resolving claims for <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> fees and finds that they are inadequate. Part Ill proposes a new model for resolving these claims. The model provides that, in evaluating claims for <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> fees, arbitrators should first look to the parties 2 ̆ 7 agreement. If the parties have agreed on rules regarding the costs of the arbitration, either directly or by reference to arbitral rules, the arbitrators should resolve the claim in accord with the agreement. However, if the agreement fails to address the issue or is ambiguous on how to resolve these claims, then the model gives the tribunal the power to award <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> fees and sets forth the rules to follow. With respect to the latter, the model states that <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> fees should be awarded on the general principle that they should be borne by the unsuccessful party. It also defines which <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> fees may be awarded. This model provides a simple and straight forward approach for tribunals to use in resolving claims for <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> fees and thus can bring much needed uniformity to the area...|$|R
