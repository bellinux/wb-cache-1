5|$|High (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato {{supports}} {{an early}} dating for Ebla {{that would put}} the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC, later accepted the event <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> in 2400 BC. The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash—who boasted of taking tribute from Mari—or Lugalzagesi of Umma, {{who claimed to have}} reached the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when they}} gather to congratulate {{the bride and}} groom, the friends joke {{that they should be}} able to kiss the bride. The husband says that anybody who wants to kiss the bride has to kiss him like that first. Ching-teng grabs the groom and pushes him onto the table, kissing him like he would kiss Chia-yi. During their kiss, he remembers how he regrets their fight from years ago, and what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had he apologized for being childish.|$|E
5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman {{trying to stop the}} ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> anywhere on the way.|$|E
25|$|The Web {{has a very}} dynamic nature, and {{crawling}} {{a fraction}} of the Web can take weeks or months. By the time a Web crawler has finished its crawl, many events <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened,</b> including creations, updates, and deletions.|$|E
25|$|The Taliban and Al Qaeda {{forces were}} {{defeated}} within two months.

25|$|This {{explains}} the controversy of Thorne and other's older dates for LM3 - {{the establishment of}} (fully modern) human settlements in the different continents, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> only after (although perhaps remarkably shortly after) the exodus of the original (perhaps remarkably small) group of humans who left Africa via the middle-East.|$|E
25|$|Rotimi, {{a patriot}} who shunned the {{attraction}} of the West and Europe and returned home to contribute his own quota to nation building, was a rare breed.

25|$|The {{time periods}} between such devastating {{environmental}} events give time windows for the possible {{origin of life}} in the early environments.

He expressed that touring with a band with a similar style and an already established fanbase would influence the band members positively.|$|E

He wondered to the Weekly if the older man could have taken the boy back to that country with him at the time.

500|$|Navy {{athletic}} director Chet Gladchuk stated that Maryland's snub {{was the basis}} for their rejection of Maryland offers to renew the series in 2010: [...] "The stage was set for everything we had talked about, and all the good things that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> for fans—a big rematch, a bowl setting, a great city ... It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do something else. That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship."

500|$|Hetrick {{felt that}} the move away from TNG gave Vash more independence, and she enjoyed the new {{relationship}} between Vash and Quark, calling them [...] "kindred spirits".
