50|$|The {{shipowner}} {{is further}} secured by the stipulation {{that if the}} total freight payable under the bills of lading {{is less than the}} full <b>chartered</b> <b>freight,</b> the difference is paid to the shipowner before the vessel sails. Sometimes a difficulty arises, notwithstanding these precautions: even though the charter-party gives an ample lien, the terms of the bills of lading may be insufficient to preserve the same extensive lien as against the holder of the bills of lading. The shippers under the bills of lading, if they are not the charterers, are not liable for the <b>chartered</b> <b>freight,</b> but only for the bill of lading freight. Unless the bill of lading expressly reserves it, they are not subject to a lien for the <b>chartered</b> <b>freight.</b> The master may guard against this difficulty by refusing to sign bills of lading that do not preserve the shipowner's lien for full <b>chartered</b> <b>freight.</b> However a difficulty often arises from an improvident clause in the charter-party that requires him to sign bills of lading as presented.

50|$|For example, bulk coal long-distance {{rates in}} America are {{approximately}} 1 cent/ton-mile. So a 100 car train, each carrying 100 tons, over {{a distance of}} 1000 miles, would cost $100,000. On the other hand, Intermodal container shipping rates depend heavily on the route taken over {{the weight of the}} cargo, just as long as the container weight does not exceed the maximum lading capacity. Prices can vary between $300-$10,000 per Twenty foot equivalent unit (TEU) depending on the supply and demand of a given route. In ship <b>chartering,</b> <b>freight</b> is the price which a charterer pays a shipowner for the use of a ship in a voyage charter.|$|R
40|$|This master thesis investigates PSV term <b>charter</b> <b>freight</b> {{rates in}} the {{offshore}} industry. Fixtures in Brazil and the North Sea from 2004 - 2015 are examined. The offshore markets and term structure of freight rates are presented and discussed. Thereafter, the data and determinants of the freight rates are analyzed and later optimized. We find that both vessel and contract specific properties are significant determinants of the freight rate. Macro determinants are also found to be key variables in determination of the freight rate. Further, the periods before and after 2009 are compared in the analysis to identify whether the freight rate determination have changed during the last decade. nhhma...|$|R
