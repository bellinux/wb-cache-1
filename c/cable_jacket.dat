50|$|Combustible <b>cable</b> <b>jackets</b> may {{catch on}} fire and cable fires can thus spread along a cable tray within a structure. This is easily {{prevented}} {{through the use of}} fire-retardant <b>cable</b> <b>jackets,</b> or fireproofing coatings applied to installed cables. Heavy coatings or long fire-stops may require adjustment of the cable current ratings, since such fireproofing measures may reduce the heat dissipation of installed cables.|$|R

5000|$|Wire Strippers: Plier-like tool {{available}} in many sizes and designs featuring special blades {{to cut and}} strip wire insulation while leaving the conductor wire intact and without nicks.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of AS-Interface installations utilize the AS-Interface flat cable, defined {{as part of the}} AS-Interface specifications. A relatively small number of industries (e.g. valve control in process automation) use a round cable, mostly because it is easier to pull through conduit. While the shape of the cable does not matter (any other cable can be used) the electrical characteristics of the selected cable matters greatly. To prevent problems due to improper cable, most professionals suggest the AS-Interface flat cable. This cable is designed to make use of a cable piercing technology. When an AS-Interface module is installed on the network, piercing needles penetrate the <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> and displace the internal copper strands without cutting them. This allows AS-Interface modules to be installed anywhere on the network without cutting and preparing (i.e. removing <b>cable</b> <b>jacket,</b> stripping insulation and possibly applying a ferule) the cable first. The result is a faster installation without the chance of inadvertent shorts between the leads.|$|E

50|$|For {{electrical}} components, Santoprene TPV offers watertight seals, enabling connectors to be insert-molded to <b>cable</b> <b>jacketing,</b> {{producing a}} single integral part.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of firestops, <b>cable</b> <b>jacketing</b> is usually removed within the seal and firestop rubber modules are {{internally}} fitted with copper shields, which contact the cables' armour in order to ground the seal.|$|R
50|$|Most {{third-party}} {{versions are}} functionally identical to Sega's model besides cosmetic differences, but some simplified designs lack the additional A/V breakout and output switch. These units {{can only be}} used for VGA and audio output. Some of these designs are streamlined {{to the point that}} no extra housing is required beyond the <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> and the connectors; such units are described generically as DC VGA cables.|$|E
50|$|Irradiation {{can be used}} to {{cross-link}} plastics or {{to improve}} material qualities of semi-precious stones. Due to its efficiency, electron beam processing is often used in the irradiation treatment of polymer-based products to improve their mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties, and often to add unique properties. Cross-linked polyethylene pipe (PEX), high-temperature products such as tubing and gaskets, wire and <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> curing, curing of composite materials, and crosslinking of tires are a few examples.|$|E
5000|$|Repair: If the MI <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> {{has been}} damaged the {{magnesium}} oxide will wick moisture into the cable {{and it will}} lose its insulating properties causing shorts to the copper cladding, and thence to earth. It is often necessary to remove 0.5 to 2 m of the MI cable and splice in a new section to accomplish the repair. Depending on the size and number of conductors, a single termination can take between one and two hours of labour.|$|E
5000|$|Cable coating is {{generally}} considered a fire retardant, which lowers the spread of flame and generation of smoke along the combustible <b>cable</b> <b>jacketing.</b> Some <b>cable</b> coating systems are able to achieve a measure of circuit integrity, which is demonstrated and quantified through certification listing and listing and approval use and compliance.|$|R
50|$|Low smoke zero halogen or low smoke free of halogen (LSZH or LSOH or LS0H or LSFH or OHLS) is a {{material}} classification typically used for <b>cable</b> <b>jacketing</b> in the wire and cable industry. LSZH <b>cable</b> <b>jacketing</b> {{is composed of}} thermoplastic or thermoset compounds that emit limited smoke and no halogen when exposed to high sources of heat. The first commercial thermoplastic LSZH material for <b>cable</b> <b>jacketing</b> was invented by Richard Skipper in 1979 and patented by Raychem Corporation.2 This invention resolved the challenge of incorporating sufficient inorganic filler, aluminium trihydrate (ALTH), into an appropriate thermoplastic matrix to suppress the fire and allow a char to be formed, which reduced emission of poisonous carbon gasses and also smoke and carbon particles, whilst maintaining electrical insulation properties and physical properties required by the end application.The preferred inorganic filler to achieve flame retardation continues to be aluminium trihydrate (ALTH). In {{the event of a}} fire this material undergoes an endothermic chemical reaction that absorbs heat energy and releases steam when the compound reaches a certain temperature. It is critical that the decomposition of the polymer(s) used to carry the filler decompose at approximately the same temperature.2Al(OH)3 = AL203 + 3H2O (180°C) The steam disrupts combustion of the evolved gasses and helps form a char layer that protects the remaining material and traps particulates. The high level of filler required (≈ 60%) also replaces the base polymer reducing the total amount of fuel available for combustion.|$|R
50|$|TPU is {{well known}} for its {{applications}} in performance films, wire and <b>cable</b> <b>jacketing,</b> hose and tube, in adhesive and textile coating applications and as an impact modifier of other polymers. TPU pellets are used as Adidas' most recent cushioning technology, known as Boost. Several thousands of TPU pellets are bound together to create a comfortable sole for the shoe.|$|R
50|$|In {{building}} construction, electrical <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> {{material is}} a potential source of fuel for fires. To limit the spread of fire along cable jacketing, one may use cable coating materials or one may use cables with jacketing that is inherently fire retardant. The plastic covering on some metal clad cables may be stripped off at installation to reduce the fuel source for fires. Inorganic coatings and boxes around cables safeguard the adjacent areas from the fire threat associated with unprotected cable jacketing. However, this fire protection also traps heat generated from conductor losses, so the protection must be thin.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{application}} for the cow hitch {{is in the}} handling of large electric power cable in surface mines. Known colloquially as a [...] "Cableman's hitch", it {{is also used to}} attach loops of cable to the back of a pick-up truck during a shovel move. As the cable can weigh upwards of 22 pounds per foot and 3-4 loops of cable can be attached to one length of rope, a clove hitch's shearing force would damage the <b>cable</b> <b>jacket.</b> The Cableman's hitch puts the strain onto the hitch crossing over the two running ends of the rope.|$|E
50|$|Breakout-style fiberoptic cable (also called {{breakout}} cable or fanout cable), is an {{optical fiber cable}} containing several jacketed simplex optical fibers packaged together inside an outer jacket. This differs from distribution-style cable, in which tight-buffered fibers are bundled together, with only the outer <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> of the cable protecting them. The design of breakout-style cable adds strength for ruggedized drops, however the cable is larger and more expensive than distribution-style cable. Breakout cable is suitable for short riser and plenum applications and also for use in conduits, where a very simple cable run is planned to avoid {{the use of any}} splicebox or spliced fiber pigtails.|$|E
25|$|Three key {{characteristics}} of fiber optic waveguides {{can be affected}} by environmental conditions: strength, attenuation and resistance to losses caused by microbending. External optical fiber <b>cable</b> <b>jackets</b> and buffer tubes protect glass optical fiber from environmental conditions that can affect the fiber’s performance and long-term durability. On the inside, coatings ensure {{the reliability of the}} signal being carried and help minimize attenuation due to microbending.|$|R
50|$|Santoprene TPV {{is used in}} weatherseals, {{underhood}} and under-car applications, {{and interior}} components. In weatherseals, TPV {{is used as a}} lightweight alternative to thermoset rubber materials in semi-dynamic and static parts, while in underhood and under-car applications it is well-suited for air ducts, tubing, molded seals, grommets, suspension bellows, <b>cable</b> <b>jacketing,</b> plugs, bumpers and many other parts. This is due to its sealing performance and resistance to extreme temperatures, chemical exposure and harsh environments.|$|R
50|$|Class-C fires involve {{electricity}} as {{a continuous}} power source for the ignition of the fuels associated with electrical equipment, such as plastic <b>cable</b> <b>jackets.</b> The application of water does not always result in effective fire control, {{and there is a}} general concern regarding conductivity and personnel safety. Class C fires can be effectively controlled by removing the oxygen. The removal of electricity {{as a continuous}} ignition source is important to eliminate re-ignition. Once the electricity is removed, the result is a Class A fire.|$|R
50|$|A {{submersible}} pump cable is a specialized product {{to be used}} for a {{submersible pump}} in a deep well, or in similarly harsh conditions. The cable needed for this type of application must be durable and reliable as the installation location and environment can be extremely restrictive as well as hostile. As such, submersible pump cable can be used in both fresh and salt water. It is also suitable for direct burial and within well castings. A submersible pump cable's area of installation is physically restrictive. Cable manufacturers must keep these factors in mind to achieve the highest possible degree of reliability. The size and shape of submersible pump cable can vary depending on the usage and preference and pumping instrument of the installer. Pump cables are made in single and multiple conductor types and may be flat or round in cross section; some types include control wires as well as power conductors for the pump motor. Conductors are often color-coded for identification and an overall <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> may also be color-coded.|$|E
50|$|TPEs {{are used}} where {{conventional}} elastomers cannot provide {{the range of}} physical properties needed in the product. These materials find large application in the automotive sector and in household appliances sector. In 2014 the world market for TPEs reached a volume of ca. 16.7 billion US dollars. About 40% of all TPE products {{are used in the}} manufacturing of vehicles. For instance copolyester TPEs are used in snowmobile tracks where stiffness and abrasion resistance are at a premium. They are also widely used for catheters where nylon block copolymers offer a range of softness ideal for patients. Thermoplastic silicone and olefin blends are used for extrusion of glass run and dynamic weatherstripping car profiles. Styrene block copolymers are used in shoe soles for their ease of processing, and widely as adhesives. TPE is commonly used to make suspension bushings for automotive performance applications because of its greater resistance to deformation when compared to regular rubber bushings. Thermoplastics have experienced growth in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry due to the function, cost effectiveness and adaptability to modify plastic resins into a variety of covers, fans and housings. TPE may also be used in medical devices and is also finding more and more uses as an electrical <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> and inner insulation. You'll also be able to find TPE used in some headphone cables.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{here two}} sensors that {{are commonly used}} to measure high-voltage fast-risetime signals in coaxial cable. One sensor measures the current in the cable, and is called a Current-Viewing Resistor, or CVR. In this design, the <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> is cut, {{a portion of the}} <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> is removed, and a number of resistors are inserted in parallel across the gap, thereby creating a low resistance in series with the outer <b>cable</b> <b>jacket.</b> The voltage across these resistors is proportional to the current in the coax. The second sensor measures the derivative of the voltage in the coax. It is fabricated from a “sawed-off ” SMA connector that is inserted through a small hole in the <b>cable</b> <b>jacket.</b> In this paper we characterize the accuracy of both sensors when used with RG- 220 cable, and we discuss the situations when one might prefer one measurement type over the other...|$|E
50|$|Meg{{ohmmeter}} is {{a special}} type of ohmmeter {{used to measure the}} electrical resistance of insulators. Insulating components, for example <b>cable</b> <b>jackets,</b> must be tested for their insulation strength at the time of commissioning and as part of maintenance of high voltage electrical equipment and installations. For this purpose megohmmeters, which can provide high DC voltages (typically in ranges from 500 V to 5 kV, some are up to 15 kV) at specified current capacity, are used. Acceptable insulator resistance values are typically 1 to 10 megohms, depending on the standards referenced.|$|R
50|$|Underground plant {{includes}} all the telecommunications equipment installed in underground {{structures such as}} utility holes, Controlled Environment Vaults (CEVs), and ducts, along with associated hardware. Underground plant can be exposed to waters containing water-soluble salts of the native soil. Utility holes often show evidence of corrosion of support hardware and bonding ribbons that is caused by sulfate-reducing bacteria. The environment in utility holes and ducts can be made corrosive by man-made chemicals such as industrial effluent, fertilizers, and de-icing salts. Protective plastic coatings and <b>cable</b> <b>jackets</b> can rapidly deteriorate from leaking steam pipes present in many urban areas and from gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks.|$|R

40|$|Cables {{have been}} {{identified}} as critical components requiring detailed technical evaluation for extending the lifetime of Light Water Reactors beyond 40 years. This paper highlights some of the DOE-sponsored cable aging studies currently underway at Sandia. These studies are focused on two important issues: the validity of the often-used Arrhenius thermal aging prediction method and methods for predicting lifetimes in combined thermal-radiation environments. Accelerated thermal aging results are presented for three <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> and insulation materials, which indicate that hardening of the outside surface has an Arrhenius temperature dependence and correlates well with reductions in ultimate tensile elongation. This suggests that the indentor approach is a promising NDE technique for <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> and unjacketed insulation materials installed in thermally-dominated regions of nuclear power plants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{nuclear power}} plants, {{there are many}} cables that perform safety-related functions. These cables should {{implement}} condition monitoring during the operation period in the nuclear power plant, {{in order to assess}} the remaining qualified life and extend the qualified life. In this study we focused on the indenting method which can measure the hardness of the <b>cable</b> <b>jacket.</b> This method is selected because it is non-destructive and requires short testing time and small sized equipment. In order to address the problems with the existing indenting test equipment, we developed new indenting test equipment, which could automatically move {{on the surface of the}} object cable. The newly developed equipment is designed for a small-sized and light-weight robot using wireless communication in order to implement condition monitoring in a harsh environment or locations that are inaccessible to the tester. The developed wireless cable indenting robot is composed of three parts, which are mechanical and electrical hardware parts and remote-control part. In order to analyze the degradation tendency of the cable, we prepared four thermally aged specimens and one un-aged specimen. Using the developed robot, we measured the modulus of the <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> of each specimen. The test data showed that the modulus of the <b>cable</b> <b>jacket</b> increased linearly as the accelerated aging time increased. From these results, we can analyze the degradation trends pertaining to cables installed in nuclear power plant according to the operation period...|$|E

40|$|Boston Insulated Wire & Cable {{developed}} a new polyimide foam material, commercially known as Solimide, which resists ignition. It chars and decomposes when exposed to open flames. Used in the space shuttle, the material does not "outgas" until it begins to char making it safer than current materials with respect to toxic fumes. The polyimide {{can be made in}} two forms: a resilient foam and a rigid foam. Used in commercial transport interiors for such soft components as seat cushions to door, wall, floor, and ceiling panels. Material's flame resistance could lengthen from two minutes to five minutes, the time needed for passenger evacuation in a ground emergency. Could help reduce airline fuel consumption, since the foam is 50 % lighter than current materials.

40|$|Flame {{retardant}} polymers {{that may}} be considered for fire resistant <b>cable</b> <b>jacketing</b> polymers were developed. Synthesis of flame retardant compound in bulk amounts for extrusion process was held. Morphology, dispersion and particle size, flame retardancy, and mechanical properties of modified polymers were investigated and characterized for optimization of flame retredancy and mechanical properties. For imparting flame retardancy to polymer matrix, intumescent type flame retardant synthesized. Improved residual char producing recipe was examined for better intumescent barrier between polymer and heat source. Stearyl alcohol, Mannitol, and Pentaerythritol were tried as carbonic sources, and Phosphoruspentaoxide and Phosphoric promoter chemicals were tried for improved char residue. For better flame resistancy synergistic phenomenon was utilized by addition of nitrogen sources such as Melamine and Ethylenediamine. Polymer and additive were processed in extruder. Due to hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity difference between flame retardant additive and polymer matrix, compatibilizers were utilized for improving interfacial adhesion. Fragile nature of flame retardant compound under high temperatures and shear forces were another concern to access improved mechanical properties in extrusion process. Processing variables were optimized by experimental trial and error methodology...|$|R
