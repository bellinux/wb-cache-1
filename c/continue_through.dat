Passengers can change at Shotton for the Borderlands Line, which links Wrexham with Bidston on the Wirral Peninsula in England. The Conwy Valley Line links Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog via Betws-y-Coed and was constructed mainly for use as a freight line for the transport of slate to the quay at Deganwy for export by sea. It is a scenic route with a number of request stops.|$|E

Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside hollowed trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. S. v. zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes four or five days and may <b>continue</b> <b>through</b> incubation.|$|E

5|$|MD 68 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 40 (Cumberland Street) {{in the town}} of Clear Spring. The state highway heads south as Mill Street through a commercial area. MD 68's name changes to Clear Spring Road after leaving the town limits. The state highway meets I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) at a diamond interchange, then heads southeast through farmland, where the highway crosses Little Conococheague Creek. MD 68 intersects the eastern end of MD 56 (Big Pool Road) shortly before passing through the village of Pinesburg. The state highway intersects CSX's Lurgan Subdivision rail line and passes between industrial properties, then crosses Conococheague Creek and enters the town of Williamsport. MD 68 is municipally maintained within the town, where the highway follows Conococheague Street south through an intersection with US 11 (Potomac Street). At this intersection, MD 63 joins MD 68 in a concurrency to <b>continue</b> <b>through</b> the Williamsport Historic District. The two highways leave the town limits at their diamond interchange with I-81 (Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway), through which the roadway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to <b>continue</b> <b>through</b> the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed his finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E
5|$|Stamford Wharf was {{the upper}} limit of navigation, and was {{situated}} below Town Bridge, which carries the A43 road over the river at Stamford. There were buildings associated with the canal {{on both sides of}} the river, including a large warehouse next to the bridge, parts of which date from 1671, and which is Grade II listed. Barges followed the river down past the ruins of St Leonard's Priory, established in 1090 by the Benedictines, to Hudds Mill, where the cut began, on the north side of the mill. Hudds Mill Lock was almost at the start of the cut. The canal flowed initially to the east, but turned to the north east to cross the River Gwash at right angles. It then entered Uffington Park, where the remains of the weir that regulated river levels at the crossing can still be seen. The Gwash now has much less flow than it did when the canal was active, since the construction of the reservoir at Rutland Water further upstream. The earthworks of the canal <b>continue</b> <b>through</b> the park.|$|E

5|$|Their goal in Laos {{seemingly}} achieved, President Thieu and General Lãm {{ordered a}} withdrawal of ARVN forces beginning on 9 March {{that was to}} <b>continue</b> <b>through</b> {{the rest of the}} month, destroying Base Area 604 and any supplies discovered in their path. General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that they keep disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy these force before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.|$|E
5|$|US30 heads {{southeast}} into Hammonton, Atlantic County, {{continuing through}} rural areas with increasing development. The road comes to its intersection with the southern terminus US206 {{and the northern}} terminus of Route54. A short distance later, the route has a concurrency with CR542 that begins adjacent to the former Atlanticare - Kessler Memorial Hospital that closed in 2009 and passes by Hammonton Lake. US30 turns south-southwest past the CR542 concurrency before heading south. The route crosses CR561 and turns southeast again, entering Mullica Township. Here, the White Horse Pike enters more forested areas with a few buildings, running a short distance to the northeast of the Atlantic City Line. Past the intersection with CR623 in the developed community of Elwood, US30 becomes a divided highway with grass median and jughandles. This configuration continues until Egg Harbor City, when the median ends. In Egg Harbor City, US30 passes a mix of homes and businesses, intersecting Route50 and CR563 {{in the center of}} town. At this point, CR563 forms a concurrency with US30 and the two routes <b>continue</b> <b>through</b> more of the town before crossing into Galloway Township at the intersection with CR674. The road passes through rural areas with some development, reaching the community of Cologne. In this area, there is a crossroads with CR614 before CR563 splits from US30 by turning south onto Tilton Road. Past Cologne, the road reaches a junction with CR575 in the developed community of Pomona.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, {{while on}} patrol west of Philadelphia, Pulaski spotted {{significant}} British forces {{moving toward the}} Continental position. Upon being informed by Pulaski, Washington prepared for a battle, but the encounter {{was interrupted by a}} major storm before either side was organized. On October 4, Pulaski took part in the Battle of Germantown. He spent the winter of 1777 to 1778 with most of the army at Valley Forge. Pulaski argued that the military operations should <b>continue</b> <b>through</b> the winter, but this idea was rejected by the general staff. In turn, he focused on reorganizing the cavalry force, mostly stationed in Trenton. While at Trenton his assistance was requested by General Anthony Wayne, whom Washington had dispatched on a foraging expedition into southern New Jersey. Wayne was in danger of encountering a much larger British force sent to oppose his movements. Pulaski and 50 cavalry rode south to Burlington, where they skirmished with British sentries on February 28. After this minor encounter the British commander, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Stirling, was apparently convinced that he was facing a much larger force than expected, and prepared to withdraw his troops across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania at Cooper's Ferry (present-day Gloucester City). Pulaski and Wayne joined forces to attack Stirling's position on February 29 while he awaited suitable weather conditions to cross. In the resulting skirmish (which only involved a few hundred men out of the larger forces on either side), Pulaski's horse was shot out from under him and a few of his cavalry were wounded.|$|E
