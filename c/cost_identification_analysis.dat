40|$|In recent years, the {{econometrics}} {{literature has}} shown a growing interest {{in the study of}} partially identified models, in which the object of economic and statistical interest is a set rather than a point. The characterization of this set and the development of consistent estimators and inference procedures for it with desirable properties are the main goals of partial <b>identification</b> <b>analysis.</b> This review introduces the fundamental tools of the theory of random sets, which brings together elements of topology, convex geometry, and probability theory to develop a coherent mathematical framework to analyze random elements whose realizations are sets. It then elucidates how these tools have been fruitfully applied in econometrics to reach the goals of partial <b>identification</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} how {{the use of}} random set theory can benefit partial <b>identification</b> <b>analysis.</b> We revisit the origins of Manski's work in partial identification (e. g., Manski (1989, 1990)), focusing our discussion on identification of probability distributions and conditional expectations {{in the presence of}} selectively observed data, statistical independence and mean independence assumptions, and shape restrictions. We show that the use of the Choquet capacity functional and of the Aumann expectation of a properly defined random set can simplify and extend previous results in the literature. We pay special attention to explaining how the relevant random set needs to be constructed, depending on the econometric framework at hand. We also discuss limitations in the applicability of specific tools of random set theory to partial <b>identification</b> <b>analysis.</b> ...|$|R

The masonry model was built with limestone units and lime mortar joints with polymeric grid reinforcement placed on the horizontal joins. The dynamic <b>identification</b> <b>analysis</b> was divided in several tasks. For the calculation of the expected dynamic parameters a preliminary FEM analysis was carried out. Two types of operational modal analysis were used, the EFDD and SSI methods. The main purpose of the analysis was to compare the classical modal analysis with the ambient based modal analysis and to verify if the ambient vibration methods are able to assess the damage in an earlier stage in the structure. Finally, concluding remarks of the work carried out are given. ...|$|R
