40|$|ABSTRACT Dipankar Roychowdhury CYBERSURFER: A ONE WINDOW INERNET BROWSER The Web browser {{interaction}} model popularized by NCSA Mosaic in 1993 {{contributed to the}} exponential growth of the Internet and has remained largely unchanged since then. However, even with multiple windows and bookmarks, it has become ineffective {{as a tool for}} managing Web pages, because the number of Web sites visited by users has increased. This study analyzes Internet browsing patterns and, based on that analysis, proposes a new {{interaction model}} that facilitates efficient Web browsing in a single window using two novel tools: “clone” and “mark. ” The innovative interface that embodies this interaction model improves access to visited pages and enhances the management of links on a page. This study also compares Web browsing performance using the interface of the <b>Cybersurfer</b> Web browser to that of Internet Explore 6. 0. The findings reveal the drawbacks of the currently used multiple window browsers and the potential efficiency, convenience, and pleasure of a new interface for single-window browsers...|$|E

In a negative review, <b>CyberSurfers</b> Linda Sharar called the game dull, and agreed with Suciu that its simulation mode lacked incentives to continue playing. She wrote, [...] "I suppose {{if you look at}} Wolf as an interactive educational program, it serves its purpose. But as a game—I just don't get it." ...|$|R
