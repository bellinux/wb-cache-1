A CDS {{in which the}} buyer does not own the underlying debt {{is referred to as}} a naked <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap,</b> estimated to be up to 80% of the <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> market. There is currently a debate in the United States and Europe about whether speculative uses of credit default swaps should be banned. Legislation is under consideration by Congress as part of financial reform.|$|E
40|$|Many {{observers}} {{have argued that}} <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> {{contributed significantly to the}} credit crisis. Of particular concern to these observers are that <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> trade in the largely unregulated over-the-counter market as bilateral contracts involving counterparty risk and that they facilitate speculation involving negative views of a firm’s financial strength. Some {{observers have}} suggested that <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> would not have made the crisis worse had they been traded on exchanges. I conclude that <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> did not cause the dramatic events of the credit crisis, that the over-the-counter <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> market worked well during much of {{the first year of the}} credit crisis, and that exchange trading has both advantages and costs compared to over-the-counter trading. Though I argue that eliminating over-the-counter trading of <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> could reduce social welfare, I also recognize that much research is needed to understand better and quantify the social gains and costs of derivatives in general and <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> in particular. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} pricing of Asian and non-Asian <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> that traded during the 1997 to 1999 time period. We employ two credit risk models, Duffie and Singleton (1999) and Jarrow and Turnbull (1995). We argue that <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> {{should have a}} {{positive}} economic value since credit spreads reflect differences in liquidity as well as credit risk. However, {{in the presence of}} moral hazard we expect to see negative economic values since asymmetric information would motivate sellers of <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> to demand a “restructuring premium”. While we generally find positive economic values for <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps,</b> both models find negative economic values for Asian <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> during the recent Asian currency crisis, which we attribute to moral hazard. <b>Credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps,</b> moral hazard, recovery rates, asymmetric information...|$|R

25|$|Under the Duffie construct, {{the price}} of a <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> can also be derived by calculating the asset swap spread of a bond. If a bond has a spread of 100, and the swap spread is 70 basis points, then a CDS {{contract}} should trade at 30. However, there are sometimes technical reasons why this will not be the case, and this may or may not present an arbitrage opportunity for the canny investor. The difference between the theoretical model and the actual price of a <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> is known as the basis.|$|E
25|$|The {{derivatives}} team at JPMorgan (including Blythe Masters) was {{a pioneer}} in the invention of credit derivatives such as the <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap.</b> The first CDS was created to allow Exxon to borrow money from JPMorgan while JPMorgan transferred the risk to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. JPMorgan's team later created the 'BISTRO', a bundle of credit default swaps that was the progenitor of the Synthetic CDO. JPMorgan currently has the largest <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> and credit derivatives portfolio by total notional amount of any US bank.|$|E

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> are {{contracts}} that provide protection against default by third parties, similar to insurance. These financial derivatives {{are used by}} banks and other financial institutions to manage risk. The rapid growth of the derivatives market, the potential for widespread <b>credit</b> <b>defaults</b> (such as defaults for subprime mortgages), and operational problems in the over-the-counter (OTC) market where <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> are traded, have led some policymakers to inquire if <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> are {{a danger to the}} financial system and the economy.

25|$|A <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> (CDS) is a {{financial}} swap {{agreement that the}} seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer (usually the creditor of the reference loan) {{in the event of}} a loan default (by the debtor) or other credit event.

25|$|Proponents {{of naked}} <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> say that short selling in various forms, whether <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps,</b> options or futures, has the {{beneficial}} effect of increasing liquidity in the marketplace. That benefits hedging activities. Without speculators {{buying and selling}} naked CDSs, banks wanting to hedge might not find a ready seller of protection. Speculators also create a more competitive marketplace, keeping prices down for hedgers. A robust market in <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> can {{also serve as a}} barometer to regulators and investors about the credit health of a company or country.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we compare market prices of <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> with model prices. We {{show that a}} simple reduced form model with a {{constant}} recovery rate outperforms the market practice of directly comparing bonds' <b>credit</b> spreads to <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> premiums. We find that the model works well for investment grade <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps,</b> but only if we use swap or repo rates as proxy for default-free interest rates. This indicates that the government curve is no longer seen as the reference default-free curve. We also show that the model is insensitive {{to the value of}} the assumed recovery rate.

25|$|Goldman {{is being}} criticized for its {{involvement}} in the 2010 European sovereign debt crisis. Goldman Sachs {{is reported to have}} systematically helped the Greek government mask the true facts concerning its national debt between the years 1998 and 2009. In September 2009, Goldman Sachs, among others, created a special <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> (CDS) index to cover the high risk of Greece's national debt. The interest-rates of Greek national bonds soared, leading the Greek economy very close to bankruptcy in 2010 and 2011.|$|E
25|$|PwC {{was also}} criticised by several {{witnesses}} {{during the investigation}} into AIG's collapse, after the insurer was unable to fulfil its collateral obligations to Goldman Sachs. The insurer was expected to cover the difference in value between the <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> contracts it had sold to Goldman Sachs, however {{the head of the}} unit at AIG disagreed with the valuation that Goldman presented. According to a memo published by Business Insider, witnesses wondered how PwC was signing off on the accounts for both AIG and Goldman Sachs, when they were using different valuation methods for the swaps contracts (and therefore booked different values for them in their accounts).|$|E
25|$|Forms {{of credit}} default swaps {{had been in}} {{existence}} from at least the early 1990s, with early trades carried out by Bankers Trust in 1991. J.P. Morgan & Co. is widely credited with creating the modern <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> in 1994. In that instance, J.P. Morgan had extended a $4.8billion credit line to Exxon, which faced the threat of $5billion in punitive damages for the Exxon Valdez oil spill. A team of J.P. Morgan bankers led by Blythe Masters then sold the credit risk from the credit line to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development in order to cut the reserves that J.P. Morgan was required to hold against Exxon's default, thus improving its own balance sheet.|$|E

25|$|American International Group {{received}} $180 {{billion in}} government loans during the financial crisis. The money {{was used to}} repay customers of its security-lending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from AIG. However, due to the size {{and nature of the}} payouts, there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks, including Goldman Sachs, should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to AIG. The New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced in March 2009 that he was investigating whether AIG's trading counterparties improperly received government money. Goldman Sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to AIG and received $12.9 billion during the unwind of <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> (CDS) contracts by AIG after receiving the government loans.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & Operation risk groups focus on middle office functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls. <b>Credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap,</b> for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as operational risk, internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|E
