40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is a {{comparative}} investigation of changes that certain genome parts undergo during speciation. The research was focused on divergence of coding and noncoding sequences in different groups of salmonid fishes of the Salmonidae (Salmo, Parasalmo, Oncorhynchus, and Salvelinus genera) and the <b>Coregonidae</b> families under different levels of reproductive isolation. Two basic approaches were used: (1) PCR-RAPD with a 20 – 22 [*]nt primer design with subsequent cloning and sequencing of the products and (2) a modified endonuclease restriction analysis.

40|$|Actinopterygian fishes {{exhibit the}} {{greatest}} taxonomical diversity of all vertebrates, making this group attractive to address numerous evolutionary questions. The role of molecular cytogenetics and cytogenomics further increase because {{recent advances in}} these fields provide more comprehensive view of fish genome organization and evolutionary dynamics, responsible for this amazing diversity. My Thesis investigates the genome organization of selected fish lineages, namely basal lineages of Actinopterygians (Lepisosteidae and Amiidae) and Teleosts (Pantodontidae), together with "modern" fishes Cobitidae and <b>Coregonidae.</b> I have integrated conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques together with phylogenetic and statistical approaches. Publications included into the Thesis describe e. g. the cytogenetic variability and dynamics in closely related fish species of the genus Coregonus {{and the impact of}} repetitive sequences on the ecological speciation. In contrast to the recent cytotaxonomical diversity of Coregonids, we have detected a karyotype stability associated with asexual reproduction in spined loaches of the genus Cobitis. In the subsequent publication, we describe a surprising AT/GC genome organization in gars (Atractosteus and Lepisosteus) and summarize the knowledge of genome [...] ...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the needs}} for the {{essential}} fatty acids, the fish can be classified in three groups: For the fish from Salrrwnidae family (Oncorhynhcus kisutch, O. keta, O. nerka and O. tshawytscha) the essential is 18 : 3 in the quantity of 1 %. The same effect in regard to growth and nutrition coefficient can be achieved {{with the addition of}} highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUF A) ω 3 rows in the quantity of 9. 5 %. The Californian trout (Oncorhynhcus mykiss) is needier than the other fish for 20 : 5 ω 3 and 22 : 6 ω 3. Its needs is 1 %. For the fish from <b>Coregonidae</b> family (Coregonus lavaretus, C. peled and C. nasus) the essential is 18 : 3 ω 3 in the quantity of 1 % or the combination 20 : 5 ω 3 (o. 25 %) and 22 : 6 ω 3 (O. 25 %). Fresh-water fish from the Anguillidae family (Anguilla anguilla and A. japonicai, Cyprinidae family (Cyprinus carpio), Ictaluridae family (lctalurus punctatus) have needs for 18 : 2 ω 3 in the quantity of 1 - 2 % or RUFA O. 5 - 1 %. The fatty acids ω 6 row (18 : 2 ω) 6 or 20 : 4 ω 6) are important for the fish from Cichlidae family (Tilapia zillii and Orechromis nilaticus) in the quantity of 1 %. Te sea fish Rhombus maximus and Pagnus major achieve the best growth when they receive HUFA ω 3 row up to 2 % together with the food. Rancid ointment, eruk-acid from the rape oil, gosipol and cyclophrophenoid acid from the cotton seeds oil if added to fish food cause the reduced growth and pathologic changes on fish liver, kidneys, heart and gills...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Teleost fishes of the <b>Coregonidae</b> {{are good}} model systems for {{studying}} postglacial evolution, adaptive radiation and ecological speciation. Of particular interest {{is whether the}} repeated occurrence of sympatric species pairs results from in-situ divergence from a single lineage or from multiple invasions {{of one or more}} different lineages. Here, we analysed the genetic structure of Baltic ciscoes (Coregonus albula complex), examining 271 individuals from 8 lakes in northern Germany using 1244 polymorphic AFLP loci. Six lakes had only one population of C. albula while the remaining two lakes had C. albula as well as a sympatric species (C. lucinensis or C. fontanae). Results AFLP demonstrated a significant population structure (Bayesian θ B = 0. 22). Lower differentiation between allopatric (θ B = 0. 028) than sympatric (0. 063 - 0. 083) populations contradicts the hypothesis of a sympatric origin of taxa, and there was little evidence for stocking or ongoing hybridization. Genome scans found only three loci that appeared to be under selection in both sympatric population pairs, suggesting a low probability of similar mechanisms of ecological segregation. However, removal of all non-neutral loci decreased the genetic distance between sympatric pairs, suggesting recent adaptive divergence at a few loci. Sympatric pairs in the two lakes were genetically distinct from the six other C. albula populations, suggesting introgression from another lineage may have influenced these two lakes. This was supported by an analysis of isolation-by-distance, where the drift-gene flow equilibrium observed among allopatric populations was disrupted when the sympatric pairs were included. Conclusions While the population genetic data alone can not unambiguously uncover the mode of speciation, our data indicate that multiple lineages may be responsible for the complex patterns typically observed in Coregonus. Relative differences within and among lakes raises the possibility that multiple lineages may be present in northern Germany, thus understanding the postglacial evolution and speciation in the C. albula complex requires a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of several potential founder lineages. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{published}} {{information on}} the white whale or beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) inhabiting the Barents, Kara and Laptev seas. Some data obtained during multi-year aerial reconnaissance of sea ice in the Russian Arctic are also included. Ice conditions, {{considered one of the}} major factors affecting distribution of belugas, are described. The number of belugas inhabiting the Russian Arctic is unknown. Based on analysis of published and unpublished information we believe that the primary summer habitats of belugas in the Western Russian Arctic lie in the area of Frants-Josef Land, in the Kara Sea and in the western Laptev Sea. Apparently most belugas winter in the Barents Sea. Although {{it has been suggested that}} a considerable number of animals winter in the Kara Sea, there is no direct evidence for this. Apparent migrations of animals are regularly observed at several sites: the straits of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago, the waters north of the archipelago, and Vilkitskiy Strait between the Kara and Laptev seas. Calving and mating take place in summer, and the beluga mother feeds a calf for at least a year. Females mature earlier than males, and about 30 % of mature females in a population are barren. Sex ratio is apparently close to 1 : 1.  The diet of the beluga in the region includes fish and crustaceans and shows considerable spatial and temporal variations. However, polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is the main prey most of the year, and whitefish (<b>Coregonidae)</b> contribute in coastal waters in summer. Usually belugas form groups of up to 10 related individuals of different ages, while large aggregations are common during seasonal migrations or in areas with abundant and easily available food. Beluga whaling in Russia has a history of several centuries. The highest catches were taken in the 1950 s and 1960 s, when about  1, 500 animals were caught annually in the Western Russian Arctic. In the 1990 s, few belugas were harvested in the Russian Arctic. In 1999 commercial whaling of belugas in Russia was banned.  Belugas can be caught only for research, cultural and educational purposes and for the subsistence needs of local people. With the absence of significant whaling, anthropogenic pollution seems to be the major threat for the species...|$|E
