40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the changes of microorganism and sanitation of African style salad during processing and refrigerating. Methods The basic formulation of African style salad was made, {{the process was}} processed, the changes of microorganism of this salad made in basic and new formulation were analyzed, so as to decide the shelf life. Results The total bacteria colonies of African style salad made in basic formulation were 2. 1 × 103 cfu/g, including 74. 1 % from cucumbers, 10. 0 % from tomatoes, 4. 9 % from onions, 7. 7 % from <b>Chinese</b> <b>leaves,</b> and 2. 7 % from eggs, respectively. The sterilization rate of African style salad made in new formulation was 71. 4 % and the shelf life increased from 3 d to 5 d by blanching raw materials and increasing the dosage of white vinegar of 2 times volume. Conclusion It has great significance to the food safety management for catering industry...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine content of nitrates as anti-nutritional factor in {{selected}} species of vegetable available in stores of Jindřichův Hradec. The study was carried out in years 2010 and 2011. Number of analysed samples reached 206. Due to the very wide range of vegetable diversity on the market the study was focused on basic categories. The green-stuff were represented by <b>Chinese</b> <b>leaves</b> and Iceberg lettuce, the root-vegetable by carrot, parsley and radishes. Finally there were put in test turnip cabbages and potatoes. The lowest amount of nitrates was determined in samples of root-vegetable except radishes and potatoes. Parsley contained 452 mg of NO 3 -. kg- 1, carrot 241 mg NO 3 -. kg- 1. The average of nitrate concentration in potatoes was 230 mg NO 3 -. kg- 1. The other side of the scale occupied turnip cabbages containing 1982 mg NO 3 -. kg- 1 in average...|$|E
40|$|For {{long time}} {{vegetables}} were thought only {{as sources of}} several vitamins; however, {{it has been shown}} that vegetables contain other component, which is also important for maintaining body's health, i. e., dietary fiber. Dietary fiber is a group of polysaccharides oan other polymers, which cannot be digested by upper gastro-intestinal system of human. Dietary fiber can be grouped as soluble and insoluble dietary fiber, showing in different physiological effect. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) is effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, while insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) can prevent the development of colon cancer, diverticulosis as well as obesity. Local vegetables found to contain high SDF (higher than 3, 06 % db) are: watercress, green bean, carrot, eggplant, lettuce, broccoli, spinach, string bean, and aubergine; while which contain high IDF (higher than 40, 60 % db) are: winged bean, watercress, <b>chinese</b> <b>leaves,</b> katuk leaves, lettuce, green bean, broccoli, carrot and spinach. Cooking (i. e. boiling, steaming and pan frying) decrease the IDF content of vegetables, while their SDF content is not affected by cooking treatments...|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 19th century {{and through the}} first two decades of the 20th, Chinese {{immigrants}} came into Sonora state. One of the places in which a significant number settled was the city of Hermosillo. Some of these immigrants had capital {{and used it to}} establish businesses, especially shoe manufacturing and clothing. Some of the most successful Chinese-owned businesses in Sonora were based in Hermosillo and sold their merchandise {{to other parts of the}} country. However, by the 1920s anti-Chinese sentiment had become strong in Sonora state, with many <b>Chinese</b> <b>leaving</b> for Mexico City or the United States.|$|R

5000|$|Like Tacoma, Seattle {{also saw}} a growth in Chinese laborers during the 1880s. A mob of 1,500 forced Chinese {{residents}} out of Seattle in 1886. Precursors began when the Seattle City Council passed a number of ordinances directly aimed against its Chinese residents. Members of the Knights of Labor chapter in Seattle then organized a movement against Chinese laborers. On February 7, many [...] "committees" [...] demanded <b>Chinese</b> to <b>leave</b> Seattle by the ship Queen of the Pacific. After reaching the docks with the Chinese and their baggage, Sheriff John McGraw ordered the mob of committees to disperse and told Chinese residents {{that they were not}} obliged to leave. Although the Sheriff promised to protect the Chinese, many decided to leave rather than stay. On February 8, 97 Chinese boarded the Queen of the Pacific.

25|$|In {{addition}} to being authoritarian, Lee was accused of promoting a culture of elitism among Singapore's ruling class. Michael Barr in his book The Ruling Elite of Singapore: Networks of Influence and Power claims that the system of meritocracy in Singapore is not quite how the government presents it; rather, it is a system of nepotism and collusion run by Lee's family and their crony friends and allies. Barr claims further that although the government presents the city-state as multi-ethnic and cosmopolitan, all the networks are dominated by ethnic <b>Chinese,</b> <b>leaving</b> the minority Malay and Indian ethnic groups powerless.

The journey was perilous, the boat over-crowded. When they landed in Malaysia the boat sank in the surf. Malaysia sent them to an isolated island in Indonesia. From there Châu with a bribe got a telegram to Keyes Beech, a Los Angeles Times journalist in Bangkok. Finally, with help form Beech, {{they made their way}} to Singapore and a flight to Los Angeles.

50|$|The {{headline}} of the Tacoma Daily Ledger on November 4th, the {{day after}} the expulsion, read: “Gone! Two Hundred <b>Chinese</b> <b>Leave</b> the City--How the People's Request was Enforced.” On November 7th, a ball was held by Tacoma Turnverein, the city’s German society, to celebrate the actions of Mayor Weisbach and the Committee of Fifteen. That same day, Mayor Weisbach, the fire chief, and 25 others who were involved with the expulsion were indicted on felony conspiracy charges. This group would become known as the Tacoma Twenty-Seven. They were escorted to Vancouver, Washington Territory on the morning of November 9th. Community members cheered on the 27 as they left, and immediately began raising money for a legal fund. Each member of the Tacoma Twenty-Seven stated that they would plead not guilty. By the 12th, the 27 had posted bail and returned to Tacoma, where they were greeted with much fanfare. The trial of the 27 had been set for the first Monday of April in 1886.|$|R

50|$|Chinese {{people were}} the first Asians to settle in Seattle, {{arriving}} directly from China or via San Francisco in the 1860s. The majority of these immigrants came from the area around Guangzhou (Canton). They worked as fishermen, cannery and mill workers, miners, loggers, or domestic help. Later they worked on railroad construction and building projects. Initially welcomed because of the region's labor shortage, the Chinese later became resented as more white settlers arrived. This resentment was felt in other states as well, notably California, and in 1882 {{it led to the}} passage of the federal Chinese Exclusion Act. Racial tension in the Washington Territory came to a head in the 1880s during an economic recession. White workers, particularly mine workers, believed the Chinese workers were taking their jobs, and resorted to rioting and force to make the <b>Chinese</b> <b>leave.</b> The Seattle riot of 1886 led to the forced expulsion of some 350 Chinese men; many others left voluntarily. Other anti-Chinese riots in the area included the Tacoma riot of 1885 and the Attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers, 1885 in what is now Issaquah.

The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the survival of Chrysoperla carnea Stephens first instar larvae in the absence of its natural prey and its compatibility with the parasitoid Aphidius matricariae Hall in controlling aphids. C. carnea larvae survived 15 days longer and gained weight on <b>Chinese</b> cabbage <b>leaves.</b> Larvae fed for 8, 10 and 12 days on cabbage leaves produced normal adults after resumption of natural prey food. There were significant (P= 0. 001) differences in the developmental period, after the resumption of feeding with natural prey food, between the larvae allowed first to feed for different periods of time on <b>Chinese</b> cabbage <b>leaves.</b> This indicates that the predator can be released before the buildup of the pests in a biological control programme. Development and fecundity of C. carnea were much affected when the larvae were fed on aphids parasitized by A. matricariae. C. carnea and A. matricariae cannot be released together to control Myzus persicae Sulzer, because each one affects the other. C. carnea larvae fed on A. matricariae adults and parasitized aphids had adults with reduced fecundity.
