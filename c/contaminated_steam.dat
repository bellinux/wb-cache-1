This {{was compounded by}} hydrogen gas explosions and the venting of <b>contaminated</b> <b>steam</b> which released large amounts of radioactive material into the air.|$|E
50|$|These loops {{also have}} an {{important}} safety role because they constitute {{one of the primary}} barriers between the radioactive and non-radioactive sides of the plant as the primary coolant becomes radioactive from its exposure to the core. For this reason, the integrity of the tubing is essential in minimizing the leakage of water between the primary and secondary sides of the plant. Steam generator tubes often degrade over time. There is the potential that, if a tube bursts while a plant is operating, <b>contaminated</b> <b>steam</b> could escape directly to the secondary cooling loop. Thus during scheduled maintenance outages or shutdowns, {{some or all of the}} steam generator tubes are inspected by eddy-current testing, and individual tubes can be plugged to remove them from operation.|$|E

Most of the diseases outbreaks are reported due to exposure to contaminated water. Both solid waste and chemical mixture prove contaminant to water. Many {{drinking water and}} recreational water sources are reported nowadays with contamination of a particular strain of E. coli known as E. coli 0157 :H 7. Cattle or humans with 0157 :H 7 infection can <b>contaminate</b> <b>steams,</b> lakes, irrigation ditches or swimming pools with feaces.

50|$|As {{the tube}} ends get {{corroded}} {{there is the}} possibility of cooling water leakage to the <b>steam</b> side <b>contaminating</b> the condensed <b>steam</b> or condensate, which is harmful to steam generators. The other parts of water boxes may also get affected in the long run requiring repairs or replacements involving long duration shut-downs.|$|R
50|$|Underwater testing {{results from}} nuclear devices being detonated underwater, usually moored to a ship or a barge (which is {{subsequently}} {{destroyed by the}} explosion). Tests of this nature have usually been conducted to evaluate the effects of nuclear weapons against naval vessels (such as in Operation Crossroads), or to evaluate potential sea-based nuclear weapons (such as nuclear torpedoes or depth charges). Underwater tests {{close to the surface}} can disperse large amounts of radioactive particles in water and <b>steam,</b> <b>contaminating</b> nearby ships or structures, though they generally do not create fallout other than very local to the explosion.|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis of}} the radiological impact of removing and replacing corroded steam generators has been updated based on experience gained during steam generator repairs at Surry Unit 2. Some estimates of occupational doses involved in the operation have been revised but are {{not significantly different from}} the earlier estimates. Estimates of occupational doses and radioactive effluents for new tasks have been added. Health physics concerns that arose at Surry included the number of persons involved in the operation, tne training of workers, the handling of quantitites. of low-level waste, and the application of the ALARA principle. A review of these problem areas may help in the planning of other similar operations. A variety of processes could be used to decontaminate steam generators. Research is needed to assess these techniques and their associated occupational doses and waste volumes. <b>Contaminated</b> <b>steam</b> generators can be stored or disposed of after removal without significant radiological problems. Onsite storage and intact shipment have the least impact. In-placing retubing, an alternative to steam generator removal, results in occupational doses and effluents similar to those from removal, but prior decontamination of the channel head is needed. The retubing option should be assessed further...|$|E
40|$|High {{efficiency}} of rocket propul-sion systems {{is essential for}} humanity to venture be-yond the moon. Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) is a promising alternative to conventional chemical rock-ets with relatively high thrust and twice the {{efficiency of}} the Space Shuttle Main Engine. NASA is in the pro-cess of developing a new NTP engine, and is evaluat-ing ground test facility concepts that allow for the thor-ough testing of NTP devices. NTP engine exhaust, hot gaseous hydrogen, is nominally expected to be free of radioactive byproducts from the nuclear reactor; how-ever, {{it has the potential to}} be contaminated due to off-nominal engine reactor performance. Several options are being investigated to mitigate this hazard potential with one option in particular that completely contains the engine exhaust during engine test operations. The exhaust products are subsequently disposed of between engine tests. For this concept (see Figure 1), oxygen is injected into the high-temperature hydrogen exhaust that reacts to produce steam, excess oxygen and any trace amounts of radioactive noble gases released by off-nominal NTP engine reactor performance. Water is injected to condense the potentially <b>contaminated</b> <b>steam</b> into water. This water and the gaseous oxygen (GO 2) are subsequently passed to a containment area where the water and GO 2 are separated into separate containment tanks...|$|E
40|$|Direct cycle {{boiling water}} reactor (BWR) plants have {{redundant}} quick-acting isola-tion valves on each main steam line from the reactor to the turbine. In {{the event of a}} loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), any leakage of <b>contaminated</b> <b>steam</b> through these valves is controlled by a leakage control system. The leakage control system must satisfy the requirements of General Design Criteria 2, 4, and 54. The review of the main steam isolation valve leakage control system (MSIVLCS) covers the entire leakage control system including the source of the sealing medium, if any, and pumps, valves, and piping to the points of connection or interface with the main steam supply system. Emphasis is placed on the components of the leakage control system that are required to remain functional following a design basis LOCA. 1. ASB reviews the design of the MSIVLCS and essential subsystems to assure their ability to function following a postulated LOCA including the loss-. of offsite power. The system is reviewed to determine that: a. A malfunction or failure of an active component of the system, or loss of the source of sealing fluid, if any, will not impair the functional j performance of the system. b. The failure of nonseismic Category I equipment or components will not have an adverse effect on the ability of the system or components to function. c. The capability of the system to perform its intended safety function is maintained assuming a single active failure of a main steam line isola-tion valve...|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the design changes placed on the ship mid-construction, the Omaha that entered the water in 1920 was a badly {{overloaded}} design that, even at the beginning, had been rather tight. The ships were insufficiently insulated, too hot in the tropics and too cold in the north. Sacrifices in weight savings in the name of increased speed led to severe compromise in the habitability of the ship. While described as a good ship in a seaway, the low freeboard led to frequent water ingestion over the bow and in the torpedo compartments and lower aft casements. The lightly built hulls leaked, so that sustained high-speed <b>steaming</b> <b>contaminated</b> the oil tanks with sea water.|$|R
40|$|Decontamination {{of field}} {{equipment}} {{is necessary to}} ensure the quality of samples by preventing cross-contamination. In addition, decontamination reduces health hazards and prevents the spread of contaminants off-site. Equipment needed: Large/heavy Equipment (i. e., Drill rigs, backhoes, augers, drill pipe, bits, casing, and screen) : High-pressure pump with steam-spray unit. Stiff-bristle brushes. Small/sampling Equipment (i. e., Split spoons, bailers, bowls, and pumps) : Soap Polyethylene sheeting Stiff-bristle brushes. Wash bottles or manual pump sprayer. 10 % methanol solution (optional) Distilled water Tap water Procedure. The following steps will be followed when decontaminating large/heavy equipment: 1. The drilling contractor will construct a decontamination area at a designated area on site of 6 -mil polyethylene, large enough to capture decontamination fluids. Decontamination of drilling equipment will be performed over the decontamination pad. Depending on site contaminants, drilling equipment may be decontaminated at each drilling location and decon water allowed to infiltrate into site soils. 2. Drill rigs and tools will be cleaned between each location and prior to the initiation of any sampling. Steam-cleaning/pressure washing water will be allowed to soak back into the ground. 3. Spray areas (rear of rig or backhoe) exposed to <b>contaminated</b> soils using <b>steam</b> or high-pressure sprayer. Be sure to spray down all surfaces, including the undercarriage. 4.

5000|$|In 1882 he {{introduced}} {{his concept of}} an impulse steam turbine and in 1887 built a small steam turbine to demonstrate that such devices could be constructed on that scale. In 1890 Laval developed a nozzle to increase the steam jet to supersonic speed, working off the kinetic energy of the steam, rather than its pressure. The nozzle, now known as a de Laval nozzle, is used in modern rocket engine nozzles. De Laval turbines can run at up to 30,000 rpm. The turbine wheel was mounted on a long flexible shaft, its two bearings spaced far apart on either side. The higher speed of the turbine demanded that he also design new approaches to reduction gearing, which are still in use today. Since the materials {{available at the time}} were not strong enough for the immense centrifugal forces, the output from the turbine was limited, and large scale electric steam generators were dominated by designs using the alternative compound steam turbine approach of Charles Parsons. [...] Using high pressure steam in a turbine that had oil-fed bearings meant that some of the <b>steam</b> <b>contaminated</b> the lube-oil, and as a result, perfecting commercial steam-turbines required that he also develop an effective oil/water separator. After trying several methods, he concluded that a centrifugal separator was the most affordable and effective method. He developed several types, and their success established the centrifugal separator as a useful device in a variety of applications.|$|R
40|$|Summary:This thesis {{presents}} the technology qualification {{plan for the}} integrated gasification {{combined cycle power plant}} (IGCC) with carbon dioxide capture based on DNV recommendations. Objectives of the thesis work were development of a qualification plan, heat balance, material balance and performance characteristics for IGCC with CO 2 capture. GT PRO software by thermoflow was used for the development of heat balance, material balance and performance characteristics of power plant. IGCC with pre-combustion capture is a process of generating power with very low CO 2 emissions. The IGCC process gasifies coal to a syngas, converts the CO to CO 2 in the shift reactors, separates the CO 2 in the capture subsystem, and the resulting fuel is used for the gas turbine (GT) in a combined cycle setup. A comparison is also made between the enriched air blown gasification combined cycle power plant with CO 2 capture and shell gasification combined cycle power plant with CO 2 capture. For the case of this thesis, technology qualification steps obtained from DNV guidelines are implemented on the enriched air blown integrated gasification power plant with CO 2 capture. First step of the technology qualification was to establish a qualification basis for the IGCC power plant with CO 2 capture. In this step detailed process description of power plant is done in order to define what technology should do and what its functional requirements are?Next step of the technology qualification was technology assessment. The main purpose of this step was to divide the IGCC power plant with CO 2 capture into manageable elements that involve the aspects of new technology and identify key challenges and uncertainties associated with those novel elements. Threat assessment was the third step in the technology qualification. Risks and failure modes associated with the commercialization of IGCC with CO 2 capture are identified by applying risk assessment techniques like (Failure Mode Effect & Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and Hazard and Operability Analysis (Hazop). Analysis of variance was used in order to give priority to more critical failure modes. Faiure modes like surge problem of gas turbine,fouling,metal dusting and tube vibration for the heat exchanger, deactivation of catalyst for shift reactor, maldistribution of the solvent for the absorber, <b>contaminated</b> supply of <b>steam</b> to steam turbine have been identified. Qualification plans were developed for the identified failure modes of concern obtained from FMECA and Hazop analysis. The main objective of this step was to select qualification activities that adequately address the identified failure modes of concern with respect to its risk and determination of sufficient performance margins. Activities like integration of gas turbine to air separation unit, chemical treatment of water in order to avoid contaminated supply of water to HRSG and <b>contaminated</b> supply of <b>steam</b> to steam turbine, better understanding of distributor design and packing development for the absorber were suggested. After the selection of these qualification activities, execution of selected qualification activities was done in a systematic manner to document performance margins for the failure modes of concern. Last step of the technology qualification plan was concept improvement. The objective of the concept improvement step was to implement improvements that have been found necessary or beneficial during the failure mode identification and risk ranking or in the performance assessment. The focus of this work was to reduce uncertainties in these parameters in order to improve the confidence in the IGCC power plant with CO 2 capture...|$|R
