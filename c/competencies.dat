PurposeTo measure <b>competency</b> for public health practice at baseline, identify factors associated with higher <b>competency,</b> document change in <b>competency</b> over 4 years, and assess differential effects associated with project participation. MethodsPerceived <b>competency</b> was assessed using a validated instrument administered through online surveys at baseline (2007) and 4 -year follow-up (2011). Analysis was completed in 2014. Overall means and SDs were calculated for each domain in the <b>competency</b> scale. Differences in means by role were tested using multivariate analysis of variance. Factors associated with higher <b>competency</b> were identified using regression analysis. Mean comparisons between baseline and follow-up were tested using paired samples t test and ANCOVA {{was used to test}} differential effects of project participation. ResultsBaseline <b>competency</b> levels were low in most domains. Managers reported higher <b>competency</b> in all domains compared to staff. Mean scores in all domains were higher on follow-up than baseline. Factors associated with higher <b>competency</b> in some domains included expected frequency of performance, higher degree, and younger age. Participants in project activities had higher mean <b>competency</b> scores than those who did not, with statistically significant differences (p< 0. 05) observed in four of nine domains.
