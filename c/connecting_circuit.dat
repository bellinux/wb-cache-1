However, the increasing requirements for the mechanical rigidity, load-carrying capacity, mass-size and speed parameters caused {{the need to develop}} a new classes of manipulation robots with a parallel <b>connecting</b> <b>circuit.</b> The closed kinematic scheme of such manipulators provides a more higher rigidity of the entire structure. The reduced mass of moving parts reduces the load on electric drives and thus provides an increase in manipulator gripper dynamics and the accuracy of positioning.

The problems of planning the trajectory of manipulator gripper with a parallel structure and flexible links are considered within the paper...|$|E

It is newly found that the performance degradation due to the body effect in series <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> is suppressed by utilizing VTCMOS. Lowering the threshold voltage (Vth) enhances the drive current and alleviates the degradation due to the series connected configuration. Therefore, larger body effect factor (γ) results in lower Vth and higher on-current even in the series <b>connected</b> <b>circuits.</b> These characteristics are attributed to the velocity saturation phenomenon which reduces the drain saturation voltage (Vdsat).

30|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{wireless}} communications {{as well as the}} use of ubiquitous technology has led to a dramatic increase of interest in the design and fabrication of miniaturized RF/microwave devices [1]. In particular, planar devices such as patch antennas and planar band-pass filters have attracted attention for their high frequency integrated circuits [2 – 4]. Therefore, the study of metallic materials and metallization processes is necessary to meet the strong need for planar device technology. Copper is a desirable material for <b>connecting</b> <b>circuit</b> elements of integrated circuits with submicron features because of their low resistivity, high thermal conductivity, and low coefficient of resistance [5, 6]. As techniques for Cu deposition, electroless deposition, electroplating, and chemical vapor deposition have usually been used as metallization processes. However, these processes have some environmental problems, such as the toxic wastewater and chemicals generated from the manufacturing and rinsing processes [7 – 10]. To solve these problems, an environmentally friendly and dry metallization process with no chemical solutions is required.|$|E
40|$|In many fluidic digital circuits, {{the control}} signals are {{transmitted}} through a transmission line as either step or pulse signals. In this case, the unexpected transient phenomena from only the static characteristics of devices occur often {{due to the}} operating conditions. And this may cause false operation of the circuit. In this paper, using a graphical method for the transmission line, we investigate the dynamic characteristics (switching delay time etc.) of connecting circuits of two wall attachment devices. In the graphical method, we assume the lossless line for simplicity. Some experiments were carried with laboratory devices and the commercially available devices (CORNING devices). The effects of the supply pressure of devices and the dimensions of transmission line (length and inner diameter) on the switching characteristics of driven device were investigated. And these results were compared with the predicted results by the graphical method. The experimental results can be explained well by the graphical solution. Thus, when the static characteristics of devices are given, this graphical method can easily predict the dynamic characteristics of <b>connecting</b> <b>circuit</b> of the devices for a given operating conditions or decide the optimal operating condition for a given devices...|$|E

Such test fixture has probes made as two separated flatcontact lands {{that can be}} used for testing BGA/CSP components or microelectromechanical devices. Only in case, when two parts of probe contact lands are pressed to according lead of electronic component, electrical circuit between them closes. This fact confirms presence of contact between testing fixture probe and tested lead of BGA device and can be considered as way of testing reliability increasing. Due to the proposed new form of contact probe for electronic component testing it became possible to simplify the topology of <b>connecting</b> <b>circuit</b> board. Developed commutative board with ZIF connectors allows realizing multiprobe device connection to automated measuring systems, providing also the possibility of its future application to test other electronic components with more leads.

40|$|The {{continuous}} miniaturization {{of integrated}} circuits {{has opened the}} path towards System-on-Chip realizations. Process shrinking into the nanometer regime improves transistor performancewhile the delay of global interconnects, <b>connecting</b> <b>circuit</b> blocks separated by a long distance, significantly increases. In fact, global interconnects extending across a full chip can have a delay corresponding to multiple clock cycles. At the same time, global clock skew constraints, not only between blocks but also along the pipelined interconnects, become even tighter. On-chip interconnects have always been considered RC-like, that is exhibiting long RC-delays. This has motivated large efforts on alternatives such as on-chip optical interconnects, which {{have not yet been}} demonstrated, or complex schemes utilizing on-chip F-transmission or pulsed current-mode signaling. In this thesis, we show that well-designed electrical global interconnects, behaving as transmission lines, have the capacity of very high data rates (higher than can be delivered by the actual process) and support near velocity-of-light delay for single-ended voltage-mode signaling, thus mitigating the RC-problem. We critically explore key interconnect performance measures such as data delay, maximum data rate, crosstalk, edge rates and power dissipation. To experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and superior properties of on-chip transmission line interconnects, we have designed and fabricated a test chip carrying a 5 mm long global communication link. Measurements show that we can achieve 3 Gb/s/wire over the 5 mm long, repeaterless on-chip bus implemented in a standard 0. 18 μm CMOS process, achieving a signal velocity of 1 / 3 of the velocity of light in vacuum. To manage the problems due to global wire delays, we describe and implement a Synchronous Latency Insensitive Design (SLID) scheme, based on source-synchronous data transfer between blocks and data re-timing at the receiving block. The SLIDtechnique not onlymitigates unknown globalwire delays, but also removes the need for controlling global clock skew. The high-performance and high robustness capability of the SLID-method is practically demonstrated through a successful implementation of a SLID-based, 5. 4 mm long, on-chip global bus, supporting 3 Gb/s/wire and dynamically accepting ± 2 clock cycles of data-clock skew, in a standard 0. 18 μm CMOS porcess. In the context of technology scaling, there is a tendency for interconnects to dominate chip power dissipation due to their large total capacitance. In this thesis we address the problem of interconnect power dissipation by proposing and analyzing a transition-energy cost model aimed for efficient power estimation of performancecritical buses. The model, which includes properties that closely capture effects present in high-performance VLSI buses, can be used to more accurately determine the energy benefits of e. g. transition coding of bus topologies. We further show a power optimization scheme based on appropriate choice of reduced voltage swing of the interconnect and scaling of receiver amplifier. Finally, the power saving impact of swing reduction in combination with a sense-amplifying flip-flop receiver is shown on a microprocessor cache bus architecture used in industry...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} new simulation and analytic models for the performance analysis of wide area communication networks. The models are used to analyse adaptive routing and flow control in fully <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> switched and sparsely connected packet switched networks. In particular the performance of routing algorithms derived from the L(_R-I) linear learning automata model are assessed for both types of network. A novel architecture using the INMOS Transputer is constructed for simulation of both circuit and packet switched networks in a loosely coupled multi- microprocessor environment. The network topology is mapped onto an identically configured array of processing centres to overcome the processing bottleneck of conventional Von Neumann architecture machines. Previous analytic work in circuit switched work is extended to include both asymmetrical networks and adaptive routing policies. In the analysis of packet switched networks analytic models of adaptive routing and flow control are integrated to produce a powerful, integrated environment for performance analysis The work concludes that routing algorithms based on linear learning automata have significant potential in both fully <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> switched networks and sparsely connected packet switched networks...|$|R
