30|$|In {{our study}} RBC levels were {{higher in the}} {{subjects}} with GS compared to the healthy controls. Wallner et al. showed a positive correlation between unconjugated bilirubin and free heme, iron and <b>carboxy</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> which might be the result of a positive feedback loop of heme oxygenase induction mediated by unconjugated bilirubin (Wallner et al. 2013). Similarly, bone marrow can be stimulated by high amounts of iron, free heme and <b>carboxy</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> which have been released from the hemolytic process in the subjects with GS in our study. Therefore, because of the activation of bone marrow the RBC levels might be higher in the GS group.|$|E
40|$|The optical {{transient}} {{absorption spectra}} at 30 ps and 6. 5 ns after photolysis are compared for both <b>carboxy</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> (HbCO) and carboxy myoglobin (MbCO). Both 355 - and 532 -nm excitation pulses were used. In all cases {{the shapes of}} the optical difference spectra thus generated are stationary over the complete time-scale studied. The photolysis spectra for MbCO are not significantly different from the equilibrium difference spectra generated on the same picosecond spectrometer when measured to an accuracy of +/- 0. 5 nm. In addition, spectral parameters for delegated HbCO generated on the same spectrometer but detected by two different techniques, either by a Vidicon detector or point by point with photomultiplier tubes, are reported; the results are different from some of the previously reported picosecond experiments...|$|E
40|$|JURNAL MASYARAKAT EPIDEMIOLOGI INDONESIAABSTRACT Carbon {{monoxide}} gas is colorless, tasteless, odorless, non-irritating, {{difficult to}} detect, toxic gas {{that can cause}} respiratory distress and death (silent killer),carbon monoxide exposure in the workplace is the most commonly experienced effects on workers (IAPA, 2008). The research aims to analyze the relationship between risk factor exposure of carbon monoxide (CO) with levels of carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) in indoor parking officer at MTC Karebosi Makassar. This type of research is observational analytic with cross sectional study design. Population and study sample is the entire parking officer {{who worked in the}} indoor parking area at Makassar Trade Center (MTC) with a total of 101 parking officer by exchaustive sampling techniques. Collecting data through interviews with questionnaires and observation. COHb levels in blood obtained through a parking officer based laboratory test results using a spectrophotometer. Bivariate analysis using Chi - Square to assess the association of risk factors exposure carbon monoxide (CO) on levels of carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) and then performed a multivariate analysis to assess the most influential variables. The results showed that age, month of working and nutritional status are not associated with COHb levels of indoor parking officer at MTC Karebosi Makassar (p> 0. 05), while smoking status (p = 0. 001) and levels of CO in air (p = 0. 031) associated with COHb levels of covered parking officer at MTC Karebosi Makassar. Smoking status is the most influential factor to the increased levels of COHb. Concluded that smoking status and levels of CO in the air associated with COHb levels of indoor parking officer at MTC Karebosi Makassar. Management and control of the air duct system on a regular basis in the indoor parking area is recommended to do in risk factor controlling air pollution by carbon monoxide.

40|$|Pathology in {{sickle cell}} disease begins with nucleation-dependent {{polymerization}} of deoxyhemoglobin S into stiff, rodlike fibers that deform and rigidify red cells. We have measured the effect of erythrocyte membranes on the rate of homogeneous nucleation in sickle hemoglobin, using preparations of open ghosts (OGs) with intact cytoskeletons from sickle (SS) and normal adult (AA) red cells. Nucleation rates were measured by inducing polymerization by laser photolysis of <b>carboxy</b> sickle <b>hemoglobin</b> and observing stochastic variation of replicate experiments of {{the time for the}} scattering signals to reach 10 % of their respective maxima. By optical imaging of membrane fragments added to a hemoglobin solution we contrast the rate of nucleation immediately adjacent to membrane fragments with nucleation in a region of the same solution but devoid of membranes. From analysis of 29, 272 kinetic curves obtained, we conclude that the effect of AA OGs is negligible (10 % enhancement of nucleation rates ± 20 %), whereas SS OGs caused 80 % enhancement (± 20 %). In red cells, where more membrane surface is available to Hb, this implies enhancement of nucleation by a factor of 6. These experiments represent a 10 -fold improvement in precision over previous approaches and are the first direct, quantitative measure of the impact of erythrocyte membranes on the homogeneous nucleation process that is responsible for polymer initiation in {{sickle cell disease}}...|$|R
