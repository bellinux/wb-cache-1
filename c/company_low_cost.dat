Currently, this operation is performed with the Coated Electrode Process, of inherent lower productivity. The semi-mechanized, slag free process herein developed (CCC) yields satisfactory properties root welds with higher productivity. Given the significant influence of the welding process over the chronogram, and then over the elevated construction costs, R&D on this technology is highly justifiable, since the aim is make it available to national <b>companies</b> at <b>low</b> <b>cost,</b> increasing their competitiveness in a globalized marketplace as the oil sector.

40|$|The {{altitude}} range between 120 and 300 km is relatively unexplored {{with regard to}} space weather, atmospheric models, climate observations, the global electric circuit, remote sensing, and intelligence gathering. This {{altitude range}} is not conducive to in situ measurements due to the high magnitudes of drag that are experienced by satellites at these altitudes. The concept of air-breathing propulsion systems have been proposed to counteract drag. These propulsion systems produce thrust through electrostatic propulsion by ionizing the background neutral atmospheric particles. The atmospheric neutral particles that are the cause of drag at these altitudes are used as the fuel source for these air-breathing thrusters. Systems have been conceptually designed for larger satellites, but in this work we show that is possible for CubeSats to employ similar systems. CubeSats are a relatively new technology that have allowed <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> satellites to be built {{by a variety of}} entities including universities and private <b>companies</b> at <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> and with rapid development cycles. Due to current restrictions, CubeSats are not allowed to carry propellant. This limits CubeSats from maneuvering, formation flying, orbit raising, drag make-up, and deorbiting. However, this has not prevented the study and design of propulsion systems for CubeSats, with the anticipation of the propellant restrictions being lifted. In this research, a concept for an air-breathing ion thruster is designed for the use in 3 U, 6 U, 12 U, and 27 U CubeSats. The design is created to be modular to this system, and each component is discussed separately. An analysis is conducted to determine the best inlet shape for capturing atmospheric particles. This analysis is conducted using a 3 D Monte Carlo simulator. The ionization of atmospheric particles is investigated, and issues with ionization of the particles given the design of the system are discussed. Based on the expected inlet capture efficiency and ionization efficiency, the thrust capabilities of the system are projected for the various CubeSat standard sizes in LEO altitudes (80 km to 600 km). Analysis of the thrust based on CubeSat size, voltage, solar activity, and ionization efficiency is also conducted herein. This work shows {{that it is possible to}} build air-breathing propulsion systems for CubeSats with thrust exceeding the local drag in LEO altitudes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} outsourcing {{of different types}} of logistics activities in Taiwanese food industry, and benchmark with practices in The Netherlands. Design/methodology/approach – The outsourcing of four levels of logistics activities is investigated: transportation (level 1), packaging (level 2), transportation management (level 3), and distribution network management (level 4). A structured questionnaire was designed and sent to logistics managers in The Netherlands and Taiwan to evaluate the most commonly outsourced activities and identify specific outsourcing firm's characteristics. Findings – About 69 per cent of the companies, in both countries outsource level 1 activities, 16 per cent level 2, and 37 per cent level 3 activities. Only few companies (about 10 per cent) outsource the highest level of activities. In particular, The Netherlands has higher percentages for levels 1 and 3. This might be caused by the fact that most Taiwanese <b>companies</b> emphasise <b>low</b> <b>cost</b> whereas the Dutch companies focus on flexibility {{in order to deal with}} higher complexities. When intentions for the future are included, Taiwan is planning to outsource level 2 (40 per cent) and level 4 activities (36 per cent) much more than The Netherlands (respectively 13 and 17 per cent). When zooming in, it was found that outsourcing strategies of companies in the subsectors differ. For instance, the dairy sector outsources more frequently than the meat sector on the first three levels. This might be caused by the fact that meat companies emphasise food quality, whereas dairy companies emphasise flexibility and reliability. Research limitations/implications – This study investigated only food processors. The paper suggests further research should include other types of food organisations. Originality/value – The paper provides valuable insights in outsourcing strategies of food processing companies in Taiwan and The Netherlands for advanced logistics service providers who are looking at the market potential of Taiwan...|$|R
