40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years, {{pharmaceutical}} coating {{has gone through}} the transition from sugar coating to organic solvent coating and aqueous coating. Since the 1990 s, aqueous coating has largely phased out organic solvent coating as the dominate coating method for pharmaceutical dosage forms due to the toxicity and environmental related concerns caused by the organic solvents. On the other hand, although prevailing, aqueous coating has other major limitations such as higher energy consumption and longer processing time than the solvent <b>coating.</b> <b>Powder</b> <b>coating</b> has the benefits of both, being environmentally friendly, energy efficient and short processing time, while equally effective in modifying drug release profiles. Consequently, <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> is pointing to the future as the next breakthrough in pharmaceutical coating. Involving three steps including preheating of the dosage forms, electrostatic deposition of <b>coating</b> <b>powders</b> and film formation (curing), <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> has been studied to tablet coating with easily coated polymers. The objectives {{of the present study}} are to expand <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> to more difficult coating materials such as ethylcellulose and cellulose acetate, as well as more difficult dosage forms including small pellets, and in particular, osmotic controlled release tablets. As a water-insoluble polymer, ethylcellulose (EC) is a commonly used coating material for sustained drug release. However, {{it is very difficult to}} <b>coat</b> by <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> due to its high glass transition temperature (Tg). The present study was successful to coat tablets with fine particles of EC in a rotatable pan coater. With the proper addition of plasticizers, a continuous and uniform coating film was formed. Pore forming agent was added in the coating formulation to adjust the permeability of the coating film to allow a more controlled drug release rate. Currently, small pellets are coated by solvent coating or aqueous coating in a fluidized bed with a larger amount of fluidizing hot air than a pan coater, leading to an extremely high energy consumption. The present study utilized the pan coater instead of a fluidized bed to coat small pellets with <b>powder</b> <b>coating,</b> leading to a significant energy savings by avoiding the use of large amount of fluidizing hot air required to fluidize those pellets and to evaporate the organic solvent or water. Three different coating formulations containing Eudragit® EPO, Eudragit® RS/RL and Acryl EZE were developed to achieve immediate release, sustained release and delayed release, respectively. Particularly, as the only oral drug delivery system capable of achieving constant drug release rate, osmotic drug delivery system (ODDS) is considered as the ultimate ideal drug delivery system. However, only organic solvent coating can be currently used to coat ODDS due to the high Tg of the coating materials. The present study successfully applied <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> to coat ODDS with cellulose acetate (CA), resulting in a continuous, uniform and functionally acceptable coating film. Both elementary and porosity ODDS were achieved by using this <b>powder</b> <b>coating.</b> Following zero order drug release kinetics, drug release rate from <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> ODDS varied with different coating levels while was independent with other factors such as drug delivery orifice diameter, pH vale of the release media and agitation speed. Considering that ODDS is the most promising controlled drug release system, the success of <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> ODDS is a big breakthrough in pharma coating. To fully illustrate the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> process, in-depth characterization was carried out to investigate the <b>coating</b> <b>powder</b> deposition and film formation, and their influence factors. Positively related to the <b>coating</b> efficiency, <b>powder</b> deposition was found to be the key of the whole process, which can be promoted by preheating the dosage forms, spraying suitable liquid plasticizer and applying electrostatics for the powder spray. A curing step is necessary after <b>coating</b> <b>powder</b> adhesion to allow deposited particles to coalesce and form a continuous coating film.

As compared with the sample prepared with co-precipitated method, which exhibited a similar grain size distribution, the EDS analysis revealed that the powder coating induced a wide distribution of CeO 2 solubility, which decreases monotonically {{with the increase of}} grain size. This variation of stabilizer content from grain to grain rendered many large grains in the monoclinic phase.

Film properties like continuity, permeability, and mechanical resistance depend on the choice of the excipients included in the formulation and the operating conditions which can modify the constraints generated at the interface film-powder. As a consequence, the scientific issue consists of combining the local phenomena happening at amicroscopic level on the surface of the particle with the processing technology and the process parameters. In a first step, the attention is focussed on the film and its formulation. For this step, films are prepared separately and they are dried under very smooth conditions. Test samples are taken from the formed composite films and contain hydroxypropyl methylcellulose asmatrix (67 % of driedmaterial),micronised stearic acid as hydrophobic filler (20 % of driedmaterial) and a plasticizer (13 % of driedmaterial). The filmformation procedure and the testmethod are described in detail. The effect of the type of plasticizer (different grades of PEG) onmechanical, thermal and permeability properties of the coating film is studied. The results show that PEG with higher molecular rate provides a better plasticizing effect for the film but increases the water vapour permeability of the film...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{process is}} {{demonstrated}} which {{is able to}} produce porous structures with internal coatings. This is achieved using sacrificial porogens which are <b>coated</b> with a <b>powder</b> and which are then infiltrated by compression moulding using a molten polymer. The <b>coating</b> <b>powder</b> is transferred to the pore and multi-material or compositionally-gradient coatings are produced. The interconnectivity of the porous structure is reduced when the pores are coated, but can be increased by reducing the degree of powder coverage of the porogen...|$|R

The results showed that the utilization of a previous hydrolysis process could reduce aggregation between core particles in the starting solution and that few little agglomerates appeared during the coating process.
