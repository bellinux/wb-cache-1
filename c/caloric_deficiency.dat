40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} obesity and the obesity-associated morbidities represent {{one of the major}} health problems of the western society. This has renewed interest in our understanding of factors that control appetite. The 28 amino acid peptide may represent one of the key players in the regulation of food intake since it is the only circulating orexigenic peptide. Ghrelin not only acts as a hunger signal but also as an adiposity signal. These effects are influenced by the internal energy status and can be considered as homeostatic signals. In addition ghrelin has direct effects on components of the reward system and increases the appetitive value of food. This hedonic feeding behavior of ghrelin can be considered as a non-homeostatic signal as it occurs in the absence of nutritional or <b>caloric</b> <b>deficiency</b> In this review we address how these signals, elicited by ghrelin, can powerfully augment the drive to eat. Better understanding of the mechanisms by which ghrelin exerts its effect may enable the development of new treatments for obesity but also for conditions of cachexia. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Out of {{the chaos}} of W. W. II emerged three United Nations agencies-FAO, WHO, and Unicef-endowed with the joint {{responsibility}} to help conquer hunger and malnutrition. Seminal nutritional research before the war along with idealistic policy makers and nutritionists afterwards {{set the stage for}} the first international initiatives to address nutritional issues in developing countries. This dissertation relies mainly on an array of primary sources and oral histories to elucidate the evolving position of nutrition in FAO, WHO, and Unicef. Nutritionists at the UN agencies, research institutes, the UN agency-supported Protein Advisory Group, and expert committees contributed substantially to the shape and focus of international nutrition policies. Alongside developments in nutritional science, administrators at FAO, WHO, and Unicef implemented complementary policy changes. During the early- 1950 s, nutritionists began applying lessons learned from the treatment and prevention of malnutrition during W. W. II to recently discovered nutritional problems in developing countries. Consequently, the agency plans for the developing countries usually entailed dried skim milk distribution and production projects since these had been successful in Europe. Throughout the 1950 s and 1960 s nutritionists concentrated on protein malnutrition and its clinical manifestation, kwashiorkor. <b>Caloric</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> which in severe cases led to marasmus, were of secondary importance as was emerging knowledge about the complex interactions of nutrition and infection. The apparent prevalence of protein malnutrition led nutritionists to draw attention to pre-school children and to develop high-protein dietary supplements. Agency policies reflected these developments and emphasized nutrition education projects, supplementary food distribution, and other schemes designed to tangibly impact nutritional status, especially of children. The lack of progress against global hunger and malnutrition inspired the agencies during the late- 1960 s and 1970 s to promote national development plans that prioritized the nutritional needs of the population. During the same period, many nutritionists drew attention to the declining protein intake of the poor and called for monumental efforts to increase protein production and availability. Although nutrition policies initially took note of this protein deficit, within a few years the nutritionists' fears were considered to have been reactionary. As a result of this and the largely uneven results of nutrition policies, the administrators tired of the influence of the nutritionists and created a new hierarchy that placed nutritionists lower on the ladder of power. Toward the end of the 1970 s, nutritional enterprises lost their singular importance and were increasingly integrated with primary health care endeavours...|$|R
40|$|As {{is evident}} from current {{military}} operations that are happening around the globe (e. g., Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea), today’s military is being called on in numerous new and innovative ways (e. g., Foster 2 ̆ 6 Lindsay, 2011). One of the primary forces behind this change is the pervasiveness of enhanced information systems. In fact, the concept of networked warfare {{is the basis of}} operations and doctrine for the armed forces (Wesensten, Belenky, 2 ̆ 6 Balkin, 2005). With respect to Admiral Cebrowski’s quote, it appears that this notion of information in warfare {{is going to continue to}} influence the way that we approach and conduct war for the foreseeable future. While this use of information and information systems have been used successfully in recent operations (Cammons, Tisserand, Williams, Seise, 2 ̆ 6 Lindsay, 2006), it must always be considered with respect to the operational context. This context is made up of the military’s primary weapon system (the individual solider) and the features of the operational environment in which they are expected to perform. Within the context of current military operations, the individual combatant is experiencing demands never before seen by predecessors. While deployments and warfare are certainly not new to military personnel, expectations regarding the use and processing of information during these operations is at an unprecedented level. These changing expectations regarding information processing have virtually transformed the soldier into a ‘‘cognitive platform’’. While this platform is certainly the most capable the world has ever seen, there are factors which limit this platform’s warfighting capability. These include such factors as nutritional or <b>caloric</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> dehydration, psychological stressors, carrying excessive loads, and hypothermia (Lieberman et al., 2005; Meyerhoff et al., 2000; Wesensten et al., 2005). Another key factor is sleep. While sleep is a basic physiological need that is usually regulated by the individual, in a military environment conditions often dictate how much sleep is obtained (and the quality of that sleep), independent of the individual military member’s personal needs or desires. Somewhat absent, however, is a critical examination of the impact of sleep loss on this 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 cognitive platform in today’s military environment. While some research has been done to address pieces of this issue (Wesensten et al., 2005), there are still many gaps that remain. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to briefly examine what is known about the effects of sleep and predict the implications of restricted sleep and sleep loss in this informationally-enhanced environment. In order to do this, three areas need to be examined in greater detail: the current operational military environment, the amount of sleep required, and sleep loss and its subsequent effects on cognitive functioning and resulting decision making in such an environment. Finally, implications in light of this information and attempts at mitigation are suggested...|$|R
50|$|Mycotoxicosis is {{the term}} used for {{poisoning}} associated with exposures to mycotoxins. The symptoms of mycotoxicosis depend {{on the type of}} mycotoxin; the concentration and length of exposure; as well as age, health, and sex of the exposed individual. The synergistic effects associated with several other factors such as genetics, diet, and interactions with other toxins have been poorly studied. Therefore, it is possible that vitamin <b>deficiency,</b> <b>caloric</b> deprivation, alcohol abuse, and infectious disease status can all have compounded effects with mycotoxins. In turn, mycotoxins have the potential for both acute and chronic health effects via ingestion, skin contact, and inhalation. These toxins can enter the blood stream and lymphatic system; they inhibit protein synthesis, damage macrophage systems, inhibit particle clearance of the lung, and increase sensitivity to bacterial endotoxin.|$|R
40|$|Forty Cape Coloured {{children}} who had been hospitalized for kwashiorkor in infancy were compared with their siblings on an intelligence test battery at the 10 th year of follow-up. No significant differences in intelligence test performance were noted. A significant discrepancy between the intelligence test score and the drawing score on late onset cases may be due to affective factors. The groups were similar in terms of height, weight and head circumference. The differences between well-nourished and poorly nourished groups found by previous investigators may be accounted for by the independent operation of non-nutritive variables in the social and emotional environment. The use of intra-familial controls in the present study minimised these influences as well as possible genetic factors in intellectual development. Kwashiorkor is a protein calorie nutritional disease which occurs typically in {{children under the age of}} 2 years. The disease was recognised in the early 1930 's, but only later was the nutritional aetiology realised. Today, kwashiorkor is regarded as a well-defined syndrome representing one pole of the broad clinical spectrum of nutritional disease referred to as protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM). In contrast to marasmus which represents the opposite end of the continuum, the <b>caloric</b> <b>deficiency</b> in kwashiorkor is not as severe as is the protein deficiency. The idea that kwashiorkor may affect the intellectual development of the child is suggested by the marked apathy during the acute stage of the disease...|$|E
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{mechanism}} for the well-known increase in microvascular permeability that occurs with diabetes mellitus, we investigated capillary permeability to albumin in diabetic rat myocardium by electron microscopy using albumin-gold (Alb-Au) complexes as a tracer. Diabetes was induced by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin. After 24 - 32 weeks, hearts from diabetic rats and age-matched control rats were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing Alb-Au for 5 or 20 minutes and then fixed and processed for electron microscopy. The binding and transport of Alb-Au by capillary endothelium was quantitatively evaluated. In control rats, Alb-Au particles were found preferentially bound to the luminal plasmalemmal vesicles. In diabetic rats, the labeling of luminal vesicles was more extensive and more pronounced after 5 minutes of perfusion when compared with control vesicles. The plasma membrane proper was also heavily labeled in diabetic rats. After 20 minutes, Alb-Au particles were transported across the capillary endothelium via plasmalemmal vesicles, {{but they did not}} penetrate the intercellular junctions in either control or diabetic rats. The vesicular transport of Alb-Au across the capillary endothelium was significantly increased in the diabetic myocardium when compared with control myocardium (percentage of abluminal labeled vesicles, 25. 9 ± 5. 5 % versus 1. 3 ± 0. 5 %; p< 0. 01). The study on food-restricted rats with body weights close to those of diabetic rats suggested that <b>caloric</b> <b>deficiency</b> alone did not have much effec...|$|E
40|$|Astronauts consume fewer {{calories}} during spaceflight {{and return to}} earth with {{an increased risk of}} orthostatic intolerance. Whether a <b>caloric</b> <b>deficiency</b> modifies orthostatic responses is not understood. Thus, we determined the effects of a hypocaloric diet (25 % caloric restriction) during 6 ° head down bedrest (an analog of spaceflight) on autonomic neural control during lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Nine healthy young men completed a randomized crossover bedrest study, consisting of four (2 weeks each) interventions (normocaloric bedrest, normocaloric ambulatory, hypocaloric bedrest, hypocaloric ambulatory), each separated by 5 months. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was recorded at baseline following normocaloric and hypocaloric interventions. Heart rate (HR) and arterial pressure were recorded before, during, and after 3 consecutive stages (7 min each) of LBNP (- 15, - 30, - 45 mmHg). Caloric and posture effects during LBNP were compared using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. There was a strong trend toward reduced basal MSNA following caloric restriction alone (normcaloric vs. hypocaloric: 22 ± 3 vs. 14 ± 4 burst/min, p = 0. 06). Compared to the normocaloric ambulatory, both bedrest and caloric restriction were associated with lower systolic blood pressure during LBNP (p< 0. 01); however, HR responses were directionally opposite (i. e., increase with bedrest, decrease with caloric restriction). Survival analysis revealed a significant reduction in orthostatic tolerance following caloric restriction (normocaloric finishers: 12 / 16; hypocaloric finishers: 6 / 16; χ 2, p = 0. 03). Caloric restriction modifies autonomic responses to LBNP, which may decrease orthostatic tolerance after spaceflight...|$|E
40|$|During {{late winter}} and spring, hunter-gatherers in temperate, subarctic, and arctic environments often relied on diets that {{provided}} marginal or inadequate caloric intakes. During such periods, particularly when stored food supplies dwindled or were used up entirely, lean meat became the principal source of energy. Nutritional {{problems associated with}} high-protein, low-energy diets are discussed. These problems include elevated metabolic rates, with correspondingly higher <b>caloric</b> requirements, and <b>deficiencies</b> in essential fatty acids. The relative benefits of adding fat or carbohydrate to a diet of lean meat are evaluated {{in light of the}} protein-sparing capacities of these two nutrients. Experimental data indicate that although both enhance high-protein, low-energy diets, carbohydrate is a more effective supplement than fat. Given the nutritional inadequacies of a lean-meat diet, the paper concludes with a discussion of alternative subsistence strategies that increase the availability of carbohydrate or fat at the critical time of year...|$|R
40|$|This review mainly {{deals with}} the Formulation Development of Enteral Nutrition Products. Nutrition plays an {{important}} role in the prevention and management of many diseases. Chronic illness is associated with many complications such as anorexia, hypermetabolism, malabsorption, atrophy of muscles, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract heart, and impaired cell mediated immunity, susceptibility to infection, poor wound healing, anaemia, death. Hence it is important to correct <b>caloric</b> and nutrient <b>deficiencies</b> whenever possible. The term enteral means “within or by the way of gastrointestinal tract”. The nutrition product given by enteral route called as enteral nutrition product. The different types of enteral nutrition are classified as Short term and long term enteral nutrition. Enteral tubes are made of PVC, Polyurethane etc. The selection of the enteral formula is patient specific thus its nutritional requirements, the ingredients used in it are taken into consideration. The classification of formulas is also done on the basis of the patient’s needs and ingredients used in it. The enteral feeds can be given in the form of solutions and powders which require reconstitution. The quality control test like Osmolality, pH, etc is also taken into consideration. Thus, the purpose here is to point out explicitly the formulation development of enteral nutrition products...|$|R
40|$|Impaired {{secretion}} {{of growth}} hormone in experimental uremia: Relevance of <b>caloric</b> <b>deficiency.</b> To evaluate {{the impact of}} uremia and associated caloric restriction on physiologically pulsatile growth hormone (GH) release, we used deconvolution analysis of spontaneous plasma GH profiles in 5 / 6 -nephrectomized male rats (NX, N = 9). Three different normal renal function sham-operated groups were used: rats fed a normal diet ad libitum (SAL, N = 9); NX pair-fed rats (SPF, N = 6); NX rats pair-fed for protein ingestion but calorically supplemented up to the energy intake of SAL (SPF+, N = 8). Severe renal failure was confirmed by much higher (P < 0. 001) BUN in NX than sham groups. NX rats were growth retarded as shown by reduced (P < 0. 01) weight and length gains as compared with sham animals. Deconvolution analysis (mean ± SEM) of plasma samples obtained every 10 minutes over 6 hours, and 14 to 16 days after second stage nephrectomy showed that NX rats had a longer GH t½ (17. 0 ± 1. 8 vs. 11. 6 ± 0. 8 min), less GH mass secreted per burst (48 ± 15 vs. 95 ± 16 ng/ml/pulse), lower secretory pulse amplitude (1. 9 ± 0. 5 vs. 5. 8 ± 0. 9 ng/ml/min), and a reduced total GH secretion (240 ± 69 vs. 400 ± 56 ng/ml/ 6 hr) than SAL rats. Corresponding data {{were not significantly different}} between NX and SPF, or between SAL and SPF+ groups. In summary, stunted rats with chronic renal failure exhibit a prolonged GH t½ and suppression of GH secretory pattern burst mass. Control data from rats with normal renal function suggest that the amplitude-specific depression of GH secretion may be attributed, at least in part, to chronic renal failure-associated calorie deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative drug {{metabolism}} in liver microsomes from uremic rats. Uremia {{was achieved by}} subtotal nephrectomy in 50 to 70 day old male rats weighing 252. 0 ± 20. 1 g. Nephrectomized rats and sham-operated controls were sacrificed six days later. After liver microsomes had been isolated, microsomal cytochrome P- 450 and cytochrome b 5 content as well as microsomal specific activity for N-demethylation of aminopyrine, O-demethylation of p-nitroanisole and p-hydroxylation of acetanilide were measured. Serum urea concentration rose to 370. 0 ± 80. 0 mg/ 100 ml. The serum creatinine rose to 4. 8 ± 1. 2 mg/ 100 ml. In sham-operated controls serum urea and creatinine concentrations were approximately 50 and 0. 6 mg/ 100 ml, respectively. Uremic rats, in contrast to sham-operated controls, lost about 25 % of their initial body wt. In uremic rats and in sham-operated controls with <b>caloric</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{there was a significant}} decrease of total microsomal protein to 51 % of the value measured in sham-operated controls fed ad libitum. Absolute and relative liver wet wt decreased more in caloric deficient controls than in uremic rats, whereas microsomal protein content per g liver was lower in uremic rats. In comparison with sham-operated controls, there was a pronounced decrease in the specific activity of liver microsomes from uremic rats for the demethylation of aminopyrine and p-nitroanisole and for the p-hydroxylation of acetanilide. The microsomal cytochrome P- 450 content was also significantly diminished, whereas the microsomal cytochrome b 5 content was not influenced, but there was stimulation of the O-demethylation of p-nitroanisole to 125. 1 % when compared to controls fed ad libitum. Four intraperitoneal injections of 6 mg δ-aminolevulinic acid/kg body given to uremic rats normalized the cytochrome P- 450 content and significantly stimulated the specific activity for demethylation of p-nitroanisole, whereas demethylation of aminopyrine, p-hydroxylation of acetanilide and cytochrome b 5 content were not altered. In sham-operated controls none of the measured parameters were influenced by δ-aminolevulinic acid pretreatment. It is assumed that the reduction of cytochrome P- 450 content in liver microsomes from uremic rats is caused by a deficiency of δ-aminolevulinic acid which leads to disturbances in cytochrome synthesis. The observed decrease in the ability of liver microsomes from uremic rats to metabolize aminopyrine, p-nitroanisole and acetanilide is not merely due to reduced cytochrome P- 450 content...|$|E
40|$|This article aims {{to clarify}} why, and by which mechanisms, {{exercise}} {{may influence the}} normal menstrual cycle. Therefore, the vast amount of literature on this subject is reviewed and a critical appraisal of the most widespread hypotheses is offered. The strikingly low body mass which frequently accompanies exercise-related menstrual irregularities (ERMI) has led some authors to develop a hypothesis which postulates that a critical percentage of body fat is essential to trigger normal menstruation. The relevance of any reference to anorexia nervosa to support this view lacks consistency: female athletes differ in many ways from patients with anorexia nervosa, not lease in their excellent physical status which is essential to deliver first-class performances. ERMI is not identical to the so-called female athlete triad, a complicated pathology that involves ERMI, premature osteoporosis and disordered eating. ERMI itself {{does not seem to}} have any substantial pathological effects as long as attention is paid to preventing osteoporosis or stress fractures which may result from prolonged hypo-estrogenaemia. In the female athlete with ERMI who wishes to conceive, the accompanying subfertility may necessitate a response other than a prompt reduction in training intensity, as this is hardly a first choice for any top athlete. During recent years, a number of prospective studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the complexity of the mechanisms involved in ERMI. Older hypotheses, such as those considering hyperprolactinaemia as the cornerstone of ERMI, have now been firmly rejected. The present hypotheses emphasi se the importance of <b>caloric</b> <b>deficiency</b> and limited energy availability, although they still fail to identify the actual mechanism that causes ERMI. There is, however, evidence that ERMI is produced by a disturbance of the hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone oscillator. This disturbance is caused by either an insufficient estrogen or progesterone feedback or by an imbalance of local opioid peptide and catecholamine activities mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), corticotrophin-releasing hormone and insulin-like growth factor- 1. More recent experiments have also linked ERMI with changes in steroid metabolism, in particular, an increasing activity of catecholestrogens possibly leading to enhanced intracerebral noradrenaline (norepinephrine) levels that may interfere with normal gonadotrophin release. This article demonstrates that the outcome of the many studies on ERMI is characterised by much controversy and numerous methodological flaws. The importance and complexity of some recent findings necessitate a comprehensive study which links older and newer findings within a critical perspective...|$|E
