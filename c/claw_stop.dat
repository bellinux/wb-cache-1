50|$|Every so often, {{the growth}} of <b>claws</b> <b>stops</b> and restarts, as does hair. In hair, this results in the hair falling out and being {{replaced}} by a new one. In claws, this results in an abscission layer, and the old segment breaks off. This process takes several months for human thumbnails. Cats are often seen working old unguis layers off on wood or on boards made for the purpose. Ungulates' hooves wear or self-trim by ground contact. Domesticated equids (horses, donkeys and mules) usually need regular trimming by a farrier, {{as a consequence of}} reduced activity on hard ground.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a non-motor wheel {{which can be}} driven by shape memory alloy, wherein the invention comprises: a main frame forming one containing space; a rotation part at one side of main frame to rotate relative to the main frame; ratchet (3); and moving part inside the containing space which comprises pushing rod (13) and two SAM actuators (11, 12); the pushing rod (13) has one main body, and upper and lower arms (13 A, 13 B) longitudinally extending along front and back directions; the free ends of upper and lower arms are arranged with <b>claw</b> and <b>stop</b> <b>claw</b> matched with ratchet (3); two SAM actuators are independently arranged inside two spaces formed by main frame and {{the main body of}} pushing rod (13), to move the pushing rod (13) via alternatively powered. The invention has small volume and simple structure. 一种通过形状记忆合金进行驱动的无马达轮子机构，包括：主体框架，其形成一个容置空间；转动部，设置于主体框架的一侧，可相对于主体框架转动，并包括有棘轮(3) ；以及移动部，设置于主体框架的容置空间内，包括推拉杆(13) 和两个SMA致动器(11 ， 12) ，其中，推拉杆(13) 具有一个主体及沿前后方向纵向延伸的上臂(13 A) 和下臂(13 B) ，在上臂(13 A) 和下臂(13 B) 的自由端分别设置有与棘轮(3) 配合传动的棘爪和止回棘爪，两个SMA致动器分别设置在主体框架和推拉杆(13) 的主体之间形成的两个空间内，并可通过交替通电往复移动推拉杆(13) 。该机构结构简单、体积小，并可产生流畅连续的运动。Department of Mechanical EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: 刘建德, Liu JiandeInventor name used in this publication: 杨继志, Yang JizhiInventor name used in this publication: 黄家强, Huang JiaqiangInventor name used in this publication: 何允贤, He YunxianTitle in Traditional Chinese: 通過形狀記憶合金進行驅動的無馬達輪子機構Chin...|$|R
50|$|When Dr. Claw is thawed out of {{an iceberg}} and reactivates M.A.D., Inspector Gadget is brought out of {{retirement}} and {{is back on the}} beat to <b>stop</b> <b>Claw</b> once again, but this time, with Penny and Brain officially by his side.

60|$|True, Jerry could trace as far back. His ancient {{ancestors}} had been Irish wolf-hounds, and, long before that, {{the ancestors of}} the wolf-hounds had been wolves. The note in Jerry's growls changed. The unforgotten and ineffaceable past strummed the fibres of his throat. His teeth flashed with fierce intent, in the desire of sinking as deep in the man's hand as passion could drive. For Jerry by this time was all passion. He had leaped back into the dark stark rawness of the early world almost as swiftly as had Borckman. And this time his teeth scored, ripping the tender and sensitive and flesh of all {{the inside of the}} first and second joints of Borckman's right hand. Jerry's teeth were needles that stung, and Borckman, gaining the grasp on Jerry's jaw, flung him away and down so that almost he hit the Arangi's tiny-rail ere his <b>clawing</b> feet <b>stopped</b> him.|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} was {{bearing the}} master away. White Fang caught glimpses of it disappearing amongst the trees. The situation was desperate. He essayed another circle. She followed, running swiftly. And then, suddenly, he turned upon her. It was his old fighting trick. Shoulder to shoulder, he struck her squarely. Not only was she overthrown. So fast {{had she been}} running that she rolled along, now on her back, now on her side, as she struggled to <b>stop,</b> <b>clawing</b> gravel with her feet and crying shrilly her hurt pride and indignation.|$|R
50|$|Claw {{begins a}} new plan to steal gold from the United States Treasury. Gadget makes {{repeated}} attempts to <b>stop</b> <b>Claw,</b> but is continually foiled by his own bumbling and gadgetry glitches. Gadget's bumbling allows Dr. Claw's men to steal components for Claw's latest scheme {{and get away with}} it. Chief Quimby becomes increasingly frustrated and eventually fires Gadget, despite that Gadget had enough evidence from scientists to prove that it wasn't his fault. When Penny realizes that her uncle was fired and asks if there's anything she can do to help, Gadget tells her that she is still too young.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was night}} outside {{long before the}} {{business}} was over, and nothing was to be seen but the dim eyes and the <b>claws.</b> I <b>stopped</b> the gas engine, felt for and stroked the beast, which was still insensible, and then, being tired, left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed. I {{found it hard to}} sleep. I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff, going over the experiment over and over again, or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me, until everything, the ground I stood on, vanished, and so I came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets. About two, the cat began miaowing about the room. I tried to hush it by talking to it, and then I decided to turn it out. I remember the shock I had when striking a light--there were just the round eyes shining green--and nothing round them. I would have given it milk, but I hadn't any. It wouldn't be quiet, it just sat down and miaowed at the door. I tried to catch it, with an idea of putting it out of the window, but it wouldn't be caught, it vanished. Then it began miaowing {{in different parts of the}} room. At last I opened the window and made a bustle. I suppose it went out at last. I never saw any more of it.|$|R

He appears at the end to congratulate Gadget and give him full credit for <b>stopping</b> <b>Claw.</b> He never knows that Penny did all the work, even though she always calls him. In Gadget and the Gadgetinis, he has become an agent for the CIA.

She is 10 in the original series, 12 in Gadget and the Gadgetinis, 16 in Biggest Caper Ever, and 14 and 15 in the 2015 series.
