40|$|Dynamic {{circuits}} {{are well}} suited for applications that require predictable service with a constant bit rate for a prescribed period of time, such as cloud computing and e-science applications. Past research on upstream transmission in passive optical networks (PONs) has mainly considered packet-switched traffic and has focused on optimizing packet-level performance metrics, such as reducing mean delay. This study proposes and evaluates a dynamic circuit and packet PON (DyCaPPON) that provides dynamic circuits along with packet-switched service. DyCaPPON provides $(i) $ flexible packet-switched service through dynamic bandwidth allocation in periodic polling cycles, and $(ii) $ consistent circuit service by allocating each active circuit a fixed-duration upstream transmission window during each fixed-duration polling cycle. We analyze circuit-level performance metrics, including the blocking probability of dynamic circuit requests in DyCaPPON through a stochastic knapsack-based analysis. Through this analysis we also determine the bandwidth occupied by admitted circuits. The remaining bandwidth is available for packet traffic and we conduct an approximate analysis of the resulting mean delay of packet traffic. Through extensive numerical evaluations and verifying simulations we demonstrate the <b>circuit</b> <b>blocking</b> and packet delay trade-offs in DyCaPPON...|$|E
40|$|Precise {{control of}} feeding {{behaviour}} {{is essential for}} the survival of animals and is largely determined by internal nutritional state and food palatability. While progress has been made towards the identification of gustatory circuitry, it remains largely elusive how information regarding internal nutritional state is integrated into the feeding circuitry to modulate feeding behavior. Here we identify a new class of interneurons (VM neurons) within the gustatory circuitry of drosophila that modulate sweet sensitivity of the animal in a starvation-dependent manner. VM neurons likely receive direct input from Gr 5 a sweet receptor neurons and VM neurites are present in closed proximity to the branches of insulin producing cells. Conditional silencing of VM neurons impairs sweet sensitivity of starved animals while artificial activation is sufficient to elicit proboscis extension. Interestingly silencing of insulin producing cells (IPCs) increases sweet sensitivity, suggesting that IPCs exert a modulatory effect on the sensitivity of the gustatory circuitry. in a manner opposite to VM neurons. Consistent with our hypothesis that VM neurons representing a direct target of IPCs in the gustatory <b>circuit,</b> <b>blocking</b> insulin signaling in VM neurons increases sweet sensitivity in fed animals. Taken together, we identified a neuromodulatory pathway that insulin signaling translates information of internal nutritional state into changes in gustatory circuit sensitivity. This mechanism enables animals rapidly adjust their feeding behaviours to maintain a homeostatic nutritional state. ...|$|E
40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationObjectiveA Na-V beta 1 (C 121 W) {{mouse model}} of human genetic {{epilepsy}} has enhanced neuronal excitability and temperature sensitivity {{attributed to a}} decreased threshold for action potential firing in the axon initial segment. To investigate the network consequences of this neuronal dysfunction and to establish a genetic disease state model we developed an in vitro assay to investigate CA 1 network properties and antiepileptic drug sensitivity. MethodsCA 1 network oscillations were induced by tetanic stimulation and average number of spikes, interspike interval (ISI), duration, and latency were measured in slices from control and Na-V beta 1 (C 121 W) heterozygous mice in the presence and absence of retigabine or carbamazepine. Retigabine was also tested in a thermogenic seizure model. ResultsOscillations were reliably induced by tetanic stimulation and were maintained after severing connections between CA 3 and CA 1, suggesting a local recurrent <b>circuit.</b> <b>Blocking</b> alpha-Amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABA(A)), I-h, and T-type Ca 2 + channels/receptors {{reduced the number of}} spikes. Slices from Na-V beta 1 (C 121 W) heterozygous mice displayed several hallmarks of increased network excitability including increases in duration of the oscillation, the number and frequency of spikes and a decrease in their onset latency. The effect of genotype on network excitability was temperature sensitive, as it was seen only at elevated temperatures. Carbamazepine and retigabine were more effective in reducing network excitability in slices from Na-V beta 1 (C 121 W) heterozygous mice. Retigabine appeared to be more effective in suppressing time to thermogenic seizures in Na-V beta 1 (C 121 W) heterozygous mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls. SignificanceHippocampal networks of the Na-V beta 1 (C 121 W) heterozygous mouse model of genetic epilepsy show enhanced excitability consistent with earlier single neuron studies bridging important scales of brain complexity relevant to seizure genesis. Altered pharmacosensitivity further suggests that genetic epilepsy models may be useful in the development of novel antiepileptic drugs that target disease state pathology.

40|$|Power {{monitoring}} {{is needed}} in most electrical systems, and is crucial for ensuring reliability in everything from industrial and telecom applications, to automotive and consumer electronics. Power monitoring of integrated circuits (ICs) is also essential, as today ICs exist in most electrical and electronic systems, in a vast range of applications. Many ICs, including power ICs, have functional blocks across the chip that are used for different purposes. Measuring <b>circuit</b> <b>block</b> currents in both analog and digital ICs is important {{in a wide range}} of applications, including power management as well as IC testing and fault detection and analysis. For example, the presence of different kinds of faults in IC <b>circuit</b> <b>blocks</b> during IC fabrication causes the currents flowing through these <b>circuit</b> <b>blocks</b> to change from the expected values. There has been general interest in monitoring currents through different <b>circuit</b> <b>blocks</b> in an attempt to identify the location and type of the faults. Previous works on non intrusive load monitoring as well as on power-line communications (PLCs) provide motivation for the work presented here. The techniques are extended and used to develop a new method for power monitoring in ICs. Most solutions to the challenge of measuring currents in different <b>circuit</b> <b>blocks</b> of the IC involve adding circuitry that is both costly and power consuming. In this work, a new method is proposed to enable individual measurement of current consumed in each <b>circuit</b> <b>block</b> within an IC while adding negligible area and power overhead. This method works by encoding the individual current signatures in the main supply current of the IC, which can then be sensed and sampled off-chip, and then disaggregated through signal processing. A demonstration of this power monitoring scheme is given on a modular discrete platform that is implemented based on the UC 3842 current-mode controller IC, which can also be used for educational purposes. by Anas Ibrahim Al Bastami.
