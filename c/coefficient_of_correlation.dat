Linear simples, multiple and polynomial relations involving the modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), strees at proportional limit (TLP) and specifie gravity (Me) of the plywood were studied. The specifie gravity did not prove to be a very exact indicator of the rigidity and strength properties of the plywood. The MOE, MOR and TLP in static bending of the plywood showed low <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>correlations</b> and determination adjusted for simple linear regression, indicating a little dependence of the specific gravity.
