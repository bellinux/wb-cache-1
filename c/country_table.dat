A more normalized snowflake schema with country keys referring to a <b>country</b> <b>table</b> would consist of the same 1,000,000 record fact table, a 200 record shop table with references to a <b>country</b> <b>table</b> with 220 records.

6000|$|Such was the housewifery in George Square. It {{was better}} at Hermiston, where Kirstie Elliott, {{the sister of}} a {{neighbouring}} bonnet-laird, and an eighteenth cousin of the lady's, bore the charge of all, and kept a trim house and a good <b>country</b> <b>table.</b> Kirstie was {{a woman in a}} thousand, clean, capable, notable; once a moorland Helen, and still comely as a blood horse and healthy as the hill wind. High in flesh and voice and colour, she ran the house with her whole intemperate soul, in a bustle, not without buffets. Scarce more pious than decency in those days required, she was the cause of many an anxious thought and many a tearful prayer to Mrs. Weir. Housekeeper and mistress renewed the parts of Martha and Mary; and though with a pricking conscience, Mary reposed on Martha's strength as on a rock. Even Lord Hermiston held Kirstie in a particular regard. There were few with whom he unbent so gladly, few whom he favoured with so many pleasantries. [...] "Kirstie and me maun have our joke," [...] he would declare, in high good-humour, as he buttered Kirstie's scones, and she waited at table. A man who had no need either of love or of popularity, a keen reader of men and of events, there was perhaps only one truth for which he was quite unprepared: he would have been quite unprepared to learn that Kirstie hated him. He thought maid and master were well matched; hard, handy, healthy, broad Scots folk, without a hair of nonsense to the pair of them. And the fact was that she made a goddess and an only child of the effete and tearful lady; and even as she waited at table her hands would sometimes itch for my lord's ears.|$|E
