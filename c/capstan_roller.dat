50|$|The Wolfbox is {{the name}} for the {{original}} passive DI unit, direct box, or DI as invented in the late 1950s by Dr. Edward Wolfrum, PhD, alumnus engineer of Motown, Golden World Records, Terra-Shirma Studios, Metro-Audio <b>Capstan</b> <b>Roller</b> Remote recording, and United Sound Systems in Detroit, Michigan. Used by James Jamerson, Dennis Coffey, Bob Babbit and other The Funk Brothers, the Wolfbox was a key component in the 1960s and 1970s sound of recorded music in the Motown/Detroit scene.|$|E
5000|$|Passive direct boxes first {{appeared}} in the United States in the middle 1960s, most notably in Detroit at radio stations and recording studios like [...] "Motown", [...] "United Sound Systems", [...] "Golden World Records", Tera Shirma Studios and the Metro-Audio <b>Capstan</b> <b>Roller</b> remote recording truck. These DIs were custom made by engineers like Ed Wolfrum with his [...] "Wolfbox" [...] and by concert sound companies to solve certain problems associated with amplifying electronic musical instruments, especially electric guitars. These boxes typically contained an audio transformer (like the Triad A11J through 1974) with a turns ratio from approximately 8:1 to 12:1, and thus an impedance ratio of around 144:1. With this kind of transformer, the output voltage of the instrument is stepped down to a range compatible with the typical mixing console's microphone preamp. The typical console preamp input impedance of 1,500 ohms would appear to the electronic instrument as a high input impedance of 216,000 ohms.|$|E
5000|$|Stewart {{spent three}} weeks {{recording}} Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing [...] "ahhh" [...] 16 times for each {{note of the}} chromatic scale, building up a [...] "choir" [...] of 48 voices for each note of the scale. The main problem facing the band was {{how to keep the}} vocal notes going for an infinite length of time, but Creme suggested that they could get around this issue by using tape loops. Stewart created loops of about 12 feet in length by feeding the loop at one end though the tape heads of the stereo recorder in the studio, and at the other end through a <b>capstan</b> <b>roller</b> fixed {{to the top of a}} microphone stand, and tensioned the tape. By creating long loops the 'blip' caused by the splice in each tape loop could be drowned out by the rest of the backing track, providing that the blips in each loop did not coincide with each other. Having created twelve tape loops for each of the 12 notes of the chromatic scale, Stewart played each loop through a separate channel of the mixing desk. This effectively turned the mixing desk into a musical instrument complete with all the notes of the chromatic scale, which the four members together then [...] "played", fading up three or four channels at a time to create [...] "chords" [...] for the song's melody. Stewart had put gaffer's tape across the bottom of each channel, which meant it was impossible to completely fade down the tracks for each note; this resulted in the constant background hiss of vocals heard throughout the song. Composer and music theory professor Thomas MacFarlane considered the resulting [...] "ethereal voices" [...] with distorted synthesized effects that are an example of early synclavier music to be a major influence on Billy Joel's hit ballad [...] "Just the Way You Are", released two years later.|$|E
50|$|A tape {{transport}} is {{the collection}} of parts of a magnetic tape player or recorder that the actual tape passes through. Transport parts include the head, <b>capstan,</b> pinch <b>roller,</b> tape pins, and tape guide. The tape transport {{as a whole is}} called the transport mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The tape {{is pulled}} from the supply reel by a <b>capstan</b> and pinch <b>roller,</b> {{similar to those used}} in audio tape recorders.|$|R
50|$|In the Cousino, Eash, Muntz, and Lear {{cartridge}}s, {{tape was}} {{pulled from the}} center of the reel, passed across the opening at one end of the cartridge and wound back onto the outside of the same reel. The spool itself was freewheeling and the tape was driven only by tension from the <b>capstan</b> and pinch <b>roller.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bernardston Congregational Unitarian Church is a {{historic}} church building at the junction of Church and Depot Streets in Bernardston, Massachusetts. The church is notable {{for the history of}} construction, movement, and reconstruction, since it was first erected in 1739, just two years after Bernardston was settled. It began as an early colonial meeting house, located on Huckle Hill, and was moved 0.5 mi in 1772 on <b>capstans</b> and <b>rollers</b> using human power. In 1791 it was moved again, this time by disassembly and reconstruction, to a location on Bald Mountain Road. It was moved a third time in 1825, again by disassembly, to its present location. It was significantly altered in 1846, which it acquired its Greek Revival features and its belfry.|$|R
50|$|When EIAJ-1 was standardized, no Videocassette {{recorders}} had {{yet been}} introduced. One {{of the main}} drawbacks to the format was the need to carefully thread {{the end of the}} tape around the head drum, through a gap between the <b>capstan</b> and pinch <b>roller,</b> and around a variety of guides and tensioners. If the user made any errors in doing this, the machine would malfunction and the tape could become damaged. So, another version, EIAJ-2, was released later on that used a single-reel cartridge (with the take-up reel being built into the VTR) instead of an open take up reel. Otherwise, the recording specifications were exactly the same.|$|R
50|$|The {{vacuum system}} {{provided}} a physical buffer between the precision {{movements of the}} capstan and the large movements of the reels by storing a short length of tape in the vacuum column under relatively low tension. The vacuum columns were chambers open at one end, the openings being {{in line with the}} tape path before and after the <b>capstan</b> and <b>roller</b> assemblies. The amount of tape in the column was controlled by four optical or vacuum sensors {{on the sides of the}} columns. The control electronics kept the curve of the tape loop between the two inner sensors, cueing the supply reel to feed more or the take-up reel to take more as necessary. The outer two sensors, at the very top and bottom of the columns, served to sense malfunctions in the feed mechanism during operation, prompting the control electronics to shut off all operation of the tape transport and vacuum system to prevent damaging the tape. Because of the tension provided by the vacuum columns and the design of the tape path, tape was usually kept in sufficient contact with the relatively high-friction coating on the capstan that a pinch roller was not used.|$|R
5000|$|In later years, an [...] "auto reverse" [...] feature {{appeared}} {{that allowed the}} deck to play (and, in some decks, record) {{on both sides of}} the cassette without the operator having to manually remove, flip, and re-insert the cassette. Most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head (similar to those on multitrack recorders), with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time, one pair for each direction. Auto-reverse decks employ a <b>capstan</b> and pinch <b>roller</b> for each side. Since these use the same opening in the cassette shell normally used for the erase head, such decks must fit the erase head (or two, one for each direction) into the center opening in the shell along with the record/play head.|$|R
50|$|There were {{a number}} of {{problems}} to be overcome with this system. The high tape/head speed could lead to rapid wear of both the tape and the head, so both need to be highly polished, and the head made of a hard, wear-resistant material. Most systems operate with an air bearing separating the heads {{from the surface of the}} drum. Supplying signals to a rotating head is also problematic: This is usually accomplished by coupling the signal(s) inductively through a rotary transformer. The transport mechanism is also much more complex than a fixed head system, since during loading, the tape must be pulled around a rotating drum containing the head(s). In a VCR for example, the tape must be pulled out of the cassette case and threaded around the drum, and between the <b>capstan</b> and pinch <b>roller.</b> This leads to complex and potentially unreliable mechanics.|$|R
40|$|An Orbital Winch {{mechanism}} enables high-load, multi-line tethers to {{be deployed}} and retracted without rotating the spool on which the tether is wound. To minimize damage to the tether and the wound package during retraction or deployment under load, it can incorporate a Tension Management Module that reduces the infeed tension {{by a factor of}} 15 {{through the use of a}} powered <b>capstan</b> with guide <b>rollers.</b> This design eliminates the need for rotating high-voltage electrical connections in tether systems that use propellantless electro-dynamic propulsion. It can also eliminate the need for rotating optical connections in applications where the tether contains optical fibers. This winch design was developed to deploy a 15 -km-long, 15 -kg high-strength Hoytether structure incorporating conductive wires as part of the MXER- 1 demonstration mission concept. Two slewing rings that orbit around the tether spool, combined with translation of one of the slewing rings back and forth along the spool axis to traverse the wind point, enables the winch to wind the tether. Variations of the traverse motion of the slewing ring can accomplish level winds and conical pirn winds. By removing the non-traversing slewing ring, and adding an actuated guide arm, the winch can manage rapid, low-drag deployment of a tether off the end of a pirn-wound spool, followed by controlled retraction and rewinding, in a manner very similar to a spin-casting reel. The winch requires at least two motor driver controller units to coordinate the action of two stepper motors to accomplish tether deployment or retraction...|$|R
