25|$|The {{remains of}} the SL-1 reactor are now buried near the {{original}} site at 43°31'02.9"N 112°49'22.2"W. The SL-1 burial ground consists of three excavations, in which a total volume of 99,000 cubic feet (2800 m3) of <b>contaminated</b> <b>material</b> was deposited. The excavations were dug as close to basalt as the equipment used would allow and ranges from 8 to 14 feet (2.4 to 4.3 m) in depth. At least 2 feet (0.6 m) of clean backfill was placed over each excavation. Shallow mounds of soil over the excavations were added {{at the completion of}} cleanup activities in September 1962. The site and burial mound are collectively known as United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund Operable Unit 5-05.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan's {{decision}} led {{to increased}} {{demands on the}} Windscale and (subsequently) Calder Hall nuclear plants to produce plutonium for military purposes. As a result, safety margins for radioactive materials inside the Windscale reactor were eroded. This contributed to the Windscale fire {{on the night of}} 10 October 1957, which broke out in the plutonium plant of Pile No. 1, and nuclear contaminants travelled up a chimney where the filters blocked some, but not all, of the <b>contaminated</b> <b>material.</b> The radioactive cloud spread to south-east England and fallout reached mainland Europe. Although scientists had warned of the dangers of such an accident for some time, the government blamed the workers who had put out the fire for 'an error of judgement', rather than the political pressure for fast-tracking the megaton bomb.|$|E

25|$|Shown this {{evidence}} by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to inspectors {{that she had}} grown 19,000 litres of botulism toxin; 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, which can cause liver cancer; clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin, a castor bean derivative which can kill by inhibiting protein synthesis. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but which is safer for researchers to work with. It {{was because of the}} discovery of Taha's work with camel pox that the US and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained <b>contaminated</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
500|$|The USAF {{worked with}} Danish nuclear {{scientists}} {{to consider the}} clean-up options. The spilled fuel in the blackened area carried the weapons material very well, raising concerns that when the ice melted in the summer, the radioactive fuel would float on the sea and subsequently contaminate the shore—the Danes thus insisted on {{the removal of the}} blackened area to avoid this possibility. [...] The Danes also requested that the nuclear material not be left in Greenland after the cleanup operation was complete, therefore requiring General Hunziker to remove the contaminated ice and wreckage to the United States for disposal. USAF personnel used graders to collect the contaminated snow and ice, which was loaded into wooden boxes at the crash site. The boxes were moved to a holding area near Thule Air Base known as the [...] "Tank Farm". There, <b>contaminated</b> <b>material</b> was loaded into steel tanks prior to being loaded onto ships. Debris from the weapons was sent to the Pantex plant in Texas for evaluation, and the tanks were shipped to Savannah River in South Carolina. [...] According to General Hunziker, 93 percent of the <b>contaminated</b> <b>material</b> was removed from the accident site.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} mine for gravel, Glacier Northwest is {{required}} to provide an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) detailing the proposed scale of operation, which is then reviewed by King County. Sand and gravel extraction {{could be as high}} as 7.5 million tons per year, but could also be much lower, depending on demand. Also dependent on demand is the lifetime of the mine, which could be 11 years at full production, up to 35 years before the site is closed. The clearing of ground is proposed to occur in phases of 32 acres (129,000 m²) each, with no more than two phases in process at a time. In order to reduce arsenic contamination, <b>contaminated</b> <b>materials</b> will be contained within a sealed berm, and no <b>contaminated</b> <b>materials</b> will leave the site.|$|R
2500|$|Aversion to {{consuming}} {{or coming}} {{into contact with}} <b>contaminated</b> <b>material</b> also exists in presocial species, e.g., the gregarious-phase migratory grasshoppers Melanoplus sanguinipes [...] avoids consuming conspecific corpses infected by entomoparasitic fungi. Female burying beetles (Nicrophorus vespilloides) choose fresh carcasses over microbe-covered degraded ones to breed on - though this may have also evolved to allow a reduction in post-hatching competition between juveniles and microbes over the carcass.|$|E

2500|$|Infection {{is through}} <b>contaminated</b> <b>material</b> such as earth, water, {{uncooked}} or cross-contaminated food {{that has been}} in contact with the feces of an infected individual or animal. Contact must then be transferred to the mouth and swallowed. It is especially prevalent amongst those in regular contact with bodies of fresh water including recreational water such as swimming pools. Other potential sources include insufficiently treated water supplies, contaminated food, or exposure to feces. [...] The high resistance of Cryptosporidium oocysts to disinfectants such as chlorine bleach enables them to survive for long periods and still remain infective.
