40|$|Transtibial {{amputation}} patients need prosthetic {{devices in}} order to regain their functional mobility and appearance. The socket and its design {{play a significant role}} in determining the wearer’s quality of the fit [...] Prosthetic users experience pressure between the socket and residual limb during daily activities. The underlying soft tissues and skin of the residual limb are not accustomed to weight bearing; thus, there is the risk of degenerative tissue ulcer in the residual limb because of constant or repetitive peak pressure applied by the socket. The prosthetic users experience different pathways such as level ground, ramps, stairs and other uneven surfaces during their daily activities. An amputee is greatly affected when dealing with the environmental barriers such as slopes and stairs because of the reported high interface pressure between socket and residual limb. The interface pressure between the residual limb and prosthetic socket has a significant effect on an amputee’s satisfaction and comfort. Suspension system and socket fitting in prosthetic devices significantly affect the amputee’s comfort, mobility, and satisfaction. Prosthetic users required a comfortable liner, good suspension, and quality socket to avoid skin problems and to prevent discomfort while using the prosthesis for daily activities. Liners provide a comfortable interface by adding a soft cushion between the residual limb and the socket. Dermo and Seal-In X 5 liners are two new interface systems and, due to their relative infancy, no literature were found about their interface pressure during level walking as well as stairs and ramp negotiations and their effect on patient’s satisfaction. Therefore, the objectives of this study was to compare the interface pressure for these two liners during level walking as well as stairs and ramp negotiations and their effect on patients satisfaction and to compare it with the most <b>common</b> <b>liner</b> in today use (Pelite liner) and its effect on patient’s satisfaction and perceived problems. In addition, investigation were carried out on the effect of suspension system on patient satisfaction and perceived problems associated with thethree liners. The selection of good prosthetic liner presents a challenging task in amputee rehabilitation. Two prostheses were fabricated for each of the 10 amputees, one with the Seal-In X 5 liner and one with the Dermo liner for comparison between Dermo, Pelite, and Seal-In X 5 liners, 60 prostheses were fabricated. Interface pressure was measured during level walking, stairs and ramp negotiations. Each subject filled in a Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) questionnaire regarding his satisfaction with the three liners. Mean Peak Pressure (MPP) was significantly (P< 0. 05) low with Dermo liner during level walking as well as stairs and ramp negotiations compared with Seal-In X 5 Liner. Participants were significantly (P< 0. 05) satisfied and fewer problems were recorded with Dermo liner compared with Seal-In X 5 and Pelite liners. Hence, it can be concluded that the Dermo liner provides more comfortable socket-residual limb interface than the Seal-In X 5 liner and showed that the Dermo liner is the best choice for transtibial users. However, despite these results, the Seal-In X 5 liner offers better suspension. These results will help the clinicians and prosthetic practitioners in selecting of prosthetic liners and will also help the clinician in the fabricating of a good comfortable socket for transtibial users. three liners.

The sample contains a range of nuclear types, ranging from Seyfert to star-forming nuclei and was originally selected for the NUclei of GAlaxies project (NUGA) - a spectrally and spatially resolved interferometric survey of gas dynamics in nearby galaxies designed to identify the fueling mechanisms of AGN and the relation to host galaxy evolution.

CIPP requires bypass of the flow in the existing pipeline while the liner is being installed. The curing may take from one hour to 30 hours depending on pipe diameter and curing system (steam / water / uv) and must be carefully monitored, inspected, and tested. Obstructions in the existing pipeline, such as protruding laterals, must be removed prior to installation. Cost should be compared with similar methods such as Shotcrete, thermoformed pipe, close-fit pipe, spiral wound pipe and sliplining as these other methods can provide a similar design solution for similar or less cost in certain situations. CIPP must also be carefully monitored for release of chemical agents utilized in the reaction process for contamination downstream of rehabilitated pipes. The liner material used for common sizes is normally a felted fabric (non-woven) and does not go around bends well without wrinkling and going out of round on corners.

40|$|We present {{infrared}} L-band (3 - 4 micron) nuclear {{spectra of}} a large sample of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). ULIRGs classified optically as non-Seyferts (LINERs, HII-regions, and unclassified) are our main targets. Using the 3. 3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and absorption features at 3. 1 micron due to ice-covered dust and at 3. 4 micron produced by bare carbonaceous dust, we search for signatures of powerful active galactic nuclei (AGNs) deeply buried along virtually all lines-of-sight. The 3. 3 micron PAH emission, the signatures of starbursts, is detected in all but two non-Seyfert ULIRGs, but the estimated starburst magnitudes can account for {{only a small fraction}} of the infrared luminosities. Three LINER ULIRGs show spectra typical of almost pure buried AGNs, namely, strong absorption features with very small equivalent-width PAH emission. Besides these three sources, 14 LINER and 3 HII ULIRGs' nuclei show strong absorption features whose absolute optical depths suggest an energy source more centrally concentrated than the surrounding dust, such as a buried AGN. In total, 17 out of 27 (63 %) LINER and 3 out of 13 (23 %) HII ULIRGs' nuclei show some degree of evidence for powerful buried AGNs, suggesting that powerful buried AGNs may be more <b>common</b> in <b>LINER</b> ULIRGs than in HII ULIRGs. The evidence of AGNs is found in non-Seyfert ULIRGs with both warm and cool far-infrared colors. These spectra are compared with those of 15 ULIRGs' nuclei with optical Seyfert signatures taken for comparison. The overall spectral properties suggest that the total amount of dust around buried AGNs in non-Seyfert ULIRGs is systematically larger than that around AGNs in Seyfert 2 ULIRGs.

40|$|Motivated by the X-ray {{properties}} of the galaxy NGC 3065, we have obtained new optical spectra which reveal {{that it has a}} low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) as well as broad Balmer emission lines, establishing it as an active galactic nucleus. We also examined an older spectrum from the CfA Redshift Survey which, lacking broad Balmer lines, indicates that they appeared some time after 1980. Thus NGC 3065 joins the set of LINERs with broad, variable Balmer lines, which includes such well-known galaxies as NGC 1097 and M 81. Inspired by the sometimes double-peaked profiles of the variable Balmer lines in other LINERs, we speculate that the broad Balmer lines of NGC 3065 also come from an accretion disk. We illustrate the plausibility of this hypothesis by fitting a disk model to the observed Hα profile. We also estimate the mass of the central black hole as (9 +/- 4) 10 ^ 7 M_sol from the {{properties of}} the host galaxy, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} accretion rate is only 2 10 ^- 4 times the Eddington value, a property that appears to be <b>common</b> among <b>LINERs.</b> At such a low relative accretion rate the inner accretion disk can turn into a vertically-extended ion torus, which can illuminate the outer, thin disk and power the broad-line emission. The reason for the sudden appearance of broad Balmer lines is an open question, although we suggest two possible explanations: tidal disruption of a star or a sudden transition in the structure of the accretion disk.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the nuclear {{obscuration}} of galaxies hosting LINERs {{based on their}} X-ray and optical emission. They show column densities (N_H) at soft energies (0. 5 - 2 keV) mostly related to the diffuse emission around the AGN, showing a correlation with the optical extinction. N_H at hard energies (2 - 10 keV) {{seem to be much}} higher than what would be expected from the optical extinction. They might be associated to the inner regions of the AGN, buried at optical wavelengths. The main result of this paper is that around 50 % of our LINER sample shows signatures of Compton-thickness (CT) according to the most common tracers: the X-ray spectral index, F(2 - 10 keV) /F([OIII]) ratio and EW(FeKa). However, the EWs of CT LINERs are significantly lower than in CT Sy, suggesting that the 2 - 10 keV emission is dominated by electron scattering of the otherwise invisible AGN, or by emission from shocked gas associated to star formation rather than by reflection from the inner wall of the torus. However, no clear relation seems to exist between galaxies with optical dust lanes and X-ray classified CT objects. This may suggest that CT sources should be related to absorbing material located at the very inner regions of the AGN, maybe in the putative dusty torus. Larger M_BH and lower Eddington ratios than Sy galaxies have been found. This effect can be better attributed to LINER nuclei being hosted by earlier morphological types than Sy nuclei. However, it has to be noted that, once a proper correction to the X-ray luminosity is applied, LINERs show Eddington ratios overlapping those of Sy 2. We speculate with a possible scenario for LINER nuclei: an inner obscuring matter similar to that of Sy 2, and an external obscuring matter responsible for the optical extinction. CT sources appear to be more <b>common</b> among <b>LINERs</b> than Sy. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

40|$|To get insight in {{the nature}} of the ionized gas in the nuclear region of LINERs we have {{performed}} a study of HST Halpha imaging of 32 LINERs. The main conclusion from this analysis is that for the large majority of LINERs (84 %) an unresolved nuclear source has been identified as well as extended emission with equivalent sizes ranging from few tens till about hundredths of parsecs. Their morphologies appear not to be homogeneous being basically grouped into three classes:nuclear outflow candidates (42 %), core-halo morphologies (25 %) and nuclear spiral disks (14 %). Clumpy structures reminiscent of young stellar clusters are not a <b>common</b> property on <b>LINERs.</b> The remaining 5 galaxies are too dusty to allow a clear view of the ionized gas distribution. A size-luminosity relation has been found between the equivalent radius of the Halpha emission and the (2 - 10 keV) X-ray luminosities. Both ionised gas morphologies and the size-luminosity relation are indistinguishable from those of low luminosity Seyferts, suggesting the same origin for the NLR of LINERs and Seyferts. Also a relation between soft X-rays and ionized gas has been suggested for the first time in LINERs. From multiwavelength data, only 4 out of the 32 LINERs have no evidences on an AGN nature of theirnuclear sources from multiwavelength data, but extremely obscured AGNs cannot be discarded out given the Compton thick signatures of their X-ray emission. For the confirmed AGN LINERs, their Halpha imaging favour core-halo and outflow morphologies (65 % of the cases). Finally, their calculated Eddington ratios show that our LINER sources radiate at sub-Eddington regime, with core-halo systems having on average larger Eddington ratios than outflow candidates.

40|$|This thesis studies {{two related}} topics in liner shipping. The first topic is the {{contract}} pricing problem for container carriers. The second part studies {{the interaction of}} the longer term contracts and the spot markets/exchanges for the same goods/services. Most containerized freight is transported under the provisions of medium term contracts between ocean carriers and shippers. One of the biggest challenges for an ocean carrier is to find optimal ways to structure the prices in those contracts. In particular, an ocean carrier would like to set the prices such that the best match between supply and demand can be obtained to maximize its profit. We propose three optimization models as decision tools that carriers can use to plan the contract price structures, as well as the anticipated freight flows and empty container flows for the period covered by the contracts. Based on the models, we propose algorithms and build decision tools that generate the following output: optimal prices to be charged for the movement of freight, the anticipated freight flows and empty flows, containers to be leased, rented and purchased, and the additional voyage capacities to be procured. The first two models are deterministic and represent the problem at different levels of detail. In addition, a three-stage stochastic model is proposed to handle uncertainties in demand rates, costs, bookings and transit times on feeder arcs. Recent developments in information technology and communication make spot transactions more economical and more convenient. Nevertheless, the incidental spot transactions still count for only a very small portion of freight transported both by the large carriers who are the leaders in implementing e-commerce and in the industry as a whole. The second part of the thesis studies models to provide insight into the effect of spot market participation rates on various economic quantities. This may have implications for freight transportation industries, such as the sea cargo industry, in which longer term contracts are still prevalent. We focus our study on the following situation. Option contracts are signed before the demand is observed. As is <b>common</b> in <b>liner</b> shipping, sellers (carriers) also sell goods/services on the spot. Buyers (shippers) may or may not buy in the spot market as a matter of policy. We investigate the effects of spot market participation on the contract market and on the surpluses of all market players. It is found that the contract market shrinks as more and more buyers participate in the spot market. However, the effects on the surpluses of different market players are much more complicated and depend on the following factors: market structure, demand variation along time, demand variation among buyers and capacity level.

40|$|In {{maritime}} transportation, {{liner shipping}} accounts for over 60 % {{of the value}} of goods shipped. However, very limited literature is available on the study of various problems in liner shipping. In this thesis we focus on problems related to this industry. Given a set of cargo to be transported, a set of ports and a set of ships, a common problem faced by carriers in liner shipping is the design of their service network. We develop an integrated model to design service network for the ships and to route the available cargo, simultaneously. The proposed model incorporates many relevant constraints, such as the weekly frequency constraint on the operated routes, and emerging trends, such as obtaining benefits from transshipping cargo on two or more service routes, that appear in practice but have not been considered previously in literature. Also, we design exact and heuristic algorithms to solve the integer program efficiently. The proposed algorithms integrate the ship scheduling problem, a tactical planning level decision, and the cargo routing problem, an operational planning level decision, and provide good overall solution strategy. Computational experiments indicate that larger problem instances, as compared to the literature, can be solved using these algorithms in acceptable computational time. Alliance formation is very <b>common</b> among global <b>liner</b> carriers however a quantitative study of liner alliances is missing from literature. We provide a mathematical framework for the quantitative study of these alliances. For the formation of a sustainable alliance, carriers need to agree on an overall service network and resolve issues concerning distribution of benefits and costs among the members of the alliance. We develop mechanisms to design a collaborative service network and to manage the interaction among the carriers through the allocation of profits in a fair way. The mechanism utilizes inverse optimization techniques to obtain resource exchange costs in the network. These costs provide side payments to the members, on top of the revenue generated by them in the collaborative solution, to motivate them to act {{in the best interest of}} the alliance while satisfying their own self interests.
