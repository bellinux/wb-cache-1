40|$|Background The actin {{cytoskeleton}} {{is essential}} for many physiological processes of eukaryotic cells. The emergence of new actin fibers is initiated by actin nucleators. Whereas {{most of them are}} evolutionary old, the <b>cordon-bleu</b> actin nucleator is classified as vertebrate specific. Findings Using sensitive methods for sequence similarity detection, we identified homologs of <b>cordon-bleu</b> not only in non-vertebrate chordates but also in arthropods, molluscs, annelids and platyhelminthes. These genes contain only a single WH 2 domain and therefore resemble more the vertebrate <b>cordon-bleu</b> related 1 protein than the three WH 2 domain containing <b>cordon-bleu.</b> Furthermore, we identified a homolog of the N-terminal, ubiquitin like, cobl domain of <b>cordon-bleu</b> in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. Conclusion Our results suggest that the ur-form of the <b>cordon-bleu</b> protein family evolved already with the emergence of the bilateria by the combination of existing cobl and WH 2 domains. Following a vertebrate specific gene-duplication, one copy gained two additional WH 2 domains leading to the actin nucleating <b>cordon-bleu.</b> The function of the ur-form of the <b>cordon-bleu</b> protein family is so far unknown.

40|$|AbstractThe axial midline is an {{important}} source of patterning and morphogenesis cues in the vertebrate embryo. The midline derives from a small group of cells in the gastrulating embryo, known as “the organizer” in recognition of its ability to organize an entire body plan. The mammalian organizer, the node, gives rise to axial midline structures: the notochord, dorsal foregut, and part of the floor plate of the neural tube. Only some of the genes that direct midline development are known. In this study, we present the complete coding sequence for a novel gene, <b>cordon-bleu</b> (cobl), expressed specifically in the node and its derivatives until organogenesis stages. The deduced sequence does not resemble any gene of known function. However, cobl is widely conserved: apparent orthologs and paralogs are found in many vertebrate species, with several sequence domains of high conservation but unknown function. We find that chicken <b>cordon-bleu</b> is similarly expressed in the node and its derivatives, suggesting functional conservation. We also report the sequence and nonoverlapping expression of a related mouse gene, Coblr 1. Finally, we show that cobl interacts with the neurulation gene Vangl 2 to facilitate midbrain neural tube closure, demonstrating roles for both cobl and Vangl 2 in midbrain neurulation...|$|E

This regulation could be accomplished by formin-binding proteins being directly involved in formin-driven actin nucleation, by formin-binding proteins influencing the activated state of the formins, by linking formin-driven actin polymerization to Arp 2 / 3 driven actin polymerization, or by influencing the subcellular localization of the formins.

40|$|Vocalizations {{have been}} elucidated in {{previous}} songbird studies, whereas less {{attention has been}} paid to non-vocal sounds. In the bluecapped <b>cordon-bleu</b> (Uraeginthus cyanocephalus), both sexes perform courtship displays that are accompanied by singing and distinct body movements (i. e. dance). Our previous study revealed that their courtship bobbing includes multiple rapid steps. This behaviour is quite similar to human tap dancing, because it can function as both visual and acoustic signals. To examine the acoustic signal value of such steps, we tested if their high-speed step movements produce non-vocal sounds that have amplitudes similar to vocal sounds. We found that step behaviour affected step sound amplitude. Additionally, the dancing step sounds were substantially louder than feet movement sounds in a non-courtship context, and the amplitude range overlapped with that of song notes. These results support the idea that in addition to song cordon-bleus produce acoustic signals with their feet...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDespite {{the wealth}} of {{different}} actin structures formed, only two actin nucleation factors are well established in vertebrates: the Arp 2 / 3 complex and formins. Here, we describe a further nucleator, <b>cordon-bleu</b> (Cobl). Cobl is a brain-enriched protein using three Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 (WH 2) domains for actin binding. Cobl promotes nonbundled, unbranched filaments. Filament formation relies on barbed-end growth and requires all three Cobl WH 2 domains and the extended linker L 2. We suggest that the nucleation power of Cobl is based on the assembly of three actin monomers in cross-filament orientation. Cobl localizes to sites of high actin dynamics and modulates cell morphology. In neurons, induction of both neurites and neurite branching is dramatically increased by Cobl expression—effects that critically depend on Cobl's actin nucleation ability. Correspondingly, Cobl depletion results in decreased dendritic arborization. Thus, Cobl is an actin nucleator controlling neuronal morphology and development...|$|E
40|$|SummarySpontaneous {{nucleation}} of actin is very inefficient in cells. To {{overcome this}} barrier, cells have evolved {{a set of}} actin filament nucleators to promote rapid nucleation and polymerization in response to specific stimuli. However, the molecular mechanism of actin nucleation remains poorly understood. This is hindered largely {{by the fact that}} actin nucleus, once formed, rapidly polymerizes into filament, thus making it impossible to capture stable multisubunit actin nucleus. Here, we report an effective double-mutant strategy to stabilize actin nucleus by preventing further polymerization. Employing this strategy, we solved the crystal structure of AMPPNP-actin in complex with the first two tandem W domains of <b>Cordon-bleu</b> (Cobl), a potent actin filament nucleator. Further sequence comparison and functional studies suggest that the nucleation mechanism of Cobl is probably shared by the p 53 cofactor JMY, but not Spire. Moreover, the double-mutant strategy opens the way for atomic mechanistic study of actin nucleation and polymerization...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe beta-thymosin/WH 2 actin-binding module {{shows an}} amazing {{adaptation}} to multifunctionality. The beta-thymosins are genuine G-actin sequesterers of moderate affinity for G-actin, allowing an efficient {{regulation of the}} G-actin/F-actin ratio in cells by amplifying changes in the critical concentration for filament assembly. In contrast, the first beta-thymosin domain of the protein Ciboulot makes with G-actin a complex that supports filament growth, such as profilin-actin. We illustrate how the use of engineered chimeric proteins, actin-binding and polymerization assays, crystallographic, NMR, and SAXS structural approaches complement each other to decipher the molecular basis for the functional versatility of these intrinsically disordered domains when they form various 1 : 1 complexes with G-actin. Multifunctionality is expanded in tandem repeats of WH 2 domains present in WASP family proteins and proteins involved in axis patterning like <b>Cordon-Bleu</b> and Spire. The tandem repeats generate new functions such as filament nucleation and severing, as well as barbed end binding, which add up to the G-actin sequestering activity. Novel regulation pathways in actin assembly emerge from these additional activities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>cordon-bleu</b> (Cobl) gene {{is widely}} conserved in vertebrates, with developmentally {{regulated}} axial and epithelial expression in mouse and chick embryos.

We find that cobl shows enriched expression in ciliated epithelial tissues during zebrafish organogenesis. Cobl protein is enriched in the apical domain of ciliated cells, in close proximity to the apical actin cap. Reduction of Cobl by antisense morpholinos reveals an essential role in development of motile cilia in organs such as Kupffer's vesicle and the pronephros. In Kupffer's vesicle, the reduction in Cobl coincides with a reduction in the amount of apical F-actin. Thus, Cobl represents a molecular activity that couples developmental patterning signals with local intracellular cytoskeletal dynamics to support morphogenesis of motile cilia...|$|E
40|$|According to {{classical}} sexual selection theory, complex multimodal courtship displays have evolved in males through female choice. While it is well-known that socially monogamous songbird males sing to attract females, we report here {{the first example}} of a multimodal dance display {{that is not a}} uniquely male trait in these birds. In the blue-capped <b>cordon-bleu</b> (Uraeginthus cyanocephalus), a socially monogamous songbird, both sexes perform courtship displays that are characterised by singing and simultaneous visual displays. By recording these displays with a high-speed video camera, we discovered that in addition to bobbing, their visual courtship display includes quite rapid step-dancing, which is assumed to produce vibrations and/or presumably non-vocal sounds. Dance performances did not differ between sexes but varied among individuals. Both male and female cordon-bleus intensified their dance performances when their mate was on the same perch. The multimodal (acoustic, visual, tactile) and multicomponent (vocal and non-vocal sounds) courtship display observed was a combination of several motor behaviours (singing, bobbing, stepping). The fact that both sexes of this socially monogamous songbird perform such a complex courtship display is a novel finding and suggests that the evolution of multimodal courtship display as an intersexual communication should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{resistance}} to BCR-ABL 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) {{and disease progression}} to blast crisis (BC) are major clinical problems in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); however, underlying mechanisms governing this process remain to be elucidated. Here, we report <b>Cordon-bleu</b> protein-like 1 (Cobll 1) as a distinct molecular marker associated with drug resistance as well as progression to BC. In detail, Cobll 1 increases IKKγ stability, leading to NF-κB activation and reduction of nilotinib-dependent apoptosis, suggesting Cobll 1 -mediated NF-κB could be involved in drug resistance. Recently, NF-κB signalling has been highlighted as a core mechanism for chronic phase (CP) -BC progression, stem cell survival and tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. We also demonstrated that high expression of Cobll 1 confers drug {{resistance to}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML cell line as well as patient samples. The analysis of large sets of primary CML samples (n= 90) shows that Cobll 1 expression is dramatically increased in BC but not in CP, which is correlated with a poor survival rate (P= 0. 002). Moreover, our studies show that Cobll 1 is highly expressed in CD 34 + primitive stem cell populations, and the zebrafish paralog Cobll 1 b is important for normal hematopoiesis during embryonic development. Based on these results, we propose that Cobll 1 is a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for CML-BC. clos...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the alternative splicing in equine <b>cordon-bleu</b> WH 2 repeat protein-like 1 (COBLL 1) gene that was identified in horse muscle and blood leukocytes, and to predict functional consequences of alternative splicing by bioinformatics analysis. In a previous study, RNA-seq analysis predicted the presence of alternative spliced isoforms of equine COBLL 1, namely COBLL 1 a as a long form and COBLL 1 b as a short form. In this study, we validated two isoforms of COBLL 1 transcripts in horse tissues by the real-time polymerase chain reaction, and cloned them for Sanger sequencing. The sequencing results showed that the alternative splicing occurs at exon 9. Prediction of protein structure of these isoforms revealed three putative phosphorylation sites at the amino acid sequences encoded in exon 9, which is deleted in COBLL 1 b. In expression analysis, it was found that COBLL 1 b was expressed ubiquitously and equivalently in all the analyzed tissues, whereas COBLL 1 a showed strong expression in kidney, spinal cord and lung, moderate expression in heart and skeletal muscle, and low expression in thyroid and colon. In muscle, both COBLL 1 a and COBLL 1 b expression decreased after exercise. It is assumed that the regulation of COBLL 1 expression may be important for regulating glucose level or switching of energy source, possibly through an insulin signaling pathway, in muscle after exercise. Further study is warranted to reveal the functional importance of COBLL 1 on athletic performance in race horses...|$|E
40|$|Actin {{nucleation}} {{triggers the}} formation of new actin filaments and {{has the power to}} shape cells but requires tight control in order to bring about proper morphologies. The regulation {{of the members of the}} novel class of WASP Homology 2 (WH 2) domain-based actin nucleators, however, thus far has largely remained elusive. Our study reveals signal cascades and mechanisms regulating <b>Cordon-Bleu</b> (Cobl). Cobl plays some, albeit not fully understood, role in early arborization of neurons and nucleates actin by a mechanism that requires a combination of all three of its actin monomer-binding WH 2 domains. Our experiments reveal that Cobl is regulated by Ca 2 + and multiple, direct associations of the Ca 2 + sensor Calmodulin (CaM). Overexpression analyses and rescue experiments of Cobl loss-of-function phenotypes with Cobl mutants in primary neurons and in tissue slices demonstrated the importance of CaM binding for Cobl's functions. Cobl-induced dendritic branch initiation was preceded by Ca 2 + signals and coincided with local F-actin and CaM accumulations. CaM inhibitor studies showed that Cobl-mediated branching is strictly dependent on CaM activity. Mechanistic studies revealed that Ca 2 +/CaM modulates Cobl's actin binding properties and furthermore promotes Cobl's previously identified interactions with the membrane-shaping F-BAR protein syndapin I, which accumulated with Cobl at nascent dendritic protrusion sites. The findings of our study demonstrate a direct regulation of an actin nucleator by Ca 2 +/CaM and reveal that the Ca 2 +/CaM-controlled molecular mechanisms we discovered are crucial for Cobl's cellular functions. By unveiling the means of Cobl regulation and the mechanisms, by which Ca 2 +/CaM signals directly converge on a cellular effector promoting actin filament formation, our work furthermore sheds light on how local Ca 2 + signals steer and power branch initiation during early arborization of nerve cells-a key process in neuronal network formation...|$|E

This study examined avian species richness and diversity along with the densities of some common bird species on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria, in relation to habitat features on farmland over a gradient of differing farming intensities. The study area exhibited {{a variety of different}} levels of farming which differed in the habitat available for birds. Birds normally associated with savanna woodland were more associated with less intensive farming, and open-country birds were more associated with more intensive sites, with more species of birds observed where farming was less intensive. Common species of birds using cultivated land associated with different crops, with acha and millet being the most commonly used. Tree density was the most important variable predicting avian species richness and diversity, with medium tree density predicting the highest species richness and diversity. The densities of two common farmland birds were predicted best by tree density, but varied in their responses to the habitat variables, with common bulbul, a savanna generalist, associating more with less intensive, wooded areas and red-cheeked <b>cordon-bleu,</b> an open savanna granivore, associating with medium intensity, more open farmland. Whinchats were common in open, intensively farmed areas with few trees and good herbaceous vegetation cover.

40|$|The {{means by}} which cells, tissues, and organisms undergo {{morphogenesis}} are variable and highly regulated, and the mechanisms that govern cellular changes in response to signaling cues are poorly understood. This study seeks to address {{the role of a}} newly characterized protein in zebrafish in translating signaling cues into physical changes within a cell. The <b>Cordon–bleu</b> (Cobl) gene is widely conserved in vertebrates, with developmentally regulated axial and epithelial expression in mouse and chick embryos. In vitro, Cobl can bind monomeric actin and nucleate formation of unbranched actin filaments, while in cultured cells it can modulate the actin cytoskeleton. However, an essential role for Cobl in vivo has yet to be determined. We have identified the zebrafish cobl ortholog and have used zebrafish as a model to assess the requirements for Cobl in embryogenesis. We find that cobl shows enriched expression in ciliated epithelial tissues during zebrafish organogenesis. The utilization of antibodies developed against Cobl shows that the protein is concentrated along the apical domain of ciliated cells, in close proximity to the apical actin cap. Reduction of cobl by antisense morpholinos reveals an essential role in embryonic morphogenesis and organ development. A requirement for Cobl was shown for the proper function of various and ciliated epithelial organs. Cobl appears to direct the elongation of motile cilia in organs such as Kupffer’s vesicle and the pronephros. In Kupffer’s vesicle, the reduction in Cobl coincides with a reduction in the amount of apical F-actin. Additionally, Cobl may play a role during gastrulation cell movements and convergence and extension morphogenesis during early embryonic development. Thus, Cobl may represent a molecular activity that couples developmental patterning signals with local intracellular cytoskeletal dynamics to support elongation of motile cilia and tissue morphogenesis.
