40|$|The paper aims to {{shed light}} on the {{relationships}} between labour market institutions with respect to wage formation and the effectiveness of economic and labour market policies in enhancing employment and overall economic performance. We evaluate tax and benefit policies under four alternative specifications of wage formation : fixed, market determined, and bargained wages. In the latter, we also distinguish between the short- and long-run effects, and between uncoordinated and coordinated (nation-wide) bargaining. To this end, we build a computable general equilibrium model which is calibrated using data on the Finnish economy and labour market, distinguishing workers of three skill categories by the level of their education. Evaluating policies under various possible labour market institutions, the paper also seeks relevance in a wider EU perspective. Overall, the model simulations show that labour market institutions with respect to wage formation influence to a large extent the effectiveness of many policies aiming at enhancing employment. When wages are allowed to react, policies expanding the demand for labour, which work well under fixed wages, turn out to be quite inefficient in the short run. The reverse emerges with supply side policies such as reducing benefits so that wage reactions reinforce the positive effects of these policies. The reduction of marginal taxes interacts with labour market institutions in quite a sensitive way. Under wage bargaining, tax reductions should be channelled to low-income earners, while the reverse holds under flexible wage formation. Policies directed at raising labour demand for a targeted group, typically the low skilled, are able, on the other hand, to lower unemployment amongst this group of workers also under coordinated wage bargaining. However, if the group concerned enters in a new wage bargaining round unilaterally, the effect of this policy can even be quite negative in terms of its impact on employment due to the rise of <b>compensatory</b> <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> through the wage-wage links. We also consider a hypothetical, fully flexible labour market and find the extent of the widening of the wage distribution, but also the magnitude of clear economic gains, related to a low rate of unemployment reached through the assumed wage adjustment process. The most effective policy in terms of employment, labour supply and unemployment is the curtailment of social security benefits while out of work. Also a neutral policy of compensating the cut in unemployment benefits by a tax reduction leads, under bargaining, to an expansion in the economy. The results call for coordination in tax and benefit policy measures, so that incentives to work and to stay out of work are not created simultaneouslyemployment, tax and benefit policies, wage formation, CGE model...|$|E

40|$|The {{corporate}} governance problem of state enterprises in formerly centrally planned economies can {{give rise to}} excess <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> and/or capital decumulation if workers and managers try to appropriate the firm''s assets before it is "commercialized" or privatized. Since state enterprises still produce a dominant fraction of total output, these problems can have serious macroeconomic consequences. For example, since the profit tax accounts for {{a significant proportion of}} government fiscal revenue, a redistribution of state enterprises'' total revenue from profits to wage implies - ceteris paribus - a worsening of the government''s fiscal position. In the absence of a developed bond market, this implies higher money creation: monetary policy becomes endogenous with respect to <b>wage</b> <b>claims.</b> Also, if the claims of workers (in the form of wages) and government (in the form of taxes) exceed output, capital will be run down. This can happen, for example, if the government imposes excess wage taxes on state enterprises, but the latter are unable to keep wage increases below the limit. This paper provides a simple dynamic framework to address these issues, and studies the impact of wage controls on the behaviour of the fiscal deficit inflation, private consumption, and output in the presence of "excessive" <b>wage</b> <b>claims.</b> The latter can lead not only to high inflation, but also to suboptimally low levels of capital and putout. If wage levels are initially excessive, simple incomes policy measures, such as a reduction in the degree of wage indexation, can be effective in reducing inflation and the fiscal deficit if nominal wage increases do not provide on average full protection against inflation. Furthermore, in the presence of structurally excessive <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> and full inflation coverage, linking wages to the path of putout can help reduce the overall output decline. The endogeneity of monetary policy with respect to <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> implies that <b>wage</b> controls may be necessary to regain monetary autonomy if the Central Bank is to pursue nominal exchange rate stability or a crawling peg...|$|R

After a given initial <b>wage</b> <b>claim,</b> the system forces the firm either to accept it or to make a counteroffer prior to a fixed (unknown to the econometrician) and short deadline. In this context signaling models predict that the <b>wage</b> <b>claim</b> should try to screen the firm’s level of profitability, while the offer is expected to reveal little information. Both hypotheses are tested using the Spanish data set and neither is rejected. The analysis of the fraction of the disputed wages the workers get after initial disagreement provides further evidence in favour of signalling models since we find it is to both observed and private information as well as to conflicting activity variables. Moreover, conditional on covariates, for a number of sectors, we cannot reject the parties “split the difference” between both initial offers. Note this solution coincides with the Rubinstein’s (1982) wage, the solution for the complete information game. ...|$|R

40|$|To put {{the plight}} of the Detroit city {{employees}} into an international and comparative context when it comes to considering how their pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> should be treated in bankruptcy, it is instructive to consider how similar employee pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> would be treated in corporate insolvencies in other countries. It is necessary to focus on corporate insolvencies in other countries as the relevant comparison because most other countries do not have government systems in which municipalities have the same financial independence to borrow money and take on debt as municipalities do in the United States as part of the municipal bond market. Additionally, exploring the corporate bankruptcy systems in other countries provides a beneficial way to consider how to approach municipal bankruptcy situations in the United States, especially since corporate and municipal bankruptcies in the United States have a number of features in common when it comes to employee creditor claims. This article therefore undertakes a comparative analysis of the treatment of pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> in insolvency proceedings and under guarantee schemes in the thirty-four member countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to understand whether the United States’ approach to employee claims in bankruptcy (in both the corporate and municipal context) is consistent with international norms. After completing the comparative analysis (which is comprehensively set out in the Country-by-Country Appendix {{at the end of this}} paper), this article then highlights common approaches to these issues, as well as important distinctions, setting up a number of tables to summarize the results. All in all, most OECD countries have adopted hybrid systems which combine both some form of priority for both pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims,</b> as well as some form of guarantee fund to complement the insolvency system. It is especially important to have these guarantee funds in place because insolvency processes can last for years, while the guarantee schemes are more likely to pay employees their claims within weeks or months. Unfortunately, the United States provides only limited priorities in most bankruptcy proceedings (and no such wage or pension priorities in Chapter 9 municipal proceedings), a guarantee system under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) that is limited to pension plans, and then only to private-sector defined benefit pension plans. Neither private-sector defined contribution plans nor public sector pension plans come under a guarantee scheme in the United States. One possible approach to employee claims in both municipal and corporate bankruptcies would be to pass pension and bankruptcy reform laws similar to what Canada enacted in 2008 as part of its Wage Earner Protection Program Act (WEPPA). Unlike the American system, WEPPA provides limited absolute priorities for pension contributions and a broad array of <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> in insolvency, as well as a robust wage guarantee scheme. As to the policy reasons supporting this approach, it appears that greater emphasis is placed on the need to protect the weakness of employees creditors in the insolvency process as opposed to focusing on the need to ensure the existence of cheap, accessible credit for companies and governments. This article concludes that given the relative vulnerability of employees and the sophistication of most lenders, the United States should balance these interests to provide increased protection for employment claims during municipal and corporate insolvency proceedings through giving heightened priority treatment to employees pension and <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> in bankruptcy in tandem with a federally-operated guarantee scheme for both pension and <b>wages</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R

40|$|In an ageing society, it is {{important}} to gain insight in the factors explaining why the transition from unemployment to employment gets harder as people move from mid to late career. This study focuses on one related aspect: individuals’ wage setting behaviour. The study explores the relationship between age and the reservation wage for people in their mid and late career. We moreover investigate whether two employability factors, ‘willingness to move’ and ‘ease of movement’, mediate this relationship. Higher <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> would not necessarily be problematic if they result from a stronger labour market position (ease of movement) and therefore a higher ‘market value’. It would be more problematic if higher <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> are a way to price oneself out of the labour market because of a low willingness to move. Path analysis on a sample of 8, 113 Belgian workers aged 40 to 60 years reveals that age positively affects the reservation wage via willingness to move. Yet, this effect is neutralized by the negative influence via ease of movement. Our analyses moreover reveal a direct, positive effect of age on the reservation wage, if employability factors are controlled for. This finding suggests that <b>wage</b> <b>claims</b> are increasing if people move from mid to late career irrespective of their employability. We discuss implications for theory, practice and future research. status: publishe...|$|R

The immediate result of the boat and caravan levy, in particular, was the decimation of both industries as potential buyers could not afford to pay the 20% tax on top of the construction costs; the tax also had the additional effect of adding to the numbers of unemployed as boat and caravan builders could not pay their employees because of the order cancellations.|$|R
