When packaged as an [...]rdp file (which contains {{the address of the}} RemoteApp server, authentication schemes to be used, and other settings), a RemoteApp can be launched by double clicking the file. It will invoke the Remote Desktop Connection client, which will <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> and render the UI. The RemoteApp can also be packaged in a Windows Installer database, installing which can register the RemoteApp in the Start menu as well as create shortcuts to launch it. A RemoteApp can also be registered as handler for file types or URIs. Opening a file registered with RemoteApp will first invoke Remote Desktop Connection, which will connect to the terminal server and then open the file. Any application which can be accessed over Remote Desktop can be served as a RemoteApp.|$|E

In Per-User mode, a CAL is purchased to allow one user to <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> software. Any user can connect, but only one user may use a given CAL at any given time. Any number of CALs can be purchased to allow five, five hundred, or any number of users to simultaneously <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server.</b> Any number of devices may <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> software, but only a set number of users can connect to it at once.|$|E

40|$|This project {{report is}} about a Customer Service System with java {{programming}} language. It {{is built based on}} TCP / IP with threads and Binary Tree. This project consists of three main programs. It consists of one server and two client programs. <b>Server</b> is <b>the</b> centre of the data transfer. The Clients are Customer Service and Customers. <b>Server</b> runs as <b>the</b> background process and responsible in managing clients and their data transfers. While these two clients are <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server,</b> <b>server</b> will <b>connect</b> them and forwards the data in accordance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intended client. This program has no limitation on the number of clients <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server.</b> When there are too many clients <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server,</b> it can slow down <b>the</b> <b>server</b> performance...|$|R

50|$|The user-based access methods work by authorizing {{specific}} {{users to}} <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server.</b> When a client establishes {{a connection to}} a server, it has to prove being controlled by an authorized user.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic concept}} of Quintet.net is that there's a {{conductor}} and several (up to five) performers (or clients), connected {{to each other}} using a central server. The clients get instructions from the conductor. These instructions can be messages sent to the clients, but usually it is a score part to play. On the other hand, control data created by the clients are {{sent back to the}} network. This latter, combined with the fact that an unlimited number of clients can <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> in a so-called listener mode (that is, a mode where the client only receives data but doesn't send control data back) lets anyone <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> and listen the music being played in real time.|$|E
50|$|JUpdater {{requires}} a central server that contains {{information about the}} latest version. The clients <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> in order to check if there are new versions and to download the changes and changelog. The server requires PHP 4.3 or greater and MySQL 4.0 or greater.|$|E
50|$|For a large {{organization}} with locations {{that are not}} a part of a private network, a hosted WIPS implementation simplifies deployment significantly because sensors <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Server</b> over the Internet without requiring any special configuration.

Several versions of Ilan's work are still on SourceForge.|$|E

5000|$|The spice-html5 module {{implements}} a SPICE client {{that uses}} JavaScript and {{is intended to}} run inside a web browser supporting HTML5.
