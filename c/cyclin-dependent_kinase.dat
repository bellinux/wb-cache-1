5|$|An {{important}} downstream {{target of}} ATM and ATR is p53, {{as it is}} required for inducing apoptosis following DNA damage. The <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor p21 is induced by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can arrest the cell cycle at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by deactivating cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes.|$|E

25|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the CDKN2 <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> {{inhibitor}} family. p16 comprises four ankyrin repeats, each spanning a length of 33 amino acid residues and, in the tertiary structure, forming a helix-turn-helix motif.

More recent investigations revealed some chemopreventive and therapeutic effects, for certain types of cancer, especially in combination of statins with other anticancer drugs. It is likely that these effect are mediated by the properties of statins to reduce proteasome activity, leading to an accumulation of <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors p21 and p27, and to subsequent G1-phase arrest, as seen in cells of different cancer lines.|$|E
25|$|CUL4B-based E3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase complexes often demonstrate overlapping {{activity with}} CUL4A-based complexes. Both CRL4 complexes utilize Cdt2 and the DNA processivity factor PCNA to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of replication licensing factor Cdt1 and <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor p21 in a proteasome-dependent manner. CRL4Cdt2 also degrades PCNA-bound PR-Set7/SET8, {{which is a}} histone 4 methyltransferase, and the p12 subunit of DNA polymerase δ, which is crucial for DNA replication.

25|$|In vertebrates, {{although}} proneural genes {{determine the}} neural fate of progenitors, they also promote {{the arrest of}} their division stage by the isolation of already specified progenitor cells from the influence of extrinsic fate-determining cues. Proneural genes regulate cell cycle by the activation of <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> (‘’Cdk’’) inhibitors in some lineages {{at the level of}} neuronal-differentiation genes. On the other hand, in invertebrates like Drosophila, proneural genes are expressed mainly in non-dividing cells, but could also be expressed in dividing-cells, where Achaete-scute complex proneural genes have been shown to inhibit cell-cycle progression.|$|E

25|$|One {{class of}} {{mutations}} affects the gene CDKN2A. An alternative reading frame mutation in this gene {{leads to the}} destabilization of p53, a transcription factor involved in apoptosis and in fifty percent of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a nonfunctional inhibitor of CDK4, a <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> that promotes cell division. Mutations that cause the skin condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) also increase melanoma susceptibility. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell's ability to repair DNA. Both CDKN2A and XP mutations are highly penetrant (the chances of a carrier to express the phenotype is high).|$|E
25|$|At {{the onset}} of S phase, the pre-replicative complex must be {{activated}} by two S phase-specific kinases in order to form an initiation complex at an origin of replication. One kinase is the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase called Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) {{and the other is}} <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> (CDK). Chromatin-binding assays of Cdc45 in yeast and Xenopus have shown that a downstream event of CDK action is loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin. Cdc6 has been speculated to be a target of CDK action, because of the association between Cdc6 and CDK, and the CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6. The CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6 has been considered to be required for entry into the S phase.|$|E

25|$|Olomoucine, a purine derivative, is a <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> (CDK) inhibitor. CDK is a cell-cycle {{promoting}} protein, which {{along with}} other pro-growth proteins is abnormally activated during glial scar formation. Such proteins can increase astrocyte proliferation and {{can also lead to}} cell death, thus exacerbating cellular damage at the lesion site. Administration of olomoucine peritoneally has been shown to suppress CDK function. Further, olomoucine has been shown to reduce neuronal cell death, reduce astroglial proliferation (and therefore reduce astrogliosis), and increase GAP-43 expression, a useful protein marker for neurite growth. Moreover, reduced astrocyte proliferation decreases expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major extracellular matrix molecules associated with inhibition of neuroregneration after trauma to the CNS.|$|E
25|$|These {{micronuclei}} undergo defective DNA replication, {{which is}} slower than DNA replication {{in the main}} nucleus and causes a proximal DNA damage response (DDR) to be initiated. However, DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint activation fail to follow. Consequently, chromosomes that are not correctly replicated in micronuclei become fragmented. The method by which the pulverization of these chromosomes occur is not fully understood, but it {{is thought to be}} caused either by aberrant DNA replication or by premature chromosome condensation, which entails semi-replicated chromosomes being compacted by <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> activity. The resulting fragmented chromosome segments can be joined together to give rise to a rearranged chromosome, which can subsequently be reincorporated into the main nucleus of a daughter cell. The new chromosome can persist for several generations of cell cycle divisions and {{contribute to the development of}} a cancer cell.|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic {{origins of}} {{replication}} control {{the formation of}} a number of protein complexes that lead to the assembly of two bidirectional DNA replication forks. These events are initiated by the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at the origins of replication. This process takes place in the G1 stage of the cell cycle. The pre-RC formation involves the ordered assembly of many replication factors including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 protein, Cdt1 protein, and minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7). Once the pre-RC is formed, activation of the complex is triggered by two kinases, <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> 2 (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) that help transition the pre-RC to the initiation complex prior to the initiation of DNA replication. This transition involves the ordered assembly of additional replication factors to unwind the DNA and accumulate the multiple eukaryotic DNA polymerases around the unwound DNA.|$|E

25|$|When it is {{time for}} a cell to enter S phase, {{complexes}} of <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinases</b> (CDK) and cyclins phosphorylate Rb to pRb, allowing E2F-DP to dissociate from pRb and become active. When E2F is free it activates factors like cyclins (e.g. cyclin E and cyclin A), which push the cell through the cell cycle by activating <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinases,</b> and a molecule called proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or PCNA, which speeds DNA replication and repair by helping to attach polymerase to DNA. The initial phosphorylation is performed by Cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6, followed by additional phosphorylation by Cyclin E/CDK2. pRb remains phosphorylated throughout S, G2 and M phases.|$|R
40|$|AbstractProteolytic {{destruction}} of cyclins {{is a fundamental}} process for cell division. At the end of mitosis, degradation of mitotic cyclins results in the inactivation of <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinases.</b> Cyclin proteolysis is triggered by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a multi-subunit complex which contains ubiquitin ligase activity. Recent data in yeast demonstrated that a partial degradation of the mitotic cyclin Clb 2, mediated by APC/C and its activator protein Cdc 20, is essential and sufficient for the mitotic exit. Remarkably, a complete inactivation of <b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinases</b> seems to be not essential. This review discusses recent novel insights into cyclin destruction {{and its implications for}} the mitotic exit...|$|R
25|$|The pRb {{protein is}} inactivated by E7 in HPV+OPC, but in HPV-OPC {{it is the}} p16 tumour {{suppressor}} part of the pRb tumour suppressor network that is inactivated. Also the pRb pathway is inactivated by E7 instead of Cyclin D1 amplification. CDKN2A is a tumour suppressor gene that encodes a tumor suppressor protein, p16 (<b>cyclin-dependent</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor 2A) and inhibits the kinase activity of the cyclin-dependant kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest. p16 expression is cell cycle dependent and is expressed focally in only about 5–10% of normal squamous epithelium. Like most HPV+ cancers, HPV+OPC express p16 but the latter does not function as a tumour-suppressor, because the mechanism by which this is achieved, pRb, has been inactivated by E7. p16 is upregulated (over-expressed) due to E7-related loss of pRB with reduced negative feedback, whereas it is downregulated in up to 90% of HPV-OPC. This diffuse over-expression in the tumour cells provides a diagnostic marker for HPV involvement. Although HPV E6 and E7 reduce tumour suppressor activity, they do so less than genetic and epigenetic processes do in HPV-OPC.|$|E
25|$|Activity {{of these}} HDACs can be {{affected}} by phosphorylation. An increased amount of phosphorylation (hyperphosphorylation) leads to increased deacetylase activity, but degrades complex formation between HDACs 1 and 2 and between HDAC1 and mSin3A/YY1. A lower than normal amount of phosphorylation (hypophosphorylation) leads to {{a decrease in the}} amount of deacetylase activity, but increases the amount of complex formation. Mutation studies found that major phosphorylation happens at residues Ser421 and Ser423. Indeed, when these residues were mutated, a drastic reduction was seen in the amount of deacetylation activity. This difference in the state of phosphorylation is a way of keeping an optimal level of phosphorylation to ensure there is no over or under expression of deacetylation. HDACs 1 and 2 have been found only exclusively in the nucleus. In HDAC1 knockout (KO) mice, mice were found to die during embryogenesis and showed a drastic reduction in the production but increased expression of <b>Cyclin-Dependent</b> <b>Kinase</b> Inhibitors (CDKIs) p21 and p27. Not even upregulation of the other Class I HDACs could compensate for the loss of HDAC1. This inability to recover from HDAC1 KO leads researchers to believe that there are both functional uniqueness to each HDAC as well as regulatory cross-talk between factors.|$|E
