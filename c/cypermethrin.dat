25|$|To combat parasites from {{biofouling}} in finfish aquaculture, treatment protocols such as <b>cypermethrin,</b> azamethiphos, and emamectin benzoate may be administered, {{but these}} {{have been found to}} have detrimental environmental effects, for example, in lobster operations.|$|E
25|$|Pyrethroids are direct stimulators {{of sodium}} {{channels}} in neuronal cells, inducing rapid depolarization and spastic paralysis leading to death. The effect is {{specific to the}} parasite since the drugs used are only slowly absorbed by the host and rapidly metabolized once absorbed. <b>Cypermethrin</b> (Excis, Betamax) and deltamethrin (Alphamax) are the two pyrethroids commonly used to control sea lice. Resistance to pyrethroids {{has been reported in}} Norway and appears to be due to a mutation leading to a structural change in the sodium channel which prevents pyrethroids from activating the channel. Use of deltamethrin has been increasing as an alternate treatment with the rise in resistance observed with emamectin benzoate.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, <b>cypermethrin,</b> and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E
50|$|If {{exposed to}} <b>cypermethrin</b> during pregnancy, rats {{give birth to}} {{offspring}} with developmental delays. In male rats exposed to <b>cypermethrin,</b> the proportion of abnormal sperm increases. It causes genetic damage: chromosomal abnormalities increased in bone marrow and spleen cells when mice were exposed to <b>cypermethrin.</b> <b>Cypermethrin</b> is classified as a possible human carcinogen, because it causes {{an increase in the}} frequency of lung tumors in female mice. <b>Cypermethrin</b> has been linked to an increase in bone marrow micronuclei in both mice and humans. One study showed that <b>cypermethrin</b> inhibits “gap junctional intercellular communication”, which {{plays an important role in}} cell growth and is inhibited by carcinogenic agents. Studies have shown that residue from <b>cypermethrin</b> can last for 84 days in the air, on walls, the floor and on furniture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cypermethrin</b> is {{very toxic}} to cats which cannot {{tolerate}} the therapeutic doses for dogs. This {{is associated with}} glucuronidase deficiency in cats, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing <b>cypermethrin.</b> As a consequence, <b>cypermethrin</b> remains much longer in the cat's organism than in dogs or other mammals and can be fatal in large doses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cypermethrin</b> is a broad-spectrum insecticide, {{which means}} it kills {{beneficial}} insects {{as well as the}} targeted insects. Fish are particularly susceptible to <b>cypermethrin,</b> but when used according directions, application around residential sites pose little risk to aquatic life. [...] Resistance to <b>cypermethrin</b> has developed quickly in insects exposed frequently and can render it ineffective.|$|E

50|$|In male rats <b>cypermethrin</b> {{was shown}} to exhibit a toxic effect on the {{reproductive}} system. After 15 days of continual dosing, both androgen receptor levels and serum testosterone levels were significantly reduced. These data suggested that <b>cypermethrin</b> can induce impairments {{of the structure of}} seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis in male rats at high doses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cypermethrin</b> is {{moderately}} toxic through skin contact or ingestion. It {{may cause}} irritation {{to the skin}} and eyes. Symptoms of dermal exposure include numbness, tingling, itching, burning sensation, loss of bladder control, incoordination, seizures and possible death. Pyrethroids may adversely effect the central nervous system. Human volunteers given dermal doses of 130 ug/cm2 on the earlobe experienced local tingling and burning sensations. One man died after eating a meal cooked in a 10% <b>cypermethrin</b> concentrate that was mistakenly used for cooking oil. Shortly after the meal, the victim experienced nausea, prolonged vomiting, stomach pains, and diarrhea which progressed to convulsions, unconsciousness and coma. Other family members exhibited milder symptoms and survived after hospital treatment. <b>Cypermethrin</b> is not a skin or eye irritant, but it may cause allergic skin reactions. [...] Excessive exposure can cause nausea, headache, muscle weakness, salivation, shortness of breath and seizures. In humans, <b>cypermethrin</b> is deactivated by enzymatic hydrolysis to several carboxylic acid metabolites, which are eliminated in the urine. Worker exposure to the chemical can be monitored by measurement of the urinary metabolites, while severe overdosage may be confirmed by quantitation of <b>cypermethrin</b> in blood or plasma.|$|E
50|$|Adults parasitize various {{wild and}} {{domestic}} mammals. Ticks {{can be controlled}} by using <b>cypermethrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cattle {{infested with}} bovine pediculosis are {{generally}} treated chemically, by drugs like ivermectin and <b>cypermethrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Cypermethrin</b> {{is used in}} {{agriculture}} to control ectoparasites which infest cattle, sheep, and poultry. In veterinary medicine, it is effective at controlling ticks on dogs.|$|E

50|$|Ant chalk, {{also known}} as Chinese chalk or 'Miraculous Insecticide Chalk', is an {{insecticide}} {{in the form of}} normal looking chalk. It contains the pesticides deltamethrin and <b>cypermethrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Cypermethrin</b> is a {{synthetic}} pyrethroid {{used as an}} insecticide in large-scale commercial agricultural applications {{as well as in}} consumer products for domestic purposes. It behaves as a fast-acting neurotoxin in insects. It is easily degraded on soil and plants but can be effective for weeks when applied to indoor inert surfaces. Exposure to sunlight, water and oxygen will accelerate its decomposition. <b>Cypermethrin</b> is highly toxic to fish, bees and aquatic insects, according to the National Pesticides Telecommunications Network (NPTN). It is found in many household ant and cockroach killers, including Raid and ant chalk.|$|E
50|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to <b>cypermethrin</b> during adulthood {{is found to}} induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration in rats, and postnatal exposure enhances the susceptibility of animals to dopaminergic neurodegeneration if rechallenged during adulthood.|$|E
50|$|Mixed with phoxim, <b>cypermethrin,</b> beta-cypermethrin {{imidacloprid}} and deltamethrin, profenofos can be {{used against}} Cotton MealyBug, cabbage caterpillar, Plutella xylostella and asparagus caterpillars, as well as against wheat and cabbage aphids.|$|E
50|$|Elliott led {{the team}} that invented the major {{pyrethroid}} insecticides bioresmethrin, permethrin, <b>cypermethrin</b> and deltamethrin. In 2009 {{it was estimated that}} pyrethroid-treated mosquito nets significantly decreased the number of deaths due to malaria.|$|E

50|$|For {{localised}} or household-level infestations {{the preferred}} control measure {{is to find}} the infested product, dispose of it, and treat around the area with a residual insecticide such as <b>cypermethrin</b> to kill off any remaining beetles.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{insecticides}} such as <b>cypermethrin</b> and deltamethrin are efficient, {{but must}} be thoroughly applied inside the bush and under leaves. Natural pyrethrin insecticides, extracted from Chrysanthemum and mixed with colza oil, can also be used. Spinosad, based on chemical compounds found in a bacterium, is also efficient.|$|E
50|$|The initial active {{ingredient}} {{was the first}} synthetic pyrethroid, allethrin. Raid derivatives aimed at particular invertebrate species can contain other active agents such as the more toxic cyfluthrin, another synthetic pyrethroid.Currently Raid Ant & Roach Killer contains pyrethroids, piperonyl butoxide, and permethrin; other products contain tetramethrin, <b>cypermethrin</b> and imiprothrin as {{active ingredient}}s. Raid Flying Insect Killer, a spray, uses prallethrin and D-phenothrin.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{specific}} environmental pollutants {{are identified}} in public law, which extends to all hazardous substances {{even if the}} item is not identified as a restricted use pesticide by the EPA. As an example, cyfluthrin, <b>cypermethrin,</b> and cynoff contain cyanide, {{which is one of}} the most toxic known substances, but some of the products that contain these chemicals may not be identified as restricted use pesticide.|$|E
50|$|Organochlorine {{pesticides}} are conventionally used {{in commercial}} wolfberry cultivation to mitigate {{destruction of the}} delicate berries by insects. Since the early 21st century, high levels of insecticide residues (including fenvalerate, <b>cypermethrin,</b> and acetamiprid) and fungicide residues (such as triadimenol and isoprothiolane), have been detected by the United States Food and Drug Administration in some imported wolfberries and wolfberry products of Chinese origin, leading to the seizure of these products.|$|E
50|$|Deltamethrin plays {{key role}} in {{controlling}} malaria vectors, and {{is used in the}} manufacture of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets. It is used as one of a battery of pyrethroid insecticides in control of malarial vectors, particularly Anopheles gambiae, and whilst being the most employed pyrethroid insecticide, can be used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, permethrin, <b>cypermethrin</b> and organophosphate-based insecticides, such as malathion and fenthion. Resistance to deltamethrin (and its counterparts) is now extremely widespread and threatens the success of worldwide vector control programmes.|$|E
50|$|Excessive use of urea as {{nitrogenous}} fertilizer and insecticides {{can lead to}} outbreaks by increasing the fecundity of the brown planthopper, and by reducing populations of natural enemies. In 2011, the Thai government announced an initiative to address brown planthoppers that included restricting the use of outbreak-causing insecticides including abamectin and <b>cypermethrin</b> - the decision {{was supported by the}} International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). IRRI also outlined recommendations in an action plan to help smartly manage planthopper outbreaks. In December 2011, the IRRI held a conference in Vietnam to address the threats of insecticide misuse and explore options for mitigation.|$|E
50|$|In July 2012 {{consumer}} action groups demanded four unlisted toxic pesticides {{found on}} common vegetables at levels 100 times the EU guidelines (which are banned in developed countries) be banned. Chemical companies are requesting to {{add them to}} the Thai Dangerous Substances Act so {{they can continue to}} be used, including on exported mangoes to developed countries which have banned their use. In 2014, Khon Kaen University concluded after a study, that Thailand should ban 155 types of pesticides, with 14 listed as urgent: Carbofuran, Methyl Bromide, Dichlorvos, Lambda-cyhalothrin, Methidathion-methyl, Omethoate, Zeta <b>Cypermethrin,</b> Endosulfan sulfate, Aldicarb, Azinphos-methyl, Chlorpyrifos-ethyl, Methoxychlor and Paraquat.|$|E
50|$|Imidacloprid {{is one of}} {{the most}} toxic {{insecticides}} to the western honeybee, Apis mellifera. The toxicity of imidacloprid to Apis mellifera differs from most insecticides in that it is more toxic orally than by contact. The contact acute LD50 is 0.024 µg a.i./bee (micrograms of active ingredient per bee). The acute oral LD50 ranges from 0.005 µg a.i./bee to 0.07 µg a.i./bee, which makes imidacloprid more toxic to the bees than the organophosphate dimethoate (oral LD50 0.152 µg/bee) or the pyrethroid <b>cypermethrin</b> (oral LD50 0.160 µg/bee). Other insecticides that are equally or more toxic than imidacloprid include spinosad, emamectin benzoate, fipronil, and the neonicotinoids clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and dinotefuran.|$|E

50|$|To {{members of}} the genus Apis, the honey bees, {{imidacloprid}} {{is one of the}} most toxic chemicals ever created as an insecticide. The acute oral LD50 ranges from 5 to 70 picograms of active ingredient per bee, making it more toxic to bees than the organophosphate dimethoate (oral LD50 0.152 µg/bee) or the pyrethroid <b>cypermethrin</b> (oral LD50 0.160 µg/bee). (For comparison, the weight of just the DNA of a human cell is about 7 picograms.) The toxicity of imidacloprid to bees differs from most insecticides in that it is more toxic orally than by contact. The contact acute LD50 is 0.024 µg active ingredient per bee.|$|E
50|$|By 1974, the Rothamsted {{team had}} {{discovered}} a second generation of more persistent compounds notably: permethrin, <b>cypermethrin</b> and deltamethrin. They are substantially more resistant to degradation by light and air, thus making them suitable for use in agriculture, but they have significantly higher mammalian toxicities. Over the subsequent decades these derivatives were followed with other proprietary compounds such as fenvalerate, lambda-cyhalothrin and beta-cyfluthrin. Most patents have now expired, making these compounds cheap and therefore popular (although permethrin and fenvalerate have not been re-registered under the 91/414/EEC process). One of the less desirable characteristics, especially of 2nd-generation pyrethroids {{is that they can}} be an irritant to the skin and eyes, so special formulations such as capsule suspensions (CS) have been developed.|$|E

Instead, by 2014 the number of active ingredients in imported pesticides increased from 210 to 253. Herbicides were by far the most significant of the imported chemicals, accounting for 80 percent of the total volume, followed by insecticides at nine percent and fungicides at eight percent.|$|E
50|$|Suitably {{prepared}} hydrogels can simultaneously {{supply and}} slowly release pesticides (such as herbicides) in the soil, and increase a sandy soil's retention of water. Hydrogels developed {{for this purpose}} include polymers of oligooxyethylene methacrylate, linked by ionic and covalent bonds to a herbicide such as 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (CMPA). Other hydrophilic polymers studied have been made {{from a variety of}} different acrylate monomers to release the pesticides 2,4-D and CMPA. These offer different combinations of pesticide release rate and soil water retention. Hydrogels {{can also be used to}} encapsulate the insecticide <b>cypermethrin</b> and the fungicide copper sulphate. Superabsorbent polymers can be used to release phosphate fertiliser slowly, by making an ester bond between polyvinyl alcohol and phosphoric acid. A polymer/clay superabsorbent composite material made by attaching acrylamide to finely powdered attapulgite (a fuller's earth clay) shows promise for its excellent water retention and low cost compared to polyacrylamide hydrogel.|$|E
5000|$|Studies on {{pesticides}} and olfaction in fishes {{have looked at}} neurophysiological effects, behavioral effects, and reproductive effects. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are neurotoxins that cause acetylcholinesterase inhibition in fish. Acetyl cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides are known to cause hyposmia. Acetylcholinesterase plays an essential role within the olfactory epithelium related to mucous production. Diazinon, an organophosphate, was found to disrupt olfactory pheromone signals that induced antipredator behavior, such as predator avoidance. It also disrupts homing behavior in Chinook salmon at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Fewer diazinon-treated chinook returned to the hatchery than control fish.Studies have found that olfactory sensory neurons {{do not respond to}} certain pesticides. Fish did not detect chlorpyrifos, esfenvalerate, and atrazine using their sense of smell and did not avoid waters contaminated with these chemicals. This contrasts metals, which elicits an avoidance response in fish. Round-up was only avoided at concentrations that caused acute lethality. Ovulating female salmon release a pheromone in their urine. After detection by the olfactory system of mature male salmon parr, plasma sex steroids and milt increase. [...] A synthetic pyrethroid pesticide, <b>cypermethrin,</b> reduced or inhibited normal olfactory system response in males to the priming effect of these pheromones. Atrazine, carbofuran and diazinon were also found to reduce olfactory detection of female priming pheromones by male Atlantic salmon parr.|$|E
