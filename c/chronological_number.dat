50|$|With The Sub-Mariner: Vol. 1, the 32nd Masterwork, Marvel relaunched {{the line}} with silver dust-jackets in 2003. On the front cover dust-jacket, these initial {{releases}} had the book's interior contents and creator names {{on the top of}} the front cover art image, and the Marvel Masterworks name under the cover art on the bottom, with the volume number on the spine featured in a black filled square with silver edging, with a silver font labeling the volume number. Post-2003 afterward, Marvel redesigned the look: the Masterworks name with the title & volume number are now up top of the cover image, with the interior contents and creator names listed at the bottom of the cover art, and the dust-jacket spine numbering filled in a silver square with black lettering font labeling the volume number. From 2002 to 2004, Marvel brought the 31 now out-of-print volumes back into print, all with the new silver dust-jackets. Like the other releases from 1997 on, these dust-jackets do not have the <b>chronological</b> <b>numbering.</b> Upon their initial release, however, a limited print run (about 1000 to 1500) was produced with variant dust-jackets that used the original marble-look style and retained the absolute <b>chronological</b> <b>numbering</b> (only on the dust-jacket's spine). These carried a $5 higher suggested retail price than the regular editions (typically US $54.99).|$|R

50|$|From 1994-1996, no new Masterworks were published, and {{existing}} volumes {{did not get}} additional printings.

Instead, the line used the number of the volume for each particular comic book series. Four new Masterworks were published from 2000 to 2002, bringing the total then to 31.

40|$|Today, {{there are}} many local governments in Japan facing the {{problems}} of deteriorating public facilities and decreasing budget. Taking their cue from the forerunner, USA, they are now introducing Asset Management practices (hereafter referred to as AM) with regards to maintenance of bridges. In Fukuoka City, a government-ordinance designated city, there are approximately 2, 100 bridges that were constructed as part of large scale road-development projects that have been rapidly implemented during Japan’s high economic growth period. Given the city’s decreasing budget for public works, {{it is imperative to}} lengthen the life of existing facilities and to reduce their maintenance costs. This paper examines the effects of AM by estimating the Life Cycle Cost (hereafter referred to as LCC) of maintaining existing bridges to be incurred in the future, based upon the result of our investigation into sampled bridges in the city. It also presents challenges and prospects for the promotion of AM. 1. PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND OF THIS STUDY Infrastructure that rapidly developed during Japan’s high economic growth period in post-war years, have deteriorated over the years. Thus, their maintenance costs are expected to grow sharply. Conversely, investment in public works is predicted to fall, as the larger share of available financial resources will be allocated to social welfare programs including one to cope with the falling birth rate. Therefore, the importance of better management and usage of facilities in stock as social infrastructure, has increased for both the national and local governments. The first and foremost critical action that local governments must take to promote AM, is to investigate into the effects of AM on cutting maintenance costs. Needless to say, {{the best way to do}} so is to check and analyze damages of all bridges. The problem is that such an approach is time-consuming and inappropriate considering financial Figure 1. 1 The <b>chronological</b> <b>number</b> of bridges in Fukuoka city Figure 1. 2 The rate of the number of bridges over 50 year...|$|E
