40|$|Recently, the European Commission {{has decided}} to {{implement}} a simplified procedure {{in the context of}} vertical integration.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the welfare aspects of vertical integration in a simple model and investigate the accuracy of the proposed rule of thumb. The welfare implications of vertical integration turn out to depend on relative <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> and the degree of product differentiation. Basically, a merger is harmless from a social point of view when the upstream market is relatively concentrated compared to the downstream market and/or if products are sufficiently close substitutes. We therefore suggest an alternative screening rule: If the upstream market is significantly less concentrated than the downstream market, or if products obviously are close substitutes, mergers may be approved at an early stage of the screening process. Otherwise the merger may be detrimental to welfare and the competition authority should evaluate it more carefully. JEL Classification: L 42, L 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{extension}} of a recent study into the relationship between merger size and profitability. It studies a class of Cournot oligopoly with linear cost and quadratic demand. Its focus is to analyze how a merger’s profitability is affected by its size and by the demand elasticity. Such results have not yet been reported in previous studies, perhaps due to the complexity of the equilibrium equation involved. It shows an increase in the demand elasticity also raises a merger’s profitability. Consequently, an increase in the demand elasticity reduces merged members’ critical <b>combined</b> per-merger <b>market</b> <b>share</b> for the merger to be profit enhancing. Comparing with 80 % minimum <b>market</b> <b>share</b> requirement for a profitable merger in Salant, Switzer, and Reynolds (1983), a greater <b>market</b> <b>share</b> is needed when the demand function is concave (demand is relatively inelastic), while a smaller <b>market</b> <b>share</b> may still be profitable when the demand function is convex (demand is relatively elastic). In our model, mergers are generally detrimental to public interests by increasing market price and reducing output. However, the merger will be less harmful when the goods are very inelastic...|$|R
