Design object of the study work is that controlled systems are controllable and stable. Two type of the practical running power were used as research object, the control system was designed accordingly. At first, the preconditions and proofs of stability of coordinated control system (CCS) and feed water control system (FWCS) were given respectively, then stability analysis for CCS and FWCS were made by mathematical derivation according to the technical problems of FWCS. The application results of super <b>critical</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> show effectiveness and practicability.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} slope-dependent {{variation}} in critical mean bed shear stress for coarse grain motion, and evaluates stream <b>power</b> per <b>unit</b> bed area {{as an alternative}} threshold parameter. Explanations for observed slope dependency and existing approaches for predicting the <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> per <b>unit</b> bed area are reviewed. An analysis of secondary bed-load transport datasets is {{used to examine the}} strength of associations between stream <b>power</b> per <b>unit</b> bed area, mean bed shear stress and mean velocity, with bedload transport rate. Data from an original flume study are combined with secondary data from similar flume experiments to investigate the effect of slope on both <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> per <b>unit</b> bed area and critical mean bed shear stress. Results suggest that stream <b>power</b> per <b>unit</b> bed area is most closely correlated with bed-load transport rate, and also that <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> per <b>unit</b> bed area is less variable with slope than critical mean bed shear stress. Alternative solutions to approximating <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> are explored. These include: (1) modifying existing expressions for <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> to account for higher critical mean bed shear stresses at higher slopes, and (2) applying a constant dimensionless <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> criterion...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its natural}} {{abundance}} and proven exploitation history, coal still represents an important fuel resource for electricity production worldwide. However, {{as a result}} of its unfavorable environmental impact and negative emission footprint, recently, a lot of efforts have been taken to provide more “environment friendly” energy producing burning coal, such as Carbon Capture Storage (CCS), utilization of low NOX burners, installation of desulphurization facilities, etc. These activities have especially large importance in case of older Large Combustion Power (LCP) plants, in particularly for those put into operation before 1 July 1987, and for which a specific and mostly case-by-case mitigation strategy must be developed. Thermal Power Plant (TPP) Bitola is the largest TPP in the Republic of Macedonia which utilizes domestic lignite. Put into operation back in 1980 s, all three units consisting TPP Bitola have already operated more than 200. 000 hours each, therefore they are far beyond their normal life expectancy. There were two possible approaches for sustainable extension of their operational life: (1) replacement of all three units (225 MW each), with completely new and modern super <b>critical</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> and with total installed capacity of more than currently existing 675 MW, or (2) performing large-scale rehabilitation program of the existing units including boiler rehabilitation, lignite supply chain modernization, steam turbines, generators and control system modernization, desulphurization, etc. Starting back in 2010, such large rehabilitation program on all three units has been initiated. Special attention during rehabilitation process was paid to environmental improvements and introduction of pollutant abatement systems providing that after rehabilitation, all three <b>power</b> <b>units</b> become fully compliant with the EU Directives for LCP Plants (EU Directive 2001 / 80 /EC). In this paper, the taken approach for selection of the best and the least-cost rehabilitation program is presented. Based on several constraint factors, four potential improvement scenarios were developed and investigated. The expected results, such as the unit’s life prolongation, boiler efficiency increase and decrease of pollutant emissions compliant with the LCP Directive are also given, therefore, providing a unique approach towards sustainable operation of the existing cold-fired power plants beyond 2016. ...|$|R
30|$|Efficiency of {{the power}} plant {{strongly}} depends on the operating steam temperature and pressure. The concern for reducing the CO 2 emission and coal consumption leads to the efforts to build power plants operating at higher steam parameters (Brozda 2007; Shu Ping et al. 2010; David et al. 2013). Austenitic stainless steels are selected for use in sections of superheaters and reheaters, which require good oxidation and fire side corrosion resistance, {{in addition to the}} creep strength. The recent improvements in operating steam temperatures up to 620  °C were achieved through the development of creep-resistant stainless steels, containing Cr, Ni, W, Co, Cu and N. Future plans of increasing the efficiency {{of the power}} plants up to 49  % require creep-resistant steels operating at steam temperatures of 760  °C and pressures of 35  MPa (Viswanathan et al. 2005). Super 304 H austenitic stainless steel is used in recently installed ultra super <b>critical</b> (USC) <b>power</b> <b>units</b> of Japan operating at steam temperature of about 613  °C (Thomas 2013). Further, Super 304 H is listed as a candidate material for superheaters and reheaters in the US program for development of materials for USC with steam temperatures of 760  °C (Viswanathan et al. 2005). Super 304 H with nominal composition of 0.1 C- 18 Cr- 9 Ni- 3 Cu-Nb-N derives excellent creep strength from the distinct Cu addition which precipitates as fine Cu-rich particle under creep conditions, in addition to NbCrN, Nb(C,N) and M 23 C 6 particles (Li et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>critical</b> <b>power</b> {{test for}} cycle ergometry has been criticised as {{providing}} an overestimate {{of the real}} value of the <b>critical</b> <b>power.</b> Part of the blame may rest in the practical problem associated with getting re-liable measurements of longer endurance times when power settings are not much above the <b>critical</b> <b>power.</b> However, by adjusting the incremental slope of ramp exercises, exhaustion brought about by high power and in a reasonably short time can be ensured, so avoiding this practical problem. This communication presents the theory and methods required to obtain estimates of both anaerobic work capacity and <b>critical</b> <b>power</b> from several ramp tests conducted to exhaustion.

40|$|When {{the flying}} {{spacecraft}} was approved for development, a <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> for the hydraulic system {{had to be}} developed. Unlike other systems on the orbiter, there was no precedent in earlier spacecraft for a hydraulic system nor for the <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> to drive the hydraulic pumps. The only prototypes available were airplane auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>units</b> (APU), which {{were not required to}} operate in the severe environments of a spacecraft nor to have the longevity of an orbiter hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>unit.</b> The challenge was to build a hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> which could operate in 0 g or 3 g, in a vacuum or at sea level pressure, and at - 65 F or 225 F, which would be capable of restarting while hot, and which would be capable of sustaining the hydraulic loads {{for the life of the}} orbiter. The basic approach to providing hydraulic power for the orbiter was to use a small, high speed, monopropellant fueled turbine <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> to drive a conventional aircraft type hydraulic pump.
