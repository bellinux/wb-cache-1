40|$|The {{effect of}} Y 2 O 3 {{concentration}} on the dielectric properties of <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> and multilayer capacitors containing 50 dielectric layers with an approximate thickness of 3 µm were investigated. The relative permittivity and temperature coefficient of capacity of multilayer capacitors at {{low and high}} applied field suggest that two types of microstructures formed, depending on yttrium doping concentration. Yttrium concentrations of 1. 5 - 2. 0 mol% yielded identical relative permittivities over a wide temperature range. The permittivities at Y concentrations of 2. 6 - 3. 0 mol% were also identical, but somewhat higher. The relative permittivity of <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> of similar composition, determined from hysteresis loop measurements as function of applied field, was compared with field-dependent permittivity measurements on multilayer capacitors. The results indicate that polarization measurements on CDCs are a good indicator for the relative permittivity values of MLCCs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

25|$|During World War II, the {{development}} of the anti-aircraft proximity fuse required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein, the former head of Globe Union's Centralab Division, its coveted Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to {{the development}} of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.|$|R

The shades of composite resin discs (Lliss / FGM / A 2) and nanofluorapatite <b>ceramic</b> <b>discs</b> with try-in pastes or cements were evaluated according to the Vita Classical shade guide by a digital spectrophotometer (Micro EspectroShade, MHT) immediately after placing the try-in pastes or resin cements between composite resin <b>discs</b> and <b>ceramic</b> <b>discs.</b> Other evaluations were performed at 2, 5, and 6 day intervals after cementation with the resin cements.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of light source, LED unit and halogen lamp (HL), on the effectiveness of Enforce dual-cured cement cured under a <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc.</b> Three exposure times (60, 80 and 120 s) were also evaluated. Two experimental groups, in which the polymerization of the dual-cured cement was performed through a <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc,</b> and two control groups, in which the polymerization of the dual-cured cement was performed directly without presence of <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> were subdivided into three subgroups (three different exposure times), with five specimens each: G 1 A- HL 60 s; G 1 B- HL 80 s; G 1 C- HL 120 s; G 2 A- LED 60 s; G 2 B- LED 80 s; G 2 C- LED 120 s; and control groups: G 3 A- HL 60 s; G 3 B- HL 80 s; G 3 C- HL 120 s; G 4 A- LED 60 s; G 4 B- LED 80 s and G 4 C- LED 120 s. Cement was applied in a steel matrix (4 mm diameter, 1. 2 mm thickness). In the experimental groups, a <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> was placed on top. The cement was light-cured through the ceramic by a HL and LED, however, the control groups were cured without the <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc.</b> The specimens were stored in a light-proof container at 37 ºC for 24 hours, then Vickers hardness was determined. A four-way ANOVA and Tukey test (p£ 0. 05) were performed. All specimens cured by LED for 60 s showed inferior values compared with the halogen groups. In general, light-curing by LED for 80 s and 120 s was comparable to halogen groups (60 s and 80 s) and their control groups. LED technology can be viable for light-curing through conventional ceramic indirect restorations, when curing time is increased in relation to HL curing time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} suction measurements {{in case of}} unsaturated soils using {{a commercially}} available water potential sensor. The sensor uses <b>ceramic</b> <b>discs</b> of predetermined pore-size distribution (i. e., fixed-matrix) for suction measurement and a surface mounted thermistor to take temperature readings. The <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> assembly of the sensor is brought in contact with a soil for which the suction measurement is required. The sensor measures the water content of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>discs</b> and further uses the water retention characteristic of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>discs</b> to determine suction. The suction thus determined {{is equal to the}} suction of the soil which is in contact with the sensor. Soil–water mixtures were prepared from two clays (Speswhite kaolin and MX 80 bentonite) with a diversified range of plasticity properties and mineralogy. Suction measurements of the soil–water mixtures were carried out at several water contents. The measured suctions of the clays were compared with the test results from a dew-point potentiameter. The test results showed that, very high suctions up to more than 10, 000 kPa and very low suctions up to about 10 kPa can be measured using the sensor. The suction equilibrium time for the soils studied was found to vary between a couple of hours to several days depending upon the magnitude of suction and initial state of the sensor (i. e., wet or dry). Comparisons of the test results from the sensor with the results from the dew-point potentiameter tests showed some significant differences in case of the bentonite, whereas the agreements between the test results from the two devices were better in case of Speswhite kaolin. The test results clearly showed that under predetermined conditions, the water potential sensor can be used to measure soil suction greater than 1500 kPa within a few hours...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the ability of}} a variety of light sources and exposure modes to polymerize a dual-cured resin composite through <b>ceramic</b> <b>discs</b> of different thicknesses by depth of cure and Vickers microhardness (VHN). Ceramic specimens (360) (Empress 2 [Ivoclar Vivadent], color 300, diameter 4 mm, height 1 or 2 mm) were prepared and inserted into steel molds according to ISO 4049, after which a dual-cured composite resin luting material (Variolink II [Ivoclar Vivadent]) with and without self-curing catalyst was placed. The light curing units used were either a conventional halogen curing unit (Elipar TriLight [3 M/ESPE] for 40 seconds), a high-power halogen curing unit (Astralis 10 [Ivoclar Vivadent] for 20 seconds), a plasma arc curing unit (Aurys [Degré K] for 10 seconds or 20 seconds) or different light emitting diode (LED) curing units (Elipar FreeLight I [3 M/ESPE] for 40 seconds, Elipar FreeLight II [3 M/ESPE] for 20 seconds, LuxOmax [Akeda] for 40 seconds, e-Light [GC] for 12 seconds or 40 seconds). Depth of cure under the <b>ceramic</b> <b>discs</b> was assessed according to ISO 4049, and VHN at 0. 5 and 1. 0 mm distance from the <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> bottom was determined (ISO 6507 - 1).

The results showed that increasing <b>ceramic</b> <b>disc</b> thickness had a negative effect on the curing depth and hardness of all light curing units, with hardness decreasing dramatically under the 2 -mm thick discs using LuxOmax, e-Light (12 seconds) or Aurys (10 seconds or 20 seconds).
