5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the rationalisation known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, passing loops and sidings removed, except the marshalling yard for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, so that only one train <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The double junction at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate {{all the way to the}} plant.|$|E
25|$|A few testing {{sessions}} with F1 teams including Jordan suggested another comeback <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cards, {{but it never}} happened. Reports at the time suggested that the Mansell–Jordan partnership for 1997 was a real possibility with Eddie Jordan's title sponsor {{willing to pay for}} the deal.|$|E
25|$|As railroads became operational, that of time became dangerous. Trains ran by a {{published}} schedule, but the scheduling was chaotic. If the watches of {{an engineer and}} a switch operator differed by even a minute or two, it could mean disaster. Two trains <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same track {{at the same time}} and crash.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, Thomas Edison won the Ratheman {{medal for}} inventing a {{lightweight}} storage battery that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back, powering a parabolic reflector that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> miner's helmet.

25|$|Unlike modern {{websites}} {{and online}} {{services that are}} typically hosted by third-party companies in commercial data centers, BBS computers (especially for smaller boards) were typically operated from the SysOp's home. As such, access could be unreliable, and in many cases, only one user <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> system at a time. Only larger BBSes with multiple phone lines using specialized hardware, multitasking software, or a LAN connecting multiple computers, could host multiple simultaneous users.|$|E
25|$|When energy {{transfer}} ceases from a system, this condition {{is referred to}} as thermodynamic equilibrium. Usually this condition implies the system and surroundings are at the same temperature so that heat no longer transfers between them. It also implies that external forces are balanced (volume does not change), and all chemical reactions within the system are complete. The timeline varies for these events depending on the system in question. A container of ice allowed to melt at room temperature takes hours, while in semiconductors the heat transfer that occurs in the device transition from an on to off state <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> order of a few nanoseconds.|$|E
25|$|Cards acquire RHP {{reliever}} John Axford. The Cardinals acquired Milwaukee Brewers closer John Axford, 30, on August 30, {{in exchange}} for a player to be named later. No cash changed hands, leaving the Cardinals to pay Axford the approximately $1 mil. remaining on his $5 mil. 2013 contract. He is eligible for arbitration after the season, and the Cardinals can either non-tender him after the season or work out a new contract for him. He has not saved a game in 2013, and has a 4.45 ERA in 62 games. This is the first deal between the Cardinals and Brewers in 10 years. This is the first deal the Cardinals have done this season to add to the club, and needed to be done before the August 31 deadline so Axford <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> postseason roster.|$|E

500|$|In {{front of}} the ridge, there were three {{positions}} that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> fortified. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> extreme right <b>were</b> the château, garden, and orchard of Hougoumont. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as [...] "the hollow-way") along which it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> supplied. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> extreme left <b>was</b> the hamlet of Papelotte.|$|R

25|$|Paris Saint-Germain faced Maccabi Tel Aviv for a {{place in}} the group stages of the Europa League after the {{play-off}} round draw at UEFA headquarters in Switzerland. PSG's French Cup triumph saw them stamp their ticket for a return to continental competition where they hosted the first leg at the Parc des Princes before heading to Israel for the return tie a week later. Paris Saint-Germain took the lead to Israel for the second leg of their play-off tie with Maccabi Tel Aviv. Péguy Luyindula and Guillaume Hoarau scored the PSG goals. Paris Saint-Germain lost at Maccabi Tel Aviv but still advanced to the group stage of the Europa League on aggregate. Paris Saint-Germain came up against former Champions League winners Borussia Dortmund and former UEFA Cup champions Sevilla in a testing Group J in which Ukrainian team Karpaty Lviv were the outsiders. Nenê pounced for the only goal of the game as PSG notched an upset win away to Sevilla. Paris Saint-Germain were in command of Group J after defeating Karpaty Lviv at the Parc des Princes. Paris Saint-Germain drew with Borussia Dortmund thanks to substitute Clément Chantôme's 87th-minute strike. Paris Saint-Germain were held to a goalless draw by Borussia Dortmund in an entertaining affair in the capital. Mathieu Bodmer, Nenê and Guillaume Hoarau did the damage for the capital club as they qualified for the last-32 after inflicting a second defeat on Sevilla to give a hint that PSG's glory days of Cup Winners' Cup and Intertoto triumphs <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way back.|$|E

500|$|From {{the early}} 13th {{century to the}} 16th, a popular form of {{monument}} north of the Alps, especially for the smaller landowner and merchant classes, was the monumental brass, a sheet of brass on which {{the image of the}} person or persons commemorated was engraved, often with inscriptions and an architectural surround. [...] They <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor or wall inside a church. These provide valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women. [...] Many bishops and even some German rulers were commemorated with brasses.|$|E

500|$|Arctic Monkeys' first release without Nicholson, {{the single}} [...] "Leave Before the Lights Come On", came on 14 August 2006. Turner {{said that the}} song {{was one of the}} last songs he wrote before their rise to fame, and {{suggested}} that [...] "it feels very much like it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album". Peaking at No.4 in the UK, the single became the band's first single not to reach No.1. The band was re-united at the Leeds Festival when Nicholson met up with his former bandmates and his replacement bassist, O'Malley. Only the original band members, minus Nicholson, were present at the award ceremony when Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not won the 2006 Mercury Prize two weeks later.|$|E

Kim and Kelley Deal were both fans of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show and had been playing [...] "Buffy Theme" [...] in concert {{in the first half}} of 2002. At some point after the July recording session, Kim Deal telephoned Buffy musical supervisor John King to ask whether the Breeders <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show. On November 5, the group appeared on the episode [...] "Him", in which they performed [...] "Son of Three" [...] and [...] "Little Fury".

2500|$|The {{recordings}} that de Sabata made in {{the studio}} are, with some exceptions, considered less gripping than {{the best of his}} work in the concert-hall and opera-house. (This {{may be related to the}} fact that he is said to have hated making recordings). Fortunately there are now several unauthorized [...] "live" [...] recordings that demonstrate how exciting de Sabata <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> podium (although the sound quality can be problematic). This contrast comes through in the two different versions of Richard Strauss's Death and Transfiguration and Verdi's Requiem listed below.|$|E

2500|$|Unterberger continues, [...] "Perhaps {{they were}} saying they wished they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front lines, but {{were not in the}} right place at the right time; perhaps {{they were saying}}, as John Lennon did in the Beatles' [...] "Revolution", that they didn't want to be {{involved}} in violent confrontation. Or perhaps they were even declaring indifference to the tumult." [...] Other writers' interpretations varied. [...] In 1976, Roy Carr assessed it as a [...] "great summer street-corner rock anthem on the same echelon as 'Summer in the City', 'Summertime Blues', and 'Dancing in the Street'." [...] In 1979, Dave Marsh wrote that it was the keynote of Beggars Banquet, [...] "with its teasing admonition to do something and its refusal to admit that doing it will make any difference; as usual, the Stones were more correct, if also more faithless, philosophers than any of their peers." ...|$|E
