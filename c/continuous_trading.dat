2500|$|The {{invention}} of the electrical telegraph consolidated markets, and New York's market rose to dominance over Philadelphia after weathering some market panics better than other alternatives. The Open Board of Stock Brokers was established in 1864 as a competitor to the NYSE. With 354 members, the Open Board of Stock Brokers rivaled the NYSE in membership (which had 533) [...] "because it used a more modern, <b>continuous</b> <b>trading</b> system superior to the NYSE’s twice-daily call sessions." [...] The Open Board of Stock Brokers merged with the NYSE in 1869. Robert Wright of Bloomberg writes that the merger increased the NYSE's members as well as trading volume, as [...] "several dozen regional exchanges were also competing with the NYSE for customers. Buyers, sellers and dealers all wanted to complete transactions as quickly and cheaply as technologically possible and that meant finding the markets with the most trading, or the greatest liquidity in today’s parlance. Minimizing competition was essential to keep {{a large number of}} orders flowing, and the merger helped the NYSE to maintain its reputation for providing superior liquidity." [...] The Civil War greatly stimulated speculative securities trading in New York. By 1869 membership had to be capped, and has been sporadically increased since. The latter {{half of the nineteenth century}} saw rapid growth in securities trading.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A stock {{time series}} is {{composed}} of a sequence of prices measured from a <b>continuous</b> <b>trade</b> day. Stock motifs are approximately similar segments {{in a group of}} different stock time series or market dataset. In this paper, at first, a definition of short-term tendency is defined; secondly, a motif of short-term tendency is introduced in the stock time series. And then a simple and effective method of stock motif detection is proposed to predict the short-term tendency in the stock time series analysis. Finally, a new motif detection of short-term tendency is introduced to predict the trend of temporal stock market trend. An empirical analysis is made to show the efficiency of the proposed method. 1...|$|R

He noted that until the inauguration of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in 2006, Israel was a key consumer of Azerbaijani oil exports, and that the proximity of Ceyhan to Israel offers excellent new opportunities for greater Israeli participation in this sector of the economy, thus creating additional areas for collaboration and mutual benefit. He underlined that through the Trans-Israel pipeline between Ashkelon and Eilat, Israel could be a strategic partner for marketing Caspian oil to Asia. Israeli efforts in developing alternative energy resources, especially solar energy, were also mentioned. Israel additionally seeks possibilities of importing gas from the Caspian Sea region.|$|R

40|$|We {{define a}} continuous-time trading process for Arrow-Debreu {{exchange}} economies such that (1) At each time, myopic traders play a (weakly) dominant strategy in Mertens' (2003) limit price strategic market game; (2) existence of <b>continuous</b> <b>trade</b> curves holds under weak conditions {{and in particular}} {{even if there is}} no static Walras equilibrium; (3) every trade curve converges to some Pareto optimal point; (4) for a generic choice of utilities and initial endowments, there is a piecewise unique trade curve, which is smooth and depends continuously upon initial conditions; (5) in the 2 x 2 case, for every interior starting point, the vector field corresponding to our dynamics is real-analytic; moreover, trade and price curves can be fully characterized and numerically simulated.

40|$|In this paper, a continuous-time price-quantity trading {{process is}} defined for {{exchange}} economies with differentiable characteristics. The dynamics {{is based on}} boundedly rational agents exchanging limit-price orders to a central clearing house, which rations infinitesimal trades according to Mertens (2003) double auction. Existence of <b>continuous</b> <b>trade</b> and price curves holds under weak conditions and in particular {{even if there is}} no long-run competitive equilibrium. Every such curve converges towards a Pareto point, and every Paretian allocation is a locally stable rest-point. Generically, given initial conditions, the trade and price curve is piecewise unique, smooth and computable, hence enables to effectively perform comparative dynamics. Finally, in the 2 x 2 case, the vector field induced by the limit-price dynamics is real-analytic. Non-tatonnement, price-quantity dynamics, limit-price mechanism, myopia, computable general equilibrium. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{practical}} and inexpensive approach for the acquisition and rendering of static incident light fields. Incident light fields {{can be used}} for lighting virtual scenes or to insert virtual objects into real world video footage. The virtual objects are correctly lit and cast shadows {{in the same way as}} real objects in the scene. We propose to use an inexpensive planar mirror and a high dynamic range video camera to record incident light fields quickly, making our method suitable for outdoor use. The mirror serves as a moving virtual camera sampling the light field. To render with the acquired data we propose a hardware accelerated rendering algorithm that reproduces the complex lighting and shadows of the 4 D light field.
