40|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>co-operative</b> <b>law</b> {{as well as}} the practical application of <b>co-operative</b> <b>law</b> produces much controversy regarding the openness of the membership of a co-operative to legal persons. This issue also concerns the legal construction of a co-operative of legal persons, i. e. a co-operative institution which shall only admit legal persons. This may be possible because the authors of the statutes of co-operatives formed exclusively for legal persons, exercising the powers provided for in the statutory rights, anticipate an important derogation from one of the basic principles of an idea of a co-operative, i. e. the principle that “one member stands for one vote”, and favour a principle that the number of votes at the AGM should depend on the number of shares brought into the co-operative. If this view is implemented, the consequent situation will be that a co-operative of legal persons would work on almost exactly the same principles as those provided for in the code of commercial companies, and in particular to those applicable to limited liability companies. Hence, one of the objectives {{of this paper is to}} discuss the real need of continuing the effort to maintain this legal situation. This paper and the interest in the subject was prompted by the draft of a new law on co-operatives developed on the initiative of the President of the Republic of Poland. Besides the issues related to the co-operatives formed by legal persons, the paper also deals with a number of proposals of individual statutory norms regulating the status of craftsmen, student, or social co-operatives.

40|$|In Germany exist a {{large number}} of co-operatives that are engaged in a broad variety of {{business}} activities. Their organisational structure is determined by <b>co-operative</b> <b>law</b> and to a lesser degree by statutes or by-laws. As has been shown for German rural co-operatives by applying property rights theory the corporate governance structure as determined by law is formally still in existence, while it actually has been shifted in favour of the executive board. This has created an imbalance where on the one hand no longer any corporate governance is actually taking place while on the other hand members' interests may easily be neglected, because it is the executive board that determines the members' interests and also whether they have benefited from the cooperatives activities. In theory, suitable instruments to improve the corporate governance structure within such co-operative are the promotion plan and the promotion report as developed by Boettcher. However, for transaction cost reasons and due to the current attenuation of property rights, it is unlikely that these instruments will be implemented without outside pressure, e. g. through a change in cooperative law. A superior alternative to promotion plan and promotion report may be a combination of promotion task controlling and member oriented quality management. While such instruments would indeed improve members' ability to execute co-operative governance, managers' willingness to submit themselves to stronger governance may well be assumed to be very low. Taking into account the current distribution of property rights in big German co-operatives, managers will accept stronger governance structures only if some other incentives exist. An ongoing research project indicates that such incentives might exist in the realm of improved business opportunities due to better information about members' aims and needs. [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study to}} {{understand}} and interpret the governance structure of and the pattern of development followed by farmer co-operatives in China. China's farmer co-operatives have developed rapidly since the Farmers <b>Co-operative</b> <b>Law</b> came into force in 2007. Unlike their counterparts in western democratic capitalist systems, however, farmer co-operatives in China are owned and controlled by individuals and groups other than farmers [...] the resulting structure {{is referred to as}} the Company+Household (C+H) co-operative. As a result, the small farmers who make up the majority of members have very little participation or control in these organizations. This thesis also uses the development of farmer co-operatives as a lens through which Chinese agriculture and rural development can be viewed and understood. The proposition examined in the thesis is that the pattern of co-operative development is the expected outcome given the challenges that China is facing in its agricultural sector, China's economic development goals, and the political economy of the country. The thesis examines the governance structure [...] i. e., the way in which business entities are structured and controlled [...] of C+H cooperatives using political economy theories. This theory argues that corporate governance structures reflect public policy choices. These policy choices are fundamentally the result of political decisions, decisions that are heavily influenced by the preferences and power resources of different groups in a society, as well as by the existing political and economic institutions. China's political economy shapes ``a capitalism with Chinese characteristics. ' All capitalist systems require mechanisms that coordinate decisions and expectations. Due to a lack of institutionalized trust (e. g., trust created by reliance on the rule of law and independent judiciaries), China relies on other mechanisms for this coordination. Meanwhile, minority shareholder protections (e. g., auditing and disclosure rules) are virtually absent. The outcome is an economic system in which a blockholder ownership pattern emerges as the most effective governance structure, with the state and large investors (both of which have close personal ties to other investors and other state officials) as the blockholders. Within this system, there is little room for the small investor. Consequently, China's political economy provides an environment in which farmer co-operatives that are owned and operated by small farmers, and in which the state and large private interests are largely absent, would be very unlikely to exist. The thesis also uses industrial organization theory to analyze C+H co-operatives in the context of agricultural industrialization. The argument developed in this thesis suggests that C+H cooperatives have also emerged as the most likely organizational structure for reasons unique to the agricultural sector. Specifically, the industrialization that has occurred in agriculture around the world during the last two decades has created a need for much greater coordination within agricultural supply chains as companies within this chain attempt to provide a rapidly increasing range of products that must meet increasingly higher standards of consistency, quality and safety. Therefore, agro-processors increasingly specify the type and quality of product produced by farmers, who are often contractually required to buy inputs from and to sell output to a particular processor. A key outcome of the research in this thesis is that the development of farmer co-operatives has to be seen as an endogenous response to the political and economic interests operating in China at the time the <b>co-operative</b> <b>law</b> was introduced. The beliefs and associated behaviours of those that benefit from the emergence of this particular policy helped to enforce and reinforce the emergence of new organizational forms that further perpetuate the power of those that initially benefitted. This self reinforcement (i. e., positive feedback) creates path dependency, which in turn explains the persistence of high modernism, capitalism with Chinese characteristics and patron-client structures, all of which contributed to formation of C+H cooperatives. The C+H co-operatives not only have a governance structure that fits into the political structure, but they provide a large degree of control by the company (i. e., the agro-processor) over the decisions made by farmers, which are crucial to meet the coordination needs of modern supply chain. The conclusion is that the political and economic institutions in China today do not provide an enabling environment for the establishment and the success of farmer self-help groups. As a consequence of both China's larger political economy and the conditions specific to agriculture, it is to be expected that the C+H model of a co-operative has emerged as the dominant organizational form for co-operatives in China...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{efforts to}} develop and promote co-operatives and the social economy confront a tension in the {{competing}} and often conflicting aims to achieve commercial sustainability in a capitalist market while also promoting social transformation. Through {{a review of the}} historical experience of institutionalization in the Co-operative Movement in the United Kingdom, this article attempts to generate insights into these tensions. Despite being seen as unpolitical, co-operatives can be understood as political at the level of re-shaping sociality through co-operative practice. Although the similarity between co-operatives and joint-stock companies produces ambiguities within the movement, this does not in itself detract from the co-operative project. It is argued that the codification of <b>co-operatives</b> in <b>law</b> as bodies corporate constitutes the closure of the political aspect of co-operation and reinforces and gives consequence to the misconception of co-operatives as primarily commercial entities. Los esfuerzos por desarrollar y promover las cooperativas y la economía social se enfrentan a un conflicto entre los objetivos contrapuestos de lograr la sostenibilidad comercial en un mercado capitalista, a la vez que se promueve una transformación de la sociedad. Realizando una revisión de la experiencia histórica de la institucionalización del movimiento cooperativista en el Reino Unido, este artículo pretende analizar estas tensiones. A pesar de ser apolíticas, las cooperativas se pueden entender como un elemento político por su intento de reformular la sociedad. Aunque la similitud entre cooperativas y sociedades anónimas produce ambigüedades dentro del movimiento cooperativista, esto no va, por sí mismo, en detrimento del proyecto de cooperación. Se argumenta que, al contemplar en la legislación a las cooperativas como personas jurídicas, se acaba con el aspecto político de las cooperativas. A su vez, esto refuerza y termina con la idea errónea de las cooperativas como entes básicamente comerciales. DOWNLOAD THIS PAPER FROM SSRN: [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|In China, {{under the}} {{transition}} from a central-planning to a socialist market economy, new cooperatives, as member-based organizations pursuing economic and social objectives, are evolving at fast pace. They have {{played an important role in}} rural local development in times of crises that have made most of the rural population of 700 million people the largest vulnerable group in Chinese society. The new co-operatives in China that are under review in this dissertation are known as shareholding co-operatives. Generally speaking, this shareholding co-operative system is regarded as a hybrid form of co-operation, combining orthodox co-operative principles with an alternative shareholding system. Shareholding co-operation based on land use and agricultural production are the two most common types. On the one hand, these new cooperatives resemble the recent organizational forms that have been defined as social enterprises emerging in the West, due to their features of multiple stakeholder ownership, their multi-purpose character and their community orientation. On the other hand, the shareholding co-operatives operate in a different way than the ones recognized by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA), due to their investors profile in capital acquisition (i. e. potential dominance of members with large shares and allowing investment from outsiders) and governance systems (i. e. a flexible voting system rather than a prescriptive system of one member one vote). The departure point of most traditional theoretical reflections on the new co-operative development in China is its inconsistency with the internationally recognized ICA-type of co-operatives. But with regard to why and how these new co-operatives operate in a deviated way from the ideal, orthodox co-operative model, academic writings are unable to provide a consistent explanation. The absence of a sound explanation for the peculiar development of the Chinese co-operative model has made this research exploratory in nature. The general approach of this study is theory elaboration, formulated by grounded theory methodologists. This is operationalized through a multiple-case study design. Cases were identified by using a theoretical sampling during the fieldwork in three municipality-level locales in Zhejiang province between 2009 and 2011. Following a constructivist approach within the grounded theory methodology, this research uses an institutional approach as a theoretical focus. The objective of this current study is twofold. First, it aims at analyzing how new cooperatives in China emerged and evolved, and particularly, how the change in the organizational field may have engendered the emergence of formal, regulative institutions (i. e. the national <b>co-operative</b> <b>law).</b> Second, this study attempts to explore why and how new cooperatives behave the way they do, which tends to deviate from the ideal, conventional cooperative model. Through these explorations, the dissertation makes a heuristic attempt to understanding the Chinese state-society relationship from an alternative perspective. To these ends, the research first re-examined the discourse on civil society dynamics in China by analyzing it from the perspective of the new rural co-operative movement. It then looked at the new co-operative practice in rural China by providing its historical account and powerand- resources related analyses, by examining its capital formation and its decision-making mechanisms. Afterwards, the concept of social economy was proposed in the Chinese context. Based on the results of the exploratory research, a theoretical framework was conceptualized at the end of the dissertation. This framework revealed the underlying dynamics of phenomena that played out over time. The theoretical framework integrated theories located at three distinct levels of analysis. At the level of the external environment, it analyzed how shifts in the broad environments engender or transform the opportunities and constraints to create formal institutions. At the institutional level, it provided an analysis of the opportunities and constraints bounded by emergent, formal institutions and how those opportunities and constraints influence the ways actors behave. At the level of actors, it focused on the action arena in which actors behavior took place depending on exogenous variables found in local situations (i. e. situations indicating both informal and formal institutions), together with actors recognition of identities and preferences. Overall, the key findings of this exploratory research suggested that an institutional change process has taken place, either as a result of institutionalization, or because of the process of rule interpretation and adaptation. This theoretical framework explains the new co-operative development in China as a context and process-specific phenomenon. It can help to understand how new co-operatives behaved the way they did, and how they emerged, evolved, and operated in reality. It can be used by future scholars in organizational behavior and co-operative studies, to interpret how the reality is constructed. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism uncovered by this theoretical conceptualization reflects a constitutive approach, to understand the interplay between actions and institutions. Hence, it contributes to the literature bridging the intra-organizational and institutional levels of analysis. After elaborating the theoretical framework, I provided an overall reflection from conceptual, theoretical, methodological and policy perspectives. Conceptually, the examination of shareholding co-operatives as new hybrids clarified how they can transform from a traditional into an innovative form of social enterprises, and how they can fit into the Chinese context of rural society at the same time. Theoretically, this research, by developing multiple-lens explanations of the new co-operative practice, helped to enrich ones understanding of cooperative development from a context-and-history perspective. Methodologically, the present study contributed to ongoing discussions on general fieldwork methodology literature by sharing extensive empirical experience. Besides, it provided an example of risk minimizing strategies in the application of grounded theory. Finally, the research contributed to the policy debate on the shareholding co-operative system and its potential as a possible solution to the rural problems in China. status: publishe...|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} private members' bills related to {{consumer}} affairs, {{put forward by}} <b>Co-operative</b> MPs, became <b>law</b> under the first Wilson government, {{and much of the}} consumer legislation taken for granted by contemporary British shoppers {{can be attributed to the}} legislation passed during this period. In 1968 the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 (the [...] "shoppers' charter") was enacted by parliament, and a farm and garden chemicals bill also became law that same year. Other co-operative bills enacted during this period included a new Clean Air Act, a bill removing restrictions on off-licences, and a bill to promote agriculture co-operatives passed in 1967, which established [...] "A scheme administered by a new Central Council for Agriculture and Horticulture Co-operation with a budget to organise and promote co-operation with agriculture and horticulture". The 1970 Chronically Sick & Disabled Persons Act, regarded as a groundbreaking measure, was the first kind of legislation in the world to recognise and give rights to disabled people, and set down specific provisions to improve access and support for people with disabilities. [...] The government effectively supported the passage of these bills by granting them the necessary parliamentary time.|$|R
50|$|Bonds's {{trial was}} set for March 2, 2009, but delayed by appeals, after the judge {{excluded}} drugs tests and other evidence {{that could not be}} specifically tied to Bonds without the testimony of Greg Anderson, who is alleged to have provided steroids to Barry Bonds when he was Bonds personal trainer and linked to Bay Area Laboratory <b>Co-operative</b> (BALCO). <b>Law</b> professor Peter Keane called the prosecutors' move a blunder, although an account by another published attorney disagreed. In June 2010, however, the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the evidence should be excluded. On August 7, 2010, it was reported that U.S. District Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco had rescheduled the trial for March 21, 2011. On Friday, December 17, 2010, it was reported that attorneys for Bonds, citing the appeals court ruling, filed papers asking the judge to forbid testimony of current and former baseball players linked to BALCO or the steroids scandal, and not to permit use of Anderson's drug ledgers and calendars, as well as other documents from BALCO which the prosecution was seeking to use at the trial in spite of the appeals court ruling.On January 10, 2011, lawyers for Bonds filed additional papers asking the judge not to permit use of Anderson as a witness by the prosecution (since, given his previous unwillingness to testify, it was presumed he would again decline), nor to allow prosecutors to tell the jury about any refusal of Anderson to testify, nor permit use of a reported tape of Anderson talking to Steve Hoskins, previously a business manager of Bonds.The judge had already excluded evidence which could not be connected to Bonds because of Anderson's refusal to testify about his alleged knowledge of Bonds' alleged connection to the evidence. The same applies to several other pieces of evidence, which Bonds' attorneys asked to be excluded in the January 10, 2011 filing. A hearing was set to be held on the exclusion of the testimony and the additional evidence on January 21, 2011. A report in the New York Times had earlier suggested it was likely that Bonds would not get prison time even if convicted, after pro cyclist Tammy Thomas received house arrest and probation for similar crimes in the BALCO scandal, in a case decided by the very same judge presiding over the Bonds case.|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the use of}} social work services by East London attorneys in criminal law matters. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and the data was saturated after 10 such interviews. In exploring the use of social work services, the study also considered the challenges and constraints experienced by lawyers {{in their use of}} expert witnesses from the Humanities generally; discussed the expectations lawyers have of expert witnesses and the presentencing reports they write and described the perceived impact of social work services on the presentation of cases in criminal matters. The focus on social work was aimed at exploring ways of increasing the use of social work as the profession of choice when attorneys call on expert witnesses. The literature revIew focussed on the individualisation of sentences, the general principles of punishment, finding an appropriate sentence, the so-called Triad of Zinn, the role of the social worker in criminal justice, the role of the legal social worker, the report, courtroom skills and the relationship between social work values and the law. Using purposive sampling of all legal firms in East London doing criminal work, ten attorneys were asked to participate in the study. A semi-structured interview based on a schedule of questions was used. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were analysed thematically. After ten interviews no new data was being generated and the topic was considered saturated. Further research is needed to build on the themes that emerged. The study argues that there is a place for social work services in criminal matters. It also, however, revealed that some of the respondents had had negative experiences when dealing with social workers. There were also positive responses and a commitment to establishing a more <b>co-operative</b> relationship between <b>law</b> and social work. Based on the research findings, the most important recommendation was to develop communication between the two professions and to provide inter-disciplinary training so as to promote an understanding of the roles and expectations of all involved in the criminal law process...|$|R
40|$|Renowned for the {{potential}} in alleviating poverty, co-operative movement has been encouraged {{and supported by the}} government. This research investigates co-operative performances and efficiency in Malaysia using quantitative and qualitative methods. The first essay revealed that co-operatives’ role in economic development is still relevant. Credit and banking co-operatives had contributed to the movement’s growth and development. The National Co-operative Plans are important blueprint for co-operative development in the country. Investigation on factors influencing co-operative membership in the second essay revealed that membership is favourable to the older age groups as compared to younger age groups. Those working in government sector {{are more likely to be}} members. The duration of membership and frequency in annual general meeting attendance are found to be positively related to co-operative shareholding. An analysis on satisfaction and perception of co-operative performance showed that patrons are satisfied with the quality and reliability of goods and services. There are positive perceptions on the benefits of co-operation and on the role of co-operative in economic development and community wellbeing. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) of co-operative membership target groups in the third essay showed the co-operative groups’ efficiency score of 0. 605 or equivalent to 65. 3 percent inefficiency level in producing outputs. Co-operatives have operational “slacks” and inefficient resource usage. Tobit regression showed that turnover, equity and members are significant in influencing efficiency scores of co-operatives. Comparison of efficiency and productivity level of Bank Rakyat with conventional banks showed that Bank Rakyat was among the top five banks. Further analysis by including 5 other Islamic banks brought it to top six positions. The source of total factor productivity progress was technological progress while technical efficiency change remained stagnant. Tobit regression analysis revealed that loan intensity and assets were significant in determining the efficiency scores. Environmental factors are significant in influencing technological and scale efficiencies. Bank’s status (co-operative or Islamic) is significant in influencing technical and pure technical efficiency of banks. Action research in the last essay reviewed that co-operative establishment requires local communities involvement in decision-making process, human capabilities enhancement programmes, empowerment, entrepreneurial spirits, leadership qualities and local community commitments. Of the three community co-operatives in Marine Park Islands, Tioman achieved highest while Redang experienced moderate progress. Tinggi co-operative failed because lack of leadership, commitment and entrepreneurial spirits. Although co-operatives in Tioman and Redang have {{the potential}} to be the vehicle in alternative livelihoods strategy and social cohesion objectives, the co-operatives are faced with ample challenges. This research contributes towards an economic approach in performance evaluation of co-operatives in Malaysia. The high percentage of inefficient co-operatives revealed had provided empirical evidence that achievement of the Second National Co-operative Plan goals by 2015 will be affected. Results and recommendations from study are important for improvement of current <b>co-operative</b> management, policies, <b>laws</b> and regulations in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|So {{much has}} been written about the {{adoption}} of Free Schools in the UK (a close equivalent of Charter Schools proposed for Australia) but so far there are only 170 with 86, 000 students across a nation serving 8. 2 million school children, with a further 125 new free schools due to open in September 2014. Free Schools are new institutions built from scratch and need a lot to succeed; highly motivated founders – preferably rooted in the community, skilled teachers and managers, supportive parents convinced of a need for a new school that demonstrates an ability to attract a roll of students – and all this before money and facilities can be addressed. So it should be no surprise that Free Schools have been slow getting off the ground, and have come in for a high degree of criticism from teachers’ bodies and local authorities.   A small number of Free School failures have challenged the Government’s adherence to a policy that is increasingly seen as marginal to mainstream education and over-demanding of policy makers’ attention. Yet there is a less well known, much quieter revolution taking place in the way schools are run in the UK.   A locally led, co-operative model of management has been spearheaded and now accounts for more than 700 Co-operative Trust schools, with a further 230 in the process of adopting this new model. These schools are not new, rather they are conversions of existing community schools, which were previously run by local councils.   They have seized the opportunity to separate from local authority control to become legally independent, employing their own teachers and other staff and providing public education in accordance with their new inclusive structural approach.   They continue to work to the national curriculum, mainstream educational standards and national pay and conditions for staff. They have adopted new governance arrangements that give membership to parents and staff alike - hard wiring a close relationship with their two main stakeholder groups to ensure that they remain close to the people that they exist to serve. This has all been brought about by a completely different approach to that adopted for Free Schools.   No Government policy has been designed to promote co-operative trusts, rather they are a variant on a theme that has taken root because of the enthusiasm of teachers and parents alone. The manner in which they have come about is useful to know.   All schools are able to take advantage of a regime that permits them to establish their own trust that takes responsibility for running the school from the local council.   But one school based near Manchester, Reddish Vale School, pioneered the adoption of a trust with a twist.   Not only would the trust be separate from the local authority, but it would empower parents and teachers by establishing a new co-operative which was owned and controlled by them. In common with the many new mutuals providing public services in the UK, this was all brought about through the successful piloting of the new structure, testing different features of the model and refining it from this experience. Firstly, a policy paper was published by Mutuo and the Co-operative College, which described the ambition for establishing a co-operative trust.   This sought to explain to politicians and educational experts, including in Government, what was intended by the pilot. Then, legal and educational experts from the UK co-operative movement worked with teachers at Reddish Vale to decide how such a school would work within the existing legislation. The intention was to create a model co-operative trust, which could be adapted for use in different schools and then replicated on a free-to-use basis by any school that wanted to. The new variant model was stress tested, and ran as a pilot, which was observed by others with similar ambitions.   Soon, the success of the pilot school at Reddish Vale was clear and this model was then made available to others to replicate in their own communities.   In just a few years, the model has been very popular and has been adopted by many different types of school. Since the first trust was established, a range of forms of the co-operative trust model have been developed:- 	A single school co-operative trust 	A cluster trust with several schools within the trust 	Hybrid models involving academies and trusts This approach should be looked at closely by Australian educationalists.   It shows how with a simple pilot, it is possible to develop a sophisticated and popularly inclusive way of running schools.   It does not require new schools to be established and it builds on existing expertise and academic qualities.   Peter Hunt, CEO Mutuo UK www. mutuo. co. uk Peter Hunt founded Mutuo in 2001 as the first cross mutual sector body to promote mutual business to opinion formers and decision makers. Peter has twenty years’ experience in the mutual sector, working with co-operatives, mutuals and employee owned businesses. For ten years, he was General Secretary of the Co-operative Party. In 1999, he was a co-founder and secretary of Supporters Direct, the football supporters’ initiative, which has gone on to establish over 100 supporters’ trusts at professional football clubs. He led the Parliamentary teams which piloted four private members bills through the UK Parliament, working with all parties to update <b>co-operative</b> & mutual <b>law</b> and encouraging employee ownership. Since 2004, he has worked closely on a number of public sector structural reforms, including NHS Foundation Trusts, advising both Government and Trust Boards on the adoption of new membership structures. In 2011, he advised the Coalition Government on its plans to mutualise Post Office Ltd and in 2012 published the report of the Ownership Commission, a two year study into corporate diversity. In 2013 Peter was been appointed by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls to lead a policy review for UK Labour on increasing the role of mutuals in the financial sector and wider economy. • Peter Hunt will be in Australia on a speaking tour from 12 - 17 March - click here for details of events to hear more from Peter Hunt: [URL] Image: student hands, Edyta Pawlowska / shutterstock  ...|$|R
