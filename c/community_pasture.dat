Because of their underlying richness and organic content of 7 - 8 percent, the Fescue grasslands ( [...] or prairie wool as it was called [...] ) were quickly broken, leaving only small fragments today. Prior to settlement, the ecosystem was shaped by periods of drought, frequent fires and intense but sporadic grazing by large herds of bison which tended to follow the richer Fescue pastures along the valleys, and find water and mineral salts in the long marshes in the valley bottoms. Antelope were the only other abundant grazer. The Buffalo Wolf was the top predator, and its dens were often located in the sandier soils and steep coulees associated with Wolf or Silver Willow ( [...] known as mahihkanahtik or Wolf Shrub in the Cree language).

By 1937, the act was amended to remove unsuitable land from cultivation permanently, and develop federally controlled community pastures. Settlers on unsuitable land were relocated to reduce relief expenditures, and farmers on quality land could balance their operations by grazing livestock on nearby pastures. The first ten years of the <b>community</b> <b>pasture</b> program (1937 - 1947) represented an important stage in the federal interpretation of the prairie region.

Efforts to develop community pastures were complicated however, by economic, political and social circumstances. By the five-year mark of the program, pasture development was at a virtual standstill. But as federal rehabilitation officials negotiated with prairie governments and private landowners for control of land in community pastures, the region was increasingly understood.

40|$|Vast {{areas of}} central Saskatchewan are {{occupied}} by aspen groves, aspen forest and mixed-wood (Rowe, 1959). A {{part of the}} aspen forest has been cleared and is now utilized as pastures. These pastures may {{be referred to as}} 'wooded', 'bushland' or 'northern wooded' pastures. Though, historically, the utilization of the wooded pastures {{can be traced back to}} the times of early settlers, their development as government sponsored pasture dates back to the early 1940 's. While the first government <b>community</b> <b>pasture</b> in the grassland zone was established in 1922 at Matador (Moen, 1964), it was not until 1941 that a <b>community</b> <b>pasture</b> was set up at Beaver Hills in the forest zone. By the early 1950 's it became obvious that the livestock industry was being greatly hampered by insufficient grazing facilities. The pastures in the grassland region could not cope with the increasing demand for grazing needs due to low carrying capacity as a result of frequent droughts. In the northern fringe of settlement there were still present vast areas of unutilized submarginal lands under aspen forest. The soil under aspen forest is podzolic, often low in fertility, of sandy texture, stony and poorly drained in low lying areas so that its tillage for cereal crops was not feasible. The importance of wooded pastures would further increase with the rising demand of beef production. Haase (1964) has outlined the need and importance of increased forage production in Canada. He suggested that an additional 15 million acres of improved land would be needed by 1980. The investigators in various fields discussed effectively the problems and needed fields of study in the establishment of northern wooded pastures in a meeting on "The development of pasture from bushlands in western Canada" under the auspecies of Canada Department of Agriculture in 1964. Perhaps, the most important aspect of the problems that were discussed at the meeting, was the need for understanding the response of vegetation, native as well as seeded, to grazing. The present study was undertaken primarily to consider the effect of grazing on herbaceous vegetation in wooded pastures. This involved the selection and study of comparable grazed and ungrazed stands under three different 'habitat' types: forest; forest, cleared; and forest, cleared, ploughed and seeded. The study sites were located in areas, potentially capable of supporting aspen forest on podzolic, degraded black or grey wooded soil. Populus tremuloides is the dominant tree species and Fragaria vesca, Lathyrus venosus, Vicia americana, Aster ciliolatus, Galium septentrionale, Thalictrum dasycarpum, Bromus ciliatus, Agropyron subsecundum and Schizachne purpurascens are the common herb species in undisturbed sites.

Rainfall in the region averages between 353 mm to 873 mm; variability is high, with coefficients of variation ranging from. 21 to. 68. Anectdotal evidence implies that the vulnerability of pastoralist households to drought is increasing; stock levels increase dramatically during good rainfall years but plummet when rainfall is poor, indicating that the drought cycle is becoming more pronounced.

The Kangayam region {{is known for its}} prized Kangayam breed of cattle developed by one individual called Rai Bahadur Nallathambi Sarkarai of the Pattagar family in the late 19 th century (Gunn 1909). Kangayam cattle were established as an important draft breed in south India. Although the Kangayam breed is well known in south India, very little information is available about the grazing tracts and the animal production system where it was developed. A second reason for initiating this study arose from the policy level, where discussions are often held about the development of grazing land and <b>community</b> <b>pasture</b> in the country. It is said that technologies exist to revitalize the grasslands but sustainable community management and equitable distribution of benefits could not be achieved because of conflicts and vested interests. Questions are also asked at the policy level if there is a successful model which could be replicated elsewhere. It is with these issues at hand that a study was initiated in the Kangayam region to pinpoint the key to success of the sustainable system which is difficult to find in tropical regions.|$|E
40|$|My {{thesis is}} a novel-length work of {{historical}} fiction entitled Thickwood. The novel can be situated {{within the context}} of great/interior plains literature, given its substantial focus on the Thickwood Hills, the northern remnant of the Missouri Coteau. This transition zone between the plains and the mixed boreal forest is an area of geographical and cultural tension. Within this drainage system of the Saskatchewan Rivers, Europeans traded for food and furs with First Nations and Métis peoples, leading to the signing of Treaty 6 and the formation of First Nations Reserves. In Thickwood characters travel across the rugged landscape but also travel into their interior landscape to struggle with questions about belonging and place. During formative years of development, certain landscapes become places of significant attachment, laden with emotional connection and sentiment. This historical work, set in Saskatchewan in 1950, takes place during intense changes after World War Two. Many rural communities without power, good roads, and even telephone services struggled to keep up with post-war development. The cooperative movement, encouraged by Premier Tommy Douglas, was a means for rural people to pool resources to improve their communities. Beef prices were climbing to an all-time high, increasing demand for pastureland. Using close third-person point of view, the novel follows a young female character skilled in ranching, horses, and the sport of baseball. Willomena Swift struggles to find a future for herself after returning from two seasons pitching in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The lease to her family ranch is about to end and her father sells the remaining land to the growing <b>community</b> <b>pasture.</b> After a rogue stallion kills Willo’s purebred foal, she begins a quest to control the stallion and avoid its villainous owner, who is also the pasture committee chairman.
