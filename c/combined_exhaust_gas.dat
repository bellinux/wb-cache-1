40|$|Exhaust Gas Fuel Reforming has {{potential}} {{to be used for}} on-board generation of hydrogen rich gas, reformate, and to act as an energy recovery system allowing the capture of waste exhaust heat. High <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> temperature drives endothermic reforming reactions that convert hydrocarbon fuel into gaseous fuel when <b>combined</b> with <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> over a catalyst - the result is an increase in overall fuel energy that is proportional to waste energy capture. The paper demonstrates how the combustion of reformate in a direct injection gasoline (GDI) engine via Reformed Exhaust Gas Recirculation (REGR) can be beneficial to engine performance and emissions. Bottled reformate was inducted into a single cylinder GDI engine at a range of engine loads to compare REGR to conventional EGR. The reformate composition was selected to approximate reformate produced by <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> fuel reforming at typical gasoline engine exhaust temperatures. The decision was guided by data from experimental work carried out by Johnson Matthey using a reforming catalyst developed for the fuel reforming application. The engine test results show improved combustion stability with REGR; this allows for higher recirculation rates and increased combustion mixture dilution. This is significant as it could allow for a higher fraction of fuel to be reformed, and therefore waste energy captured. REGR results in a large NOx reduction and a reduction in HCs relative to EGR. The effects of REGR on Particulate Matter (PM) emissions were also analysed, concluding that REGR reduces PM mass compared to conventional EGR...|$|R

Although post-combustion capture via chemical absorption is now a mature technology, the separation of CO 2 from flue gases shows many issues, including the solvent degradation and the high regeneration energy requirement, that in turn reduces the power plant performances. Focusing on a triple pressure and reheat <b>combined</b> cycle with <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation, this paper aims to evaluate the potential impacts of integrating a post-combustion capture system, based on an absorption process with monoethanolamine solvent. Energy and economic performances of the integrated system are evaluated varying the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation fraction and the CO 2 capture ratio. The different configurations examined are then compared in terms of efficiency and rated capacity of the integrated system, as well as considering the cost of electricity generated and the cost of CO 2 avoided...|$|R

In this research, CO 2 -based transcritical Rankine cycle (CTRC) was used for fully combining the wastes heats.

In order to <b>combine</b> the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> and pass them through the HRU a Barometric Thermal Trap (BaTT) was designed and installed. An inline fan is installed downstream of the BaTT unit.

In order to determine the characteristic factors affecting the flow {{into and out of the}} BaTT and finding optimized flow conditions, a model of the BaTT was created using software suite, FLUENT??. The analysis of turbulence is based on the standard k-?? turbulent model.

The most desirable condition for maximum heat recovery appears to be at a pressure of - 40 Pa at the top outlet.

The effects of air and <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> dilution on the CAI combustion {{of a range of}} fuels including three gasoline compositions, four primary reference fuels, and two alcohols are experimentally investigated using a single cylinder research engine. Two of the three gasolines tested are manufactured from standard gasoline during engine operation by a novel fuel system, designed to improve the performance of both controlled autoignition and spark ignition engines. A series of experimental tests are performed to establish the satisfactory <b>combined</b> air and <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> dilution regions for each fuel. Detailed in-cylinder pressure and <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> speciation measurements are taken, and the fuels are compared and contrasted for their performance in terms of power output, fuel consumption, and harmful exhaust emissions. Results show that alcohol fuels are superior to hydrocarbon fuels for controlled autoignition combustion because their autoignition characteristics are less affected by the presence of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> species. Furthermore, the timing of autoignition is shown to be of minor importance for achieving efficient and stable controlled autoignition combustion, contrary to widely held beliefs. In addition, the novel fuel system is developed and commissioned for use on a single cylinder research engine operating with a spark ignition system. The two gasoline fuels produced by the system are evaluated individually for their knocking combustion characteristics over a range of compression ratios and spark advances. Results from these tests indicate that the fuel system used in conjunction with a specially modified production engine may allow the normal compression ratio of that engine to be increased by up to 1. 0, increasing its efficiency.

40|$|Hydrogen-fueled {{internal}} combustion engines equipped with {{port fuel injection}} offer a cheap alternative to fuel cells and can be run in bi-fuel operation side-stepping the chicken and egg problem of availability of hydrogen fueling station versus hydrogen vehicle. Hydrogen engines with external mixture formation have a significantly lower power output than gasoline engines. The main causes are the lower volumetric energy density of the externally formed hydrogen-air mixture and the occurrence of abnormal combustion phenomena (mainly backfire). Two engine test benches were used to investigate different means of compensating for this power loss, while keeping oxides of nitrogen (NO x) emissions limited. A single cylinder research engine was used to {{study the effects of}} supercharging, <b>combined</b> with <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation (EGR). Supercharging the engine results in an increase in power output. The combination with EGR permits stoichiometric operation and thus low NO x emissions because of the resulting high aftertreatment efficiency. Furthermore, the power output can be varied through the supercharging pressure and the EGR percentage, enabling throttle-less operation and thus higher engine efficiencies. A four-cylinder production gasoline engine was converted to bi-fuel operation and was used to study the effects of continuously variable intake valve timing on power output, efficiency, emissions and the occurrence of backfire when operated on hydrogen. The engine efficiency on hydrogen is compared to gasoline operation...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{pressure}} {{development in a}} combustion chamber is uniquely related to the combustion process, substantial variations in the combustion process on a cycle-by-cycle basis are occurring. To this end, an experimental study of cycle-by-cycle variation in a direct injection spark ignition engine fueled with natural gas-hydrogen blends <b>combined</b> with <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation at relative air-fuel ratios was conducted. The impacts of relative air-fuel ratios (i. e. λ = 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 3 and 1. 4 which represent stoichiometric, moderately lean, lean and very lean mixtures respectively), hydrogen fractions and EGR rates were studied. The results showed that increasing the relative air-fuel ratio increases the COVIMEP. The behavior is more pronounced at the larger relative air-fuel ratios. More so, for a specified EGR rate; increasing the hydrogen fractions decreases the maximum COVIMEP value just as increasing in EGR rates increases the maximum COVIMEP value. (i. e. When percentage EGR rates is increased from 0 % to 17 % and 20 % respectively. The maximum COVIMEP value increases from 6. 25 % to 6. 56 % and 8. 30 % respectively). Since the introduction of hydrogen gas reduces the cycle-by-cycle combustion variation in engine cylinder; thus {{it can be concluded}} that addition of hydrogen into direct injection compressed natural gas engine employing EGR at various relative air-fuel ratios is a viable approach to obtain an improved combustion quality which correspond to lower coefficient of variation in imep, (COVIMEP) in a direct injection compressed natural gas engine employing EGR at relative air-fuel ratios...|$|R
