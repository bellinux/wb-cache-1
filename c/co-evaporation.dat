50|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} (CVD) {{has been}} implemented in multiple ways for the deposition of CIGS. Processes include atmosphere pressure metal organic CVD (AP-MOCVD), plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), low-pressure MOCVD (LP-MOCVD), and aerosol assisted MOCVD (AA-MOCVD). Research {{is attempting to}} switch from dual-source precursors to single-source precursors. Multiple source precursors must be homogeneously mixed and the flow rates of the precursors have to be kept at the proper stoichiometry. Single-source precursor methods do not suffer from these drawbacks and should enable better control of film composition. As of 2014 CVD was not used for commercial CIGS synthesis. CVD produced films have low efficiency and a low VOC, partially {{a result of a}} high defect concentration. Additionally, film surfaces are generally quite rough which serves to further decrease the VOC. However, the requisite Cu deficiency has been achieved using AA-MOCVD along with a (112) crystal orientation. CVD deposition temperatures are lower than those used for other processes such as <b>co-evaporation</b> and selenization of metallic precursors. Therefore, CVD has a lower thermal budget and lower costs. Potential manufacturing problems include difficulties converting CVD to an inline process as well as the expense of handling volatile precursors.|$|E
40|$|For {{in-cylinder}} {{fuel mixture}} distribution measurement, {{a method for}} designing a multi-component fuel for planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) experiments is developed based on thermal gravity analysis and vapor-liquid equilibrium calculation. The {{goal is to create}} fuel that has a volatility similar to real gasoline and good <b>co-evaporation</b> ratios (near 1. 0) with tracers. Acetone, toluene, and trimethylbenzene are chosen as tracers for light, medium, and heavy fractions, respectively, and a five-component test fuel is developed. The test fuel is used to study the influence of components and temperature on <b>co-evaporation</b> ratios. Any variation in tracer or fuel component proportions affects all <b>co-evaporation</b> ratios, but a variation within 5 % is considered acceptable. Results show that acetone presents the most significant influence on <b>co-evaporation</b> ratios. Temperature is also a key factor. Saturated vapor pressure and activity coefficient of the tracer and components in a fraction group affect <b>co-evaporation</b> optimization substantially, indicating that these values are a primary consideration in tracer selection. Finally, the test fuel is applied to an in-cylinder gasoline direct injection fuel mixture distribution measurement using PLIF. Differences between light, medium, and heavy fraction groups are studied under different strategies. Cycle-to-cycle variation analysis shows that the influence of absorption attenuation of the aromatic is distinct in a typical stratified strategy.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} Povacoat on the solid state {{characteristics}} and polymorphic transformation of γ-form of indomethacin (γ-IMC) after solvent <b>co-evaporation</b> via two drying methods was investigated by thermoanalytical and FTIR spectroscopic studies.

A physical mixture of Povacoat and γ-IMC was also {{carried out by}} neat grinding process. The results indicate {{that there was no}} interaction between Povacoat and γ-IMC or no polymorphic change of γ-IMC after the neat co-grinding process. Since Povacoat was only soluble in water or[*]< 30 % ethanol aqueous solution but γ-IMC was only soluble in organic solvents, different solvents and drying methods might significantly influence the solid-state characteristics of IMC formed in the presence of Povacoat. It was found that the amorphous IMC was formed in the Povacoat/IMC evaporates after dissolving both Povacoat and γ-IMC in water:ethanol (mixed ratio= 1 : 9 and 2 : 8, v/v) and <b>co-evaporation</b> via microwave-drying, whereas the α-IMC was formed in the Povacoat/IMC evaporates via the air-drying method. In addition, the predominate α-IMC formation was only found in all the Povacoat/IMC evaporates with different weight ratios prepared by previously dissolving in water:ethanol (1 : 9, v/v) and <b>co-evaporation</b> via air-drying, but the amorphous IMC formation after <b>co-evaporation</b> via microwave-drying was obtained except the 4 : 10 (w/w) weight ratio.

30|$|Se 2 (CIS/CIGS) {{thin films}} are {{considered}} as a promising candidate for solar cells since they have a high light absorption coefficient (about 105 cm− 1), good radiation, and thermal stability [2 – 7]. Also, CIGS has a direct and tunable bandgap range from 1.04 to 1.72 eV owing to the components of indium and gallium. Moreover, photoelectrochemical water splitting property of CIGS has been discussed in works in recent years [8, 9]. Several methods {{have been reported to}} fabricate CIGS thin films such as <b>co-evaporation,</b> electrode position, selenization of sequentially stacked precursors, etc. [3, 10 – 12]. A high conversion efficiency of 19.9 % at laboratory scale was reported via a three-stage <b>co-evaporation</b> with a modified surface termination [3]. Also, the new record has been reported to achieving 20.3 % last year [13]. Both of them have high conversion efficiency, but they all have the same disadvantages that the method is sophisticated and needs an expensive vacuum technology. However, electrodeposition is a competitive method that is economic and convenient. It also has high deposition speed and can prepare large area films [14].

3000|$|Se 2 (CIGS) {{has emerged}} as one of the most {{promising}} materials for low cost and high-efficiency thin-film solar cells. CIGS possesses superior optical properties such as high absorption coefficient (α[*]~[*] 105  cm− 1), long-term stability, and high radiation tolerance, due to that it belongs to the family of direct band gap chalcopyrite semiconductor compounds. Moreover, its band gap can be engineered by the partial substitution of indium by gallium, which further renders the flexibility of manipulating the optical absorption [1]. Nowadays, various methods for preparing CIGS absorber layers have been implemented, including vacuum processes (<b>co-evaporation</b> [2], sputtering [3], and pulsed laser deposition [4]) and nonvacuum processes (ink-printing [5] and electrochemical deposition [6]). However, the high quality CIGS thin films for laboratory-scale or module-level solar cells are usually prepared by <b>co-evaporation</b> or sputtering processes. In general, <b>co-evaporation</b> and sputtering processes for growing CIGS thin films both include the metallic precursor deposition of Cu–In–Ga alloy and the subsequent two-step selenization process, which consists of an initial low temperature selenization in H 2 Se atmosphere followed by a high temperature annealing in inert gas.
