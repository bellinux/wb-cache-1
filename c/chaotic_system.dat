5|$|Weather is a <b>chaotic</b> <b>system</b> that {{is readily}} {{modified}} by small {{changes to the}} environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days. Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.|$|E
5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically <b>chaotic</b> <b>system</b> is positive.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a <b>chaotic</b> <b>system.</b> As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work describes the modelling of two novel 3 -D <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems,</b> the {{first with a}} hyperbolic sinusoidal nonlinearity and two quadratic nonlinearities (denoted as system (A)) and the second with a hyperbolic cosinusoidal nonlinearity and two quadratic nonlinearities (denoted as system (B)). In this work, a detailed qualitative analysis of the novel <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> (A) and (B) has been presented, and the Lyapunov exponents and Kaplan-Yorke dimension of these <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> have been obtained. It is found that the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) for the novel <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> (A) and (B) has a large value, viz. for the system (A) and for the system (B). Thus, both the novel <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> (A) and (B) display strong chaotic behaviour. This {{research work}} also discusses the problem of finding adaptive controllers for the global chaos synchronization of identical <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> (A), identical <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> (B) and nonidentical <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> (A) and (B) with unknown system parameters. The adaptive controllers for achieving global chaos synchronization of the novel <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> (A) and (B) have been derived using adaptive control theory and Lyapunov stability theory.

30|$|In recent years, chaos {{synchronization}} [1] {{of multiple}} <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> has became a much-studied topic in nonlinear research area. It {{is in favor}} of its potential applications in multilateral communications, secret signaling, and many other engineering fields [2, 3]. Various kinds of synchronization of multiple <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> have been discussed by using some advanced control techniques. Lü and Liu addressed complete synchronization of N coupled <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with chain and ring connection based on feedback control methods [4]. Tang and Fang extended the work of [4] to multiple fractional-order <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> [5]. Chen et al. used the direct design method to study complete synchronization, anti-synchronization and hybrid synchronization among multiple <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> [6, 7]. Sun et al. and Jiang et al. investigated generalized combination synchronization of multiple <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> in [8, 9], respectively. Sun et al. discussed compound synchronization among four memristor <b>chaotic</b> oscillator <b>systems</b> based on the adaptive techniques [10]. For a special ring connection structure of multiple <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems,</b> a new transmission synchronization mode of multiple <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> was proposed in [11]. Xi et al. proposed adaptive function projective combination synchronization of three different fractional-order <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> [12]. It {{should be pointed out that}} most of aforementioned results are only concerned with the synchronization of multiple systems based on knowing exactly the system parameters, and the influences of unknown parameters for such systems are not considered. In fact, <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> are unavoidably affected by unknown parameters, and it is hard to exactly know the values of the systems parameters in a priori. Thus, it is a challenging problem to study the synchronization among multiple <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with unknown parameters, which is the main motivation of this work.|$|R
25|$|Under {{the right}} {{conditions}}, chaos spontaneously evolves into a lockstep pattern. In the Kuramoto model, four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a <b>chaotic</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sensitivity {{to initial}} {{conditions}} means that each {{point in a}} <b>chaotic</b> <b>system</b> is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the Rössler map, are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Nonlinear jerk systems are in a sense minimally complex systems to show chaotic behaviour; there is no <b>chaotic</b> <b>system</b> involving only two first-order, ordinary differential equations (the system resulting in an equation of second order only).|$|E
30|$|The complex {{transformation}} matrix not only establishes {{a link between}} fractional-order real <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> and complex <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems,</b> but also sets up a bridge between two fractional-order complex <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems.</b> It increases the range of choosing fractional-order chaotic generators in the transmitters and receivers, thus an interceptor is harder to crack information sources.|$|R
30|$|The {{benefits}} of using fractional-order models of real dynamical objects and processes of applications appear in various fields {{of science and}} technology [6]. The synchronization of <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> has been implemented in many engineering applications with integer-order derivatives [7 – 11]. However, only a few works have been reported on the synchronization of fractional-order <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems,</b> since the proof of stability of fractional-order systems is more complex than the <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with integer-order derivatives [6]. Synchronization of <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> deals with asymptotically synchronizing the state trajectories of a pair of <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> called the master and slave systems. Many control techniques have been developed for the chaos synchronization of integer-order <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> such as active control [12 – 16], adaptive control [17 – 21], sliding mode control [22 – 25], backstepping control [26 – 28], fuzzy control [29, 30], and so on.|$|R
30|$|On another {{research}} frontier, {{adaptive control}} method [13] {{is an effective}} way to estimate the unknown parameters due to its advantages on witnessed rapid and impressive developments leading to global stability and tracking results for nonlinear systems. It has been successfully applied to synchronize <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with unknown parameters, and many important results have been presented. For example, Park studied adaptive synchronization of a unified <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with an unknown parameter [14, 15]. Zhang et al. proposed the adaptive controllers and adaptive laws to synchronize two different <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with unknown parameters [16]. In [17], the adaptive complete synchronization between <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with fully uncertain parameters were realized. Li et al. gave a deeply research on adaptive impulsive synchronization for fractional-order <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with unknown parameters [18]. In [19], adaptive synchronization of two different <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> was addressed by considering the time varying unknown parameters. Adaptive added-order and reduced-order anti-synchronization of <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> were investigated in [20, 21], respectively. He et al. made a thorough inquiry about synchronization of hyperchaotic systems with multiple unknown parameters [22]. Zhao et al. presented a discussion of chaos synchronization between the coupled systems on network with unknown parameters based on adaptive control method [23]. Liu developed adaptive anti-synchronization of <b>chaotic</b> complex nonlinear <b>systems</b> with unknown parameters [24]. Wu and Yang achieved the adaptive synchronization of coupled nonidentical <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with complex variables and stochastic perturbations [25]. However, all of these works only deal with the synchronization problems between two <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with unknown parameters. Up to now, no related results have been established for the synchronization of multiple <b>chaotic</b> <b>systems</b> with unknown parameters, which is another motivation of this paper.|$|R
25|$|Surface {{temperature}} {{differences in}} turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due {{to differences in}} compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The atmosphere is a <b>chaotic</b> <b>system,</b> and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is often}} possible, however, to make precise and {{accurate}} {{statements about the}} likelihood of a future state in a <b>chaotic</b> <b>system.</b> [...] If a (possibly chaotic) dynamical system has an attractor, then there exists a probability measure that gives the long-run proportion of time spent by the system in the various regions of the attractor.

[...] Hence, and fortunately, even if we know very little about the initial state of the logistic map (or some other <b>chaotic</b> <b>system),</b> we can still say something about the distribution of states arbitrarily far into the future, and use this knowledge to inform decisions based {{on the state of the}} system.|$|E
2500|$|For a <b>chaotic</b> <b>system</b> to have dense {{periodic}} orbits {{means that}} every {{point in the}} space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.

2500|$|An {{easy way}} to {{visualize}} a chaotic attractor is {{to start with a}} point in the basin of attraction of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit.

[...] This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the Lorenz weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known <b>chaotic</b> <b>system</b> diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but {{it is also one of}} the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern, that with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.|$|E

2500|$|Chaos theory {{concerns}} deterministic systems whose {{behavior can}} in principle be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable {{for a while}} and then 'appear' to become random. The amount of time that the behavior of a <b>chaotic</b> <b>system</b> can be effectively predicted depends on three things: How much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the Lyapunov time. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few [...] days (unproven); the solar system, 50 million years. In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases exponentially with elapsed time. Hence, mathematically, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast. This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears random.|$|E
