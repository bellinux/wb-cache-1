Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a possible result of the biopsy, and represents dysplastic <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> may eventually progress to invasive cancer. Most cases of cervical cancer are detected in this way, without having caused any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include vaginal bleeding, discharge, or discomfort.|$|E

5|$|One {{was that}} under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age and the other that the {{government}} would advise seniors to end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to Medicare by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when the statutory levels set for Medicare were exceeded within any given 3-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> would result in rationing.|$|E
