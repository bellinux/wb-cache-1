5|$|He {{also wrote}} three concertos: the Piano Concerto (1936), the Violin Concerto (1940), and the <b>Cello</b> Concerto (1946).|$|E
5|$|In Ratner's view, {{the most}} {{important}} of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for <b>cello,</b> and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment. The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions. The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards. The First <b>Cello</b> Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier. It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the <b>cello</b> over a virtuoso piano accompaniment. Fauré called it the only <b>cello</b> sonata from any country to be of any importance. The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.|$|E

5|$|In spring 1949 {{he wrote}} his <b>Cello</b> Sonata in C, Op. 119, for the 22-year-old Mstislav Rostropovich, who gave the first {{performance}} in 1950, with Sviatoslav Richter. For Rostropovich, Prokofiev also extensively recomposed his <b>Cello</b> Concerto, transforming it into a Symphony-Concerto, his last major masterpiece and a landmark in the <b>cello</b> and orchestra repertory today. The last public performance he attended was the première of the Seventh Symphony in 1952. The music was written for the Children's Radio Division.|$|E
5|$|The Maltings {{gave the}} festival a venue that could comfortably house large orchestral works and operas. Britten {{conducted}} the first performance outside Russia of Shostakovich's Fourteenth Symphony at Snape in 1970. Shostakovich, a friend since 1960, dedicated the symphony to Britten; he was himself the dedicatee of The Prodigal Son. Two other Russian musicians who {{were close to}} Britten and regularly performed at the festival were the pianist Sviatoslav Richter and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten composed his <b>cello</b> suites, <b>Cello</b> Symphony and <b>Cello</b> Sonata for Rostropovich, who premiered them at the Aldeburgh Festival.|$|E
5|$|The continuo part {{is played}} by organ, bassoon, <b>cello</b> and violone in most {{movement}}s. In the 1723 version movement 10 (Suscepit Israel) has a bassett (Ba) part played exclusively by violins and viola in unisono. In the 1733 version this continuo line is given to a continuo that includes <b>cello,</b> but not bassoon and violone.|$|E
2500|$|Standard-sized <b>cellos</b> are {{referred}} to as [...] "full-size" [...] or [...] "" [...] but are also made in smaller (fractional) sizes (e.g. , , , , , , [...] ). The smaller <b>cellos</b> are identical to standard <b>cellos</b> in construction, range, and usage, but are simply scaled-down for the benefit of children and shorter adults.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{electric}} <b>cellos</b> have bodies {{modeled after}} acoustic <b>cellos,</b> while others abandon the design completely, opting for {{a totally new}} body shape, or having little or no body at all. Most electric <b>cellos</b> feature a traditional endpin and knee supports, but some are supported in other ways, such as by an elongated pin for playing in the standing position, a tripod stand, strap, or strap system [...] that allows mobility while playing the instrument. The major differentiating factor between electric <b>cellos</b> and acoustic <b>cellos</b> {{is that while the}} latter rely on an acoustically resonant soundbox, the former are amplified electronically and often have no resonant chamber at all.|$|R

5|$|Additionally, {{the film}} {{featured}} {{a number of}} pieces of classical music, as the main Bond girl, Kara Milovy, is a cellist. Mozart's 40th Symphony in G minor (1st movement) is performed by the orchestra at the Conservatoire in Bratislava when Koskov flees. As Moneypenny tells Bond, Kara is next to perform Alexander Borodin's String Quartet in D major, and the finale to Act II of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (in Vienna) also features. Before Bond is drugged by Kara, she is practising the <b>Cello</b> solo from the first movement of Dvořák's <b>cello</b> concerto in B minor. At {{the end of the}} film, Kara and an orchestra (conducted onscreen by John Barry) perform Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations to rapturous applause.|$|E

5|$|Khachaturian went on {{to serve}} again as Secretary of the Composers Union, {{starting}} in 1957 until his death. He was also a deputy in the fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (1958–62). In {{the last two decades}} of his life, Khachaturian wrote three concert rhapsodies—for violin (1961-2), <b>cello</b> (1963) and piano (1965)—and solo sonatas for unaccompanied <b>cello,</b> violin, and viola (1970s), which are considered to be his second and third instrumental trilogies.|$|E

50|$|The symphony is scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. The edition by H. C. Robbins Landon for Verlag Doblinger has the <b>cellos</b> and basses on {{the same}} staff {{for most of the}} work even though the <b>cellos</b> {{occasionally}} are independent of the bassoons and basses in the first movement. Close {{to the beginning of the}} third movement it becomes necessary to split the <b>cellos</b> and basses on to different staves as the <b>cellos</b> switch to tenor clef and double the violas, leaving the bass to the bassoons and basses.|$|R

50|$|In {{classical}} music, the bassline {{is always}} written {{out for the}} performers in musical notation. In orchestral repertoire, the basslines are played by the double basses and <b>cellos</b> in the string section, by bassoons and contrabassoons in the woodwinds and by bass trombones, tubas {{and a variety of}} other low brass instruments. In symphonies from the Classical period, a single bassline was often written for the <b>cellos</b> and basses; however, since the bass is a transposing instrument, and it is notated an octave higher than it sounds, when <b>cellos</b> and basses play the same bassline, the line is performed in octaves, with the basses an octave below the <b>cellos.</b> By the end of the Classical period, with Beethoven's symphonies, <b>cellos</b> and double basses were often given separate parts. In general, the more complex passages and rapid note sequences are given to the <b>cellos,</b> while the basses play a simpler bassline. The timpani (or kettledrums) also play a role in orchestral basslines, albeit confined in 17th and early 18th century works to a few notes, often the tonic and the dominant below it. In a small number of symphonies, the pipe organ is used to play basslines.|$|R
5|$|The first {{movement}} is in cut common (2/2) time. It {{starts with the}} <b>cello,</b> alone, playing eight quarter notes on the same B-flat. It is not until the third measure of the movement that the violins and viola enter. The cello's eight throbbing notes act as more than an introduction. They reappear at critical junctures throughout the movement, including {{at the beginning of}} the development and recapitulation sections, illustrating that they are part of the movement's primary thematic material. The melody that follows the eight <b>cello</b> notes is echoed in Beethoven's String Quartet No. 1 (Op. 18, No. 1).|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which {{defending}} champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a <b>cello.</b> Jarrett went to hit Nash with the <b>cello,</b> however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken <b>cello</b> {{and placed it on}} the canvass. He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the <b>cello</b> to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, which led to a fight between the two. After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them. A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force his face into the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the Stroke. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the more}} unusual chase {{sequences}} include the gondola sequence from Moonraker, which leaves the canals of Venice {{to continue on}} land, and the <b>cello</b> case chase in The Living Daylights, {{as well as a}} double-decker bus in Live and Let Die.|$|E
