40|$|A corpus-based {{generation}} of fundamental frequency (F 0) contours was realized for emotional speech synthesis. The method, originally developed for read speech, is to predict <b>command</b> <b>values</b> of the F 0 contour generation process model with {{the input of}} linguistic information of the sentence to be synthesized. Since the generated F 0 contour is under the model constraint, a certain quality is still kept in synthesized speech even if the prediction is done poorly. The speech corpus used for the F 0 contour generation experiments includes three types of emotional (anger, joy, sad) and calm speech uttered by a female narrator. The <b>command</b> <b>values</b> necessary for the training and evaluation of the method were automatically extracted using a program developed by the authors.

When an optic {{of such a}} telescope is controlled with both surface-deforming and rigid-body actuators, the sensitivity-matrix obtained from the exit pupil wavefront vector divided by the corresponding actuator <b>command</b> <b>value</b> can sometimes become singular due to difference in actuator types and in actuator command values. In this paper, we propose a simple approach for preventing a sensitivity-matrix from singularity. We also introduce a new "minimum-wavefront and optimal control compensator". It uses an optimal control gain matrix obtained by feeding back the actuator commands along with the measured or estimated wavefront phase information to the estimator, thus eliminating the actuator modes that are not observable in the wavefront sensing process...|$|E
40|$|A mode-constrained corpus-based {{synthesis}} {{strategy was}} developed for fundamental frequency (F 0) contours of Japanese sentences. In the training phase, the relationship between linguistic factors and the <b>command</b> <b>values</b> (amplitudes and locations) of F 0 contour generation process model was learned for a prediction module; a neural network in the current paper. Input parameters consist of linguistic information related to accentual phrases that can be automatically driven from text, such as {{the position of the}} accentual phrase in the utterance, number of morae, accent type, and morphological information. In the synthesis phase, the prediction module is used to generate <b>command</b> <b>values</b> of the model. The synthesis method was also realized based on multiple linear regression analysis to examine how each input parameter contributes to the F 0 contour generation. The use of the parametric model restricts the degrees of freedom of the mapping between linguistic and prosodic features, and thus enables to generate appropriate values even with limited training data. Experimental results showed that the method could generate F 0 contours quite close to those by the rule-based method. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a straightforward view of constructing controllers for linear systems di-rectly {{from the system}} model and the desired step response of the closed-loop system. When this approach is applied to any scalar state variable, {{the result is an}} elementary linear controller formally, but composed of two discrete parts: The “trajectory control ” part realizes a first- or second-order low-pass filter on the <b>command</b> <b>value.</b> The “error compensation ” part corrects the controller’s operating point {{in the manner of a}} first-order high-pass filter on the current model error. This controller is stable by design and oscillation-free, its step response without over-shooting, for any possible parameterization. The utility of above approach is demonstrated on helicopter flight control, as very successfully used in the field with the MARVIN helicopter UAV. Much opposed to statements frequently found in the literature, helicopter dynamics are in fact fully linear with very small error. The MARVIN control architecture performs smooth 3 D multi-point trajectory flight with nothing but linear elementary controllers, purely due to a clever choice of the controlled variables...|$|E
