30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that provincial, municipal, and county governments spent {{a large amount of}} fiscal funds, the {{standards}} of compensation were barely acceptable to coal mine owners. Opening a coal mine usually required an investment of over twenty million yuan; thus, the compensation did not suffice. L County added more compensation for coal mines and basically reached the amount of investment, and it also asked other mines to provide additional <b>compensation</b> <b>funds</b> based on their production output. L County government explained that sixteen mines were shut down, and thus the surviving mines would benefit from this policy; it was reasonable for them to provide additional <b>compensation</b> <b>funds.</b> The specific criterion was that each ton of coal produced since November 2013 would be levied an additional fee of 20 yuan. Based on the price of coal and the market prospects, it would take at least 3  years to levy the total amount of fees as <b>compensation</b> <b>funds.</b> Among the mines shut down in 2013, the one that received the most <b>compensation</b> <b>funds</b> was a medium-sized mine with an annual production output of 150, 000  t; it received 37.6 million yuan in compensation. The three levels of budgetary funds could only provide 18 million yuan in compensation, with the remaining funds to be paid by the surviving mines. The shutdown schedule was that mines shut down by the end of August 2013 would receive the first installment accounting for 50  % of the total <b>compensation</b> <b>funds</b> and mines shut down by the end of October 2013 would receive the first installment accounting for 40  % of the total <b>compensation</b> <b>funds.</b> 21 Only after the mines had properly handled all equipment and workers’ wages and signed agreements with the government would the shutdown be considered complete and the remaining installment of <b>compensation</b> <b>funds</b> be paid. For the shutdown mines, 20  % of the <b>compensation</b> <b>funds</b> were still withheld in case of additional problems, such as environmental pollution or unpaid wages. Ultimately, L County took forceful measures to fulfill the task.|$|R

25|$|However, {{most of the}} {{criticism}} of the agreement has focused on its potential impact on Peru's agricultural sector.

2500|$|The {{issue of}} pardoning men {{convicted in the}} postwar era {{remained}} controversial until June 2017.

In cases where victims had died still bearing a conviction, the government will instead make payments to gay rights groups. This was confirmed on October 8, 2016, when Maas laid out the compensation scheme and announced {{that the government was}} setting aside €30million to cover claims. The law will see both individual pardons and a collective pardon and the documenting of suffering caused by the law, with the full process expected to take up to five years. Those affected by the pardon can apply for a [...] "vindication certificate", and relatives can apply for a posthumous pardon. Each person convicted will receive €3,000 compensation, plus €1,500 for each year spent in custody {{as a result of a}} conviction under Paragraph 175 – on average, a conviction carried a two-year sentence. Bundestag Member Volker Beck, who was a key figure in establishing a <b>compensation</b> <b>fund</b> for victims of Nazism, suggested that other losses suffered as a result of conviction under Paragraph 175, such as the loss of a job and resulting reduction in pension, should also be taken into account when deciding how much compensation to offer. In June 2017, the law was passed in Bundestag by a overwhelming mayority in all parties.|$|E
