5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and <b>cereal</b> <b>products,</b> meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E

Foods that contain high concentrations of niacin in the free form include beans and organ meat, as well as enriched grain and <b>cereal</b> <b>products.</b> While niacin is present in corn and other grains, the bioavailability of the nutrient is much less {{than it is in}} protein-rich sources. Different methods of processing corn may result in a higher degree of bioavailability of the vitamin.|$|E
25|$|The Economist also campaigned {{against the}} Corn Laws that {{protected}} landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of <b>cereal</b> <b>products.</b> A rigid belief in laissez faire guided the government response in 1846–1849 to the Great Famine in Ireland, during which an estimated 1.5 million people died. The minister responsible {{for economic and}} financial affairs, Charles Wood, expected that private enterprise and free trade, rather than government intervention, would alleviate the famine. The Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846 by the removal of tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high. However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because {{it was done in}} stages over three years.|$|E

This measure changed the form of cereal product export: mills emerged in Altai, Novosibirsk, and Tomsk; many farms switched to butter production.

Three samples for each food item selected were purchased from the markets. Each pooled sample was analyzed in triplicate by ICP–MS after thorough homogenization.

The major food sources of selenium intake were <b>cereals</b> and <b>cereals</b> <b>products</b> (30. 2 %), legumes (24. 7 %) and meats (20 %). The daily intake of Se was calculated taking into account the concentration of this element in the edible part and the daily consumption data which were derived from two sources, (a) the food balance sheet of KSA given by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and (b) from questionnaires distributed among 200 families in Jeddah.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to discover if significant relationships exist between age, gender, household income, locations where children/adolescents ate, whom they ate with, whether they considered the food as a meal or a snack, and their consumption of food by food group. Three hundred and twelve children (9 - 11 years old) /adolescents (13 - 15 years old) completed a 24 -hour dietary intake recall, and a 2 -day dietary record. The subject was asked to indicate the amount of food he/she consumed, where he/she consumed it, who was with him/her when he/she consumed the food, and whether he/she considered the food to be a meal or a snack. The information was coded and all the foods were grouped into 12 groups. Data were analyzed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). The results showed that children had higher intakes of breads and <b>cereals,</b> dairy <b>products,</b> fruits and fruit juices, snacks and desserts than adolescents. Girls consumed more snacks and desserts, and condiments than boys. Children/adolescents in families with higher household incomes consumed more snacks and desserts, but fewer meats than those with lower household incomes. Children and adolescents consumed more breads and <b>cereals,</b> dairy <b>products,</b> fruits and fruit juices, vegetables, fats, meats, and snacks and desserts when they ate at home than when they ate away from home. Children/adolescents ate more breads and <b>cereals,</b> dairy <b>products,</b> fruits and fruit juices, vegetables, fats, meats and condiments when they ate with various family members than when they ate alone, with only one family member or with non-family members. Children/adolescents consumed more breads and <b>cereals,</b> dairy <b>products,</b> fruits and fruit juices, burgers and sandwiches, snacks and desserts, condiments, but less fats when they ate with their friends as compared to eating with others. Children/adolescents who ate breakfast had higher intakes of breads and <b>cereals,</b> dairy <b>products,</b> fruits and fruit juices, vegetables, fats, meats, snacks and desserts, and condiments {{than those who did not}} eat breakfast.
