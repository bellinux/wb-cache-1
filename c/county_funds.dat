5|$|Taking {{office in}} January 1906, Barkley saved taxpayers over $35,000 by {{challenging}} improper charges to the county. He prosecuted two magistrates for approving contracts {{in which they}} had a conflict of interest. Even Republicans admitted that he performed well, and he was chosen president of the State Association of County Attorneys. During the 1907 gubernatorial election, he was the Democratic county spokesman, and despite his previous support for the Gold Democrats, he backed William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election. Friends encouraged him to run for county judge, a powerful position which controlled <b>county</b> <b>funds</b> and patronage, and he announced his candidacy on August 22, 1908. After the chairman of the county's Democratic Club Executive Committee endorsed him, the incumbent judge, Richard T. Lightfoot, retired rather than challenge him.|$|E
25|$|The bridge, one of {{the scenic}} wonders of the Pacific Northwest, is {{actually}} two spans, one over Canoe Pass to the north, and another over Deception Pass to the south. Pass Island lies between the two bridges. Construction began in August 1934, and the completed bridge was dedicated at noon on July 31, 1935. The Wallace Bridge and Structural Co. of Seattle, Washington provided 460 tons of steel for the 511-foot Canoe Pass arch and 1130 tons for the 976-foot Deception Pass span. The cost of the New Deal-era construction was $482,000, made possible through the Public Works Administration and <b>county</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Orange County {{declared}} the greatest municipal bankruptcy in United States history, {{the result of}} a $1.7 billion loss sustained after Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert Citron invested <b>county</b> <b>funds</b> in various risky financial instruments. Since that time, county officials have sought to reduce and eventually eliminate county responsibility for provision of municipal services such as policing, street sweeping, trash removal and building code enforcement, in order to focus greatly diminished county resources on provision of regional services such as public health, social services, flood control, environmental protection and regional planning. One means of achieving this goal has been to encourage municipalities within the county to annex unincorporated areas within or adjacent to their boundaries.|$|E

500|$|On March 23, 2007 Jones {{announced}} {{he was running for}} the United States Senate against incumbent Republican Saxby Chambliss. Jones was criticized by his chief rival Jim Martin over his more conservative politics and past support for George W. Bush. Jones' campaign was also marred by two new controversies. Jones sent out a flier in which he appeared in a digitally altered picture next to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama with the words [...] "Yes We Can." [...] However, Obama himself stated he not only never posed with Jones, he did not endorse Jones or any other candidate for the Democratic nomination for Senate. In response, Jones blamed his [...] "liberal opponents backed by the liberal media" [...] for trying to ruin his campaign. Jones also received criticism for the appearance of the tagline [...] "Vote Vernon Jones for GA Senate" [...] on tickets, produced using <b>county</b> <b>funds,</b> for the Dekalb County Blues and Jazz Festival. The company who printed the tickets, supporters of Jones' campaign, took responsibility for the incident; saying that they were unaware campaign finance laws made such an action illegal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{election}} locally between Milliken and Earle {{degenerated into}} a particularly bitter race, {{with the latter}} accusing the former of having converted <b>county</b> <b>funds</b> to his own personal use. [...] Specifically, when Milliken was Clerk of Courts, he had used $5,953 in fees paid to the county for his own use, later paying back all of the funds. [...] James J. Connor, the minority County Commissioner, jumped into the fray, declaring that he would ask his fellow commissioners to file suit against Milliken to recover about $1,400 in estimated interest that these funds would have earned. [...] An indignant Milliken said that his actions were not illegal and had been standard practice, at least by his two predecessors in office, and retaliated by filing a criminal libel suit against Earle. [...] Earle was then arrested and posted a $1,000 bail on October 25, but Milliken failed to appear at the magistrate's hearing at the Springfield Township Building that day. The Democrat was undeterred by the lawsuit and continued his attacks {{the next day at}} a rally in Chester, offering to withdraw from the campaign and go to jail if Milliken would answer several pointed questions regarding the missing funds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elections}} were marred by fraudulent voting, ballot-box stuffing, and false returns, [...] {{the administration of}} the offices by fraud and robbery. In Mahanoy township, $60,000 was appropriated for the schools and eleven-twelfths of it stolen. Exorbitant road taxes were a fruitful means by which township officials robbed the taxpayers and put the money in their own pockets. In August 1875 an ex-county commissioner, a Molly; and two commissioners then in office, not actually belonging to the order but in sympathy with it, had been convicted of stealing the <b>county</b> <b>funds</b> and each had been sentenced by a full bench September 6 to two years' imprisonment. At the fall election for governor in this year (1875) the Molly Maguires, who were naturally Democrats, foresaw Republican success and sold their vote in Schuylkill and Luzerne counties to the Republicans for {{a certain amount of money}} in hand and an implied agreement that these convicted commissioners and other criminals who were called by a leading Molly [...] "our men" [...] should be pardoned. [...] It is hardly to be supposed that the Republican politicians who made this bargain were aware of the thoroughly criminal nature of the Molly Maguires, for they had astutely covered themselves with a virtuous cloak, securing from the Legislature in 1871 a charter for the Ancient Order of Hibernians whose motto was [...] "Friendship, Unity and Christian Charity." [...] On October 10, 1875, in a letter to the Shenandoah Herald Jack Kehoe denied with indignation that the Molly Maguires were synonymous with the Ancient Order of Hibernians, which latter was [...] "composed of men who are law abiding and seek the elevation of their members." [...] (2) Kehoe was crafty enough to see the advantage of throwing dust in the eyes of the public and, when the outside world was bargained with, the A.O.H. was put forward; but, as matter of fact, it was the old story of ravening wolves in sheep's clothing.|$|E
