25|$|The station's large {{solar panels}} {{generate}} a high potential voltage {{difference between the}} station and the ionosphere. This could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath.

50|$|Unlike {{general-purpose}} relays, <b>contactors</b> {{are designed}} to be directly connected to high-current load devices. Relays tend to be of lower capacity and are usually designed for both normally closed and normally open applications. Devices switching more than 15 amperes or in circuits rated more than a few kilowatts are usually called <b>contactors.</b> Apart from optional auxiliary low-current contacts, <b>contactors</b> are almost exclusively fitted with normally open ("form A") contacts. Unlike relays, <b>contactors</b> are designed with features to control and suppress the arc produced when interrupting heavy motor currents.|$|R
25|$|Static and {{agitated}} {{cultures are}} conventional ways to produce bacterial cellulose. Both static and agitated cultures are not feasible for large-scale production as static cultures {{have a long}} culture period as well as intensive manpower and agitated cultures produce cellulose-negative mutants alongside its reactions due to rapid growth. Thus, reactors are designed to lessen culture time and inhibit the conversion of bacterial cellulose-producing strains into cellulose-negative mutants. Common reactors used are the rotating disk reactor, the rotary biofilm <b>contactor</b> (RBC), a bioreactor equipped with a spin filter, and a reactor with a silicone membrane.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes an {{economizer}} circuit is also installed {{to reduce the}} power required to keep a <b>contactor</b> closed; an auxiliary contact reduces coil current after the <b>contactor</b> closes. A somewhat greater amount of power is required to initially close a <b>contactor</b> than is required to keep it closed. Such a circuit can save {{a substantial amount of}} power and allow the energized coil to stay cooler. Economizer circuits are nearly always applied on direct-current <b>contactor</b> coils and on large alternating current <b>contactor</b> coils.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum <b>contactors</b> utilize {{vacuum bottle}} {{encapsulated}} contacts {{to suppress the}} arc.

Novel {{membrane}} <b>contactors</b> offer {{a number}} of important advantages over conventional dispersed phase <b>contactors,</b> including absence of emulsions, no flooding at high flow rates, no unloading at low flow rates, no density difference between fluids required, and surprisingly high interfacial area.

50|$|Starters using {{magnetic}} contactors usually derive {{the power}} supply for the <b>contactor</b> coil {{from the same}} source as the motor supply. An auxiliary contact from the <b>contactor</b> is used to maintain the <b>contactor</b> coil energized after the start command for the motor has been released. If a momentary loss of supply voltage occurs, the <b>contactor</b> will open and not close again until a new start command is given. this prevents restarting of the motor after a power failure. This connection also provides a small degree of protection against low power supply voltage and loss of a phase. However since <b>contactor</b> coils will hold the circuit closed with as little as 80% of normal voltage applied to the coil, {{this is not a}} primary means of protecting motors from low voltage operation.|$|E

When the beam was broken, the speaker reproduced the clicking of the receiver relay. An alarm buzzer also sounded and a flashing red light came on actuated by the relay. During this interruption, another <b>contactor</b> closed and a sentry (searchlight) was exposed across the river, on a bearing a few degrees inside {{the line of the}} infrared PE beam. The service <b>contactor</b> switch for the searchlight was then closed by the switchman, who carried out a quick search of the area; the control panel <b>contactor</b> being immediately reset by pressing a button on the control panel. Resetting stopped the alarm buzzer, flashing light and the clicking in the loudspeaker, leaving the apparatus ready to give another signature immediately.|$|E
