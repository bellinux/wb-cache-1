25|$|Polk was a slaveholder for {{his entire}} life. His father, Samuel Polk, had left Polk more than 8,000 acres (32km²) of land, and divided about 53 slaves to his widow and {{children}} after he died. James inherited twenty of his father's slaves, {{either directly or}} from deceased brothers. In 1831, he became an absentee <b>cotton</b> <b>planter,</b> sending slaves to clear plantation land {{that his father had}} left him near Somerville, Tennessee. Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and, together with his brother-in-law, bought 920 acres (3.7km²) of land, a cotton plantation near Coffeeville, Mississippi. He ran this plantation {{for the rest of his}} life, eventually taking it over completely from his brother-in-law. Polk rarely sold slaves, although once he became President and could better afford it, he bought more. Polk's will stipulated that their slaves were to be freed after his wife, Sarah, had died. However, the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution freed all remaining slaves in rebel states long before the death of his wife in 1891.|$|E

25|$|The {{tendency}} of monoculture cotton plantings {{to lead to}} soil exhaustion created a need for <b>cotton</b> <b>planters</b> to move their operations to new lands, and therefore to the westward expansion of slavery from the Eastern seaboard into new areas (e.g., Alabama, Mississippi, and beyond to East Texas).|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{a reason}} why slaves can be {{profitable}} at the south. In cultivating cotton or sugar, a vast proportion of all the work done in the year is the same. Almost the whole consists of a few simple processes, such as planting, hoeing, picking cotton, &c., and {{this is to be}} performed on smooth, even land, where set tasks can be easily assigned. But the work on a grass farm is endlessly varied. It would not be possible to divide it into set tasks. And then it is of such a nature, that it could not possibly be performed successfully by the mere labor of the hands. The mind must be employed upon it. For instance, even in getting in hay, in the summer season, the farmer has to exercise all his judgment and discretion to avoid getting it wet by the summer showers, and yet to secure it in good time, and with proper dispatch. A <b>cotton</b> <b>planter</b> may hire an overseer to see to the getting in of his cotton, and he can easily tell by the result, whether he has been faithful or not. But hay can not be got in well, without the activity, and energy, and good judgment, which can come only from the presence and immediate supervision of an owner. This produces vast differences {{in the nature of the}} business, and in the whole state of society in the two regions." ...|$|E
