40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} 15 knitted fabrics of varying <b>cover</b> <b>factor,</b> yarn, and fiber compositions were investigated for their aerodynamic properties on circular cylinders in a wind tunnel. Measurements of the drag force, pressure distribution, and the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique {{were used in}} order to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} effects of yarn, fiber composition, <b>cover</b> <b>factor,</b> and elastic deformation on the flow field and drag coefficient. It was clearly demonstrated from the drag force measurements that the yarn construction and fiber composition have a substantial effect on the drag coefficient (CD), with fabrics composed of spun yarn experiencing no CD-drop as opposed to those composed of filament yarn, and being almost unaffected by the <b>cover</b> <b>factor</b> in the range of Reynolds numbers investigated. Hairiness of the spun yarn was found to minimise the drag-reducing effect of the boundary layer transition and increase the trans-critical drag. The hairy surface layer also appeared to retard the turbulent boundary layer as almost no pressure recovery was observed prior to separation on the cylinder model. The effect of elastic deformation was investigated by image analysis of scanned textile samples, and demonstrated that surface roughness might not be directly correlated to <b>cover</b> <b>factor</b> when the fabrics are stretched. Different elastic behavior of fabrics with different cover factors was also found to affect the structure of the knit surface and thus their aerodynamic behavior. The onset of drag crisis found in drag measurements confirmed the deviation from a sequence determined solely by <b>cover</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|E

The simultaneity of production and consumption however needs to be evaluated: the distribution grid is regarded as virtual storage and is loaded unconventionally or even overloaded.

40|$|The {{presented}} work {{focuses on}} the introduction of thermal <b>cover</b> <b>factors</b> and {{the assessment of the}}ir interaction with the electrical <b>cover</b> <b>factors.</b> <b>Cover</b> <b>factors</b> are used to quantify the mismatch or non-simultaneity of local production and consumption of electricity and heat. First, the electrical <b>cover</b> <b>factors</b> are redefined to include the losses related to the storage of electricity and other inherent losses. Thereafter, similar thermal <b>cover</b> <b>factors</b> are defined. This allows the assessment of the self-consumption and self-generation for locally generated heat by means of e. g. heat pumps. In this paper, a case study focuses on a net-zero energy building. Net- zero energy buildings require an increase in distributed energy resources (e. g. photovoltaic systems). To minimize the impact of the resulting bidirectional power flows on the distribution grid, demand side management and storage (thermal and electrical) are often mentioned as solutions; i. e. increasing the self-consumption of locally produced electricity. The building in this case study is heated by means of a heat pump. The case study is used to demonstrate the use of the thermal <b>cover</b> <b>factors,</b> as well as the interaction between electrical and thermal energy flows. status: publishe...|$|R

In this work, methane hydrate formation was carried out in glass tubes to study the effects of the existence of surfactant micelles on methane hydrate growth pattern. For comparison, surfactants could and could not form micelles at hydrate formation temperature were used, which were sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), respectively. SDS led to obvious upward hydrate growth on the reactor sidewall (<b>cover</b> <b>factors</b> 2. 8 - 3. 7), while SDBS resulted in obviously less extent of upward hydrate growth (<b>cover</b> <b>factors</b> 1. 8 - 2. 6) due to the micelle effect. When SDS-coated polystyrene nanospheres were used, SDS existed in the reaction solution in the form of mimic micelles and consequently much less extent of upward hydrate growth was achieved (<b>cover</b> <b>factors</b> 1. 8 - 2. 3).

The study illustrated in this paper shows the results from geomatic perspective, applying an interdisciplinary approach undertaken in order to identify major natural hazards affecting cultural landscapes and archaeological heritage in rural areas in Cyprus. In particular, Earth Observation (EO) and ground-based methods were identified and applied for mapping, monitoring and estimation of the possible soil loss caused by soil erosion. Special attention was given to the land use/land <b>cover</b> <b>factor</b> (C) {{and its impact on the}} overall estimation of the soil-loss. <b>Cover</b> <b>factor</b> represents the effect of soil-disturbing activities, plants, crop sequence and productivity level, soil cover and subsurface bio-mass on soil erosion.

40|$|Mining is {{the major}} {{economic}} activity in New Caledonia, which contains 25 % of the world’s nickel ore reserves. With so much land disturbance associated with mining, {{it is important to}} minimise the off site impacts of sediment deposition in waterways and lagoons. An erosion model that relates off-site deposition to mining activities is needed to help plan the mitigation of erosion. We used the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) to estimate the soil loss per unit area coming from surficial erosion. GIS maps were derived for each of the factors involved in the USLE, including rainfall, slope length and steepness, soil erodibility, and cover. Data limitation has hindered the calibration of the estimation of soil loss. However, initial results show a strong soil loss {{at the top of the}} mountain, mainly due to high precipitation and steep slopes. These areas correspond to the mining activities. Mitigation work can be prioritised by using the model to identify sources of sediment that make large contributions.
