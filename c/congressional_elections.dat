5|$|Elections {{were held}} in early October from which all {{political}} parties were barred from participating. Castillo Armas was the only candidate; he won the election with 99% of the vote, completing his transition into power. Castillo Armas became affiliated with a party named the Movimiento de Liberación Nacional (MLN), which remained the ruling party of Guatemala from 1954 to 1957. It was led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, and was a coalition of municipal politicians, bureaucrats, coffee planters, {{and members of the}} military, all of whom were opposed to the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution. In the <b>congressional</b> <b>elections</b> held under Castillo Armas, it was the only party allowed to run.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, {{with their}} {{relationship}} completely ruptured, Jefferson unsuccessfully {{tried to convince}} Washington to remove Hamilton, but Washington largely supported Hamilton's ideas, believing that they had led to social and economic stability.

Opponents of Hamilton and the administration won several seats in the 1792 <b>Congressional</b> <b>elections,</b> and Hamilton was unable to win Congressional approval of his ambitious economic proposals afterward.|$|E

5|$|Stanley gained {{national}} notoriety for {{his actions}} against U.S. Steel. In 1909, he introduced a resolution calling for {{an investigation of the}} company, but it died in the House Rules Committee. A second resolution, introduced in June 1910, passed the House, but was ignored by President William Howard Taft. Stanley introduced a stronger resolution later that month, but it was killed in committee. After Republicans lost control of the house in the 1910 <b>congressional</b> <b>elections,</b> Stanley reintroduced his resolution. House Speaker Champ Clark appointed him as chairman of a nine-member committee to investigate U.S. Steel.|$|E
5|$|The midterm <b>congressional</b> <b>elections</b> of 1854 and 1855 were {{devastating to}} the Democrats (as {{well as to}} the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked {{together}} to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected {{under the auspices of the}} new Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the rightwing {{elements}} who had {{resisted the}} US entry into World War II because of their pro-Fascist isolationism, continued their attempts to control and punish the left-leaning entertainment professionals who fought the spread of Fascism in Europe during the 1930s while the United States was technically neutral. In 1946, the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority in the <b>Congressional</b> <b>elections.</b> and used this power to re-invigorate committees there that had failed to stop anti-Fascist artists before the war. The Communist victory of China in 1949 {{and the start of}} the Korean War in 1950 reinforced the anti-Communist hysteria being whipped up at the time.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Nixon {{took office in}} 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7percent—its highest rate since the Korean War. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm <b>congressional</b> <b>elections</b> (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency). According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through {{the first year of}} his presidency.|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{accepted}} his narrow defeat and {{spent most of}} the next year working on the second volume of Twenty Years of Congress. The book continued to earn him enough money to support his lavish household and pay off his debts. Although he spoke to friends of retiring from politics, Blaine still attended dinners and commented on the Cleveland administration’s policies. By the time of the 1886 <b>Congressional</b> <b>elections,</b> Blaine was giving speeches and promoting Republican candidates, especially {{in his home state of}} Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned {{against the}} Lodge Bill, {{which would have}} {{strengthened}} voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of <b>congressional</b> <b>elections</b> upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and Giles v. Teasley, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).|$|E

5|$|McGovern did not mourn {{leaving the}} Senate. Although being {{rejected}} {{by his own}} state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt {{out of touch with}} the country and in some ways liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the Moral Majority and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. <b>Congressional</b> <b>elections.</b> McGovern shut the committee down when he decided to run for president again.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's chances in the 2006 <b>congressional</b> <b>elections.</b> It states that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{warning was}} appropriate, {{for in the}} <b>Congressional</b> <b>elections,</b> Republicans won their biggest {{landslide}} in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts {{were two of the}} few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for President.|$|E

5|$|Garfield's {{assassination}} by an office-seeker amplified {{the public}} demand for civil service reform. Both Democratic and Republican leaders {{realized that they}} could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system, and by 1882 a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform. In the previous Congress, Sherman's fellow Ohio Senator, Democrat George H. Pendleton, had introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination, but Congress declined to act on it right away. Republicans lost seats in the 1882 <b>congressional</b> <b>elections,</b> in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue, and in the lame duck session were more amenable to civil service reform. Sherman spoke in favor of merit selection and against removing employees from office without cause. He was against the idea that civil servants should have unlimited terms of office but believed that efficiency, not political activity, should determine an employee's length of service. Sherman {{voted in favor of}} Pendleton's bill, and the Senate approved it 38–5. The House concurred by a vote of 155–47. Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January16, 1883.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, a bill {{to reduce}} the tariff was {{narrowly}} defeated in the House. The tariff issue was emphasized in the <b>Congressional</b> <b>elections</b> that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed {{a bill to}} reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{had earlier}} taken several {{measures}} to oppose Gray and the FHLBB, including recruiting {{a study from}} then-private economist Alan Greenspan saying that direct investments were not harmful, and getting President Ronald Reagan to make a recess appointment of a Keating ally, Atlanta real estate developer Lee H. Henkel Jr., to an open seat on the FHLBB. By March 1987, however, Henkel had resigned, upon news of his having large loans due to Lincoln. Meanwhile, the Senate had changed control from Republican to Democratic during the 1986 <b>Congressional</b> <b>elections,</b> placing several Democratic senators in key positions, and starting in January 1987, Keating's staff was putting pressure on Cranston to remove Gray from any FHLBB discussion regarding Lincoln. The following month, Keating began large-scale contributions into Cranston's project to increase California voter registration. In February 1987, Keating met with Riegle and began contributing to Riegle's 1988 re-election campaign.|$|E
