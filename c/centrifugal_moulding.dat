Hemodialysis {{is the main}} treatment of acute and chronic renal failure, and the selection of hemodialysis membrane materials is the key factor that determines the curative possibilities. By changing the membrane forming conditions, we have spun polyvinylidene fluoride（PVDF） hollow fiber membranes with the same inner diameters but different wall thicknesses. Via <b>centrifugal</b> <b>moulding,</b> we have also made membranes into dialyzers to study the mechanical performance of the membranes and the dialysis performance of the dialyzers. The {{results show that the}} mechanical performance meets the demand of dialysis. For the dialyzers with 30 µm fiber walls, the clearance rates of urea and lysozyme are 90 % and 75 % respectively, and the rejection rate of bovine serum albumin（BSA）comes to 90 % plus. The increase of the mass content of the dope solution polyethylene glycol (PEG) from 19 % to 22 % decreases the rejection rate of BSA...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{fatigue test}} results on motorcycle valves obtained by permanent-mould cast g-TiAl alloy, {{which is an}} excellent alternative material for engine valves because of its low density and elevated temperature strength. Since the production and machining of gamma-TiAl valves are very expensive, particular care was paid to meeting reliability requirements while trying to reduce costs. The development of high quality low-cost g-TiAl alloy engine valves was obtained without performing a hot isostatic pressing (HIP) process. The valves were mounted onto an actual motorcycle engine and a racing-type fatigue test was then positively overcome. A contribution to {{the evaluation of the}} effect of the intrinsic defects that are typical of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>mould</b> technology on the fatigue behaviour of castings was also given...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the effects}} of <b>centrifugal</b> radius and <b>mould</b> {{rotation}} speed on microstructure in centrifugal-cast Al-Cu alloy have been investigated. The results show that, with increase of the <b>centrifugal</b> radius or <b>mould</b> rotation speed, the grain size of centrifugal-cast Al-Cu alloy decreases gradually, while the content of white phases containing the Al 2 Cu precipitated from α-phase, divorced eutectic and regular eutectic microstructure increases, leading to higher Cu macrosegregation. The variation level of microstructure in centrifugal-cast Al-Cu alloy at 600 rpm of mould rotation speed is greater than that at 300 rpm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{the effects}} of <b>centrifugal</b> radius and <b>mould</b> {{rotation}} speed on the tensile strength, yield strength, specific elongation, and microhardness on Al-Cu alloy castings are investigated. The results show that, with increasing the <b>centrifugal</b> radius or <b>mould</b> rotation speed, the mechanical properties increase gradually. With increasing the centrifugal radius, the variation amplitude of mechanical properties of Al-Cu alloys at mould rotation speed 600 rpm is greater than that at 300 rpm. This {{is due to the}} finer microstructure and the strengthened grain boundary and then resulting in the increase of the resistance to dislocation slipping...|$|R
40|$|The cohort {{consisted}} of 15, 908 {{men and women}} who worked for at least six months between 1948 and 1977 in 30 participating manufacturing plants in the reinforced plastics and composites industry. These workers were occupationally exposed to the working environment in the industry, which included exposure to styrene. Cause specific mortality analyses were performed based on the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) with the United States population as a comparison. No significant excess of cause specific mortality was found for the total cohort. Mortality from cancer was slightly less than expected (SMR = 88. 1). For cancer of the respiratory system, a small non-significant excess was detected (SMR = 116. 1). For lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer, a non-significant deficit was found (SMR = 73. 3). The observed mortality from leukaemia was similar to that expected (five observed v 4. 76 expected deaths). The plants with hot processes (injection <b>moulding,</b> <b>centrifugal</b> casting, compression <b>moulding,</b> continuous lamination, and pultrusion) experienced a significantly increased SMR (177. 9) for respiratory cancer, which was more than twice that (78. 3) for those with cold processes (resin mixing, lay up and spray up, bag moulding, and filament winding). As potential exposure to styrene from hot processes is considerably less than that from the cold processes, this finding could not be attributed to occupational exposures. A subsequent nested case-control study consisting of 40 cases of deaths from respiratory cancer was conducted. Further information on detailed work history, occupational exposures, and smoking history was collected. The case-control study did not show any significant association between respiratory cancer and direct exposure to styrene (contained in polyester resins), duration of exposure to styrene, the type of process (hot or cold), or whether a resin was used. A statistically significant association (relative risk = 7. 33) was found between cigarette smoking and respiratory cancer among the study subjects...|$|R
