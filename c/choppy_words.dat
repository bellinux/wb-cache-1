5000|$|The Sith language, {{intended}} to be spoken by Sith characters, was created by Ben Grossblatt for the Book of Sith, published in February 2012. Development on the language and accompanying writing system began in November 2010. Grossblatt sought to create a pronounceable language that was not [...] "cartoonish" [...] and [...] "would conform to the patterns of principles of [...] language. He felt that it needed to [...] "feel martial and mystical" [...] and be a [...] "suitable, aesthetically-pleasing vehicle for communication". He characterized {{the sound of the}} language as [...] "tough—but not barbarous" [...] and as [...] "conveying a kind of confident, elegant cruelty". To achieve [...] "formal, quasi-military" [...] and [...] "imposing, undeniable" [...] qualities, he preferred closed syllables, creating brisk and <b>choppy</b> <b>words,</b> and constructed the language as agglutinative.|$|E
40|$|We used a command-response {{additive}} F 0 {{model to}} analyze F 0 patterns of Japanese spoken by native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. Compared to native speakers of Japanese, {{we found that}} Chinese speakers exhibit the following characteristics: (a) higher pitch, (b) more phrases, (c) bunsetsu decomposition, and (d) utterance-final plunging. These characteristics physically manifest themselves as: (a) higher baseline F 0, (b) more phrase commands, (c) more accent commands, and (d) negative commands. These characteristics may be subjectively perceived as: (a) tinnier speech (possible L 1 marker but does not degrade communication), (b) disjoint phrases (requires mental consolidation), (c) <b>choppy</b> prosodic <b>words</b> (requires reconstruction), and (d) abrupt utterance termination (possibly misconstrued as emphatic or rude). We believe these difficulties arose from tonal and syllable-timed interference, which can be overcome by prosodic control and planning...|$|R
40|$|The authorship, genre, {{style and}} content of the 2 ̆ 2 Spielmann 2 ̆ 2 epics have always set them apart from other Middle High German (MHG) works. It has still not been {{successfully}} determined when they were first composed or by whom, but one can be fairly certain from their style and content that these epics were meant to entertain and amuse, rather than to depict great turning points or resolutions of moral struggles or to present great insights or ideas of universal interest. The main goal of this dissertation is to provide an English translation of the MHG epic poem Salman und Morolf and, by means of a brief discussion of the 2 ̆ 2 Spielmann 2 ̆ 2 genre, the sources of the Salman und Morolf plot, possible date of composition, and various motifs found in the work, to provide a foundation for a better understanding of Salman und Morolf. ^ This English version of Salman und Morolf is not a line by line translation of the original, nor is it presented in the original 2 ̆ 7 s stanza form. Rather, it is a prose rendition in a style familiar to today 2 ̆ 7 s reader yet faithful to the original 2 ̆ 7 s content. The original 2 ̆ 7 s short, <b>choppy</b> lines, repeated <b>words</b> and phrases, mechanical rhyme and limited vocabulary make for difficult imitation of style as well as reading in a translation. By recasting the work in prose, the plot, entertainment value, character development, and glimpses of the author 2 ̆ 7 s world can still be presented, consistent with the original. The translation 2 ̆ 7 s chapter divisions are based on breaks in the plot and are not present in the MHG version. ...|$|R
