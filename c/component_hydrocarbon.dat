40|$|High-temperature, {{high-pressure}} (HTHP) {{conditions are}} exemplified in ultra-deep petroleum reservoirs {{and can be}} exhibited within diesel engines. Accurate pure <b>component</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> data is essential in understanding the overall behavior of petroleum and diesel fuel at these conditions. The present study focuses on the HTHP properties of toluene since this hydrocarbon is frequently used to increase the octane rating of gasoline and toluene occurs naturally in crude oil. In this thesis experimental densities and viscosity are presented to 535 K and 300 MPa extending the database of toluene viscosity data to higher temperature than previous studies. The data is correlated to a Tait-like equation and a Padѐ approximate {{in conjunction with a}} single mapping of the isotherms. Free-volume theory and a superposition of the viscosity in relation to the Leonnard-Jones repulsive force are both used to model the toluene viscosity data. It was found that the data are in good agreement with the available literature data...|$|E
40|$|Five {{reaction}} schemes {{are suggested}} for the initiated nonbranched-chain addition of free radicals to the multiple bonds of alkenes, formaldehyde, and oxygen. The schemes include reactions competing with chain propagation through a reactive free radical. The chain evolution stage in these schemes involves {{three or four}} types of free radicals. One of them— 				CH 2 =C(CH 3) •CH 2, CH 2 =CH•CHOH, H•C=O, −CH 3 C 6 H 4 CH 2 O• 4, or HO• 4 —is relatively low-reactive and inhibits the chain process by shortening of the kinetic chain length. Based on the suggested schemes, nine rate equations containing one to three parameters to be determined directly are set up using quasi-steady-state treatment. These equations provide good fits for the nonmonotonic (peaking) dependences of the formation rates of the molecular addition products (1 [*]:[*] 1 adducts) on the concentration of the unsaturated component in liquid homogeneous binary systems consisting of a saturated <b>component</b> (<b>hydrocarbon,</b> alcohol, etc.) and an unsaturated component (olefin, formaldehyde, or dioxygen). The unsaturated compound in these systems is both a reactant and an autoinhibitor generating low-reactive free radicals.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate appearance of surface ignition- postignition experienced inside the engine cylinder and correlate it with the nature of the spark ignition combustion prior to the onset of surface ignition. The test engine used to carry out all experiments was a Jaguar optical single-cylinder engine, operating in spark-ignition mode, although with negative valve overlap. The optical configuration of the engine allows characterizing and analyzing combustion process based on the processing of captured images in correlation with in-cylinder pressure and other parameters recorded with regard to instantaneous engine operating conditions. Results of the experiments covered in this publication focus on flame propagation and development as well as reveal occurrence of abnormal combustion processes. Experimental observations, especially the captured images show a relationship between the nature of normal combustion process initiated by spark discharge and the existence of abnormal combustion phenomena. All tests were performed under fixed engine conditions – constant speed and single <b>component</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuel. Because the nature of fuel can shape the combustion process, a brief discussion and a proposed correlation of anti-knock, auto-ignition, and resistance to surface ignition qualities of a few single-and multi-component fuels is presented. Finally the publication leads to provide an indication of possible solutions concerning the problem of uncontrolled post-ignition events in optical engines...|$|E

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{evaluation by}} permeation measurements and modeling of thin (< 2 µm) MFI molecular sieve membranes and, {{to a smaller}} extent, synthesis of such materials. The membranes have been synthesized on graded a-alumina microfiltration filters using The seed film method. Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction were used for characterization in addition to permeation measurements. Mathematical models describing membrane flux for real membranes and defect distributions were developed. Defect distributions were calculated from porosimetry data and were further used for prediction of single gas permeation characteristics for real membranes. The models confirm the experimental findings, with respect to ideal selectivities as a measurement of membrane quality. Membrane permeation simulations indicate increasing ideal selectivities, with increasing film thickness, for quotients containing SF 6. Thereby a high quality membrane could possess low ideal selectivities. This finding was confirmed by comparing experimental data of several membranes with varying thickness. The correlation between multi component separation data and commonly used quality criteria was investigated. It was found that commonly used single gas permeation quotients (ideal selectivity) between light inorganic gases, especially those containing sulphurhexaflouride (SF 6), is less appropriate for membrane quality measurement. The porosimetry experiment showed {{on the other hand}} a good agreement between experimental data and separation performance of the membranes, as expected. ZSM- 5 membranes with low aluminum content and silicalite- 1 membranes with similar material properties, such as defect distribution and thickness were evaluated with multi <b>component</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> isomers permeation. The ZSM- 5 membrane had lower permeances and a slightly better butane isomer separation performance than the silicalite- 1 membrane. The latter membrane showed a minimum in separation selectivity between two C 6 isomers whereas the ZSM- 5 membrane showed an almost constant selectivity, independent of temperature, but with lower permeances. ZSM- 5 membranes with a high aluminum content catalyzed the formation of diethylether and ethylen at temperatures exceeding 150 °C from a water/ethanol mixture. The membrane separated a mixture of C 4 isomers with good performance at elevated temperatures. However these membranes suffered from temperature instability problems.

40|$|The thesis {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of Rankine cycles with mixed <b>component</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> working fluids, or hydrocarbon mixtures. The objective is to compare mixtures with pure fluids {{on the basis of}} the same total heat exchanger (HX) area. This is achieved through further development and application of a three-step cycle optimization model developed in the project work, which calculates the maximum work output for a pre-defined value of total HX area. The model simultaneously calculates the optimum distribution of HX area between the condenser and the heat recovery heat exchanger (HRHE). A literature review is performed that studies heat transfer and pressure drop of working fluid mixtures through horizontal smooth tubes to evaluate and implement improved correlations. The literature review demonstrates that several methods are available for predicting heat transfer coefficients (HTCs), and that a method by Bell and Ghaly (1973) is most common for condensation, and a method by Thome (1996) is most common for evaporation. The cycle optimization model is further developed though implementation of new heat transfer correlations better suited for hydrocarbons. A more comprehensive estimation of overall HTC is made, and the option of internal heat exchanger (IHX) is included. A more detailed working fluid comparison is made through the study of optimum heat exchanger designs, including the distribution of condenser and HRHE area for different values of pre-defined total HX area. The specific working fluid affects HX design in terms of pinch points and distributions between condenser and HRHE area. Moreover, HX pressure loss is determined by working fluid overall HTCs and operating pressure, and the number of tubes and tube diameter is most affected by pressure levels. Four cases are defined that represent present and future applications of Rankine cycle. Case 1 and 2 consider a heat source at 100 ℃, with no lower limit on heat source outlet temperature. In case 1, the heat sink outlet temperature fixed and in case 2 it is allowed to vary. In case 1 and 2, butane, ethane and ethane (0. 6 / 0. 4) are studied. Case 3 and 4 consider a heat source cooled from 200 ℃ to 80 ℃. Case 4 differs from case 3 in that the optimization tool is given the choice to include an IHX, and does so if this contributes to an increased work output. In case 3 and 4, butane and butane-propane (0. 6 / 0. 4) are studied. For all cases, work output is maximized for different values of pre-defined total HX area. Contrary to the case studied in the project work, the results for case 1 and 2 demonstrate that the hydrocarbon mixture has the potential to achieve significantly higher work output than the pure fluids for the same total HX area (up to 34 %). Variable heat sink outlet temperature allow small improvements in work output from case 1, and the improvement is greater for the pure fluids. In case 3, the pure fluid achieves on average 3. 7 % higher work output than the mixture. However, a working fluid screening demonstrated that other mixtures may have more potential in this case. With the inclusion of IHX, work outputs increases between 1. 5 % and 11. 6 % for the same total HX area, with increased potential for improvement at relatively high values of total HX area. In fact, the IHX was not included in the optimum solutions for lower-range values of area. Improvement with IHX was highest for the mixture, which enabled it to achieve the same levels of work output as the pure fluid. Despite the low potential of the mixture in this case, it may be more applicable for high values of total HX area than the pure fluid due to its relatively hgih pinch point temperatures. A significant increase in work output can be achieved with increasing heat source temperature. For the heat source at 100 °C, work outputs reaches around 25 kW for high values of total HX area. For a case studied in the project work with a heat sources at 150 °C, work outputs reaches 50 kW, and for the heat source at 200 °C in the current work, work output reaches 100 kW...|$|E

The chemical <b>components</b> (<b>hydrocarbons</b> – HCs, free fatty acids – FFAs, free fatty alcohols – FALs and wax esters – WEs) of natural waxes were analyzed using HPLC–ELSD and GC–MS followed by evaluation of their oil structuring properties. The gel strength, including the average storage modulus and oscillation yield stress, displayed a negative correlation with FALs and a positive correlation with HCs, FFAs and WEs. The components dictating the gel strength are HCs, FFAs and WEs in a descending order of importance. The consistency of the oleogels increased with the increasing amount of FFAs and HCs and the decreasing amount of WEs and FALs. The presence of more WEs results in a strong but brittle gel with a high initial flow yield stress.

The effects of propylene addition on the ATR performance of benzene are described. In ATR tests with mixtures of paraffins and aromatics, synergistic effects on conversion characteristics were identified.

40|$|The {{success of}} insects in {{terrestrial}} environments {{is due in}} large part to their ability to resist desiccation stress. Since the majority of water is lost across the cuticle, a relatively water-impermeable cuticle is a major component of insect desiccation resistance. Cuticular permeability is affected by the properties and mixing effects of <b>component</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and changes in cuticular hydrocarbons can affect desiccation tolerance. A pre-exposure to a mild desiccation stress increases duration of desiccation survival in adult female Drosophila melanogaster, via a decrease in cuticular permeability. To test whether this acute response to desiccation stress is due to a change in cuticular hydrocarbons, we treated male and female D. melanogaster to a rapid desiccation hardening (RDH) treatment and used gas chromatography to examine the effects on cuticular hydrocarbon composition. RDH led to reduced proportions of unsaturated and methylated hydrocarbons compared to controls in females, but although RDH modified the cuticular hydrocarbon profile in males, there was no coordinated pattern. These data suggest that the phenomenon of RDH leading to reduced cuticular water loss occurs via an acute change in cuticular hydrocarbons that enhances desiccation tolerance in female, but not male, D. melanogaster...|$|R
