40|$|In a {{statistical}} study {{performed by the}} London fire brigade in the Real Fires Database {{it was found that}} out of 30 086 fires occurring between 2009 and 2011, fire spread beyond the floor of origin through gaps or voids occurred in 92 cases. This illustrates that the phenomenon is relatively rare. However, it can lead to severe property damage. Fires can spread invisibly within cavities of the structure, which has led to problems concerning the extinguishment of the fire. <b>Cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> function is to stop the fire spread through cavities. However, these <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> have not always been effective. This report {{is the result of a}} study that aimed to: 1. Develop a robust testing method for <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> for cavities with combustible materials within walls, floors and other elements in buildings. 2. Provide guidelines for the materials, installation, positioning, detailing and location of the <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers.</b> Additionally, a preliminary study is performed to assess some extinguishing strategies. Based on a study of characteristics of cavity fires, current standard fire tests for <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> were revised for the use in cavities with combustible materials. From tests following the revised methodology, guidelines regarding the dimensions, installation and fire stopping design are provided. Brandforsk project BF 14 - 004 </p...|$|E

40|$|To build multi story {{buildings}} out {{of timber}} is {{of a common}} interest in the building sector. Timber as a building material has many profits, such as the low cost, the availability {{and the ability to}} recycle it, the low carbon footprint and the workability. Although, when it comes to fire protection of buildings with a timber based structure there are challenges regarding prevention of the spread of fire while timber surface is exposed to fire. There have been cases in which timber buildings have caught fire leading to severe fire spread and ruined buildings. One example concerns a student modulus accommodation in Luleå that caught fire in august 2013. The fire started on the fourth floor after which a vertical fire spread occurred in concealed spaces between the volume modules. According to the fire investigation lack of knowledge regarding performance of detailed building solutions has led to the poor fire performance of the building. This master thesis mainly consists of a model scale tests that is prepared and performed according to the standard EN 1363 - 1. The purpose of the test is to investigate the performance of various <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> exposed to fire. The main objective is to examine which temperatures that can be expected at different positions at various <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> when using model scale test as a test method. There are two main kinds of cavity barriers: barriers that are airtight and closed inside the voids of the construction; and ventilated barriers. The most common <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are the ones that are}} airtight and closed. The material can be solid wood, gypsum board or mineral wool. The installation areas for these <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> are anywhere, besides where the concealed spaces shall be ventilated and in every joint that shall be sealed using sealant. The ventilated <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> are mounted in concealed spaces where the ventilating function is provided. These concealed spaces are often situated in, for example, ventilated attics, facades and roofs. The purpose of the ventilated barriers is to maintain the air flow in the cavity during regular conditions but also to form a protecting barrier between fire compartments when exposed to fire. The model scale test includes test apparatuses such as thermocouples and a fire resistance furnace with plate thermometers and burners. In addition, a test rig consisting of test specimens and the products to be tested are essential.   In this report, two model scale tests have been performed and prepared according to EN  1363 ‑ 1. The test period endured for four hours and the thermocouples measured the temperatures during the whole time. During the first hour the test specimens were exposed to the standard ISO 834 fire curve by controlling the burners in the furnace. After one hour the burners were turned off and the specimens were no longer exposed to fire. The measurements of the temperatures continued during three more hours. After the first two of these three hours the furnace was opened to confer more oxygen in the purpose to record any changes in the temperatures. Results of the performed experiments have indicated parameters that affect the performance of the <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers.</b> The cavity surface itself has an influence to the fire spread. The number of barriers in the cavity and the material properties of the material that is used as the cavity barrier lead to the different protection by those <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers.</b> Some of the tested barriers were plastic covered, which had effect on the performance of the <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers.</b> The dimensions of the barriers, moreover the width and the thickness, are important parameters for the proper function of the barrier. The test results indicate that glowing combustion occurs in the cavity between various <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers.</b>   It can be seen that the temperature rises when the furnace is opened. This indicates the appearance of smouldering since the combustion increases when the amount of oxygen increases, which leads to a temperature rise. Furthermore, the appearance of smouldering (glowing combustion) can be indicated by the observation of the damages of the specimens after the test. The temperatures that may be expected at the unexposed side of the cavity barrier depend on the surface material of the cavity, dimensions, and the material of the <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers.</b> Smouldering is a consequence of the temperature rise in closed cavities between <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers.</b> The performed test endured for approximately four hours and this indicates that fires in cavities can stay for a long time. To ensure the performance of various <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> and verification by a model scale test it is important to perform further experiment and analyses to investigate the effects of the various parameters. To ensure the effectiveness of the performance of the <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> they should be tested in cavities with various widths and various heights. Further investigation of the risk for smouldering is needed with measuring the amount of oxygen and the pressure...|$|E

The experiment demonstrated {{the principle of}} accumulating beam and storing it in an essentially debunched state by using <b>barrier</b> <b>cavities.</b> When the beam is de-bunched the peak-to-average current ratio drops by an order of magnitude. By using two barriers with time varying relative phase, any number of injections is possible, limited only by the momentum acceptance of the ring.

40|$|The {{importance}} of providing effective fire protection to buildings cannot be over-emphasised. The {{consequences of a}} fire occurring in a building, without adequate protection, can result {{in the loss of}} life,property and serious disruption to business and communities. Fire protection requirements should be identified and designed in at the earliest possible stage since later modifications can be disruptive and costly. In the search for a building board which maximised the fire protection properties of the gypsum raw material, British Gypsum developed Glasroc F fire protection boards using below the surface glass reinforcement tissue in place of traditional paper liners. Glasroc F boards are completely non-combustible and offer an excellent surface finish, good impact resistance and moisture tolerance in semi-exposed situations, in addition to superb fire resistance performance. The boards are split into two distinct ranges, Glasroc F MULTIBOARD for general building and fire protection applications, and Glasroc F FIRECASE which has been specially developed for fire protection of structural steelwork and other high performance applications. Glasroc F MULTIBOARD is available in thicknesses of 6 mm, 10 mm and 12. 5 mm and is used to contribute to the fire resistance {{of a wide range of}} building elements including partitions, <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers,</b> ceilings and floors. Glasroc F FIRECASE is available in thicknesses of 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm and 30 mm and is used in the FireCase frameless encasement system to provide up to 120 minutes fire protection to structural steel beams and columns. Glasroc F FIRECASE can also be used in other high performance applications such as in FireWall, a hig...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} present {{evidence}} of smoke spread due to problems in compartmentation and also reviews different test methods {{which can be}} employed to identify these problems during construction stages. Since 2010, evidence has emerged that the rapid spread of smoke occurs in and between UK buildings, including where accredited construction details and/or robust details are specified [1, 2]. It is considered that this rapid smoke spread {{could be due to}} incorrect installation, missing, inappropriate or defective components, that make up compartmentation and fire stopping within concealed spaces [1, 2, 3]. These defects can compromise the ability of compartmentation to resist fire and smoke spread between dwellings and also into any means of escape. The impact of the defects could ultimately be detrimental to occupant safety, care staff with the occupants and also fire fighters, {{in the event of a}} real fire. In 2016, fire risk assessments undertaken in buildings before occupancy (that ascertain the performance of the building with respect to fire and smoke spread in accordance with Approved Document B) of the UK Building Regulations are based upon a visual review of building design details and documentation, and also visual inspection of as-built details. However, this approach is inadequate to identify defects in the components that make up compartmentation and fire stopping details in concealed spaces [3] since, it is impossible to determine with the naked eye whether these details have been installed as designed. Littlewood and Smallwood [1, 2] have identified an urgent need to investigate the extent of these smoke spread problems within new dwellings being constructed in the UK and also the development for an appropriate compliance test which can identify issues in fire compartmentation and fire stopping and used before buildings are occupied - such as the in-construction testing (iCT) process. The paper also reviews different tests that can be employed as part of iCT methodology to identify the potential defects in fire compartmentation, and fire stops such as <b>cavity</b> <b>barriers</b> in buildings...|$|E
40|$|A barrier bucket {{experiment}} with two dedicated <b>barrier</b> <b>cavities</b> was {{performed at the}} Brookhaven AGS. One of the <b>barrier</b> <b>cavities</b> was a magnetic alloy (MA) –loaded cavity {{and the other was}} a ferrite-loaded cavity. They generated a single sine wave with a peak voltage of 40 kV at a repetition rate of 351 kHz. A barrier rf system was established with these cavities and five bunches from the AGS booster were accumulated. A total of 3 × 10 ^{ 13 } protons were stored without beam loss, and were successfully rebunched and accelerated. The longitudinal emittance growth was observed during accumulation by the barrier bucket, the blowup factor of which was about 3. The longitudinal mismatch between the rf bucket and the beam bunch was the main reason for the emittance growth. The potential distortions by beam loading of the ferrite cavity and the overshooting voltage of the MA cavity disturbed the smooth debunching...|$|R

40|$|Any {{opening in}} the {{exterior}} of structures are critical when exposed to fire. Windows and doors may be open, ventilation openings may be unprotected, wall cladding and roof tiles may allow flames or embers to enter cavities. Gaps may have developed over time and allow embers to settle in crevices or cavities in the structure. In fact, rarely does initial fire penetration occur right through cladding, sheets, insulation or solid walls. Penetration is most often related to openings, weak joints or cracks. There is no doubt these weak points to fire spread in construction or indoor are crucial to the outcome of exterior fire exposure whether caused by wildfire or fire in outdoor trash or neighbouring buildings. Therefore, this has been addressed by authorities, standardization bodies and industry world-wide and much progress have been made during the last decade. This paper provide overview on new standards, on codes and on various pass/fail criteria set by code or classification standards.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the {{technological}} advances observed in solar collector materials, namely better spectrally selective absorber coatings and ultra clear glass covers, contribute to performance improvements and translate into higher operational temperature ranges with higher efficiency values. While the use of Evacuated Tube Collectors (ETCs) is becoming widespread in the thermal conversion of solar energy, non-evacuated solar collectors still hold advantages at manufacturing, reliability and/or cost levels, making them interesting and competitive for a large range of applications, in particularly, in temperature ranges up to 80 °C. However, these advantages have not prevented the major drawback of these collectors when compared to ETCs: thermal losses due to internal convection which prevent their general use {{in the range of}} operating temperatures up to 150 °C. Insulation, double glazing or selective coatings can be used in non-evacuated collectors to reduce heat losses. To prevent internal convection losses in these solar collectors, different control strategies have been studied, such as the adoption of different inert gases within the collector <b>cavity,</b> physical <b>barriers</b> reducing air flow velocities over the absorber or cover surfaces or the use of concentration. In the present article, an assessment of adopting such internal convection control strategies in a CPC collector is presented. Each of the presented strategies is assessed in terms of the resulting collector optical and thermal characterization parameters and yearly collector yield. For this purpose, an integrated tool allowing the design, optical and thermal characterization of CPC collectors was developed. The results obtained provide valuable guidelines for anyone wishing to implement any of these strategies in a new collector design...|$|R

The Lennard‐Jones 28 – 7 potential gives the least satisfactory results. The Lennard‐Jones 12 – 6 potential works satisfactorily for the monatomic gases and CH_ 4 but poorly for the rodlike molecules C_ 2 H_ 6, CO_ 2, N_ 2, O_ 2, C_ 2 H_ 4. This failure {{may be due to}} (i) distortions of the hydrate lattice, (ii) neglect of molecular shape and size in determining the <b>cavity</b> potential (iii) <b>barrier</b> to internal rotation of the molecule in its cavity. A crude model for the lattice shows that it is not distorted. The Kihara potential predicts better dissociation pressures for the hydrates of the rodlike molecules. Unlike the previously used Lennard‐Jones 12 – 6 potential, it depends on {{the size and shape of}} the interacting molecules. The absence of lattice distortions, improved dissociation pressures through the use of the Kihara potential and the restriction of the motion of the solute molecule to around the center of a cavity makes a large barrier to rotation unlikely.

Fluid enters subperitoneal lymphatic lacunae, between muscle fibres of {{the diaphragm}}, the lacunae being separated from the peritoneal <b>cavity</b> by a <b>barrier</b> comprising, successively, lymphatic endothelium, a layer of collagenous fibres, a thin fenestrated layer of elastic tissue, and the peritoneal mesothelium. To reach the lacunae, peritoneal fluid passes through stomata located between cuboidal mesothelial cells of the lacunar roof. Whilst the distribution of mesothelial stomata and subjacent lymphatic lacunae varies in different species, stomata appear to be exclusive to the diaphragm and may serve as the main drainage channels for absorption from the peritoneal cavity. Clinically, they may provide escape for tumour cells, pathogens and toxins from the peritoneal cavity. They could provide access for blood transfusions, for intraperitoneal chemotherapy to treat malignancies, and for peritoneal dialysis in treating chronic renal failure. From the lacunae, fluid traverses the diaphragm via intrinsic lymphatics to reach collecting lymphatics beneath the diaphragmatic pleura. Both intrinsic and collecting lymphatics contain valves. The collecting lymphatics drain principally into retrosternal (parasternal) lymphatic trunks that carry lymph to the great veins after it filters through mediastinal lymph nodes...|$|R

Interstitial delivery is compromised {{by the poor}} mobility of macromolecules and larger nanoscale structures. We developed an in vitro system to quantify the suitability of superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPM NPs) as a site-specific therapeutic vehicle for delivery through fluid- and gel-based systems. SPM NP motion was induced by an external magnetic field. NP migration was modulated by NP concentra-tion and surface coating. 135 nanometer radius PEGylated NPs moved through the extracellular matrix with an average velocity of 1. 5 mm h− 1, suitable for some clinical applications. Increasing the SPM NP radius to 400 nm while maintaining the same per NP magnetic susceptibility resulted in a greater than 1000 -fold reduc-tion in magnetic mobility, to less than 0. 01 mm h− 1. The critical influence of NP size on gel permeation was also observed in silica-coated 135 nm SPM NPs that aggregated under the experimental conditions. Aggregation {{played a critical role}} in determining the behavior of the nanoparticles.
