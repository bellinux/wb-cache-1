2500|$|Upon introduction, {{the model}} {{had only one}} trim level, which would later {{be known as the}} LX model trim; it was powered by the 2.0L straight-four B20B {{producing}} [...] at 5400rpm and [...] of torque at 4800rpm. Outer dimensions for this engine would be identical to the Integra's 1.8L engine, but internally the engine had a larger [...] bore to add the extra displacement needed to produce more torque. The engine utilized a one-piece <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> construction unique from any other B-series engine. The chassis was a unibody design with a four-wheel double wishbone suspension. Inside, the rear seats were able to fold down, and a picnic table was stowed in the rear floor area. A common external trait that was visible with this generation was plastic cladding covering the front bumper, rear bumper, and fender wells. In most countries, CR-Vs had a chrome grille; however, in the United States, the grille was made out of the same black plastic as the bumpers. A major difference between the LX and EX trims was that the EX had anti-lock brakes and 15inch alloy wheels while the LX did not. Drivetrain options were front-wheel drive or Honda's Real Time AWD.|$|E
5000|$|The Navistar DT {{diesel engines}} {{are of a}} wet-sleeve design. This means that the {{cylinder}} wall (sleeve) is a separately machined part that fits into the cylinder bores cast into the engine block. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> is {{in contact with the}} engine coolant, hence the [...] "wet"-sleeve.|$|E
5000|$|... 3. Engine {{size was}} {{sometimes}} upgradeable. For example, in the 1950s and 60s {{it was very}} popular to upgrade the Super M-TA and 400 model 264 cid engine to 281 cid. An economical <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> and piston change {{was all that was}} needed. This brought the power level up to that of the 450 model.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> of engines ZMZ- 53 (66 - 1002020) and diesels SMD- 60 and SMD- 62 (60 - 0110212). The {{purpose of the}} work: the {{development}} of the new economic technological process of the finishing antifriction abrasiveless treatment of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> of the internal combustion engine, which increases its quality and wear-resistance. Founder theoretically has been the condition of application of antifriction coatings on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves.</b> A new method of obtaining the composition antifriction coating from copper and molibdenum disulphide has been suggested. The new technological process FAAT of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> of the internal combustion engines allowing to increase the wear-resistance of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> by 1. 6 to 2. 3 times, piston rings by 1. 35 to 1. 8 times and the engines time between overhauls by 1. 3 times has been developed.

5000|$|The {{problem was}} {{diagnosed}} to {{originate in the}} thermal expansion rate of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> causing the Cooper Ring in between the block and the head to leak. With this problem solved in the Mk.II 186 bhp version, having a larger 1.35" [...] intake valves (1.30" [...] previously), FWMV started to score GP victories, ending the 1962 season with 3 wins for Lotus, 1 win for Cooper, 5 second places and 4 third places, in addition to 7 pole positions and 6 fastest laps.|$|E
50|$|Navistar {{claims that}} the wet-sleeve design enhances {{durability}} because the consistent wall thickness of the sleeve allows for consistent heat transfer, ensuring the cylinders stay round during thermal expansion. Additionally, they state that the hardened <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> is more durable and wear resistant than a softer, cast-in wall. Also, the replaceable cylinder sleeves protect the block from damage (e.g. in case of foreign objects entering the cylinder) and can easily be replaced, which Navistar claims enables simpler restoration to original specifications. The wet-sleeve design also allows the engine to be rebuilt easily to factory specifications, sometimes without even removing the engine from the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The most {{powerful}} {{version of the}} Centaurus was intended for the Blackburn Beverley transport aircraft. Using direct fuel injection, it achieved a remarkable 3,220 hp but was never fitted. A projected enlarged capacity version of the Centaurus was designed by Sir Roy Fedden; cylinders were produced for this engine {{but it was never}} built. Known as the Bristol Orion (a name used previously for a variant of the Jupiter engine, and later re-used for a turboprop) this development was also a two-row, 18 <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> valve engine, with the displacement increased to 4,142 cubic inches (67.9 l) (6.25x7.5), nearly as large as the American Wasp Major four-row, 28-cylinder radial, the largest displacement aviation radial engine ever placed in quantity production.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the SV engine, {{which uses}} cast iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves,</b> the DL650 uses Suzuki's {{proprietary}} SCEM (Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material) plated cylinders, a race-proven nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide coating for reduced weight and improved heat transfer, allowing for tighter {{and more efficient}} piston-to-cylinder clearance, similar to a Nikasil coating.|$|R
5000|$|Toyota {{has since}} used metal matrix {{composites}} in the Yamaha-designed 2ZZ-GE engine {{which is used}} in the later Lotus Lotus Elise S2 versions as well as Toyota car models, including the eponymous Toyota Matrix.

25|$|Centrifugal casting is {{also used}} to produce short {{circular}} tubes as billets, usually to achieve a precise metallurgical structure.

50|$|The B21A1 was {{basically}} a re-worked B20A5 {{with an increase in}} bore to 83 mm. The external block dimensions had to stay identical (although there was increased external strengthening and webbing on the B21) to the B20A5 block so Honda called upon Saffil to create a thin but strong cylinder liner called FRM (fiber reinforced metal) which basically consisted of a carbon fiber matrix, aluminum alloy, and aluminum oxide to make a very strong <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The sleeve is so strong, in fact, that it wears out the piston rings causing low compression numbers, severe smoking, and high oil usage. It is possible in many situations to merely replace the worn rings in order to revive the motor's former output. Many machine shops will not attempt to re-hone or re-bore the FRM sleeves, as this type of sleeve will de-laminate during machining operations.|$|E
5000|$|All the old {{designs were}} dropped {{and a new}} 10 hp car called the Bullet was {{designed}} by A,W. Reeves who had been at Crossley Motors. This radical design had an air cooled, five <b>cylinder,</b> <b>sleeve</b> valve, radial engine of 1247 cc mounted {{at the front of}} a tubular steel lattice frame. [...] The drive to the rear wheels was via an inclined shaft to a central 3 speed gearbox and then another shaft to the rear axle. Suspension was by transverse cantilever springs. A three-seat body was fitted. When announced a price of £295 was advertised {{but by the time the}} car was exhibited later in the year at the London Motor Show this had risen to £350. A. C. [...] "Gus" [...] Bertelli of the Grahame-White Aviation company was called in to give an opinion on the car and reported that a lot of development was required and the price was uneconomic and should be raised to £550. This was too much for the market and probably only 5 reached customers.|$|E

5000|$|A {{cylinder}} block is a unit comprising several cylinders (including their cylinder walls, coolant passages, <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> if any, and so forth). In the earliest decades of {{internal combustion engine}} development, monobloc cylinder construction was rare; cylinders were usually cast individually.

The company was provided sixty Volkswagen Type 1s by Major Ivan Hirst {{but was unable}} to sell any in the anti-German postwar climate and difficult economic conditions. The company's first product, the Fedden O-325, was a small horizontally-opposed fuel injected six <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> valve aeroengine intended for helicopters or for submerged wing installation in aircraft. It was technically superior to any flat-four or -six produced in the U.S. and was being considered for the American Ercoupe. The engine did not progress beyond development as [...] "Roy Fedden Limited" [...] went into liquidation in June 1947. Fedden then turned to a new [...] turboprop design, the Cotswold, meant to be installed within the wings of aircraft in either tractor or pusher configuration, This source may be misleading as Gunston shows three different schemes, all tractor nacelle installations. The Cotswold engine did not progress beyond the design stage. Finally they decided to design their own car, powered by a three-cylinder air-cooled radial, but they found it had vibration and overheating problems and tended to skid badly when being cornered hard. Work started on a replacement chassis, {{but the rest of the}} company's engineers lost interest and left, and soon the company had to be dissolved.|$|E

The {{finite element}} {{analytical}} {{model of a}} diesel engine is established to analyze the stress, the flatness, the roundness {{and the rate of}} light leakage of the diesel engine block. The analysis result shows that the optimized scheme improves the body's stress concentration and deformation obviously: the tensile stress between the upper <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> shoulders spigot and the counter bore of cylinder head bolt decreases by 15 % compares to the original diesel engine block. The maximum stress decreases obviously and the stress concentration region moves down slightly by changing the “T ” type stiffener above the head of the block into rectangular stiffener; the flatness of the end surface of cylinder liner spigot decreases by 11. 3 %; the circularity and the rate of light leakage of each cross section on cylinder liner decreases obviously...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{performed}} tests, an advantageous interaction of glassy carbon particles in a couple consisting of a heterophase composite and a spheroidal cast iron has been corroborated. It was found that, the presence of glassy carbon in the heterophase composite (SiC+C) affects the stabilization of the friction coefficient value {{as a function of the}} friction distance and reduces the intensity of the wearing-in stage of the interacting surfaces. Both a decrease of the friction coefficient and the wear of the heterophase composites may be connected with the carbon particles' chipping effect and the deposition of its fragments on the surface of the interacting components of the friction couple, which forms a kind of a solid lubricating agent in the system. This should allow applying of this material to the composite piston - <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> system in piston air-compressors. Further works will concern the selection of the matrix alloy composition with the purpose of reducing the phenomenon of particles chipping during machining. It seems that one of the possibilities is the application of a more plastic matrix and optimizing the fraction of reinforcing phases and their gradient distribution in the casting...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a process}} of combustion in a spark-ignition engine. The aim of the analysis {{was to determine the}} differences in the combustion process between the engine with a classic multipoint injection system and a system wh ich injects fuel directly to the cylinders as well. To aid in the analysis the measuremen ts of the high variable pressure in th e engine's cylinder against the crankshaft angle were taken. This allowed us to obtain indicated diagrams for both types o f engines. To eliminate distortions, both functions were approximated using combined functions. Th e other basic parameters were also measu red: torque, RPM and insta ntaneous fuel consumption. The analysis of the indicated diagrams yielded an indicated mean pressure and thermal e fficiency for both fuel systems. Then, a comprehensive analysis of pressures in cylin ders was performed {{in order to determine the}} way the flame spreads in the cylinder for the two types of engines. The results obtained from this analysis show that the speed of combustion is grea ter for the charge formed by the dual-injector fuel system. The increased spee d of the combustion, especially when it reaches a 50 % fraction of the exhaust gas in the cylinder, is what accounts for the increase in the indicated mean pressure and the increase in the thermal efficiency of the engine with a dual-injector fuel system. The time of the spreading of the flame, as well as the fast burn period were reduced. The increased eff iciency of the combustion process in the cylinder means tha t the heat losses through the <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> are greatly reduced. The results of the research in th is paper confirm the purposefulness of using a dual-injector fuel system in a spark-ignition engine...|$|E

50|$|Engine blocks are {{normally}} cast from either a suitable grade of iron or an aluminium alloy. The aluminium block is much lighter in weight, and has better heat {{transfer to the}} coolant, but iron blocks retain some advantages {{and continue to be}} used by some manufacturers. Because of the use of cylinder liners and bearing shells, the relative softness of aluminium is of no consequence.
