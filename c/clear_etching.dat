It is shown that above (i. e., at higher Eh or C 1 -) the line Eh = 0. 90 - 0. 08 log(C 1 -) the solubility of gold theoretically exceeds 10 - 5 moles/liter, or 2 ppm; it is dissolved as the auric chloride complex, AuCI•-. Only part of the region above this line lies below the upper stability limit for water. Experiments produced <b>clear</b> <b>etching</b> on smooth gold plates. A solution, 1 N in H 2 SO 4 and 0. 1 M in NaC 1, was passed over crushed pyrolusite and a gold plate; this dissolved 0. 8 mg of gold in 51 ml of solution in one week.

The emerging etching pattern (the initial pattern is round; see Figure 1 b) reveals that the solution etches anisotropically. <b>Clear</b> <b>etching</b> facets in the < 110 > crystal direction of the STO substrate are observed, indicating the slowest etching direction. The < 100 > direction is the fastest etching direction as seen in the underetched fingers (Figure 1 a, b).

40|$|SUMMARY. The Angra dos Reis (iron) {{has been}} studied metallogl"aphically and an attempt {{has been made to}} discuss the {{circumstances}} under which the following elements of structure formed: <b>clear</b> <b>etching</b> and frosty etching kamacite, decorated Neumann lines, giant rhabdites, plate rbabdites, rhabdite clusters, microrhabdites, cohenite, and remelted troilite. The remelted troilite is taken to indicate a shock event. However, since there are no metallographically visible indications of shock in the kamacite and since the back reflection X-ray diffraction pattern shows only very faint Debye-Scherrer arcs superimposed on a pattern of sharp spots, it is concluded that the shock event ook place at a temperature that allowed shock effects to anneal out of the kamacite almost completely. A sub-microscopic precipitate in the metallic matrix is observable with the electron microscope and may represent the final precipitation of phosphide from shocked kamacite. TnE Angra dos Reis (iron) is recorded by Hey (I 966) as a nickel-poor ataxite. The main mass is in the Vatican collection and Salpeter 0957) has recorded it as a hexa-hedrite under the name Pseudo-Angra dos Reis. Our own examination indicates a hexahedrite structure.

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} fabrication and optimization of micro-scale gratings formed by nanosecond laser etching. The mechanism of nanosecond laser processing and the geometric phase analysis (GPA) are discussed, and the factors influencing the fabrication process including laser energy, laser fluence, and ablation threshold of material, are experimentally studied. In order {{to eliminate the}} dependence of the processing parameters on the samples, depositing Al film on a sample before laser processing is proposed for the fabrication of high-quality gratings. The energy of the laser pulse is optimized for <b>clear</b> line <b>etching</b> on Al film considering the distance between adjacent lines of parallel gratings. The optimal energy of the laser pulse is 9. 8 μJ, and the optimum fluence is 9. 5 J/mm 2 with the waist radius of the laser beam 25. 7 μm. With the optimal parameters, experimental {{results indicate that the}} highest frequency of parallel gratings is about 30 lines/mm, with a line width of 29 μm, and the distance between two adjacent laser pulses being of 10 μm. By performing tensile tests, micro-scale gratings fabricated on specimens are experimentally verified. The verification tests prove that the proposed fabrication method for the micro-scale gratings in GPA measurements is reliable and applicable, and the micro-scale gratings can be fabricated in many areas of interest, such as the crack tip, for deformation measurements. Furthermore, the adhesion between the Al film and the tested sample is strong enough so that the pattern sticks well to the sample...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{with the}} help of a {{nanoscale}} trench, the 3 D composition and conductance distributions are simultaneously measured on same single GeSi QDs by combining CAFM measurement with NHH etching. The results present that the highly GeSi mixed QDs (grown at 680  °C) exhibit extremely poor conductance after 2 -min NHH etching, which can be recovered after the subsequent NHH etching processes. With further confirmatory experiments, it is predicted that a thick oxide layer is formed and remains on these QDs’ surface after NHH etching. This oxidation problem has never been mentioned in previous experiments with similar etching method, probably due to the following: conductive properties were not concerned in those cases or the dealt QDs were not highly GeSi mixed. Therefore, our experimental findings should be useful to make <b>clear</b> the NHH <b>etching</b> process of highly GeSi mixed QDs, as well as to get the exact composition and conductive properties of those kinds of QDs.|$|R
40|$|Previously, etching {{experiments}} were performed in this laboratory by injecting short pulses of an etchant gas, such as NF 3, into a slow stream of Ar passing through an active plasma cell, and {{by analyzing the}} resulting transients of inter-mediates and products mass spectrometrically. In the present study, these procedures were modified in several ways, so as to {{add to our understanding}} of the etching mechanism: (i) In some experiments, the plasma voltage was applied only for short time intervals to a previously etched sample, and discharge cleaning was observed, as one would expect. (ii) More surprisingly, when Si wafers were first etched, then partially discharge cleaned, and finally subjected to pulses of NF ~ after the plasma had been extinguished, small additional amounts of SiF 4 were released. By varying the lengths of gas and voltage pulses and by adjusting the time delays between pulses, it was possible to estimate the rates at which ion bombardment damage built up and healed in near-surface r gions of the Si sample. (iii) Finally, in some ex-periments, the plasma was extinguished uring an NF 3 gas pulse, and etching virtually stopped at once while the frag-ment concentrations decayed more gradually. The subtle effects described under (ii) were not discernible in these latter experiments. In recent years, it has become <b>clear</b> that plasma <b>etching</b> of a solid can lead to the formation of layers of intermedi...|$|R

40|$|Anisotropic etching {{of silicon}} (Si) in {{alkaline}} solutions have remained a reliable bulk micromachining process for micro electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) for several decades. The anisotropy, or (surface) orientation dependence, in the silicon etch rate {{allows for the}} fabrication of complex, micrometer-sized structures with well-defined geometries. Using smart mask designs {{in combination with other}} bulk and surface micromachining processes, complex MEMS devices can be fabricated for various applications such as sensor, actuator or micro-fluidics systems. Although wet chemical etching is widely used within the industry, the fundamental basis behind the actual etch process is not entirely <b>clear.</b> Anisotropic <b>etching</b> of Si {{has proven to be a}} very complex system, where in-depth knowledge is required ranging from a chemical scale (i. e. surface reactions) to a macroscopic scale (e. i. surface morphology and etch features). While the surface etch reactions are purely chemical in nature, more recent investigations have shown the additional importance of the electrochemistry within the system, which further increases the complexity of the system. Within this thesis we aim to investigate the influence of the electrochemistry on the impact of a constant applied potential on a more microscopic scale. The lectrochemistry of Si in an alkaline solution (such as concentrated potassium hydroxide (KOH)) on a chemical scale is well established. It is, however, not entirely clear how the electrochemistry affects microscopic phenomena such as the step or surface anisotropy, roughening and step velocity. Understanding this not only gives more insight into the electrochemistry and electrochemical oxidation mechanism, but also the etch mechanism as a whole. For MEMS application and processing, this can lead to increased control and predictability of the etch process. This in turn can help in the design and fabrication of better structures and surface quality, which increases device performance. Investigating the etch mechanism on a microscopic scale is however not straight forward. The processes, phenomena and properties of interest on this scale, are very difficult to measure directly. To overcome this, we have used the kinematic wave theory to determine these properties indirectly. The kinematic wave theory can be used to construct a continuous etch model where the etch rate is a function of the Si surface orientation and several physical parameters. These parameters are linked to the microscopic properties of interest. Using measured etch rate data obtained from primarily wagon-wheel patterns, these parameters can then be determined...|$|R
40|$|Texturing {{of silicon}} wafers is an {{important}} process step in fabrication of solar cells {{in order to reduce}} the reflection of incoming light radiation on the solar cell surfaces. The conventional wet chemical <b>etching</b> methods have <b>clear</b> limitations in <b>etching</b> and texturing of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers. Chemical etching of mc-Si wafers in alkaline solutions results in a coarse and non uniform surface morphology since the dissolution rate depends on the grain orientation. In contrast to alkaline etching, textures formed by acidic etchants (HF+HNO 3) are uniform. However, acidic etching is difficult to control, the disposal of the waste is expensive and the method is in general environmentally hazardous. The aim of this thesis is to study an environmentally friendly etching method, which is supposed to be an alternative to acidic texturing of both single and multicrystalline B-doped silicon wafers. The method is based on anodic polarization of Si in alkaline solutions. In spite of the fact that silicon is one of the most studied elements due to its applicability in electronic devices, its electrochemistry in alkaline solutions at increased temperatures and at high potentials has been scarcely investigated. In the first part of the thesis monocrystalline (100) and (111) silicon samples were polarized in a strong alkaline solution at different temperatures and potentials in order to study anodic passivation mechanism. In the second part single- and multicrystalline Si-wafers were textured by utilizing electrochemical treatment in hot alkaline solutions. Anodic dissolution and passivation of Si (100) and Si (111) were studied by potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarizations in 2 M KOH at temperatures ranging from 23 oC to 70 oC and at potentials from the open circuit potential (OCP) to 14. 5 V (with respect to Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Potentiostatic polarization experiments were performed on as-received (mechanically sawed or polished) and pre-etched (at OCP in the alkaline test solution) samples. The composition and thickness of the reaction products formed on the surfaces were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology of the surfaces was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The oxide products formed during passivation was analyzed after polarization to the Flade potential at about 1 V. A thin (about 1 nm) homogeneous layer of Sioxyhydroxide (H 2 SiO 3) is formed at this potential. It is formed on both crystal orientations independent of temperature. The hydrated silica layer is gradually transformed into the stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 by polarizing Si (100) above the Flade potential at 23 oC or 30 oC. The phase change is indicated by an oxidation peak at around 4 V during potentiodynamic polarizations. Further, XPS analysis shows that both hydrated and dehydrated silica coexist at this potential. The oxide thickness formed during potentiodynamic polarization to 14. 5 V is 22 nm. Oxygen evolution is observed at about 4 V. At higher potentials the oxygen evolution is inhibited due to growth of thick oxide. The stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 forms and grows with increasing potential and exposure time on Si (111) at all temperatures irrespective of pre-etching. The thicknesses of the oxide are in the range 3 nm to 40 nm depending on the polarization method, potential and exposure time. The formation and growth of SiO 2 on Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures depends on surface pre-etching. Polarization of pre-etched Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures does not form SiO 2 on the surface. The compound present after polarization at all potentials was the thin, 1 nm thick hydrated silica layer. It was formed irrespectively of the polarization method or potential. Thus, pre-etching {{is an important}} parameter in the oxidation mechanism of Si (100). Oxide growth on non-pre-etched Si (100) at the high temperatures was similar to that of Si (111). However, pre-etching of Si (100) for more than 10 min at the high temperatures results in formation of pyramidal hillocks on the surface. During polarization at the high temperatures, the pyramidal hillocks are dissolved and the surface becomes flattened. Hydrated silica layer is the only detected oxidation product at all potentials. In the second part of the thesis a method is developed for electrochemical texturing of as-cut multicrystalline and single crystals, Si (111) and Si (100), in alkaline solutions. The wafers are potentiostatically polarized in 2 M KOH and 4 M KOH at temperatures in the range 30 oC to 70 oC. The applied potentials are varied from 20 V to 50 V (referred to Pt-counter electrode). Before the polarization, the samples are pre-etched in the test solution to remove the deformed zone on the as-cut surfaces. The morphology of the textured surfaces, the composition and thickness of the surface products and the light reflectivity are analyzed by utilizing SEM, XPS and Lambda UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer, respectively. Pre-etching of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers results in anisotropic surface morphology with protrusions and valleys due to etching of different grains at different etch rates in alkaline solutions. During anodic polarization at potentials above 20 V and at temperatures at 40 oC and above, all the grains are uniformly textured. At 25 V and 30 V, micro-pits are formed on the protrusions. With increasing the potential to 40 V and 50 V, concave cavities are formed on the entire surface. Isotropic texturing is achieved. Isotropic texturing on mc-Si wafers is characterized by formation of the concave cavities of 1 to 10 μm. Inside the micropits and cavities, nano-pits are formed. Their lateral size is in the range 100 nm to 200 nm. At 50 V, the nano-pits are etched away and the cavities become shallower due to enhanced dissolution. The lowest average reflectivity, 17 %, is achieved on electrochemically textured surface after polarization at 40 V for 10 min in 4 M KOH at 50 oC, which is 50 % lower than the reflectivity on the pre-etched surface. A model for the isotropic texturing mechanism is proposed based on XPS analysis and electrochemical measurements. It is suggested that the formation of pits and concave cavities is due to local pH variations caused by oxygen evolution reaction, which control formation and dissolution of the surface oxide. Protons formed during oxygen evolution reduce the pH on the surface locally. Hereby, SiO 2 becomes stable and grows on the surface in the low pH area. For prolonged exposure the growth of the oxide passivates the surface and lowers the oxidation rate of Si and water. Due to high alkalinity of the electrolyte, oxide dissolves at weak points thus creating pits. Oxidation of silicon and oxygen evolution occurs at the oxide breakdown sites. Continuous formation and local dissolution of oxide causes the formation of micro-pitted surface. Formation of pits and concave cavities are not affected by changes in the electrolyte concentration and temperature. However, pre-etching is an important factor in obtaining the uniform textures on all the grains of the mc-Si wafers. This is due to the fact that pre-etching influences the formation of SiO 2 on (100) grains at high temperatures. Isotropic textures are not obtained on mc-Si wafers containing significant number of (100) grains when pre-etched for more than 10 min. On Si (111) wafer surfaces, pre-etching results in formation of steps and terraces. The terraces contain true (111) planes are stable and steps contain fast etching planes such as (100) and (110) are more reactive. During polarization, terrace planes are passivated by formation of a stable oxide, and pits are initiated at the step edges. With increasing potential, temperature and exposure time, pitting spreads over the terrace planes. The surface reflectance is decreased with increasing pit coverage. It is demonstrated that the electrochemical texturing method can effectively replace the present isotropic etching by acidic etchants. Both single crystal and multicrystalline materials have successfully been textured. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|R
