5|$|Fay Michael Peter v. Public Prosecutor (1994) {{concerned}} an American teenager, Michael P. Fay, who {{was arrested}} in 1994 for vandalizing cars and stealing street signs. He pleaded guilty to two charges of vandalizing by spraying paint {{on a number of}} cars. On conviction by a subordinate court, he was sentenced to a total of four months' imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. For the purposes of sentencing, other charges were taken into consideration, including 16 charges of vandalism involving paint. Fay appealed to the High Court against the sentences, arguing that (a) proviso to section 3 of the Vandalism Act required the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the indelible quality of the paint used before <b>caning</b> could be imposed; (b) a probation order was appropriate in this case; and (c) the trial judge below should have ordered a pre-sentencing report with a view to ordering probation. The appeal was dismissed. The case generated intense media interest in the United States, culminating in a formal request from the US Government for the <b>caning</b> sentence not to be carried out. The Singapore Government rejected the request on the basis that foreigners in Singapore could not be held to a different standard from citizens. However, it recommended that the President reduce the <b>caning</b> from six strokes to four.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the contribution of different traits to <b>cane</b> yield in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L). Sixty-five clones were evaluated in a replicated field experiment at Sugarcane Research Programme, Jitpur, Nepal in 2003 for six morphological characters under irrigated conditions. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences for all the characters studied. <b>Cane</b> yield showed positively and highly significant correlation with single <b>cane</b> weight, stalk length and millable <b>cane</b> number. There was also positively significant correlation of <b>cane</b> diameter and number of internode with <b>cane</b> yield. Length of internode had positive non-significant correlation with <b>cane</b> yield. Single <b>cane</b> weight had the highest positive direct effect on <b>cane</b> yield followed by millable <b>cane</b> number. Stalk diameter and stalk length was positively and significantly correlated with <b>cane</b> yield, which was due to indirect effect of single <b>cane</b> weight.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} differences in the energy expenditure and economy of movement of sugarcane cutters with regard to burnt and green <b>cane</b> in situ. The primary objective was to investigate the differences in physiological responses, namely oxygen consumption (VO 2), heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) and the economy of movement with regard to burnt and green sugarcane during a normal working day. The secondary study was to investigate the effect of the long and the short handled curved blade knives on the cutter’s energy expenditure and economy of movement. The average relative VO 2 for cutting burnt <b>cane</b> and the calculated relative EE were both significantly lower than those for green <b>cane.</b> The average HR during work was not significantly different for burnt or green <b>cane,</b> neither was the maximal HR. Rate of productivity for burnt <b>cane</b> was significantly higher than that for green <b>cane.</b> Energy per kilogram required for burnt cut <b>cane</b> was significantly lower than that for green <b>cane.</b> The amount of <b>cane</b> cut per litre of oxygen consumed for burnt <b>cane</b> was significantly higher than that for green <b>cane.</b> The number of <b>cane</b> cutting strokes per minute for green <b>cane</b> was significantly lower than that for burnt <b>cane.</b> The number of stalks cut per stroke of green <b>cane</b> was significantly higher than that for burnt <b>cane.</b> The secondary study produced no significant differences in any of the measured variables for the comparison between the long handled knife and the short handled knife, except for the <b>cane</b> cutter’s perceived exertion (RPE).

5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to <b>caning.</b> A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of <b>caning.</b> A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E
