50|$|There {{are several}} {{proposed}} plans {{of action in}} protecting the falcated duck. <b>Conservationists</b> are keen to continue monitoring populations that have unfortunately stopped breeding, and plan to petition for hunting and shooting regulations on both the local and national level, respectively. <b>Conservationists</b> are also aware as to the great lack of education in regards to waterfowl extinction. For hunters who make a living off of either using the falcated duck as a food source or from simple sport hunts, <b>conservationists</b> are looking for alternative employment opportunities. Finally, <b>conservationists</b> hope to improve the management and coordination of already existing nature reserves where the falcated duck is present.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{different}} groups had emerged within the US environmental movement {{by the early}} 20th century: the <b>conservationists</b> and the preservationists. The initial consensus among <b>conservationists</b> was split into [...] "utilitarian conservationists" [...] later {{to be referred to}} as <b>conservationists,</b> and [...] "aesthetic conservationists" [...] or preservationists. The main representative for the former was Gifford Pinchot, first Chief of the United States Forest Service, and they focused on the proper use of nature, whereas the preservationists sought the protection of nature from use. Put another way, conservation sought to regulate human use while preservation sought to eliminate human impact altogether. The management of US public lands during the years 1960s and 70s reflected these dual visions, with <b>conservationists</b> dominating the Forest Service, and preservationists the Park Service ...|$|R

5|$|An avid <b>conservationist</b> and hunter, Burnham {{supported}} the early conservation programs {{of his friends}} Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot. He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa {{with the goal of}} finding large animals such as Giant Eland, hippopotamus, zebra, and various bird species that might be bred in the United States and become game for future American sportsmen. Burnham, Hammond, and Duquesne appeared several times before the House Committee on Agriculture to ask for help in importing large African animals. In 1914, he helped establish the Wild Life Protective League of America, Department of Southern California, and served as its first Secretary.|$|E

The family moved to Syracuse, New York, where Louis Marshall {{was active in the}} Jewish community and a co-founder of the American Jewish Committee.

The session also tightened strip mining laws to prohibit mining on mountainsides that were too steep to be restored. In 1967, he was recognized with the U.S. Department of Interior's Distinguished Service Award and Outdoor Life magazine's <b>Conservationist</b> of the Year Award for his contributions to conservation.|$|E

5|$|During Princess Elizabeth's 1950 tour of Canada, she {{was promised}} a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, the {{arrangements}} {{to be made}} by Peter Scott. Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in British Columbia as they had been fed for decades by <b>conservationist</b> Ralph Edwards. In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos). One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of his}} {{own life}} {{conservationism}} wasn't yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express <b>conservationist</b> views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{an ardent}} <b>conservationist,</b> {{assisted}} in this by like-minded appointees, including Interior Secretary James R. Garfield and Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot. Taft {{agreed with the}} need for conservation, but felt it should be accomplished by legislation rather than executive order. He did not retain Garfield, an Ohioan, as secretary, choosing instead a westerner, former Seattle mayor Richard A. Ballinger. Roosevelt was surprised at the replacement, believing that Taft had promised to keep Garfield, and this change was one of the events that caused Roosevelt to realize that Taft would choose different policies.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its history, Banff National Park {{has been}} shaped by tension between <b>conservationist</b> and land {{exploitation}} interests.

The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.|$|E
5|$|Mauricio González-Gordon y Díez, Marquis of Bonanza (18 October 1923 – 27 September 2013) was a Spanish sherry {{maker and}} a <b>conservationist.</b> Most {{of his life}} he worked for the family company, González Byass, where he {{increased}} its exports to a worldwide level. His family estate was located in the wetland region called Doñana in southern Spain and was threatened by drainage efforts in the early 1950s. González-Gordon with the help of researchers and international support managed to preserve the site, {{while at the same time}} donating some of his family land to the conservation effort. Afterward, González-Gordon became one of the founders of the Spanish Ornithological Society in 1954. His conservation efforts for Doñana culminated in the creation of the Doñana National Park in 1969. The area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The <b>conservationist</b> Mervyn Cowie {{was born}} in Nairobi. Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in 1932, he was alarmed {{to see that the}} amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled. Expanding farms and {{livestock}} had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become Nairobi National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed. Cowie started to campaign {{for the establishment of a}} national park system in Kenya. The government formed a committee to examine the matter.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a dynamic common agency model of natural resource harvest quota regulation {{in which both}} <b>conservationists</b> and harvesters vie to influence the regulator's quota allocations {{as well as the}} choice of regulator. <b>Conservationists</b> tend to benefit from the adoption of regulation since the regulator will reduce the aggregate harvest quota relative to the unregulated equilibrium. Harvesters, however, only support the adoption of regulation if the regulator places sufficient weight on their welfare. Because harvester's support of regulation is conditional while <b>conservationist's</b> support of regulation is unconditional, harvester's interests tend to be over-represented in the truthful Markov Perfect equilibrium. ...|$|R
