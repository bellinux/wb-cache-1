40|$|International audience—The {{increase}} in integration density and {{the requirement of}} low power supplies to reduce energy consumption can make circuits more and more sensitive to upsets errors. The loss of robustness increases with process/voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. This paper 1 shows {{that the impact of}} errors that appear when computing the estimation of the Doppler offsets in a GPS application can be greatly reduced by tuning appropriately the <b>carrier</b> <b>filter</b> bandwidth. The effectiveness of the proposed was proven by comparing the performance a faulty GPS receiver to a non-faulty (noisy-free) GPS receiver at two levels: the standard deviation of the tracking error variance (by theory and by simulation) as well as the standard deviation between positions given by the faulty (noisy) and non-faulty (the noiseless) GPS receivers. Modifying properly the optimal filter bandwidth values gives astonishing results in terms of robustness against errors. The modification of the bandwidth filter values introduces almost no position degradation in a noise-free GPS receiver (only 11 cm in average). With 40 % of error, the standard deviation of the error in the position does not exceed 2 m by increasing the PLL bandwidth while the tracking loop does not support more than 6 % of errors...|$|E
40|$|The latest-generation {{cochlear}} implant devices provide many deaf patients with good speech recognition in quiet listening conditions. However, speech recognition deteriorates rapidly as {{the level of}} background noise increases. Previous studies have shown that, for {{cochlear implant}} users, the absence of fine spectro-temporal cues may contribute to poorer performance in noise, especially when the noise is dynamic (e. g., competing speaker or modulated noise). Here we report on sentence recognition by cochlear implant users and by normal-hearing subjects listening to an acoustic simulation of a cochlear implant, in the presence of steady or square-wave modulated speech-shaped noise. Implant users were tested using their everyday, clinically assigned speech processors. In the acoustic simulation, normal-hearing listeners were tested for different degrees of spectral resolution (16, eight, or four channels) and spectral smearing (<b>carrier</b> <b>filter</b> slopes of − 24 or − 6 dB/octave). For modulated noise, normal-hearing listeners experienced significant release from masking when the original, unprocessed speech was presented (which preserved the spectro-temporal fine structure), while cochlear implant users experienced no release from masking. As the spectral resolution was reduced, normal-hearing listeners’ release from masking gradually diminished. Release from masking was further reduced as the degree of spectral smearing increased. Interestingly, the mean speech recognition thresholds of implant users were very close to those of normal-hearing subjects listening to four-channel spectrally smeared noise-band speech. Also, the best cochlear implant listeners performed like normal-hearing subjects listening to eight- to 16 -channel spectrally smeared noise-band speech. These findings suggest that implant users’ susceptibility to noise may be caused by the reduced spectral resolution and the high degree of spectral smearing associated with channel interaction. Efforts to improve the effective number of spectral channels as well as reduce channel interactions may improve implant performance in noise, especially for temporally modulated noise...|$|E

40|$|Heavily boron-doped {{polycrystalline}} silicon {{has been reported}} to be characterized by somewhat unexpectedly high power factor. High Seebeck coefficients are however unexpected in materials with high carrier densities. A semi-quantitative model was proposed, showing that the potential barrier structure at grain boundaries, along with the nanometric grain size, leads to an unusual mechanism of <b>carrier</b> <b>filtering,</b> named adiabatic energy filtering. Actually, the presence of potential barriers associated with segregated boron disables charge transport by holes in the band deep tail. This leads to a decrease of the actual carrier density, {{as in the case of}} standard energy filtering. However, the nanometric grain size along with the inefficiency of the hole-hole relaxation mechanism in degenerate semiconductors actually prevents carriers from relaxing, causing an increase of the average (macroscopic) drift mobility. Thus, in spite of the decrease of drifting hole density the electrical conductivity is found to increase. In this communication a refinement of the model is presented, that will be discussed and corroborated with an extended body of experimental data gathered by several authors on degenerate {{polycrystalline silicon}} films...|$|R

40|$|A {{cochlear}} implant (CI) presents band-pass-filtered acoustic envelope information by modulating current pulse train levels. Similarly, a vocoder presents envelope information by modulating an acoustic carrier. By studying how normal hearing (NH) listeners {{are able to}} understand degraded speech signals with a vocoder, the parameters that best simulate electric hearing and factors that might contribute to the NH-CI performance difference may be better understood. A vocoder with harmonic complex carriers (fundamental frequency, f 0 = 100 Hz) was used to study the effect of carrier phase dispersion on speech envelopes and intelligibility. The starting phases of the harmonic components were randomly dispersed to varying degrees prior to <b>carrier</b> <b>filtering</b> and modulation. NH listeners were tested on recognition of a closed set of vocoded words in background noise. Two sets of synthesis filters simulated different amounts of current spread in CIs. Results showed that the speech vocoded with carriers whose starting phases were maximally dispersed was the most intelligible. Superior speech understanding {{may have been a}} result of the flattening of the dispersed-phase carrier’s intrinsic temporal envelopes produced by the large number of interacting components in the high-frequency channels. Cross-correlogram analyses of au-ditory nerve model simulations confirmed that random-ly dispersing the carrier’s component starting phases resulted in better neural envelope representation. However, neural metrics extracted from these analyses were not found to accurately predict speech recognition scores for all vocoded speech conditions.

40|$|In this work, we {{describe}} a novel idea {{that allows for}} high thermoelectric power factors in two-phase materials that are heavily doped with an inhomogeneous distribution of dopants. We show that a concurrent increase of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient and a consequent increase of the power factor can be achieved in such systems. To explain the concept, we employ a semiclassical one-dimensional model that considers both electron and phonon transport through a series connection of two-phases of the material. We discuss microscopic characteristics of the material {{and the formation of}} the two phases (grains and grain boundaries in our case) by the inhomogeneous distribution of dopants in the polycrystalline material. Our theoretical investigation reveals that: (1) the improvement in the Seebeck coefficient can be attributed to <b>carrier</b> <b>filtering</b> due to the energy barriers at the grain boundaries, and to the difference in the lattice thermal conductivity of the grains and grain boundaries, and (2) the improvement in the electrical conductivity is a result of a high Fermi level in the grains. This allows high energy carriers to contribute to transport, which increases the impurity scattering limited mean-free-path, and increases the conductivity in the grains and thus in the whole material. Such an unexpected concurrent increase of the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient was recently observed in heavily boron-doped polycrystalline silicon of grain sizes < 100 nm in which a silicon-boride phase is formed around the grain boundaries.
