5|$|Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, {{continued}} {{researching the}} effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified galvanic cell, made of plates of <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> zinc separated by an electrolyte and {{connected by a}} conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> allowing the zinc to corrode.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{copper alloys}} have been formulated, many with {{important}} uses. Brass is an alloy of <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but {{can refer to}} any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze. Copper {{is one of the}} most important constituents of silver and carat gold and carat solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> other metals.|$|E
5|$|The alloy of <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> nickel, called cupronickel, {{is used in}} low-denomination coins, {{often for}} the outer cladding. The US 5-cent coin (currently called a nickel) {{consists}} of 75% <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. The alloy of 90% <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> 10% nickel, remarkable for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various objects exposed to seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries. Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and are used in decorations. Shakudō is a Japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold, typically 4–10%, that can be patinated to a dark blue or black color.|$|E

40|$|Changes in serum zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> {{levels were}} studied in 19 tumor bearing {{patients}} undergoing parenteral nutrition (TPN) {{for five to}} 42 days. Before initiation of intravenous feeding mean serum zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> concentrations were within normal limits but during TPN levels decreased significantly below those measured prior to parenteral nutrition. During TPN nitrogen, zinc, <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> intake, urinary output and serum levels were studied prospectively in nine of these patients. These nine patients exhibited positive nitrogen retention based upon urinary nitrogen excretion, but elevated urinary zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> excretion <b>and</b> lowered serum zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> concentrations. Neither blood administration nor limited oral intake was consistently able to maintain normal serum levels of zinc or <b>copper.</b> Zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> supplementation of hyperalimentation fluids in four patients studied for five to 16 days was successful in increasing serum zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> levels in only two.

40|$|Abstract: Serum zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> were {{determined}} in thirty (30) malnourished pre-school-age children (age, 0 - 60 months) and thirty (30) age-and sex-matched apparently healthy well nourished controls {{to evaluate the}} effect of protein-energy malnutrition on serum zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper.</b> Mean serum zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> were significantly reduced (p 0. 05) among kwashiorkor and marasmus, serum albumin was significantly lower (p 0. 05). This study shows that malnourished children have deficient serum zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> with anaemia <b>and</b> leucopenia. For effective management of protein-energy malnutrition, zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> supplementation {{should be part of}} treatment regimen, however, in order to prevent zinc <b>and</b> <b>copper</b> deficiency <b>and</b> its health implications in pre-school age children, food fortification should be promoted...|$|R

5|$|A {{widely used}} zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with {{anywhere}} from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass.

5|$|Current {{limitations}} to p-doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of n-type and p-type material. Known p-type dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; {{as well as}} <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p-type conduction at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{separation}} of cobalt from <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> nickel. They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. One separation step involves froth flotation, in which surfactants bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent roasting converts the ores to the cobalt sulfate, whereas the <b>copper</b> <b>and</b> the iron are oxidized to the oxide. Leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric acid, yielding a solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known metals—common metals such as iron, <b>copper,</b> <b>and</b> tin, {{and precious}} metals such as silver, gold, and platinum—are heavy metals.

5|$|The {{heaviness}} of {{naturally occurring}} metals such as gold, <b>copper,</b> <b>and</b> iron {{may have been}} noticed in prehistory and, {{in light of their}} malleability, led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments, tools, and weapons.
