We generated mice engineered {{to contain a}} <b>Crim</b> 1 conditional null allele by flanking exons three and four of <b>Crim</b> 1 with unidirectional LoxP sites. After crossing <b>Crim</b> 1 +/FLOX mice with a CMV-Cre line, a <b>Crim</b> 1 +/?flox colony was established after germline transmission of the deleted allele. We then analyzed genomic DNA, mRNA transcripts, and protein expression from <b>Crim</b> 1 ?flox/?flox null mice to confirm {{the nature of the}} genomic lesion. <b>Crim</b> 1 ?flox/?flox mice displayed phenotypes similar to those previously described for a <b>Crim</b> 1 gene-trap mutant, <b>Crim</b> 1 KST 264 /KST 264, including perinatal lethality, digit syndactyly, eye, and kidney abnormalities, with varying penetrance and severity.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of <b>Crim</b> 1, a transmembrane protein that is {{expressed}} {{in a number of}} areas in the vertebrate embryo including the developing kidney, eye, testis and spinal cord, which we believe may be a regulator of vertebrate tissue development. To dissect the function of <b>Crim</b> 1 in normal mammalian development, two vertebrate models were used, zebrafish and mice. The results show that in zebrafish, <b>crim</b> 1 is expressed early in development from the 16 -cell stage through to 30 hours post fertilisation (Chapter 3). At 24 hours post fertilisation <b>crim</b> 1 is expressed in the intermediate cell mass (icm), the site of haemangioblast development. Haemangioblasts are precursor cells that contribute to the formation of the blood and endothelial cell lineages. Injection of <b>crim</b> 1 antisense oligonucleotides into zebrafish embryos (<b>crim</b> 1 morphants) lead to an expansion of the icm and defects in the trunk, tail, somites and vasculature. The injection of <b>crim</b> 1 antisense oligonucleotides into transgenic fli:GFP zebrafish revealed defects in the intersegmental, dorsal longitudinal anastomotic and parachordal vessels. Although <b>crim</b> 1 is expressed during haemagiogensis the primary defect in the <b>crim</b> 1 morphant zebrafish appears to be vascular. Further experiments used a ‘knock-in’ mouse, <b>Crim</b> 1 KST 264, in which a loss of functional <b>Crim</b> 1 leads to defects in limb (syndactyly), skeleton, eye, vascular, kidney and placental development. Analysis of the kidney phenotype in the embryonic <b>Crim</b> 1 KST 264 homozygotes showed that a loss of <b>Crim</b> 1 affects ERK 1 / 2 and phosphorylated-Smad 1 / 5 / 8 protein expression, although has no direct effect on BMP or TGFβ protein expression (Chapter 4). Analysis of the adult <b>Crim</b> 1 outbred kidneys revealed they have albuminuria and leaky vasculature. The complex phenotype presented by the <b>Crim</b> 1 KST 264 homozygote kidneys suggests <b>Crim</b> 1 may be regulating multiple growth factor pathways. As <b>Crim</b> 1 was shown to be expressed in the placenta, we characterised {{the role of}} <b>Crim</b> 1 in placental development using the <b>Crim</b> 1 KST 264 mouse (Chapter 5). <b>Crim</b> 1 KST 264 homozygote placentas and embryos are smaller than their wild-type littermates. Our investigations revealed that <b>Crim</b> 1 is expressed in trophoblast giant cells and in spongiotrophoblasts. A loss of <b>Crim</b> 1 causes a developmental defect in that the junctional zone (region of the placenta containing spongiotrophoblasts and glycogen cells) is expanded, although this phenotype does not appear to be due to a defect in proliferation or apoptosis. Further analysis of E 15. 5 <b>Crim</b> 1 KST 264 homozygote placentas revealed there was a reduction in the number of labyrinth trophoblast gaint cells. Thus, by using zebrafish and mouse as two model organisms of vertebrate development, this thesis has showed that <b>Crim</b> 1 is clearly important for normal embryonic development. To dissect the complex phenotype presented by the <b>Crim</b> 1 KST 264 mouse, further studies of <b>Crim</b> 1 and its interaction with other growth factor pathways is needed to elucidate how and to what extent they interact with <b>Crim</b> 1 to determine its biological effect on vertebrate tissue...|$|R
