40|$|Aim: Inferior dental {{anaesthesia}} via {{the direct}} intraoral approach, mandibular <b>conduction</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> via extraoral landmarks (Gow-Gates) and mandibular <b>conduction</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> via the tuberosity approach (Akinosi) were evaluated using pain during injection, aspiration test, pinprick, depth {{and frequency of}} anaesthesia, onset and duration of anaesthesia. Materials and Methods: 120 patients of both sexes, aged from 16 years to 50 years undergoing mandibular molar tooth extraction were included. They were randomly designated into 3 groups {{with regards to the}} applied technique of mandibular anaesthesia. Each patient was given injection of 2 ml of 2 % lignocaine with adrenaline (1 : 80, 000) using 2 ml disposable syringes and a 25 gauge, 1. 5 inch needle. Results: Classical inferior nerve block showed greater incidence of pain among the applied techniques. Positive aspiration was most frequently observed with classical inferior nerve block. The onset of anaesthesia was found to be slower with Gow-Gates technique while duration of anaesthesia was longer. Mandibular <b>conduction</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> via the tuberosity approach did not show any particular advantage over the other two techniques in this study. Conclusions: After using Gow-Gates method, {{it was found that the}} Gow-Gates technique is a highly successfu...|$|E
40|$|Patients who undergo surgery receive general {{anaesthesia}} or {{any form of}} <b>conduction</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> during the operation. For most people it is strange, unexpected and for many something completely new to be a patient and undergo surgery. Awake conduction anaesthetic patients’ experiences from the intraoperative period were little studied. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine awake <b>conduction</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> patients’ experiences. An empirical study with nine patients that had surgery was carried out in southern Sweden. The interviews were analysed with content analysis. The results are presented in the tree categories that emerged from the analysis of these interviews and they were: sense of security is influenced by nursing staff, experiences of self during surgery and experiences of time and waiting. The overall theme that emerged in the analysis was a desire for closeness in the relationship and understanding of the unknown. The conclusion is that awake conduction anaesthetic patients wants: To fell safe and that they would be well cared for by the nursing staff, prefer to listen to music intraoperative, would like to be offered the possibility to see their operations, to get information about what happens during the operation, would like more information on how local anaesthetics acts and feels, experience that things take time intraoperative and wants to have influence on their situation intraoperative...|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor Thesis {{with the}} topic "Algesthesia of {{patients}} after surgery {{deals with the}} patient pain and differences in its perception in the postoperative period. To achieve the set out goals, a research in form of questionnaire was carried out. The research set was formed from the patients hospitalized at Surgical Departments of the Hospitals in České Budějovice and Strakonice. The gals of the thesis were fulfilled, because we found out the real situation of the pertinent matter thanks to the research. The Hypothesis 1 was not confirmed, {{because the majority of}} the medical personnel checks-up the effects after analgesia. The Hypotheses 2 has been confirmed; the women percept the pain after a surgery stronger than men. The Hypothesis 3 has been confirmed, because the patients after the <b>conduction</b> <b>anaesthesias</b> percept pain less than those after a total anaesthesia. This Bachelor Thesis should make the nurses think about whether they offer enough to calm down the pain, check the effect after serving the analgesia, treat the patient with respect to the type of surgery and individual perception of pain...|$|R
40|$|Anaphylaxis is {{generally}} an unanticipated severe allergic reaction, often explosive in onset that cans occurperioperatively, especially during a surgical procedure when multiple drugs are administered during the <b>conduction</b> of <b>anaesthesia</b> 1. The survey for possible etiological causes, its differentiation from {{adverse drug reaction}} and management must be immediate, because anaphylaxis is life threatening and may produce cardiovascular collapse. The term “anaphylaxis ” was coined by Nobel prize recipients Portier and Richet in 19021. The incidence of anaphylactic reaction during anaesthesia has been reported as 1 : 6000 to 1 : 20000 anaesthetics. The variou...|$|R
40|$|Taking {{in charge}} {{severely}} ill {{patients in the}} intensive care environment to manage complex procedures is a performance requiring highly specific knowledge. Close collaboration between anaesthetists and intensive care specialists is likely to improve the safety and quality of medical care. Three forms of anaesthetic care should be considered in clinical practice: sedation and analgesia; monitored anaesthetic care; and general <b>anaesthesia</b> or <b>conduction</b> block <b>anaesthesia.</b> Even in the field of sedation and analgesia, the anaesthesiologist can offer expertise on new anaesthetic techniques like: the most recent concepts of balanced anaesthesia in terms of pharmacokinetics and dynamics, favouring the use of short-acting agents and of sedative-opioid combinations. New modes of administration and monitoring intravenous anaesthesia have been developed, with potential application {{in the intensive care}} unit. These include the use of target-controlled administration of intravenous drugs, and of electroencephalographic signals to monitor the level of sedation...|$|R
40|$|Two male {{patients}} {{had a history}} of right-sided headache attacks occurring daily and spreading from the occipital to the frontal region. The attacks were accompanied by ciliary injections on the symptomatic side, increased lacrimation and, in one case, by rhinorrhea. The pain was relieved with vasoconstricting preparations (ergotamine) and provoked with vasodilating medications (nitroglycerine). A selective <b>conduction</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> of the C 2 nerve root in one case and of the C 2 and C 3 roots in the other, temporarily relieved the pain. At operation, vessels were found which compressed these roots. Since decompression of the nerve roots, 3 years and 1 year ago respectively, the patients have remained free of pain. 0 Cervicogenic headache, occipital neuralgia, operative nerve root decompression, vascular nerve root compression...|$|E
40|$|Background. Endarterectomy of the {{internal}} carotid artery, supported by medicamental treatment, is the best method used to prevent stroke with symptomatic patients with an over 70 -percent narrowing of the ipsilateral carotid artery. With patients who have successfully passed the operation the occurrence of the stroke is less often than with non-operated patients (1 % vs. 6 – 10 % per year). Therefore, {{it is important that}} the operation is carried out as safely as possible. Currently, the average acceptable rate of death and/ or severe stroke risk stands at between 2 – 4 %. Greatest problems faced during carotid artery surgery are embolism of the affected artery during preparation, brain ischaemia during the blockade of the carotid artery, and embolism and intimal tearing due to injury of {{the internal}} carotid artery by the temporary internal shunt. Due to the risk of causing an embolism and intimal tearing, the use {{of the internal}} shunt can be dangerous. Therefore, selective usage of the shunt is recommended when necessary due to brain ischaemia. Methods. Under block/conduction anaesthesia (deep and superficial cervical block) we have performed surgery on 23 patients (16 males, 7 females) because of severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery (over 70 %). A mixture of Xylocain 1 % and Marcain 1. 5 % was used for the cervical block. Cerebral blood circulation was monitored by neurological testing of the patient awake during the procedure. During the procedure, we performed standard monitoring of the vital functions including the blood pressure. Additionally, the transcranial Doppler monitoring of the blood flow through the middle cerebral artery was used with 20 of the patients. Results. Even after placing the artery clamp and cutting off the blood flow through the internal carotid artery no neurological deficits were observed with 18 patients, neither did we use temporary internal shunt with them. Five patients suffered problems with loss of consciousness, therefore we used the internal shunt. With all but one patient we performed a typical longitudinal endarterectomy and used the Dacron patch to close the carotid artery. Those patients underwent operation and post-operation treatment without complications and were dismissed from hospital five to seven days after the operation. Meanwhile, one patient’s condition worsened severely during preparation of the carotid artery even before the placement of the artery clamp, which resulted in paralysis on the contralateral side and loss of consciousness. The operation was suspended, the patient was treated conservatively. Conclusions. The patients handled the procedure under block/ <b>conduction</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> well. Neurological testing of the patient awake during the procedure was a reliable method to ascertain cerebral blood circulation. Temporary internal shunt was used with patients who suffered a neurological deficit during the blockade of the carotid artery. As a result, the neurological deficit improved. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hypotension and {{bradycardia}} after <b>conduction</b> of spinal <b>anaesthesia</b> {{are common}} side effects because of sympathetic blockade. Efforts {{to prevent these}} complications have been attempted like preloading with crystalloids, colloids or use of vasopressors. The role of volume preloading to prevent haemodynamic changes associated with spinal anaesthesia has been recently questioned. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate the effects of volume preload on changes of patient’s hemodynamic. Materials and methods: A Quasi- experimental design was used to conduct the study. Taking written informed consent, 40 patients of age group 18 - 45 years and ASA grade I and II undergoing surgery under spinal anaesthesia in operation theatre of Dhulikhel Hospital were selected as the sample of the study and allocated randomly to 2 groups. Group I did not receive volume preload and Group II received preload of 1000 ml of Ringer’s lactate solution within 30 minutes immediately before giving the spinal anaesthesia. An observational checklist was used to collect demographic, intraoperative and post-operative records of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Results: The findings revealed that the haemodynamic changes occurred in all patients. The decrease in SBP, MBP an...|$|R
