5|$|A new {{publication}} called Classic Rock, featuring Barton {{and many}} of the writers from Kerrang!s first run, <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> NWOBHM revival and continues to focus much of its attention on rock acts from the 1980s. Starting in the 2000s, many reunited bands recorded new albums and revisited their original styles, abandoned {{in the second half of}} the 1980s. Their presence, at metal festivals and on the international rock club circuit, has been constant ever since.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Seizing upon a new {{development}} to visualize particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and known as a bubble chamber, Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it {{could be made to}} function with liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E

5|$|The Prince of Wales Trophy, {{also known}} as the Wales Trophy, is an award {{presented}} by the National Hockey League (NHL) to the Eastern Conference (formerly the Wales Conference) playoff <b>champions,</b> prior to <b>the</b> final series of games for the Stanley Cup. Named for Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII and then Duke of Windsor), the trophy was first presented in the 1925–26 NHL season to <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> first game in Madison Square Garden and then subsequently presented to <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> NHL playoffs (including the previous two seasons). However, the trophy has been awarded for eight different accomplishments throughout its history, including for the American Division regular season <b>champions,</b> <b>the</b> NHL regular season <b>champions,</b> <b>the</b> East Division season <b>champions,</b> <b>the</b> Wales Conference regular season <b>champions,</b> <b>the</b> Wales Conference playoff <b>champions,</b> and <b>the</b> Eastern Conference playoff <b>champions.</b> <b>The</b> current holder of the Prince of Wales Trophy are the Pittsburgh Penguins, after winning the 2017 Eastern Conference Final.|$|R
50|$|During the Final Four round, {{regardless}} of {{the seeds of the}} participating teams, <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> top overall top seed's region plays <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> fourth-ranked top seed's region, and <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> second overall top seed's region plays <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> third-ranked top seed's region.|$|R
5|$|Some {{scholars}} state Gandhi {{supported a}} religiously diverse India, while others {{state that the}} Muslim leaders who <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> partition and creation of a separate Muslim Pakistan considered Gandhi to be Hindu nationalist or revivalist. For example, in his letters to Mohammad Iqbal, Jinnah accused Gandhi to be favouring a Hindu rule and revivalism, that Gandhi led Indian National Congress was a fascist party.|$|E
5|$|The arts also flourished while Maidique {{was at the}} helm, {{with the}} {{university}} acquiring The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum on Miami Beach and building the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum on its main campus. In athletics, FIU made inroads in becoming a powerhouse athletic university during Maidique's time as president and he <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> eventual establishment of a NCAA football program. Finally, the school earned membership into Phi Beta Kappa, the nation's oldest honor society.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} Muslim {{support for}} Gandhi, after he <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature {{as the political}} leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced {{his opposition to the}} satyagraha non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|The bracket is thus established, {{and during}} <b>the</b> semifinals, <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> top-ranked number 1 seed's region will play against <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> fourth-ranked number 1 seed's region, and <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> second-ranked number 1 seed's region will play against <b>the</b> <b>champion</b> of <b>the</b> third-ranked number 1 seed's region.|$|R

5|$|Witchfinder General {{eventually}} {{developed into}} a cult film, partially attributable to Reeves's 1969 death from a drug overdose {{at the age of}} 25, only nine months after Witchfinders release. Over the years, several prominent critics have <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> film, including J. Hoberman, Danny Peary, Robin Wood, and Derek Malcolm. In 2005, the magazine Total Film named Witchfinder General the 15th-greatest horror film of all time.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|After {{the war he}} {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships, where he was involved with the development of nuclear propulsion. Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, his most important task was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{performing}} {{new works}} dedicated to him, Szigeti also <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> music of other contemporary composers, notably Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky. He {{was among the}} first violinists to make Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto a standard part of his repertoire, and frequently performed and recorded works of Stravinsky (including the Duo Concertante, recorded with the composer at the piano in 1945.) The Berg Violin Concerto he even recorded twice, under the baton of Dimitri Mitropoulos. Most famously, Szigeti recorded the Bloch concerto, a premier recording made in 1939 with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire conducted by Charles Munch (originally released on Columbia LP and reissued on Membran CD).|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Porch Morrow (November 28, 1877June 15, 1935) was an American politician, {{who served}} as the 40th Governor of Kentucky from 1919 to 1923. He was the only Republican elected to this office between 1907 and 1927. He <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> typical Republican causes of his day, namely equal rights for African-Americans and the use of force to quell violence.

5|$|Gandhi {{felt that}} Hindu-Muslim {{co-operation}} {{was necessary for}} political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Henry rode to Winchester, {{where an}} {{argument}} ensued {{as to who}} now had the best claim to the throne. William of Breteuil <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> rights of Robert, who was still abroad, returning from the Crusade, and to whom Henry and the barons had given homage in previous years. Henry argued that, unlike Robert, {{he had been born}} to a reigning king and queen, thereby giving him a claim under the right of porphyrogeniture. Tempers flared, but Henry, supported by Henry de Beaumont and Robert of Meulan, held sway and persuaded the barons to follow him. He occupied Winchester Castle and seized the royal treasury.|$|E
5|$|In 1817 an English doctor, James Parkinson, {{published}} his essay reporting six cases of paralysis agitans. An Essay on the Shaking Palsy described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, {{and the way}} that the disease progresses over time. Early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge of the disease include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and most notably Jean-Martin Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease. Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also <b>championed</b> <b>the</b> renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.|$|E
