5|$|By 1182 Young Henry reiterated his {{previous}} demands: {{he wanted to}} be granted lands, for example the Duchy of Normandy, which would allow him to support himself and his household with dignity. Henry refused, but agreed to increase his son's allowance, but this was not enough to placate Young Henry. With trouble clearly brewing, Henry attempted to defuse the situation by insisting that Richard and Geoffrey give homage to Young Henry for their lands. Richard did not believe that Young Henry had any claim over Aquitaine and refused to give homage; when Henry forced Richard to give homage, Young Henry angrily refused to accept it. Young Henry formed an alliance with some of the disgruntled barons of the Aquitaine who were unhappy with Richard's rule, and Geoffrey sided with him, raising a mercenary army in Brittany to threaten Poitou. Open war broke out in 1183 and Henry and Richard led a joint campaign into Aquitaine: before they <b>could</b> <b>conclude</b> it, however, Young Henry caught a fever and died, bringing a sudden end to the rebellion.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the triumphal arch {{is often associated with}} ancient Roman architecture. To fully understand this development however {{it is important to understand}} the importance of basic arches in Roman civilization. The Romans had learned how to construct effective arches from the Etruscans, who lived in central Italy. This knowledge had a major impact on the architecture of Roman civilization. As a result, the Romans used arches for things such as aqueducts, amphitheaters, bridges, and domed temples. They had effectively used the arch in various aspects of their civilization and city structure. Since the Romans had effectively perfected this architectural structure, one <b>could</b> <b>conclude</b> that the arch symbolized perfection and triumph in Roman society. Monumental gateways had already been in use for hundreds of years by civilizations such as the Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians and Myceneans.|$|E

2500|$|The First Bulgarian Empire was a {{hereditary}} monarchy. The monarch {{was responsible}} for the issues of peace and war. He was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, a judge and a high priest in the pagan period. He guided the external policy of the country and <b>could</b> <b>conclude</b> treaties personally or through authorised emissaries. In the pagan period the title of the ruler was Khan. After 864 Boris I adopted the Slavic Knyaz (Prince), and since 913 the Bulgarian monarchs were recognised as Tsars (Emperors). The authority of the Khan was limited by the leading noble families and the People's Council. The People's Council included the nobility and the [...] "armed people" [...] was gathered to discuss issues of crucial importance for the state. A People's Council in 766 dethroned Khan Sabin because he was seeking peace with the Byzantines. According to the old Bulgarian tradition the Khan was first among equals and that was among the reasons for why Boris I decided to convert to Christianity, as the Christian monarch ruled by the grace of God. However, {{it should be noted that}} the divinity of the Bulgarian ruler, as well as his superiority over the Byzantine Emperor, were already asserted by Khan Omurtag (r.814–831), as stated in the Chatalar Inscription: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Hawala, {{an early}} {{informal}} value transfer system, has {{its origins in}} classical Islamic law, and is mentioned in texts of Islamic jurisprudence {{as early as the}} 8th century. Hawala itself later influenced the development of the agency in common law and in civil laws such as the aval in French law and the avallo in Italian law. The words aval and avallo were themselves derived from Hawala. The transfer of debt, which was [...] "not permissible under Roman law but became widely practiced in medieval Europe, especially in commercial transactions", was due to the large extent of the [...] "trade conducted by the Italian cities with the Muslim world in the Middle Ages." [...] The agency was also [...] "an institution unknown to Roman law" [...] as no [...] "individual <b>could</b> <b>conclude</b> a binding contract on behalf of another as his agent." [...] In Roman law, the [...] "contractor himself was considered the party to the contract and it took a second contract between the person who acted on behalf of a principal and the latter in order to transfer the rights and the obligations deriving from the contract to him." [...] On the other hand, Islamic law and the later common law [...] "had no difficulty in accepting agency as one of its institutions in the field of contracts and of obligations in general." ...|$|E
2500|$|UK and EU law divide {{discrimination}} into {{direct and}} indirect forms. Direct discrimination means treating a person, because of a [...] "protected characteristic", less favourably than a comparable person who has {{a different type of}} gender, race, sexual orientation, etc. This is an objective test, so the employer's motives are irrelevant. Even if employers have [...] "positive" [...] motives, for instance to help underprivileged groups, discrimination is still unlawful in principle. The claimant's trait merely has to be the reason for the unfavourable treatment. An appropriate comparator is one who is the same in all respects except for the relevant trait, which is claimed as the ground for discrimination. For instance in Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary a chief inspector claimed that she was dismissed because the police force was sexist, and pointed to male chief inspectors who had not been treated unfavourably. The House of Lords overturned a Tribunal finding of sex discrimination because colleagues had complained about how Ms Shamoon had performed appraisals, and her chosen comparators had not received complaints. Generally there is, however, no need to point to an actual comparator, so a claimant can allege they were treated less favourably than a hypothetical person would have been, who is the same except for the protected characteristic. The burden of proof is explicitly regulated so that claimants merely need to show a set of facts from which a reasonable tribunal <b>could</b> <b>conclude</b> there was discrimination, and need not show an intention to discriminate. Because the law aims to eliminate the mindset and culture of discrimination, it is irrelevant whether the person who was targeted was themselves a person with a protected characteristic, so that people who associate with or are perceived to possess a protected characteristic are protected too. In Coleman v Attridge Law a lady with a disabled child was abused by her employer for taking time off to care for the child. Even though Ms Coleman was not disabled, she could claim disability discrimination. And in English v Sanderson Blinds Ltd, a man who was from Brighton and went to boarding school was teased for being gay. Even though he was married with children, he successfully claimed discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. An instruction by an employer to discriminate against customers or anyone else also violates the law.|$|E
