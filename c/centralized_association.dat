40|$|Abstract — Association rule mining is a one of {{the most}} {{important}} technique in data mining. It extracts significant patterns from transaction databases and generates rules used in many decision support application. Modern organizations are geographically distributed. Using the traditional <b>centralized</b> <b>association</b> rule mining to discover useful patterns in such distributed system is not always feasible because merging data sets from different sites into a centralized site incurs huge network communication and time costs. This paper present an optimized Distributed Association Rule Mining (D-ARM) based on vertical partitioning. The existing D-ARM algorithms have lots of communication overhead, which is a major issue for concerning. The proposed approach minimizes this communication overhead and it is based on total count. The papers then discuss the Total Count on Vertical Dataset (TCDV) use of this structure which offers significant advantages with respect to existing D-ARM techniques...|$|E
40|$|Data mining means extracting hidden, {{previous}} unknown {{knowledge and}} rules with potential value to decision from mass data in database. Association rule mining is a main researching area of data mining area, which {{is widely used}} in practice. With the development of network technology and the improvement of level of IT application, distributed database is commonly used. Distributed data mining is mining overall knowledge which is useful for management and decision from database distributed in geography. It has become an important issue in data mining analysis. Distributed data mining can achieve a mining task with computers in different site on the internet. It can not only improve the mining efficiency, reduce the transmitting amount of network data, but is also good for security and privacy of data. Based on related theories and current research situation of data mining and distributed data mining, this thesis will focus on analysis {{on the structure of}} distributed mining system and distributed association rule mining algorithm. This thesis first raises a structure of distributed data mining system which is base on multi-agent. It adopts star network topology, and realize distributed saving mass data mining with multi-agent. Based on raised distributed data mining system, this these brings about a new distributed association rule mining algorithm?RK-tree algorithm. RK-tree algorithm is based on the basic theory of twice knowledge combination. Each sub-site point first mines local frequency itemset from local database, then send the mined local frequency itemset to the main site point. The main site point combines those local frequency itemset and get overall candidate frequency itemset, and send the obtained overall candidate frequency itemset to each sub-site point. Each sub-site point count the supporting rate of those overall candidate frequency itemset and sent it back to the main site point. At last, the main site point combines the results sent by sub-site point and gets the overall frequency itemset and overall association rule. This algorithm just needs three times communication between the main and sub-site points, which greatly reduces the amount and times of communication, and improves the efficiency of selection. What's more, each sub-site point can fully use existing good <b>centralized</b> <b>association</b> rule mining algorithm to realize local association rule mining, which can enable them to obtain better local data mining efficiency, as well as reduce the workload. This algorithm is simple and easy to realize. The last part of this thesis is the conclusion of the analysis, as well as the direction of further research...|$|E

In this paper, we investigate the problem of user association in a heterogeneous network (HetNet) with massive MIMO and small cells, where the macro base station (BS) {{is equipped with a}} massive MIMO and the picocell BS's are equipped with regular MIMOs. We first develop <b>centralized</b> user <b>association</b> algorithms with proven optimality, considering various objectives such as rate maximization, proportional fairness, and joint user association and resource allocation.

40|$|In future networks, an {{operator}} may employ {{a wide range}} of access points using diverse radio access technologies (RATs) over multiple licensed and unlicensed frequency bands. This paper studies <b>centralized</b> user <b>association</b> and spectrum allocation across many access points in such a heterogeneous network (HetNet). Such centralized control is on a relatively slow timescale to allow information exchange and joint optimization over multiple cells. This is in contrast and complementary to fast timescale distributed scheduling. A queueing model is introduced to capture the lower spectral efficiency, reliability, and additional delays of data transmission over the unlicensed bands due to contention and/or listen-before-talk requirements. Two optimization-based spectrum allocation schemes are proposed along with efficient algorithms for computing the allocations. The proposed solutions are fully aware of traffic loads, network topology, as well as external interference levels in the unlicensed bands. Packet-level simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform orthogonal and full-frequency-reuse allocations under all traffic conditions. Comment: Submitte...|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} {{local area}} networks (WLANs) often a station can potentially associate {{with more than}} one Access Point (AP). In IEEE 802. 11, the station simply associates to the AP from which it has received the strongest signal during the scanning process. However, this may result in a significant load imbalance between several APs since some of them might be highly loaded while others are lightly loaded or even idle. Moreover, the multi-rate flexibility provided by several IEEE 802. 11 variants can cause low bit rate stations to negatively affect high bit rate ones and consequently degrade the overall network throughput. Therefore, a relevant question is how to optimally distribute stations among APs so as to maximize the overall network performance. This paper presents a <b>centralized</b> optimal <b>association</b> policy for IEEE 802. 11 WLANs. We first derive the optimal solution for stations association. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of the solution through the results obtained from Lingo optimization and NCTUns simulation packages...|$|R

In comparing the two alternatives they note the following trade-off: “On the one hand, close proximity {{has the potential}} to improve the decision making process, as it provides politicians with good information about banks that get into distress. On the other hand, close proximity could imply that politicians’ personal considerations distort the decision making process, which is clearly undesirable.” Such trade-off is similar to the one considered in this paper.|$|R
40|$|We study {{network utility}} {{maximization}} (NUM) {{in the context}} of cellular single station association (SSA) policies, which assigns each mobile user (MU) to a single base station (BS). We measure an SSA policy in terms of the induced α-proportional fairness utility of each user's downlink rate, summed over all users. The general SSA NUM problem involves choosing an optimal association from MUs to BSs as well as an optimal allocation of BS resources to associated MUs. Finding an exact solution to such <b>centralized</b> user <b>association</b> problems is well-known to be NP-hard. Our contributions are as follows: i) we give an explicit solution for the optimal BS allocation for a given SSA, which establishes SSA NUM as a purely combinatiorial problem; ii) we establish the integrality gap for the association problem to be one, and prove the relaxation to be a non-convex optimization problem; iii) we provide both centralized and distributed greedy algorithms for SSA, both with and without the exchange of instantaneous rate information between users and stations. Our numerical results illustrate performance gains of three classes of solutions: i) SSA solutions obtained by greedy rounding of multi-station <b>associations</b> (a <b>centralized</b> convex program), ii) our centralized and distributed greedy algorithms with/without rate information exchanged, and iii) simple association heuristics.

40|$|Mining for {{association}} rules between {{items in}} large transactional databases {{is a central}} problem {{in the field of}} knowledge discovery. It has crucial applications in decision support and marketing strategy. <b>Centralized</b> and Distributed <b>Association</b> Rules Mining (DARM) include two phases of frequent itemset extraction and strong rule generation. The most important part of ARM is Frequent Itemsets Mining (FIM) and because of its importance in recent years, there have been many algorithms implemented for it. In this paper, we have focused on distributed Apriori-Like frequent itemsets mining and proposed a distributed algorithm, called New Dynamic Distributed Frequent Itemsets Mining (NDD-FIM), for geographically distributed data sets. NDD-FIM has a merger site to reduce communication overhead and eliminates size of dataset partitions dynamically. The experimental results show that our algorithm generates support counts of candidate itemsets quickerthan other DARM algorithms and reduces the size of average transactions, datasets, and messageexchanges...|$|R

This saves postage fees for the sender by sending several cards destined for a single country in one envelope, or large numbers of cards using parcel services. The price for lower postage, however, is a delay in reaching its destination because of the extra handling time involved. [...] In addition to such incoming bureaus, there are also outgoing bureaus in some countries. These bureaus offer a further postage savings by accepting cards destined for many different countries and repackaging them together into bundles that are sent to specific incoming bureaus in other countries. Most QSL bureaus operated by national amateur radio societies are both incoming and outgoing, with the notable exception of the United States of America, and are coordinated by the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU).|$|R
40|$|Triggered by the {{explosion}} of mobile traffic, 5 G (5 th Generation) cellular network requires evolution to increase the system rate 1000 {{times higher than the}} current systems in 10 years. Motivated by this common problem, there are several studies to integrate mm-wave access into current cellular networks as multi-band heterogeneous networks to exploit the ultra-wideband aspect of the mm-wave band. The authors of this paper have proposed comprehensive architecture of cellular networks with mm-wave access, where mm-wave small cell basestations and a conventional macro basestation are connected to Centralized-RAN (C-RAN) to effectively operate the system by enabling power efficient seamless handover as well as centralized resource control including dynamic cell structuring to match the limited coverage of mm-wave access with high traffic user locations via user-plane/control-plane splitting. In this paper, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed 5 G cellular networks with mm-wave access, system level simulation is conducted by introducing an expected future traffic model, a measurement based mm-wave propagation model, and a <b>centralized</b> cell <b>association</b> algorithm by exploiting the C-RAN architecture. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed network to realize 1000 times higher system rate than the current network in 10 years which is not achieved by the small cells using commonly considered 3. 5 GHz band. Furthermore, the paper also gives latest status of mm-wave devices and regulations to show the feasibility of using mm-wave in the 5 G systems.

40|$|Abstract—Many large {{organizations}} have multiple data sources, such as different branches of an interstate company. While putting all data together from different sources might amass a huge database for <b>centralized</b> processing, mining <b>association</b> rules at different data sources and forwarding the rules (rather {{than the original}} raw data) to the centralized company headquarter provides a feasible {{way to deal with}} multiple data source problems. In the meanwhile, the association rules at each data source may be required for that data source in the first instance, so association analysis at each data source is also important and useful. However, the forwarded rules from different data sources may be too many for the centralized company headquarter to use. This paper presents a weighting model for synthesizing high-frequency association rules from different data sources. There are two reasons to focus on high-frequency rules. First, a centralized company headquarter is interested in high-frequency rules because they are supported by most of its branches for corporate profitability. Second, high-frequency rules have larger chances to become valid rules in the union of all data sources. In order to extract high-frequency rules efficiently, a procedure of rule selection is also constructed to enhance the weighting model by coping with low-frequency rules. Experimental results show that our proposed weighting model is efficient and effective.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} cross-country variation in tax policy outcomes mainly depends on two factors: the agenda-setters’ fiscal policy preferences and {{the patterns of}} business organization. I develop a theory of tax policy change that builds on the existing literature on business interest groups, but incorporates the patterns of business organization as a crucial factor in explaining fiscal policy choice. This theory suggests {{that if there is}} no convergence between the policy preferences of agenda-setters and business interest groups, the latter will display their economic and political power in order to avoid increases in direct taxation and transfer any costs of fiscal consolidation to consumers or non-organized citizens by increasing value-added taxes or other indirect taxes. The rationale of this theory is straightforward. Both, agenda-setters and business interest groups, have distinctive preferences over types of taxation, tax rates, tax bases, and tax administration. Agenda-setters’ tax policy preferences are usually partisan-oriented and depend on the characteristics of the government coalition. Business interest groups usually prefer lower corporate tax rates, and their preferences about personal income and value-added taxes are ambiguous. If their preferences do not converge and both, agenda-setters and business interest groups, follow their most preferred policies, the feasibility of tax reforms will depend on business interest groups’ market leverage and their organizational capacity to coordinate firms, industry-level organizations, or economic conglomerates. Tax policy outcomes will vary as the patterns of business organization range from <b>centralized</b> national <b>associations</b> to intra-business competition. Overall, this dissertation finds support for strong and systematic links between patterns of business organization and tax politics. Additionally, I present empirical evidence that contradicts the widespread argument that agenda-setters are the predominant actors for economic policy-making in presidential regimes. These findings enrich theories of governance by modeling the role of business interest groups in policy-making and its implications for policy change. This dissertation not only offers a new theoretical approach but also new methodological tools to understand how business interest groups are actually influential for policy-making. Finally, this dissertation also makes an important empirical contribution for the study of business politics beyond the limited sample of developed countries...|$|R

[...] While reviewing Sidorov's article [...] "Psychic terrorism is nonlethal weapon of mass destruction" [...] published by the Rossiyskiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal in its issue 3 of 2005, Kanterov notes that, according to it, religious behavior is regarded as inherently deviant from the [...] "norm", that similar type of behavior is always dependent and imposed by recruiting and manipulative influence and that, thus, the possibility to be initiated into religious organizations due to free choice of religious belief guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation is outright rejected. In his 2010 article, Kanterov writes about the works by P.I. Sidorov and V.E. Pashkovskiy and points out that inspired by the desire to expose the malicious actions of [...] "totalitarian cults," [...] P.I. Sidorov and V.E. Pashkovskiy at the same time never resort to Russian laws regulating activity of religious associations, and it can hardly be considered accidental, since all the original sets of the authors are in flagrant contravention of current legislation.

30|$|Numerous recent {{societal}} examples {{illustrate that}} we are capable of creating such distributed organizational systems. Small bottom-up organizations {{around the world are}} rapidly becoming far more effective at promoting environment protection and social justice than the huge centralized and much better funded NGOs and governments. Businessman and social activist Paul Hawken likens this growing network of local organizations to an immune system, in that it is widely distributed yet connected, and grows larger not for its own sake, but through the process of local populations identifying additional needs and replicating their successful efforts [11]. Similarly, Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom have chronicled the struggles of traditional centralized business models in competing with new distributed networks of competitors. For example, highly decentralized music file sharing networks—typically run by college students on hundreds or thousands of independent machines that are constantly changing—have been successful at eluding the copyright protection efforts of the much better funded and highly <b>centralized</b> Recording Industry <b>Association</b> of America [12]. Most impressively, Google Flu Trends, an application that tracks users’ “Googling” words associated with the flu, such as “flu symptoms”, “flu remedies”, and “flu vaccines”, tightly matches the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) official flu tracking, which is based on Doctor and hospital survey data that have to be returned to and compiled by the CDC, with one major difference. The decentralized Google Flu provided data on outbreaks two weeks faster than the centralized CDC data [13]. When it comes to the rapidly mutating flu virus, two weeks advance notice could easily be the difference between a mild nuisance and a global pandemic.|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} and describe leadership duties and service responsibilities provided by Coordinating Secretaries in state, provincial and regional organizations affiliated with the Association of School Business Officials of the United States and Canada. A second {{purpose of the}} study was to identify and describe significant historical antecedents leading to the development of the position of Coordinating Secretary. The population of the study included sixteen individuals identified as Coordinating Secretaries of associations affiliated with ASBO and five association secretaries who, though elected annually, have, by agreement, continued to serve year after year. A data gathering. instrument was designed to secure responses from study participants relative to personal and employment information. Also, data was collected relative to the fiscal and personnel support provided by the state association to the Coordinating Secretary to conduct ASBO services and activities. The questionnaire was also designed to secure information relative to value judgment data from study participants regarding the degree of importance of various organizational activities associated with the office of Coordinating Secretary. In addition, information relative to historical antecedents leading to the development of the office of Coordinating Secretary and information relative to the formation of administrative "umbrella" associations was secured from study participants through the data gathering instrument. Findings derived from the study included:(1) Forty-seven percent of the respondents reported having had ten or more years of state ASBO service as a coordinating or elected secretary. (2) Fifty-seven percent of the Coordinating Secretaries reported that at least one-fifth of the total work week was devoted to state ASBO activities. (3) Coordinating Secretaries reported holding other employment positions as faculty members of state universities, professional staff members of state departments of public instruction and as Executive Directors of other professional associations. Four respondents reported being retired from full-time employment positions. (4) Additional compensation paid to Coordinating Secretaries for state association service varied from $ 0 to $ 10, 000. (5) The number off members in state organizations served by a Coordinating Secretary ranged from 160 persons to 850 persons. The average number of members was computed to be 502 persons. (6) The annual budgets for state associations served by a Coordinating Secretary varied from $ 2, 000 to $ 54, 000. The average annual state association budget was computed to be $ 25, 750. (7) Coordinating Secretaries reported the following association activities to be of major importance: publications-newsletters-mailings, correspondence, budget control and reporting, membership promotion, relations and communication with ASBO, fiscal record keeping and reporting, workshop planning and relations with the state department of public instruction. (8) The need for continuity, the need for coordination, the need for representation with other educational associations and the need for a <b>centralized</b> repository for <b>association</b> records were reported by study participants to be the four major forces causing state ASBO leadership to establish the office of Coordinating Secretary. Conclusions developed from the study included the following:(1) The establishment of the office of Coordinating Secretary can be very beneficial to a state ASBO organization, primarily because stability and continuity of leadership are strengthened. (2) Because state universities and state departments of public instruction have typically had a strong commitment, to service, have been willing to provide service assistance to professional education groups and have staff members with the needed background and interest, state ASBO officials contemplating the establishment of the position of Coordinating Secretary should explore both sources for assistance and support. (3) Because of the essential nature of the services provided by Coordinating Secretaries, more and more state associations will be considering the establishment of an office of Coordinating Secretary.
