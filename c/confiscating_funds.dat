50|$|Public sympathies for the {{movement}} had been waning due to their postwar attacks. The Huks carried out a campaign of raids, holdups, robbery, ambushes, murder, rape, massacre of small villages, kidnapping and intimidation. The Huks <b>confiscated</b> <b>funds</b> and property to sustain their movement and relied on small village organizers for political and material support. The Huk movement was mainly spread in the central provinces of Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Bulacan, and in Nueva Vizcaya, Pangasinan, Laguna, Bataan and Quezon.|$|R
50|$|The Mexican {{government}} had encouraged him by {{giving him a}} fixed salary and entrusted to him {{the management of the}} Pious Fund of the Californias. But, in February 1842, President Santa Anna <b>confiscated</b> the <b>Fund.</b> The bishop received no aid and he was obliged to depend upon the contributions from the few white settlers in the territory. Many of them refused to pay the tithes which he had found it necessary to impose.|$|R
50|$|The first {{instance}} of a violation to this law happened {{almost ten years}} later when employees of the American-owned María Isabel Sheraton Hotel of Mexico City expelled a group of Cuban officials upon pressure from the United States government and <b>confiscated</b> their <b>funds.</b> The Cuban officials were meeting U.S. energy executives from organizations that included Valero, the United States' biggest oil refiner, the Louisiana Department of Economic Development, and the Texas port of Corpus Christi.|$|R
50|$|This {{opportunity}} {{emerged in}} the 1970s, when the Somoza government <b>confiscated</b> relief <b>funds</b> for personal gain instead of giving aid to individuals and families after the 1972 Managua earthquake. Fonseca stated that the persistent problems that existed in Nicaragua could not be solved through legal activities and elections. Instead, Fonseca drew from {{the success of the}} Cuban Revolution and the life of Sandino to persuade students, workers, and peasants to gain power through the revolutionary force of the FSLN.|$|R

[...] One {{of them was the}} Maricopa County, Arizona law enforcement after failing to account for 20 of the 200 military weapons it had received.

5000|$|Simplicius was {{a disciple}} of Ammonius Hermiae, and Damascius, and was {{consequently}} {{one of the}} last members of the Neoplatonist school. The school had its headquarters in Athens. It became the centre of the last efforts to maintain Hellenistic religion against the encroachments of Christianity. Imperial edicts enacted in the 5th century against paganism gave legal protection to pagans against personal maltreatment. [...] In the year 528 the emperor Justinian ordered that pagans should be removed from government posts. Some were robbed of their property, some put to death. The order specified that if they did not within three months convert to Christianity, they were to be banished from the Empire. In addition, it was forbidden any longer to teach philosophy and jurisprudence in Athens. Probably also the property of the Platonist school, which in the time of Proclus was valued at more than 1000 gold pieces, was confiscated; at least, Justinian deprived the physicians and teachers of the liberal arts of the provision-money which had been assigned to them by previous emperors, and <b>confiscated</b> <b>funds</b> which the citizens had provided for spectacles and other civic purposes.|$|R
50|$|Mexico {{passed the}} Law of Protection of Commerce and Investments from Foreign Policies that Contravene International Law in October 1996, aimed at {{neutralizing}} the Helms-Burton Act. The law {{provides for a}} fine of 2.2 million pesos, or $280,254, against anyone who while in Mexican territory obeys another country's laws aimed at reducing Mexican trade or foreign investment in a third country. This law was used against the Sheraton Maria Isabel Hotel and Towers in Mexico City, which had expelled a group of Cuban officials upon pressure from the United States government and <b>confiscated</b> their <b>funds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Quranic Literacy Institute was {{allegedly}} {{part of a}} large web of organizations and individuals that were funding terrorist groups. In October 2001 in the wake of 9/11, the U.S. Department of Treasury froze the assets of 38 individuals believed to be involved in terrorist financing. One of the individuals, Yassin Kadi, was a prominent Saudi businessman who was linked to Osama bin Laden and was a terrorism financier through his business ventures and charitable projects. In 1991, Kadi loaned $820,000 to the Quranic Literacy Institute allegedly due to his friendship with the group’s president. While he said that the money was intended to allow them to make a land investment in order to yield profits and support their work, the income was actually given to Mohammad Salah, a high level Hamas military operative who was employed as a computer analyst by the Quranic Literacy Institute. When Mohammad Salah pleaded guilty to helping Hamas in an Israeli military court in 1995, the U.S. Treasury Department added him as a list of specially designated terrorists. In 1998 {{when he returned to the}} Chicago suburbs, the U.S. filed a forfeiture complaint to confiscate $1.4 million in assets that belonged to him and the Quranic Literacy Institute. The $820,000 loaned to the Institute by Kadi was included in the <b>confiscated</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Constantine was {{the only}} one of the two co-emperors to be old enough to rule by himself. He was about twenty-nine years old at the time but already {{suffered}} from tuberculosis. Chances were that he would not survive long and Heraklonas would remain as sole emperor. However Constantine set about to secure the loyalty of the Byzantine army for himself. His father had entrusted Patriarch Pyrrhus I of Constantinople with the administration of a treasury fund for Martina. Constantine <b>confiscated</b> the <b>fund</b> and used it for the spring military payroll and substantial donations to the army, estimated to about two millions coins.|$|R

25|$|In 1799 {{the abbey}} was burned and plundered by the {{soldiers}} of Napoleon's army, and many valuable items, books and archives were destroyed, including a 7th-century manuscript chronicle. The printing press {{that had been set}} up in 1729 was also destroyed at the same time, but much of the melted type and other metal was saved and from it were made the pipes of the organ of the church of St. Martin's in Disentis, which is still in use. Most of what was not destroyed was <b>confiscated</b> to <b>fund</b> the war effort. The abbey also lost half of its estates. It was nevertheless rebuilt by Abbot Anselm , the last of the abbots to enjoy the rank and title of Prince of the Empire.|$|R
5000|$|Bolaños accused Alemán of {{widespread}} corruption and was integral in exposing this alleged corruption throughout the Alemán administration. The scheme {{was reported to}} have involved several members of Arnoldo Alemán's closest family, including a brother and sister. Ex-ministers and close friends were also charged, some of whom fled the country. However, one of the central figures in the corruption complot, the former Chief of Department of Taxes Byron Jeréz, was imprisoned on the basis of another charge of corruption. All in all, fourteen persons were charged." [...] Several foreign governments froze Alemán's bank accounts in their countries and threatened to <b>confiscate</b> the <b>funds.</b> In such cases, his defense has been to claim that the funds were not stolen, but that they came from his coffee plantations.|$|R
5000|$|Opening {{hours for}} churches which still had their priests had been {{restricted}} to Sundays from 9 to 11 {{in the morning}} and sermons allowed to be preached only in German.

50|$|The first notable act of {{this group}} {{seems to have been}} their looting of a British outpost during the Supa Uprising when they <b>confiscated</b> {{government}} <b>funds,</b> took many chaukidars (watchmen) captive and burnt several outposts. The leaders of the 'bundh' are said to have taken shelter in the Darshanigudda ranges and at times escaped into neighbouring Goa territory. There are also references to a formidable fight at Dandeli and one at a Somalinga temple. These activities continued for several months and the British eventually sentenced some of them. The Portuguese also deported more than 100 of these insurgents along with the Sawant brothers and their families to Timor in the East Indies. Gunaba Shenvi, Siddi Bastian, his brother Anna Saheb and the three Phadnis brothers were still at large and in July 1859, the British offered rewards of Rs. 1000 each for their arrest. Chintoba Phadnis and Siddi Bastian were eventually killed in an encounter at Jagabet.|$|R

50|$|Der Hauptmann von Köpenick {{is based}} on a true story that took place in Germany in 1906. A poor cobbler named Wilhelm Voigt {{purchased}} the second-hand uniform of a Prussian infantry captain. Wearing this, he travelled to the borough of Köpenick and ordered a troop of guardsmen to place themselves under his command. He then declared the town hall to be under military law, ordering the arrest of the mayor and treasurer and <b>confiscating</b> all the <b>funds</b> in the exchequer. In this film version it's a considerable sum of 4,000 reichsmarks. Voigt's orders were obeyed without question and he temporarily got away with the caper, although he was eventually caught.|$|R
5000|$|The {{congress}} was held from 18 October 1946 until 21 October 1946. However, {{the start of}} the conference was undermined as a result of French Socialist opposition and conflict between some of the members. The Communist party offered full support to the meeting, which only led the other parties to approach the meeting with suspicion. Most importantly the Socialist Minister of colonial affairs, Marius Moutet, viewed the meeting as a threat to his colonial policies and thus instructed his allies to not attend and for colonial authorities to do what they could to hinder the meeting. Moutet convinced some of the signatories of the document to renounce the manifesto and persuaded Guèye, Senghor, and Diallo not to attend. In addition, the colonial authorities <b>confiscated</b> Tchicaya's <b>funds</b> for travel. The result was that the 800 delegates who did arrive included few socialist moderates and instead was dominated by those who sought to align the party with the communists. Reflecting on the way this shaped the party, Houphouët-Boigny recalled in 1952 that [...] "If Lamine and Senghor had been at Bamako, we would have written another page of history." ...|$|R

5000|$|Joseph then {{embarked}} on an ambitious programme of reform and regeneration aimed at raising Naples {{to the level of}} a modern state in the mould of Napoleonic France. Monastic orders were suppressed, their property nationalised and their <b>funds</b> <b>confiscated</b> to steady the royal finances. Feudal privileges and taxes were abolished, however the nobility was compensated by an indemnity in the form of a certificate which could be exchanged in return for lands nationalised from the Church. Moreover, provincial intendants were instructed to engage those dispossessed former monks who had the inclination in the work of public education, and to ensure that elderly monks no longer able to support themselves were moved into communal establishments founded for their care. A college for the education of young girls was also established in each province and a central college at Aversa was founded to which the daughters of public functionaries, and the ablest from the provincial schools, were admitted under the personal patronage of Queen Julie.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 January 1832 Benbow {{published}} a pamphlet entitled Grand National Holiday and Congress of the Productive Classes. He {{had joined the}} National Union of the Working Classes in 1831, and his coffee house and beer shop at 8 Theobalds Road, otherwise known as the Institution of the Working Classes, became the focus for the Union's activities. [...] Benbow was a regular, high-profile speaker at its gatherings at Blackfriars Rotunda, where he advocated direct and even violent action for political reform, and in particular his idea for a [...] "national holiday" [...] and [...] "national convention".

The striking workers were to support themselves with savings and <b>confiscated</b> parish <b>funds,</b> and by demanding contributions from rich people. Benbow briefly edited {{published a}} newspaper, the Tribune of the People, whose subject-matter was the topics {{to be included in the}} Congress, but it was discontinued after just three issues.

5000|$|From the beginning, the Commune had a tense {{relationship}} with the Catholic Church. On 2 April, soon after the Commune was established, it voted a decree accusing the Catholic Church of [...] "complicity in the crimes of the monarchy." [...] The decree declared {{the separation of church}} and state, <b>confiscated</b> the state <b>funds</b> allotted to the Church, seized the property of religious congregations, and ordered that Catholic schools cease religious education and become secular. Over the next seven weeks, some two hundred priests, nuns and monks were arrested, and twenty-six churches were closed to the public. At the urging of the more radical newspapers, National Guard units searched the basements of churches, looking for evidence of alleged sadism and criminal practices. More extreme elements of the National Guard carried out mock religious processions and parodies of religious services. Early in May, some of the political clubs began to demand the immediate execution of Archbishop Darboy and the other priests in the prison. The Archbishop and a number of priests were executed during Bloody Week, in retaliation for the execution of Commune soldiers by the regular army.|$|R
