40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{considered}} {{how to perform}} logic synthesis of the single-flux-quantum (SFQ) logic circuits by using logic synthesis tools for semiconductor logic circuits. Fundamental difference of the SFQ logic gates from the semiconductor logic gates in terms of logic synthesis is that typical SFQ gates are <b>clocked</b> <b>gate,</b> where gates have to be clocked by SFQ pulses. In our approach, we divided the procedure into two steps; logic synthesis and clock distribution. In the logic synthesis step, the logic function is optimized using a logic synthesis tool without considering the clock network. The Design Analyzer provided from Synopsys is used in this study. We have developed an SFQ cell library for the logic synthesis. In the clock distribution step, clock networks for every clocked SFQ gates are designed taking account of timing. We used a clock-followed-data clocking scheme in this study. We have classified every <b>clocked</b> <b>gate</b> into stages, where the clocked gates in the same stage are clocked simultaneously. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we have designed a controller of an 8 -bit SFQ microprocessor. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A new three-phase, three-level dc to dc phase shifted pulsewidth {{modulation}} (PWM) converter {{is proposed}} for high power and high input voltage applications. Output voltage {{is controlled by}} incorporating phase shift PWM. <b>Clocked</b> <b>gate</b> signals of each leg are phase shifted by 2 pi/ 3 from each other. Major features of the converter include: (1) outer two switches of each leg are turned on and off as zero voltage switching, (2) inner two switches of each leg are turned on and off as zero current switching, and (3) this is achieved without involving any extra passive or active components. The secondary side of the converter is of center tapped full-wave current tripler type. This results in an increase of ripple frequency {{by a factor of}} six, leading to a significant reduction in size of the output filter. In order to obtain behavioral and performance characteristics of the proposed converter topology, detailed analytical and simulation studies are carried out.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Clock</b> <b>gating</b> is a {{predominant}} {{technique used}} for power saving. It is {{observed that the}} commonly used synthesis-based gating still leaves {{a large amount of}} redundant <b>clock</b> pulses. Data-driven <b>gating</b> aims to disable these. To reduce the hardware overhead involved, flip-flops (FFs) are grouped so that they share a common clock enabling signal. The question of what is the group size maximizing the power savings is answered in a previous paper. Here we answer the question of which FFs should be placed in a group to maximize the power reduction. We propose a practical solution based on the toggling activity cor-relations of FFs and their physical position proximity constraints in the layout.
