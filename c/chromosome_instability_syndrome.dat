Fanconi anemia (FA), for example, is an inherited <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> <b>syndrome</b> with a complex array of variable disease phenotypes including congenital malformations, hematological manifestations, and cancer. To better understand specific aspects of the genetic etiology of FA and other rare diseases with complex phenotypes, it is often necessary to reduce {{the dimensions of the}} disease phenotype information. Towards this end, we extend a novel non-parametric approach to include information about a hierarchical structure among disease phenotypes.

Eight FA proteins form a nuclear core complex, which promotes tolerance of DNA lesions in S phase, but {{the underlying mechanisms}} are still elusive. We reported recently that the FA core complex protein FANCM can translocate Holliday junctions. Here we show that FANCM promotes reversal of model replication forks via concerted displacement and annealing of the nascent and parental DNA strands. Fork reversal by FANCM also occurs when the lagging strand template is partially single-stranded and bound by RPA. The combined fork reversal and branch migration activities of FANCM lead to extensive regression of model replication forks. These observations provide evidence that FANCM can remodel replication fork structures and suggest a mechanism by which FANCM could promote DNA damage tolerance in S phas...|$|E

NBS results from mutations in the mammalian gene Nbs 1 that codes for a 95 -kDa protein called nibrin, NBS 1, or p 95. To establish an animal model for NBS, we attempted to generate NBS 1 knockout mice. However, NBS 1 gene knockouts were lethal at an early embryonic stage. NBS 1 homozygous(-/-) blastocyst cells cultured in vitro showed retarded growth and subsequently underwent growth arrest within 5 days of culture. Apoptosis, assayed by TUNEL staining, was observed in NBSI homozygous(-/-) blastocyst cells cultured for four days. NBSI heterozygous(+/-) mice were normal, and exhibited no specific phenotype for at least one year. However, fibroblast cells from NBSI heterozygous(+/-) mice displayed an enhanced frequency of spontaneous transformation to anchorage-independent growth as compared to NBS 1 wild-type(+/+) cells. Furthermore, heterozygous(+/-) mice exhibited a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma after one year compared to wild-type mice, even though no significant differences in the incidence of other tumors such as lung adenocarcinoma and lymphoma were observed. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that NBS 1 heterozygosity and reduced NBSI expression induces formation of specific tumors in mice...|$|E

NBS patients show growth retardation und microcephaly, a characteristic facial appearance, immunodeficiency and {{an increased risk of}} cancer; in addition, NBS patient cells were found to be sensitive to ionizing irradiation und have higher levels of spontaneous chromosomal damage. Over 90 % of all patients are homozygous for a truncating mutation, producing two mutated forms of the NBS 1 gene product nibrin. For {{a better understanding of the}} role of Nibrin, other proteins were identified whose abundance is altered in the absence of Nibrin. Homozygous null mutant fibroblasts of a murine model were exposed to ionising radiation, separated in a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and by searching the Swiss Prot Database. In total, 35 proteins were identified which fall into different functional categories (metabolism, chaperones, cell cycle, signal transduction, transcription/translation, cytoskeleton, collagen). The results confirm Nibrinâ€™s role in cell cycle and checkpoint control as well as tumorigenesis and indicate additional functions of Nibrin.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:The FA/BRCA pathway repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks. Mutations in this pathway cause Fanconi anemia (FA), a <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> <b>syndrome</b> with {{bone marrow}} failure and cancer predisposition. Upon DNA damage, normal and FA cells inhibit the cell cycle progression, until the G 2 /M {{checkpoint}} {{is turned off}} by the checkpoint recovery, which becomes activated when the DNA damage has been repaired. Interestingly, highly damaged FA cells seem to override the G 2 /M checkpoint. In this study we explored with a Boolean network model and key experiments whether checkpoint recovery activation occurs in FA cells with extensive unrepaired DNA damage. METHODS:We performed synchronous/asynchronous simulations of the FA/BRCA pathway Boolean network model. FA-A and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines were used to study checkpoint and checkpoint recovery activation after DNA damage induction. The experimental approach included flow cytometry cell cycle analysis, cell division tracking, chromosome aberration analysis and gene expression analysis through qRT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS:Computational simulations suggested that in FA mutants checkpoint recovery activity inhibits the checkpoint components despite unrepaired DNA damage, a behavior that we did not observed in wild-type simulations. This result implies that FA cells would eventually reenter the cell cycle after a DNA damage induced G 2 /M checkpoint arrest, but before the damage has been fixed. We observed that FA-A cells activate the G 2 /M checkpoint and arrest in G 2 phase, but eventually reach mitosis and divide with unrepaired DNA damage, thus resolving the initial checkpoint arrest. Based on our model result we look for ectopic activity of checkpoint recovery components. We found that checkpoint recovery components, such as PLK 1, are expressed to a similar extent as normal undamaged cells do, even though FA-A cells harbor highly damaged DNA. CONCLUSIONS:Our results show that FA cells, despite extensive DNA damage, do not loss the capacity to express the transcriptional and protein components of checkpoint recovery that might eventually allow their division with unrepaired DNA damage. This might allow cell survival but increases the genomic instability inherent to FA individuals and promotes cancer...|$|E
40|$|Ubiquitin {{signalling}} is {{a fundamental}} eukaryotic regulatory system, controlling diverse cellular functions. A cascade of E 1, E 2, and E 3 enzymes is required for assembly of distinct signals, whereas an array of deubiquitinases and ubiquitin-binding modules edit, remove, and translate the signals. In the centre of this cascade sits the E 2 -conjugating enzyme, relaying activated ubiquitin from the E 1 activating enzyme to the substrate, usually via an E 3 ubiquitin ligase. Many disease states are associated with dysfunction of ubiquitin signalling, with the E 3 s being a particular focus. However, recent evidence demonstrates that mutations or impairment of the E 2 s can lead to severe disease states, including <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> <b>syndromes,</b> cancer predisposition, and immunological disorders.

40|$|DNA is {{constantly}} exposed to endogenous and exogenous mutagenic stimuli that {{are capable of}} producing diverse lesions. In order to protect the integrity of the genetic material, a wide array of DNA repair systems that can target each specific lesion has evolved. Despite the availability of several repair pathways, a common general program known as the DNA damage response (DDR) is stimulated to promote lesion detection, signaling, and repair in order to maintain genetic integrity. The genes that participate in these pathways are subject to mutation; a loss in their function would result in impaired DNA repair and genomic instability. When the DDR is constitutionally altered, every cell of the organism, starting from development, will show DNA damage and subsequent genomic instability. The cellular response to this is either uncontrolled proliferation and cell cycle deregulation that ensues overgrowth, or apoptosis and senescence that result in tissue hypoplasia. These diverging growth abnormalities can clinically translate as cancer or growth retardation; both features can be found in <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> <b>syndromes</b> (CIS).

The cytogenetic effects of this aggressive therapy on skin fibroblasts were studied. Skin biopsies were cytogenetically analysed from 38 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT and who received conditioning with TBI (exceptions: patients 204 and 207). One group consisting of 20 patients was studied prospectively at three different points of time (before, 3 - 6 and 12 months after SCT), another patient cohort consisting of 18 patients was studied retrospectively 23 - 216 months after SCT. We could show that the intensive conditioning regimens used for SCT induce stable, structural chromosomal aberrations of clonal character in skin fibroblasts which can persist for up to 18 years after SCT. The performed breakpoint analysis revealed a non-random distribution of the breakpoints. Interestingly, some of the observed hot spots were located at bands where genes for the <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> <b>syndromes</b> have been mapped. The analysis of {{the time course of}} the cytogenetic aberrations indicated that the cytogenetic damage in the skin fibroblasts stays relatively stable throughout the first year after SCT and afterwards increases with time. This can be interpreted as an indication of in vivo radiation-induced chromosomal instability, supporting the results of the breakpoint analysis. When comparing different clinical groups, we found that the extent of cytogenetic damage was especially high in patients with acute leukemias. Further investigation with prospective study groups is needed to evaluate whether a high extent of cytogenetic damage correlates with an elevated risk of developing a secondary tumor...|$|R

RAD 50 function {{is essential for the}} formation and repair of meiosis-specific double-strand breaks and chromosome stability, Results: We present evidence for two new phenotypes associated with the rad 50 Delta mutant; shortened telomeres and cell senescence. Comparison of TG(1 - 3) telomeric sequences in an isogenic pair of RAD 50 and rad 50 Delta haploid strains showed that they were considerably shortened in the latter. Although rad 50 Delta mutation conferred cell enlargement and slow growth, cell doubling was faster but caused an increase in the frequency of cell death, Telomeres were restored to the wild-type size in hemizygous RAD 50 /rad 50 Delta and ran 50 S/rad 50 Delta strains; however, they showed a significant increase in rad 50 S/rad 50 S diploid with a concomitant rise in cell viability. Telomeres were stabilized in hemizygous RAD 50 / rad 50 Delta and rad 50 S/rad 50 Delta diploids during prolonged growth, suggesting that even a half-dosage of RAD 50 is sufficient to conserve the telomere size during successive cell divisions. Furthermore, cells bearing the rad 50 Delta mutation revealed abnormalities in nuclear segregation and, in the presence of hydroxyurea, displayed phenotypes consistent with defects in S-phase checkpoint control, Conclusion: This report presents evidence of the involvement of a gene relevant to recombinational repair in the maintenance of telomeres.

40|$|It is {{nowadays}} {{generally accepted}} that cancer {{can be considered}} as a genetic disease. However, there are two clear differences between cancer and most other genetic diseases. First, most cancers are caused essentially by somatic mutations, whereas all other genetic diseases are caused solely by germline mutations. Second, for most cancer types at least two mutations are required before a tumor may arise. For most pediatric and some adult tumors {{only a limited number of}} mutations are supposed to be sufficient for tumor development (Knudson, 1971, 1986; Haber and Housman, 1992). In contrast, most adult cancers appear to require more than two genetic changes. This 'multiple-hit' concept of tumorigenesis stems from several lines of evidence. First, most adult cancers show an exponential increase in incidence with age, suggesting that the accumulation of different hits is involved in tumor development (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 1993). Second, a dramatically increased incidence of cancer has been observed in individuals with <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> <b>syndromes</b> such as Bloom's syndrome (Vijayalaxmi et aI., 1983; Seshadri et aI., 1987). Third, repeated administration of mutagen to test animals is generally required before a tumor arises (Saffhill et aI., 1985). Fourth, increasing evidence becomes available for the involvement of multiple genetic alterations in common human tumors. The most extensively studied example is the accumulation of genetic alterations observed in human colon tumors, in which mutations in APe and ras found in adenomatous polyps have been classified as early events and mutations in p 53 and Dee as later events that may contribute to tumor progression (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990; section 3. 3). In a specific human cancer, mutations in one particular gene appear to precede those in others (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 1993), although after this first hit the accumulation of changes rather than their specific order seems to be important for tumor progression (Marx, 1989) ...|$|R

The loss of telomeres that protect the ends of chromosomes and prevent chromosome fusion has been proposed as one mechanism for <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> in cancer cells, however, there is little direct evidence to support this hypothesis. To investigate the relationship between spontaneous telomere loss and <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> in human cancer cells, clones of the EJ- 30 tumor cell line were isolated in which a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene was integrated immediately adjacent to a telomere.

In a chromosomal instable p 53 deficient mouse model with accelerated lymphomagenesis, we previously observed whole chromosome copy number changes affecting all lymphoma cells. This suggests that <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> is somehow suppressed in the aneuploid lymphomas or that selection for frequently lost/gained chromosomes out-competes the CIN-imposed mis-segregation. Results: To distinguish between these explanations and to examine karyotype dynamics in chromosome instable lymphoma, we use a newly developed single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) platform that provides a complete and unbiased overview of copy number variations (CNV) in individual cells. To analyse these scWGS data, we develop AneuFinder, which allows annotation of copy number changes in a fully automated fashion and quantification of CNV heterogeneity between cells. Single-cell sequencing and AneuFinder analysis reveals high levels of copy number heterogeneity in chromosome instability-driven murine T-cell lymphoma samples, indicating ongoing <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability.</b> Application of this technology to human B cell leukaemias reveals different levels of karyotype heterogeneity in these cancers.

The goal is to understand how genetic and epigenetic factors might influence the onset of <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> and the role of chromosomal instability in carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Centrosomes play {{critical}} {{roles in}} processes that ensure proper {{segregation of chromosomes}} and maintain the genetic stability of human cells. They contribute to mitotic spindle organization and regulate aspects of cytokinesis and cell cycle progression. We and others have shown that centrosomes are abnormal in most aggressive carcinomas. Moreover, centrosome defects have been implicated in <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> and loss of cell cycle control in invasive carcinoma. Others have suggested that centrosome defects only occur late in tumorigenesis and may not contribute to early steps of tumor development. To address this issue, we examined pre-invasive human carcinoma in situ lesions for centrosome defects and <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability.</b> We found that a significant fraction of precursor lesions {{to some of the}} most common human cancers had centrosome defects, including in situ carcinomas of the uterine cervix, prostate, and female breast. Moreover, centrosome defects occurred together with mitotic spindle defects, <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability,</b> and high cytologic grade. Because most pre-invasive lesions are not uniformly mutant for p 53, the development of centrosome defects does not appear to require abrogation of p 53 function. Our findings demonstrate that centrosome defects occur concurrently with <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> and cytologic changes in the earliest identifiable step in human cancer. Our results suggest that centrosome defects may contribute to the earliest stages of cancer development through the generation of <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability.</b> This, together with ongoing structural changes in chromosomes, could accelerate accumulation of alleles carrying pro-oncogenic mutations and loss of alleles containing wild-type tumor suppressor genes and thus accelerate the genomic changes characteristic of carcinoma, the most prevalent human cancer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChromosome {{instability}} {{plays an}} important role in cancer by promoting the alterations in the genome required for tumor cell progression. The loss of telomeres that protect the ends of chromosomes and prevent chromosome fusion has been proposed as one mechanism for <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> in cancer cells, however, there is little direct evidence to support this hypothesis. To investigate the relationship between spontaneous telomere loss and <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> in human cancer cells, clones of the EJ- 30 tumor cell line were isolated in which a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene was integrated immediately adjacent to a telomere. Selection for HSV-tkdeficient cells with ganciclovir demonstrated a high rate of loss of the end these "marked" chromosomes (10 - 4 events/cell per generation). DNA sequence and cytogenetic analysis suggests that the loss of function of the HSV-tk gene most often involves telomere loss, sister chromatid fusion, and prolonged periods of <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability.</b> In some HSV-tk-deficient cells, telomeric repeat sequences were added on to the end of the truncated HSV-tk gene at a new location, whereas in others, no telomere was detected on the end of the marked chromosome. These results suggest that spontaneous telomere loss is a mechanism for <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> in human cancer cells...|$|R
50|$|One form of {{patellofemoral}} syndrome {{involves a}} tissue-related problem that creates pressure and irritation {{in the knee}} between the patella and the trochlea (patellar compression syndrome), which causes pain. The second major class of knee disorder involves a tear, slippage, or dislocation that impairs the structural ability of the knee to balance the leg (patellofemoral <b>instability</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Patellofemoral <b>instability</b> <b>syndrome</b> may cause either pain, a sense of poor balance, or both.|$|R
40|$|<b>Chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> and {{aneuploidy}} are {{hallmarks of}} cancer, {{but it is}} not clear how changes in the chromosomal content of a cell contribute to the malignant phenotype. Previously we have shown that we can readily isolate highly proliferative tumor cells and their revertants from highly invasive tumor cell populations, indicating how phenotypic shifting can contribute to malignant progression. Here we show that <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> and changes in chromosome content occur with phenotypic switching. Further, we show that changes in the copy number of each chromosome quantitatively impose a proportional change in the chromosome transcriptome ratio. This correlation also applies to subchromosomal regions of derivative chromosomes. Importantly, we show that the changes in chromosome content and the transcriptome favor the expression of a large number of genes appropriate for the specific tumor phenotype. We conclude that <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> generates the necessary chromosome diversity in the tumor cell populations and, therefore, the transcriptome diversity to allow for environment-facilitated clonal expansion and clonal evolution of tumor cell populations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Telomeres are {{essential}} to maintain chromosomal stability. Cells derived from mice lacking telomerase RNA component (mTERC 2 / 2 mice) display elevated telomere-mediated <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability.</b> Age-dependent telomere shortening and associated <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> reduce the capacity to respond to cellular stress occurring during inflammation and cancer. Inflammation {{is one of the}} important risk factors in cancer progression. Controlled innate immune responses mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLR) are required for host defense against infection. Our aim was to understand the role of chromosome/genome instability in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined the function of TLR 4 in telomerase deficient mTERC 2 / 2 mice harbouring <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> which did not develop any overt immunological disorder in pathogen-free condition or any form of cancers at this stage. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> was measured in metaphase spreads prepared from wildtype (mTERC +/+), mTERC +/ 2 and mTERC 2 / 2 mouse splenocytes. Peritoneal and/or bone marrow-derived macrophages were used to examine the responses of TLR 4 by their ability to produce inflammatory mediators TNFa and IL 6. Our results demonstrate that TLR 4 is highly up-regulated in the immune cells derived from telomerase-null (mTERC 2 / 2) mice and lipopolysaccharide, a natural ligand for TLR 4 stabilises NF-kB binding to its promoter by down-regulating ATF- 3 in mTERC 2 / 2 macrophages...|$|R
40|$|Perturbation {{of origin}} firing in {{chromosome}} replication {{is a possible}} cause of spontaneous <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> in multireplicon organisms. Here, we show that chromosomal abnormalities, including aneuploidy and chromosome rearrangement, were significantly increased in yeast diploid cells with defects in the origin recognition complex. The cell cycle of orc 1 - 4 /orc 1 - 4 temperature-sensitive mutant was arrested at the G 2 /M boundary, after several rounds of cell division at the restrictive temperature. However, prolonged incubation of the mutant cells at 37 Â°C led to abrogation of G 2 arrest, and simultaneously the cells started to lose viability. A sharp increase in <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> followed the abrogation of G 2 arrest. In orc 1 - 4 /orc 1 - 4 rad 9 Î”/rad 9 Î” diploid cells grown at 37 Â°C, G 2 arrest and induction of cell death were suppressed, while <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> was synergistically augmented. These findings indicated that DNA lesions caused by a defect in Orc 1 p function trigger the RAD 9 -dependent checkpoint control, which ensures genomic integrity either by stopping the cell cycle progress until lesion repair, or by inducing cell death when the lesion is not properly repaired. At semirestrictive temperatures, orc 2 - 1 /orc 2 - 1 diploid cells demonstrated G 2 arrest and loss of cell viability, both of which require RAD 9 -dependent checkpoint control. However, <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability</b> was not induced in orc 2 - 1 /orc 2 - 1 cells, {{even in the absence}} of the checkpoint control. These data suggest that once cells lose the damage checkpoint control, perturbation of origin firing can be tolerated by the cells. Furthermore, although a reduction in origin-firing capacity does not necessarily initiate <b>chromosome</b> <b>instability,</b> the Orc 1 p possesses a unique function, the loss of which induces <b>instability</b> in the <b>chromosome...</b>|$|R
