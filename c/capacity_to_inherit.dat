50|$|Although the {{customary}} law of intestate succession has been abolished {{to a great}} extent by means of court judgments, there are customary law impediments influencing a beneficiary’s <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> in terms of {{the customary}} law of succession.

50|$|The {{general rule}} is that all persons, born or unborn, natural or juristic, and {{regardless}} of their general legal capacity—minor children, too, therefore—may take validly any benefit conferred on them by will or on intestacy.

40|$|Background: Reduced DNA repair <b>capacities</b> due <b>to</b> <b>inherited</b> polymorphisms may {{increase}} the susceptibility to cancers including gastric cancer. Previous studies investigating the association between Xeroderma Pigmentosum group C (XPC) gene polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk reported inconsistent results. We performed a meta-analysis to summarize the possible association. Methods: All studies published up to January 2014 on the association between XPC polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk were identified by searching electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM). The association between XPC polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) together with their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Six studies with 1, 355 gastric cancer cases and 2, 573 controls were finally included in the meta-analysis. With respect to Lys 939 Gln polymorphism, {{we did not observe}} a significant association when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. When stratified by ethnicity, source of control, and study quality, statistical significant association was not detected in all subgroups. With respect to Ala 499 Val and PAT−/+polymorphisms, we also did not observe any significant association with gastric cancer risk in the pooled analysis. Conclusions: This meta-analysis based on current evidences suggested that the XPC polymorphisms (Lys 939 Gln, Val 499 Arg, and PAT−/+) did not contribute to gastric cancer risk. Considering the limited sample size and ethnicity included in the meta-analysis, further larger scaled and well-designed studies are needed to confirm our results...|$|R

40|$|A {{child may}} be born {{after the death of}} its natural father. That has always been the case. Modern {{advances}} in technology now create a new possibility and a {{child may be}} both conceived and born after the death of its father. This creates many legal complexities and uncertainties, one of which relates to the posthumously conceived child’s <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> from the deceased father’s estate. This article examines the novel legal questions that arise in relation to such children and succession. In particular, the extent to which sperm is inheritable, the obstacles faced by posthumously conceived children in inheriting from the natural father and the circumstances when a duty to provide for the child from the estate will arise...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma thesis was {{to discuss}} the issues of {{testamentary}} succession, where not only the institute of the {{last will and testament}} will be discussed, but also some other legal regulations of the succession rights, that cannot be left out while discussing the issues of testamentary succession. The presented work is devided into six chapters, where the first chapter is started with the introduction word of the author, who introduces the work and puts the reader into the problem. After this a brief digression into the past follows, showing the issues of testamentary succession in the historical context and finally, this chapter is finished with the definition of the valid legal regulation of this time. The second chapter of this work focuses on the main principles of the testamentary succession. Individual principles are named individually and analysed in details, where some of the specific declarations of these rules are explicitly pointed out not only in this chapter, but in the following ones, too. The third chapter focuses in details on individual presumptions that must be individually fullfilled, so that the succession could be possible. These conditions are discussed in individual subchapters called: the death of testator, the existence of decedent's estate, the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit,</b> the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This {{essay will}} explore aspects of Bernard Stiegler's theorisation of film editing as the {{construction}} of a flux of perceptual experience {{at the heart of the}} industrialisation of attention characteristic of modern and contemporary technocultures. This work appears in the third volume of the Technics and Time series and provides a crucial plank in the rationale informing Stiegler's recent critical activism dedicated to a reformulation of the mainstream mediascape. It also represents a substantially novel reconsideration of key themes in film theory through a critical phenomenological perspective informed by an equally critical mobilisation of Gilbert Simondon's notion of individuation. The relations between perceiving spectator and projected film, film and experience, and the individual and collective experience of cinema as a cultural form are reposed through this perspective. Editing is central to this reconsideration, as it has been to many accounts of the specificity of cinematic representation. Stiegler sees the co-incidence of the flux of the perceiving consciousness with the synthesis of an edited cinematic work as crucial <b>to</b> cinema's <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> both <b>inherit</b> from and displace the literary technicity of early and pre-modern Western cultural becoming. Cinematic technicity has been and remains a crucial substrate for the dynamics of this mutual becoming because it has played such a major role in the organisation of collective cultural experience in and through its instantiation of individual lived experience, memory, imagination and anticipation. Stiegler's diagnosis in recent texts of the addictive, disassociating, and disorienting dynamics of contemporary 'ill-being' will be approached through his account of editing's part in making experience modern - which he associates with mainstream Hollywood's projection and exporting of a model of life as and for universal adoptability - and then global and realtime in the digital age...|$|R

40|$|Womenâ€™s substantives right <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> {{land from}} their {{deceased}} husbandâ€™s estate {{and their ability}} to enforce that right through various dispute resolution mechanisms are serious problems that affect thousands of women who live under either customary or Islamic law in Ilemela District, Mwanza in Tanzania This is because the perception of many societies in Tanzania is that women are inferior to men and this adversely affects womenâ€™s right <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> land under customary and Islamic laws. Equality for all citizens before the law and access to justice are two human rights which make ideal tools <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> land from their deceased husband. This study examines and analyse the challenges faced by women especially widows, not only when they seek to enforce their right before dispute resolution mechanisms which are controlled by men but the substantive rights <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> land (under customary, Islamic and statutory law) itself. These challenges essential undermine womenâ€™s right <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> for example, under customary laws a widow does not have the right <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> the land of her late husband; under Islamic law however women do not have the right <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> land of their deceased husband or father in accordance with the Holy Quran These are additional factors that make womenâ€™s right <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> of land problematic in Mwanza, and these include the conflicting and discriminatory approaches to womenâ€™s right <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> land. While customary laws are highly patriarchal and fraught with gender discrimination, Islamic laws is based on the obedience of women to men and their submissive nature. In both cases, women are discouraged from pursuing their rights for fear for loosing their existing economic dependence on male family members or as a result of false accusations of witchcraft against them. The majority of respondents believed that the statutory law was the most supportive of their rights three systems of law as they confirm with the provisions of the Tanzania Constitution and other International human rights Conventions which prohibit discrimination against women. This study recommended that Tanzania should enact or reform its laws to abolish all discriminatory laws which undermine womenâ€™s rights <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> land, and cooperate with international human rights instrument.,NORA...|$|R
