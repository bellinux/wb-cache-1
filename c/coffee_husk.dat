Sixteen boars were housed in individual stalls; eight were maintained in a conventional system with a concrete floor and eight were maintained on a concrete floor lined with <b>coffee</b> <b>husks.</b> The experimental period was 60 days. All animals were filmed two days {{prior to the start}} of the experiment, on both the 7 th and 60 th days after exposure to <b>coffee</b> <b>husks,</b> and finally two days after the removal of the material. During this period, the number of times that the animals ate, drank, stood, sat, lay down, and dug was recorded.

Basal diet consisted of napier grass (60 %) and concentrate (40 %). The results showed that supplementation of lactating Etawah does with fermented <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> {{did not affect the}} palatability of the diets, but increased the protein and crude fiber consumption (P< 0. 05).

The persistency of milk production and the somatic cells count were not different. There was an improvement of somatic cells count on supplemented groups.

40|$|The {{processing}} of coffee generates {{significant amounts of}} agricultural wastes. <b>Coffee</b> <b>husks,</b> comprised of dry outer skin, pulp and parchment, are probably the major residues from the handling and {{processing of}} coffee (1). Coffee spent ground is the main coffee industry residue obtained during the processing of raw coffee powder to prepare instant <b>coffee.</b> <b>Coffee</b> <b>husks</b> and spent ground are generated {{in more than two}} millions tons yearly (2), and the major problem encountered by the industries is the disposal of these residues, since they contain some amount of caffeine, polyphenols and tannins, which makes them toxic in nature (3).

Therefore, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the ability of some fungal strains to growth on <b>coffee</b> <b>husks</b> (basically the parchment skin the hull that surrounds the coffee bean), and spent grounds, as an alternative to add value to these toxic residues. Strains from the genus Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mucor and Neurospora were used. Microbial growth was carried out in Petri plates containing 30 % of <b>coffee</b> <b>husks</b> or spent ground and 70 % of CzapekDox saline media, pH 5. 0. The plates were inoculated with a suspension containing 5 ´ 106 spores/g dry residue, and maintained at 28 ºC for 5 days. The spore suspension was prepared by scrap down the spores from PDA plates with a sterilized solution of 0. 2 % Tween 80, and counted in a Neubauer chamber.

40|$|The {{goal was}} to {{investigate}} the influence of natural products such as lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), dried avocado leaves (Persea americana), <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> (Coffea arabica) and castor bean (Ricinus communis) in the defense of Apis mellifera, as well the effect of these products on the population development of the beehive. Defensive behavior was evaluated by time of first sting (TFS) and number of stingers (NS), and population development, by open brood area and operculated brood. It was observed that the treatment with smoke + seven castor beans presented significant increase in the TFS, for treatment without and with smoke. Regarding NS, it was verified that the treatments with smoke + seven castor bean and smoke + 20 % <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> were different from the treatment without and with smoke. The other treatments did not differ significantly with respect to the use of smoke or its absence. The application of <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> and castor bean did not interfere {{in the development of the}} population, suggesting that these compounds were not toxic. It can be concluded that the use of castor bean and <b>coffee</b> <b>husk</b> in smoke may represent an important tool for the reduction of defensiveness, without promoting toxicity for A. mellifera...|$|E
