The rules {{of a contract}} of sale are sometimes applied {{in terms of a}} <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease,</b> as where, for example, a third party fixes the sale or rental price.

50|$|As noted above, in Roman law the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> (locatio conductio) {{had three}} forms: the locatio conductio rei, the locatio conductio operis and the locatio conductio operarum.

50|$|The <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> is a {{bilateral}} juristic act: It {{gives rise to}} rights and duties between the parties. There are several statutes applicable to the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease.</b> The parties must be mindful of the relevant statutory provisions when drafting the lease. The rights and duties afforded by legislation may not be waived. For example, section 5(3) of the Rental Housing Act (RHA) sets out certain rights and duties, while section 5(4) states that such provisions may not be waived by either party, as they are for the mutual benefit of both parties. The <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> will be deemed to include these provisions. Such provisions include the provision that, before the tenant takes occupation, {{there must be a}} joint inspection of the leased premises for defects and the right to privacy.|$|E

The Romanian legislation in post-communist period leasing experienced a special regulation to introduce it in the new Civil Code, thus recognizing the importance it has in the socio-economic rent in Romania.

The attorney whom they approached for assistance offered to lease the farm, equipment and animals from them in his personal capacity, although in his professional capacity he also drafted the <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease.</b> It later transpired that the attorney used his position to mislead the couple as regards the contracts in question and that he was guilty of unethical and unprofessional conduct. The couple applied to court to have the leases declared void, alternatively cancelled, and to have the attorney evicted from the farm. The order was granted; however, the discussion seeks to demonstrate that the couple were afforded only minimal justice in that they did not claim, nor were they granted, any damages. The various possibilities open to them in the circumstances are examined and the conclusion is that ventilating the matter by way of application was probably not the best manner in which to have sought assistance...|$|R

To fulfil such objectives, I have applied the methods of analysis and interpretation of the existing legislation, a comparison with historical legislation and with international law, and have assessed the relevant jurisprudential arguments. The structure of this dissertation thesis is divided into the following areas: definition of the enterprise, legal provisions relating to the conclusion, modification and termination <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> on <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> the enterprise and, finally, special cases of application <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> on <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> the enterprise, e. g. in connection with insolvency, execution or public contracts etc. I consider the following legal conclusions as basic findings and results of this thesis: The enterprise 1.

The Constitutional Court found in favour of the tenants and postponed the appeal to allow any of the parties to lodge a complaint at the Gauteng Rental Housing Tribunal.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} {{considerable}} interest in the fundamental economics and finance of commercial real estate leases, following theoretical work on the economics of a term structure <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> rates and returns, the gametheoretical context within which lease rates are determined, and the economic nature <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> transactions as financial contracts. There has also been practical interest in the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>leases</b> as financial <b>contracts</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} asset-liability management. Unlike the term structure of interest rates, there is little empirical evidence <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> return term structure phenomena, primarily because extremely complex data requirements have conspired against the construction of an actual term structure <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> returns at any time. This has thus also limited the conduct of empirical tests of advances in commercial real estate lease research with actual lease returns term structure data. This paper reports on research towards abstracting an ex-post term structure <b>of</b> commercial <b>lease</b> returns from analysis of a sample of some four hundred office lease transactions over a five year timeframe. Following a detailed and time-intensive analysis <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> <b>contracts,</b> transaction-based office capital and rental indices and associated aggregate financial markets data, we construct an ex-post term structure <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> rates in a series of cross-sectional analyses using regression methodology.
