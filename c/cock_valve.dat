50|$|A routine {{inspection}} during the train's stop in New York City, inspectors later said, found the angle cock in the correct, open position. But an after-accident {{investigation by the}} ICC revealed that {{the handle of the}} angle cock {{at the rear of the}} third coach was not in the correct position, as a design flaw on New Haven coach #8665 allowed the handle of the angle <b>cock</b> <b>valve</b> to come into contact with the car frame, causing the valve to close. This meant that the engine could only activate the braking power of the first three coaches.|$|E
50|$|After {{more than}} 47 {{years of service}} as a sail and later on as a {{stationary}} training ship she was first laid up in A Graña, Ferrol, her Spanish port of registry. In 1981 the underwater hull was re-plated at the drydock in Ferrol. Later Galatea was completely de-rigged down to a hulk (all yards with standing and running rigging and even the masts removed) and was towed to Seville {{to be used as}} a floating museum, but left forgotten. Some sources even reported that the ship was sunk in the harbour by removing her bronze sea <b>cock</b> <b>valve,</b> but salvaged later by the Spanish Navy.|$|E
5000|$|The year 2003 brought {{several new}} markers and {{products}} from Smart Parts, {{due to a}} reshuffling of design engineers. The most notable new product from this time period was the Shocker 03 marker (whose name soon after became Shocker SFT). The Shocker SFT was a redesigned marker that used a single solenoid open bolt, <b>cock</b> <b>valve</b> operation capable of high firing speeds,small body size, but an average efficiency without a Smart Parts High Efficiency Bolt. Although this marker was given the name [...] "Shocker", it actually shares virtually no design aspects with its namesake the older Shocker Sport. However, Smart Parts decided {{to call it the}} next-generation [...] "Shocker" [...] for marketing purposes, since the older Shockers were already discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|... 7-122. GENERAL. The word {{safetying}} {{is a term}} universally used in {{the aircraft}} industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, oil caps, drain <b>cocks,</b> <b>valves,</b> and parts. Three basic methods are used in safetying; safety-wire, cotter pins, and self-locking nuts. Retainer washers and pal nuts are also sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|In many countries. {{approved}} backflow prevention assemblies {{are required}} by law, and must be installed in accordance with plumbing or building codes. A typical backflow assembly has test <b>cocks</b> and shut-off <b>valves,</b> and must be tested when installed, if relocated or repaired, and also on a periodic basis.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{techniques}} for different applications. The word safetying is a term universally used in the aircraft industry. Briefly, safetying is defined as: [...] "Securing by various means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle etc., on the aircraft so that vibration will not cause it to loosen during operation." [...] These practices are not a means of obtaining or maintaining torque, rather a safety device to prevent the disengagement of screws, nuts, bolts, snap rings, oil caps, drain <b>cocks,</b> <b>valves,</b> and parts. The wire itself maintains tension and remains in place by being twisted around itself and attached to the fastener to be secured on one end and an anchor point (which could be another fastener) on the other end. Since safety wire is made of a malleable alloy, it retains its shape after being bent, rather than springing back to its original shape. This property allows it to remain locked around an object, such as when it is passed through a small hole on a fastener, looped back upon itself and then twisted. The same process is then repeated around the anchor point, which could be another fastener. Since it remains twisted instead of unraveling, it acts as a fixed loop and will not back out without considerable force (greater than the stresses which {{it is intended to}} counter) being applied.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of January 15, 1953, at Washington's Union Station, the Federal overran {{the end of the}} track and into the concourse. According to {{official}} ICC reports, a design flaw on New Haven coach #8665 allowed the handle of an angle <b>cock</b> <b>valve</b> in the air brake system to come into contact with the car frame, causing the valve to close. This disabled the brakes on all of the following cars, rendering them inoperable by the locomotive operator. Approaching automatic block signal #1339, the engineer attempted to apply the brakes to slow the train, with no effect. The unbraked cars pushed the GG1 locomotive and two passenger cars off the end of Track 16 at the station. They crashed through the Stationmaster's office and fell through the floor of Union Station into the baggage room below. The operator at control Tower [...] "K" [...] had contacted station personnel by phone to warn them of the runaway train and the station was evacuated before the crash. In a remarkable demonstration of the durability of the GG1 engine, engine #4876 was later cut into three pieces, hoisted from the baggage room, and reassembled at the Altoona shops of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It then re-entered commercial service and went on {{to be one of the}} last-serving GG1 engines. It is, as of 2011, being held for restoration at the B&O Railroad Museum in Baltimore. This crash also inspired the finale for the 1976 film, Silver Streak.|$|E
40|$|Keywords- <b>cock</b> <b>valve,</b> failure analysis, {{mechanical}} analysis, finite element, {{flow field}} calculation Abstract. Though statistically analyzing ten typical wells of kelly <b>cock</b> <b>valve</b> failure in certain oilfields, the main failure modes of the kelly <b>cock</b> <b>valve</b> were determined. Aiming at these modes and combining with mechanical analysis of knob, upper seat and {{main body of}} the kelly <b>cock</b> <b>valve,</b> its finite element calculation had been implemented and the weakness of all parts was found. By numerical modeling of the flow field of a kelly <b>cock</b> <b>valve</b> {{it was found that the}} velocity of fluid rapidly increased at upper and lower valve seats and this could easily prick out ball valves and valve seats, there was a annular low-velocity zone of minimum speed between the ball valve and the inner wall of the main body and this caused solid aggregation at this area. The research in this paper made the modes and causes of kelly failure to be recognized systematically. The results provided theoretical foundations of further improving the design and reasonable using of a kelly <b>cock</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out as a study of flow rate using a single channel {{acoustic}} emission (AE) technique. The objective of this project is to study the effect of ball valve, brass gate valve and brass stop <b>cock</b> <b>valve</b> to flow rate using AE technique. A test rig consists of the circumferential galvanized steel pipe, ball valve, gate valve and stop <b>cock</b> <b>valve</b> to run the experiments. The fluid used was water throughout the experiments. The pressure of water was controlled by a valve. The source of AE signal was from the valve and it was captured using AE sensor {{with the help of}} Acoustic Emission Detector 2. 1. 3 software. For all valve conditions, the value of hits, count and RMS (average, maximum and minimum) were recorded and analyzed. All the value recorded were compared among the ball valve, gate valve and stop <b>cock</b> <b>valve.</b> The results were gained from 10 marked points each for all type of valve. The result showed that there was no AE activity on the pipe without valve, the AE activities are greater for high pressure or full close valve. In addition from the RMS against distance graft, RMS value increased when pressure is increased. From the flow rate against RMS graf show that flow rate will decrease when RMS is increased...|$|E
50|$|Railroads have strict government-approved {{air brake}} testing {{procedures}} for various circumstances when assembling trains or switching out cars en route. After a cut is made between cars in a train {{and the train}} is rejoined, {{in addition to other}} tests, the crew must verify that the brakes apply and release on the rear car (to ensure that all of the brake hoses are connected and the angle <b>cocks,</b> or <b>valves,</b> are opened). In most cases, the engineer is able to use information from the ETD to verify that the air pressure reduces and increases {{at the rear of the}} train accordingly, indicating that proper brake pipe continuity. This device is said to constitute a fail-safe condition.|$|R
50|$|The {{tanks were}} air pressurised, {{the fuel tank}} by engine {{compressor}} bleed air and the oxidiser tank by ram air and additionally by the stored air bottle. Ram air {{was taken from the}} supersonic inlet boundary layer bleeds. A single timer-controlled valve opened the stored air supply which then opened the pneumatic LP <b>cocks.</b> A second <b>valve,</b> after a delay, engaged the turbopump clutch. HP cocks were opened by a single hydraulic piston, driven by fuel pressure controlled through a third timed valve. Both fuel and oxidiser first flowed through a small pilot valve for ignition, before their main valves opened. Correct opening of all four valves was monitored by the timer control, to ensure a safe mixture.|$|R
500|$|An {{investigation}} by the Interstate Commerce Commission discovered a design flaw on a style of passenger car used by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in which the handle of an angle <b>cock,</b> a <b>valve</b> used to close the brake pipe when the car is the last one in the train, {{came into contact with}} a bottom crossmember of the coupler pocket. The angle cock would become closed, rendering the brakes on all the trailing cars inoperable. The third car behind 4876, New Haven 8665, was of this design, but the fourth car had a slightly different style of coupler. The difference between the two cars increased the frequency and the intensity of which the angle cock at the rear of 8655 would hit the crossmember. Earlier in the morning, the train was stopped outside of Kingston, Rhode Island, because the brakes on the final two cars were [...] "sticking" [...] and could not be released from the locomotive. Upon inspection, the angle cock on 8655 was found to be closed and was reopened by the engineer, but, after a locomotive and shift change, the matter was forgotten.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{developed}} several types of wave generator for experiments, whichhave been used to contribute to studies on waves. In this study, a wave generator ofhydraulic swelling type is introduced {{which is designed to}} be simple and easy even whenapplication f or model experiments. The wave generator of hydraulic swelling type in a model basin is consisted of asubmerged canvas bag and a pump for water supply and drainage. If a water flow intoand out of the bag is controled by regulation of <b>cock</b> <b>valve,</b> a progressive wave of anarbitrary form will be produced in the mode basin. Efficiency of the wave generator is determined by the oscillation characteristics ofthe model basin and the control of water flow as an external force. In this study, thisproblem is studied experimentally, especially for the case of trigonometrical external force. When these equipments and conditions were applied to the model of rivers in OsakaCity, {{it was found that the}} generated waves were progressive and its celerities were nearlyequal to that of long wave. The wave generator may be applicable for waves of period in a range from 0. 5 to 4 mmnutes. In an application, periodgram of the wave in the model basin gave a result that thereexist a little hi-modal componemt and a little or comparable semi-modal component to thefundamental mode...|$|E

5000|$|In 1875, Hurt {{moved to}} Atlanta, where he {{organized}} the Atlanta Building and Loan Association, which {{he ran for}} thirty-two years. He also co-founded the Trust Company of Georgia - now part of Suntrust - and, starting in 1895, was its president for nine years. In 1882, he organized the East Atlanta Land Company, where he designed and developed Inman Park, a residential area connected to the city center by his Atlanta and Edgewood Street Railway Company, which opened along Edgewood Avenue in 1886. It was Atlanta's first electric streetcar line, {{and it was the}} first profitable electric line in America. In 1880, he filed what would be [...] for an interesting thermal water valve.

50|$|Cone valves or {{ball valves}} are another alternative. These are {{commonly}} found as the service shut-off valves in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They {{can be identified}} by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed. Usually, when the handle {{is in line with}} the pipe the valve is open, and when the handle is across the pipe it is closed. A cone valve consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a taper-plug <b>cock.</b> A ball <b>valve</b> uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle rotates the passage away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot pass. Valves of this type using a cylinder rather than a cone are sometimes encountered, but using a cone allows a tight fit to be made even with moderate manufacturing tolerances. The ball in ball valves rotates within plastic seats.|$|R
