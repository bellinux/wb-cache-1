Image analysis also distinguished defects in the cork structure: empty ant gallery; Coroebus undatus F. larvae gallery; and wetcork. Several predictive classification models of stoppers into quality classes were built using the results from <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> surface characterization and a simplified model using the main discriminant features i. e. porosity coefficient and the RGB colour-type variables was presented. X-ray tomography {{was used as a}} non-destructive technique to study the internal structure of natural <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers,</b> allowing the visualization of some defects inside the <b>cork</b> <b>stopper.</b> After characterization, the natural <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> were used as closure of bottles and oxygen diffusion measurements were made along time. The kinetics of oxygen transfer was similar and could be adjusted to logarithmic models. On average 35 % of the overall oxygen ingress occurred in the first 5 days, 59 % in the 1 st month and 78 % in the first 3 months. Microtomography images (voxel size of 50 µm) allowed the observation of lenticular channels development and geometry, and the quantification of void and high density regions (HDR) fractions.

Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is presently the isocyanate used {{in the production of}} polyurethane based adhesive due to its lowest toxicity comparing with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) previously employed.

The presence of these compounds are usually investigated by HPLC with Fluorescence or UV-Vis detector depending on the derivatising agent.

40|$|With the {{availability}} of new techniques to close wine bottles avoiding the risk of ?corky? taste the tradition of closing wine bottles with <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> is on the retreat. As a consequence the Mediterranea cork oak forests with their rich biodiversity are endangered since their cultivation is not profitable anymore. This paper explores the viability of a market approach {{to the preservation of}} these ecologically valuable landscapes. In an internet-based Contingent Valuation survey we assess wine consumers' willingness to pay a higher price for wine bottles closed with high-quality <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> instead of buying wine with alternative stoppers in order to preserve the cork oak landscapes. We find that though many wine consumers have experience with tainted wine they are, nevertheless, willing to buy wine with (highquality) <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> at higher prices. Their average WTP is, however, not sufficient to cover the additional costs of these stoppers. Thus, we propose a financing mix of market returns and government subsidies for preserving the cork oaks.

40|$|Novel {{processes}} for sterilization and deodorization of <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> and <b>cork</b> barks {{have been developed}} and evaluated. Cork sterilization targets to microbial load reduction, either for bacteria or yeasts-moulds, while the reduction of rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -Trichloroanisole (2, 4, 6 -TCA) of cork is achieved via their deodorization. The determination of microbial load and rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -TCA οf cork {{was carried out by}} appropriate developed and evaluated analytical techniques, while the corks were subjected to artificial microbial or chemical contamination in many cases. The application of the plain ozonation process (ozone dosage= 1500 g?min/m 3) proved to be particularly efficient on microbial load removal of cork barks (98 %) and their 7 day preservation, without causing any remarkable degradation of cork quality characteristics. At once, three times higher ozone dosage (4500 g?min/m 3) resulted to a deodorization degree varied from 45 to 82 % and this variation is probably due to the local distribution of 2, 4, 6 -TCA in cork and to the restricted ozone access in cork internal structure. Despite the application of plain and pulsed steam processes, under the experimental conditions, resulted to lower sterilization efficacy of barks (76 %), showed comparable deodorization percentages (75 - 85 %) accompanied with lower remaining values of rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -TCA. The steam pulsed process (SPP) was selected as the optimum process based on techno economical criteria, for the treatment of artificially contaminated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers,</b> because during its application, a 99 % sterilization degree and a comparable deodorization efficacy was achieved, resulted to a rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 -TCA sufficiently lower to the acceptable quality limit of 5 ng/L. Ozone usage, showed once more its excellent sterilizing action, but its contribution to <b>cork</b> <b>stopper</b> deodorization seemed to be negligible. Consequently, taking into account the high cost required for ozone production, its use wasn’t desirable. During a more detailed insight of the optimum process SPP, naturally contaminated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> were tested and sporadic resistance phenomena to deodorization were observed probably due to thermal collapsing of cork cells and 2, 4, 6 -TCA content release from these cells. Based on a statistical analysis using Gamma distribution was demonstrated that SPP treatment of naturally contaminated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> contributed to an increase of the possibility to find an untainted <b>cork</b> <b>stopper</b> from a bale from 0, 54 to 0, 74. In the sequel, an appropriate mathematical model describing the deodorization of artificially and naturally contaminated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> was constructed and its critical parameters were determined by obtained experimental data simulation In the second part, the deodorization of <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> through the liquid or gas phase, using commercially available adsorbents was studied. The majority of the tested materials showed significant adsorption capacity against 2, 4, 6 -TCA and Tygon was chosen for further study. The simultaneous presence of Tygon in cork aqueous extracts, during a time period of 16 h, conduced to values of rapidly releasable 2, 4, 6 - TCA of <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> significant lower than the limit of 5 ng/L, delimiting 97 % deodorization, while the 20 day residence of Tygon with artificially contaminated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> in an enclosed gas atmosphere was proved sufficient in order to achieve a 95 % deodorization degree. The estimated operational cost of the deodorization process with Tygon was 200 times lower than the corresponding cost of SPP. Finally, 2, 4, 6 -TCA management as a waste amount during cork deodorization processes in liquid or gas phase, was included the usage of oxidizing agents, as ozone and the photocatalytic degradation on titania film. The latter process resulted to faster and more efficient 2, 4, 6 -TCA reduction in gas phase (99 %), providing a potential solution. ...|$|R

Two training sets of international and national cork planks were studied. The first set comprised a total of 479 samples from Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, while the second set comprised a total of 179 samples from the Spanish regions of Andalusia, Catalonia, and Extremadura. A training set of 90 <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> from Andalusia and Catalonia was also studied.

Six different solvents were put in contact with adhesive film during ten days at a temperature of forty degrees. Experiments were replicated and repeated three times. Through a TWO-WAY ANOVA the significance of solvents was evaluated and the three better solvents selected.

Simultaneously, it was envisaged to perform an evaluation of the air quality. Methods and Results: Moulds were isolated and identified from cork slabs and cork samples in four <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> facto-ries. The identification was based on morphological characters and microscopic observation of the reproductive structures. Airborne spore dispersion was assessed using a two stage Andersen sampler. It was observed that Chrysonilia sitophila was always present on cork slabs during the maturing period, but mould diversity appeared to be associated to the different factory configurations and processing steps. Conclusions: Spatial separation of the different steps of the process, including physical separation of the maturation step, is essential to guarantee high air quality and appropriate cork slabs colonization, i. e.
