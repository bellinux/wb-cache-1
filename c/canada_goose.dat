40|$|The Platte {{rivers and}} {{associated}} habitats are major wintering areas for <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> (Branta Canadensis) in Nebraska. The {{objective of this}} study was to examine changes in abundance and distribution of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> along the Platte River system during 1960 - 2000. We used counts of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> based on aerial surveys from the annual Mid-Winter Survey (MWS). The entire lengths of the North and South Platte rivers and the Platte River were surveyed, and counts of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> were made by visual estimation. We examined changes in goose numbers for the North and South Platte rivers, and divided the Platte River into two main sections (Central and East) over four time periods (i. e., decades).

40|$|Prolonged {{recreational}} hunting of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> in New York State may {{be contributing to}} the degradation of the species and ecological damage throughout the state. Due to the recent {{significant changes in the}} resident and migratory populations of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> throughout the Atlantic Flyway, a more thorough Environmental Impact Statement, than the one the New York Department of Environmental Conservation currently relies on, should be required for any action that will result in the hunting of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese.</b> The DEC should also reopen environmental review and conduct a cumulative impact assessment of the effects of habitat manipulation and prolonged hunting on <b>Canada</b> <b>geese.</b> The goals and mandates of New York 2 ̆ 7 s Environmental Conservation Law, specifically SEQRA, would be better served if the DEC prohibited all current and future hunting of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese.</b> This Comment considers whether the DEC 2 ̆ 7 s management of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> deviates from the policies and mandates of the New York ECL and whether the DEC 2 ̆ 7 s management of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> should be reconsidered and restructured to better comply with New York State 2 ̆ 7 s ECL and, therefore, embody a more ecologically sound approach to the management of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese...</b>|$|R

50|$|Since {{establishment}} of the refuge, the primary emphasis on waterfowl species has been expanded to include the Eastern Prairie Population of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese.</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> were first observed using the refuge in the early 1940s, and numbers increased gradually to peak populations over 200,000 birds annually.

At the turn of the 20 th century, <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> were almost extirpated from most parts of North America. However, populations of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> have rebounded dramatically, primarily due to the concerted efforts of wildlife mangers across the country and the ability of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> to adapt to habitats found in urban and suburban areas.

Occasional visitors include: osprey ("Pandion haeliatis"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The ruddy darter dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E
5|$|Large mammals {{found in}} the city {{includes}} urbanized coyotes and numerous whitetail deer. Eastern gray squirrel, and other rodents are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum and raccoon.

Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally {{be seen on the}} MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{national}} {{symbols are}} influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada. The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include the beaver, <b>Canada</b> <b>goose,</b> and common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf. The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.|$|E

5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered whooping crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Whooping cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the sandhill crane, American white pelican, brown pelican, roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and <b>Canada</b> <b>goose.</b> The blue crab and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and redfish are the common finfish that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, redfish live in shallow waters; their tail fins can be spotted above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors to be careful.|$|E
