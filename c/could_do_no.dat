5|$|Kepler {{postponed}} {{the move}} to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph's death in early 1612, though between political upheaval, religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate), Kepler <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, Eclogae Chronicae, from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} improved for {{the following}} race in Bahrain though, as Webber picked up his first point for the season despite a small mistake in qualifying which left him starting 14th and {{marked the first time}} he had been outqualified by his teammate in F1. He was unable to continue his point scoring form, however, as intermittent electrical problems in San Marino and a lack of grip in Spain meant that he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> better than 13th and 12th in those races.|$|E

5|$|The Third Test of the 1948 Ashes {{series was}} one of five Tests in a cricket series between teams {{representing}} Australia and England. The match was played at Old Trafford in Manchester from 8–13 July, with a rest day on 11 July. The match was drawn after {{the whole of the}} fourth day and {{the first half of the}} fifth day was washed out due to rain; England had the upper hand before the weather intervened. The draw maintained Australia's 2–0 lead in the series, which was established through victories in the first two Tests. As Australia were the holders of The Ashes, the draw meant that England <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> better than level the series 2–2 by winning the last two Tests, and thus Australia retained The Ashes.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts won the 250cc Grand Prix, Sheene {{claimed the}} {{victory in the}} 500cc Venezuelan Grand Prix while Roberts' Yamaha {{suffered}} a mechanical failure on the starting line. In the second round at the Spanish Grand Prix, Roberts was leading the race by eight seconds when his throttle stuck, forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow American Pat Hennen. Roberts then won his first-ever 500cc Grand Prix with a win in Austria, quickly followed by two more victories in France and Italy, along with two second-place finishes in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, Roberts crashed during practice for the 250cc race, sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury. Shaken up by the accident, he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> better than seventh place in the 500cc race. Sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at the Venezuelan round, but a string of podium finishes and a victory at the Swedish Grand Prix combined with Roberts' failure to score any points in the Finnish Grand Prix, allowed him to close the points gap.|$|E
5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E

5|$|The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions {{reported}} reaching and capturing {{their first}} objective, the Black Line, by 6:25am. The 4th Canadian Division encountered {{a great deal}} of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. After a planned pause, when the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions consolidated their positions, the advance resumed. Shortly after 7:00am, the 1st Canadian Division captured the left half of its second objective, the Red Line and moved the 1st Canadian Brigade forward to mount an attack on the remainder. The 2nd Canadian Division reported reaching the Red Line and capturing the village of Les Tilleuls at approximately the same time. A mine explosion that killed many German troops of the Reserve Infantry Regiment 262 manning the front line preceded the advance of the 3rd Canadian Division. The remaining German troops <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> more than man temporary lines of resistance until later manning a full defence at the German third line. As a result, the southern section of the 3rd Canadian Division was able to reach the Red Line at {{the western edge of the}} Bois de la Folie at around 7:30am. At 9:00am the division learned of its exposed left flank, as the 4th Canadian Division had not yet captured Hill 145. The 3rd Canadian Division was thus called upon to establish a divisional defensive flank to its north. Although the German commanders were able to maintain open lines of communication and issue operating orders, even with swift staff work the tempo of the assault was such that German decision cycle was unable to react decisively.|$|E
25|$|On 9 June 1917, Bernert was {{transferred}} back to Jasta 2, and would command {{it to the}} end of his flying career. The previous commanding officer had scored no victories to inspire his pilots; as it turned out, because of his injuries, Bernert <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> better.|$|E
25|$|In the race, he stalled on the grid, {{the same}} as his countryman, Ukyo Katayama.

That he only did for 10 laps, before he suffered a terminal gearbox problem and began limping back to the pits.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{between the}} PRC and India {{deteriorated}} {{during the rest}} of the 1960s and the early 1970s as China–Pakistan relations improved and Sino-Soviet relations worsened. The PRC backed Pakistan in its 1965 war with India. Between 1967 and 1971, an all-weather road was built across territory claimed by India, linking PRC's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Pakistan; India <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> more than protest.|$|E
25|$|From {{the first}} the British had an {{extraordinary}} advantage, {{never to be}} balanced out {{at any time during}} the whole war, which was their radar and fighter control network and organization.

25|$|Eddie Irvine, {{fresh off}} a podium finish at the Italian GP, showed promise for Jaguar by posting the second best time on Friday, {{just ahead of}} the two McLarens, as Williams {{struggled}} to get in the top 10.

Williams took fourth (Montoya) and fifth (Ralf Schumacher), while Irvine <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> better than thirteenth.|$|E
25|$|Berry {{returned}} as Premier, {{and formed a}} much more moderate ministry than the one which had fallen in 1879. Both sides were exhausted by the struggle, and in July 1881 a modest reform bill was passed, including some reforms of Council elections, but no concessions on the essential powers of the Council. Berry, feeling he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> more, resigned, and Bryan O'Loghlen formed another weak conservative government. Later Berry accepted office as Chief Secretary and Postmaster-General in a coalition government led by Service, from 1883 to 1886.|$|E

After further innings of 0, 43, 0, 19 and 1 he was dropped before the last match of the series. Although Worcestershire did win the Benson & Hedges Cup, in first-class cricket Hick finished with an average for the season of just 32.91, which remains his lowest in any English summer.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, {{the arts}} institute, {{along with the}} {{watercolor}} museum, was destroyed by the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. In 1987, the city government bought the house on Salvador Novo Street in Coyoacan, the present site, and donated it to the watercolor museum. However, the government also stated that it <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> more to support the project. The museum continued on private donations and the efforts of Guati Rojo’s work. He not only provided much of the funding, but his popularity helped to promote the museum along with Mexican watercolor painting in general.|$|E
25|$|A new governor, Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois, {{arrived in}} New France in 1726. In August 1728 he sent Lignery, {{recently}} promoted to major, {{in command of}} an army of 450 Frenchmen and 1,000 Indians against the Foxes. This was the largest force ever to advance so far into the interior, but it failed to secure a decisive engagement with the enemy. Lignery arrived at the fortified Fox village {{at the mouth of}} the Fox River on August 17. Here and elsewhere during the campaign, the Foxes fled to the west; the French <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> more than burn their villages and their crops. The expedition continued up the Fox River as far as the Wisconsin River portage before retracing their steps.|$|E
25|$|Lütjens radioed Wilhelmshaven and Berlin and all {{the naval}} {{commands}} concerning the sinking of Hood continually until his message was acknowledged. It was received only at 14:40 in Berlin. Aboard Prinz Eugen Captain Brinkmann noted that such actions were dangerous. He recorded in the ships' war diary that Lütjens' insistence on radioing every change of course to the shore commands; then confirmed by a final “Execute!” order, was unnecessary and risky. In {{the morning of the}} 25 May, his 52nd birthday, Lütjens persisted by sending a long message on the Hood action. It was apparent that he mistakenly believed he was still under surveillance by the British and thus any message <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>no</b> harm since his position was known to the enemy.|$|E
