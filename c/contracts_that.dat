5|$|Seattle {{was one of}} {{the major}} cities that benefited from {{programs}} such as the WPA, CCC, UCL, and PWA. The workers, mostly men, built roads, parks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record sites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as Los Angeles prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building <b>contracts</b> <b>that</b> rivaled New York City and Chicago, but lost to LA as well. Seattle’s eastern farm land faded due to Oregon’s and the Midwest’s, forcing people into town.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the lockout, {{a higher percentage of}} players signed contracts worth the maximum amount possible under the cap. Some young players, such as LeBron James, began signing shorter <b>contracts</b> <b>that</b> allowed for more flexibility in team choice and salary. The agreement expired in 2005, and both sides became concerned about the possibility of another work stoppage. A lockout was prevented, however, when a six-year CBA was reached in June 2005. After the expiration of that CBA, a lockout occurred in 2011; it was the fourth in league history and lasted for about five months before the sides came to an agreement. Each team's schedule in the 2011–12 NBA season was cut by 16 games.|$|E
5|$|Riley {{began his}} career writing verses as a sign maker and {{submitting}} poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents. Riley was an alcoholic, never married or had children, and created a scandal in 1888 when he became too drunk to perform. He became more popular {{in spite of the}} bad press he received, and as a result extricated himself from poorly negotiated <b>contracts</b> <b>that</b> limited his earnings; he quickly became very wealthy.|$|E
50|$|The {{contract}} {{is subject to}} various legal provisions. An employer may not legally offer a <b>contract</b> <b>that</b> pays the worker less than a minimum wage. An employee may not agree to a <b>contract</b> <b>that</b> allows an employer to dismiss them for illegal reasons.|$|R
50|$|An {{escalation}} clause is a clause in a lease or <b>contract</b> <b>that</b> guarantees {{a change in}} the agreement price once a particular factor beyond control of either party affecting the value has been determined.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Mexican league incident, Robert Murphy, a former {{negotiator}} for the National Labor Relations Board, attempted {{to organize the}} Pittsburgh Pirates into a guild for purposes of collective bargaining. Murphy decried the reserve clause in player <b>contracts</b> <b>that</b> gave team owners unlimited control over the player's services, and demanded more rights for players, including the right of contract {{and the right of}} salary arbitration. Chandler worked with Pirates officials to avoid a threatened strike by the players. Part of Chandler's intervention included organizing a team of replacement players as a contingency plan; the team would have included Honus Wagner, who was 72 years old at the time.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and <b>contracts</b> <b>that</b> fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E
5|$|The Engineering Experiment Station {{was renamed}} the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1984. A {{separate}} organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, {{changed its name}} to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally to the Georgia Tech Research Corporation in 1984. There are legal difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities, especially the federal government, so the second organization is a contracting organization. Most importantly, it allows the university to perform multi-year <b>contracts</b> <b>that</b> are not possible under state law, which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year. The name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with the federal government. GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s: the Centennial Research Building opened on {{the north end of the}} Georgia Tech campus in 1985, providing expanded lab and office space, and the electromagnetic radiation measurement range was established at GTRI's Cobb County research facility.|$|E
50|$|The Labour Act of 2004 {{allows for}} a few {{different}} ways in which employees can be terminated. The first method is in the event of the death of an employee. The second is that either party may terminate the employment contract as long as the other party is given notice. The amount of notice given goes as follows: one days notice for a <b>contract</b> <b>that</b> has lasted less than three months, one week of notice for a <b>contract</b> <b>that</b> has lasted more than three months but less than two years, two weeks for a <b>contract</b> <b>that</b> has lasted more than two years but less than five years, and one month for a <b>contract</b> <b>that</b> has lasted for more than five years. Also within the terms of the contract, all payments most be made to an employee before his contract is terminated.|$|R

5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' <b>contracts</b> <b>that</b> stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{is one of}} the ten most visited {{national}} parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession <b>contracts</b> <b>that</b> provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport's presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within a U.S. National Park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise abatement regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, 10million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.|$|E
