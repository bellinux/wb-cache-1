40|$|Abstract. Deep {{drawing is}} one of widely used sheet metal working process in {{industries}} to produce cup shaped components {{at a very high}} rate. In deep drawing process, a sheet metal blank form cylindrical components by process in which central portion of sheet is pressed into die opening to draw the metal into desired shape without folding the corners. Earing {{is one of}} the major defects observed during deep drawing process due to anisotropic nature of sheet metal. Earing is defined as formation of waviness on uppermost portion of deep drawn cup. Knowledge about ear formation in deep drawing process allows a prior modification of process which can result in defect free final product with financial saving and time. The initial blank shape used in present study is circular in nature. The objective of present study aims to produce parts which are earing defect free. Earing can be reduced by modifying the initial blank shape such as use of non <b>circular</b> <b>blank</b> as in present study.

40|$|Abstract The cup {{drawing is}} a basic deep drawing process. Thus, {{understanding}} {{the mechanics of the}} cup drawing process helps in determining the general parameters that affect the deep drawing process. There are mainly two methods of analysis; experimental and analytical/numerical. Experimental analysis can be useful in analyzing the process to determine the process parameters that produce a defect free product. However, experimental work is usually very expensive and time consuming to perform. On the other hand, the Analytical/Numerical modeling can be used to model and analyze the process through all stages of deformation. This approach is less time consuming and more economical than experimental analysis. There have been several efforts to solve and analyze the deep drawing problem. Among these are the attempts to analyze the cup drawing process, by few researches who developed analytical models for the cup drawing process to solve for stresses and strains over the deforming sheet metal.

Illustrations of how strain distribution and the plastic work done on a blank vary with hydrostatic head are also given. In particular it is shown that the energy received from an explosive charge by a blank may greatly exceed the fraction expected by reference to the solid angle subtended by the blank at the point charge. With the aid of some blank speed measurements an attempt is made to relate the kinetic energy acquired by the blank to the plastic work done on them. PART 2 : The measured maximum speed of deformation over the central portion of blanks is shown to be less than 300 ft/sec (rupture excluded). For some circumstances that two phases of motion exist is incontro-vertible, and the mechanism responsible for these, we believe, is as follows. In the first phase the speed is dependent upon stand-off distance and is a consequence of the primary shock wave and subsequent cavitation and diffraction effects that occur {{as a result of the}} shock wave impinging on the blank. The second phas...|$|R

The proposed algorithm uses the knapsack algorithm and an enumeration method to determine the optimal combination of blank rows in the strips, the strip numbers and directions in the pattern. A heuristic algorithm for the one-dimensional cutting stock problem with usable leftover is presented by (Cui & Yang 2010).|$|R
