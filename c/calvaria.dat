However, the difference (delta) between the calcium efflux induced in <b>calvariae</b> incubated with and without β 2 m in basal medium and that in <b>calvariae</b> incubated with and without β 2 m in indomethacin supplemented medium was similar, suggesting a prostaglandin independent mechanism.

Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that differentiated osteoblasts contain a nuclear factor that binds to this site. This binding activity is not present in undifferentiated osteoblasts.

Five CD- 1 pOBCol 3. 6 IGF lines were generated. Transgenic mice appeared healthy, bred normally and had growth rates similar to wild-type littermates. Analysis of transgene mRNA expression indicated that the transgene was targeted to bone tissue, with some extent of expression in tendon and skin. Transgene mRNA expression was strong in young animals and then gradually decreased. The level of transgene mRNA expression varied among the different founder lines. ^ The level of transgene expression was correlated with the bone phenotype in three independent founder lines. Percent collagen synthesis (PCS) in calvarial cultures was significantly greater in both the high and intermediate expressing lines than in wild-type. However, PCS of the low expressing line was not different than wild-type. Static histomorphometry showed that 8 -week old transgenic <b>calvariae</b> from the high and intermediate expressing lines were significantly wider and had greater marrow area and osteoclast number/bone area than wild-type calvariae; however, <b>calvariae</b> from the low expressing line and wild-type mice were similar. <b>Calvariae</b> of the intermediate expressing line maintained the phenotype at 7 months.

Osteoblasts also are known to produce neutral proteinases, including collagenase and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which are thought to be important in bone development and remodeling. The present study investigated the effects of zero gravity on development of <b>calvariae</b> and their expression of collagenase and tPA. After in utero exposure to zero gravity for 9 days on the NASA STS- 70 space shuttle mission, the <b>calvariae</b> of rat pups were examined by immunohistochemistry for the presence and location of these two proteinases. The ages of the pups were from gestational day 20 (G 20) to postnatal (PN) day 35. Both collagenase and tPA were found to be present at all ages examined, with the greatest amount of both proteinases present in the PN 14 rats. At later ages, high amounts were maintained for tPA but collagenase decreased substantially between ages PN 21 to PN 35. The location of collagenase was found to be associated with bone-lining cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and in the matrix along cement lines. In contrast, tPA was associated with endothelial cells lining the blood vessels entering bone. The presence and developmental expression of these two proteinases appeared to be unaffected by the exposure to zero gravity.

40|$|Introduction: External {{mechanical}} forces on cells {{are known to}} influence cytoskeletal structure and thus cell shape. Mechanical loading in long bones is unidirectional along their long axes, whereas the <b>calvariae</b> are loaded at much lower amplitudes in different directions. We hypothesised that if osteocytes, the putative bone mechanosensors, can indeed sense matrix strains directly via their cytoskeleton, the 3 D shape and the long axes of osteocytes in fibulae and <b>calvariae</b> will bear alignment to the different mechanical loading patterns in {{the two types of}} bone. Materials and methods: We used confocal laser scanning microscopy and nano-computed tomography to quantitatively determine the 3 D morphology and alignment of long axes of osteocytes and osteocyte lacunae in situ. Results: Fibular osteocytes showed a relatively elongated morphology (ratio lengths 5. 9 : 1. 5 : 1), whereas calvarial osteocytes were relatively spherical (ratio lengths 2. 1 : 1. 3 : 1). Osteocyte lacunae in fibulae had higher unidirectional alignment than the osteocyte lacunae in <b>calvariae</b> as demonstrated by their degree of anisotropy (3. 33 and 2. 10, respectively). The long axes of osteocyte lacunae in fibulae were aligned parallel to the principle mechanical loading direction, whereas those of calvarial osteocyte lacunae were not aligned in any particular direction. Conclusions: The anisotropy of osteocytes and their alignment to the local mechanical loading condition suggest that these cells are able to directly sense matrix strains due to external loading of bone. This reinforces the widely accepted role of osteocytes as mechanosensors, and suggests an additional mode of mechanosensing besides interstitial fluid flow. The relatively spherical morphology of calvarial osteocytes suggests that these cells are more mechanosensitive than fibular osteocytes, which provides a possible explanation of efficient physiological load bearing for the maintenance of calvarial bone despite its condition of relative mechanical disuse. © 2008...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRunx family {{transcription}} factors {{consist of}} Runx 1, Runx 2, and Runx 3. Runx 1 {{is involved in}} chondrocyte differentiation at an early stage. Runx 2 is a major transcription factor for chondrocyte maturation, and Runx 3 has a redundant function with Runx 2 and it is partly involved in chondrocyte maturation. Runx 2 directly regulates Ihh expression and enhances chondrocyte proliferation. Runx 2 is an essential transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation. Heterozygous mutation of RUNX 2 causes cleidocranial dysplasia, which is characterized by hypoplastic clavicles, open fontanelles, and supernumerary teeth. Runx 2 directly regulates Sp 7 expression, and Runx 2 together with Sp 7 and canonical Wnt signaling completes determination of the lineage of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts. Runx 2 expression in osteoblasts is regulated by a 343 -bp enhancer. Dlx 5 / 6 and Mef 2 directly bind this enhancer; form an enhanceosome with Tcf 7, β-catenin, Sox 5 / 6, Smad 1, and Sp 7; and activate this enhancer. Msx 2 inhibits this enhancer, and switching of the binding of Msx 2 to Dlx 5 is important for this activation. Core binding factor β (Cbfb) forms a heterodimer with Runx family proteins and enhances their DNA-binding capacity. In Cbfb conditional knockout mice in osteoblast and chondrocyte lineages, the differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts is inhibited. All of the Runx family proteins are reduced in the cartilaginous limb skeletons and <b>calvariae</b> in Cbfb conditional knockout mice, although the reduction of Runx 2 protein in <b>calvariae</b> is much milder than that in cartilaginous limb skeletons.
