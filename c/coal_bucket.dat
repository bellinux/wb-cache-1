25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and <b>coal,</b> <b>bucket</b> wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.|$|E

5000|$|A {{wide range}} of {{accessories}} are used with fireplaces, which range between countries, regions, and historical periods. For the interior, common in recent Western cultures include grates, fireguards, log boxes, andirons, pellet baskets, and fire dogs, all of which cradle fuel and accelerate burning. A grate (or fire grate) is a frame, usually of iron bars, to retain fuel for a fire. Heavy metal firebacks are sometimes used to capture and re-radiate heat, to protect {{the back of the}} fireplace, and as decoration. Fenders are low metal frames set {{in front of the fireplace}} to contain embers, soot and ash. For fireplace tending, tools include pokers, bellows, tongs, shovels, brushes and tool stands. Other wider accessories can include log baskets, companion sets, <b>coal</b> <b>buckets,</b> cabinet accessories and more.|$|R

If they did not get orders at that lock, they waited near the {{aqueduct}} bridge in Georgetown, until orders came through. A tugboat on the river would pull the boats to other points, e.g. Navy Yard, Indianhead, Alexandria. Some coal loads were unloaded directly in the Georgetown <b>coal</b> yards, using <b>buckets.</b> <b>Coal</b> was also unloaded onto ocean sailing vessels bound for Massachusetts (which brought ice, and returned with coal), a 4 masted vessel holding about 20 boatloads of coal.|$|R

This coal facility which was {{state of the}} art at that time, and greatly reduced the amount of physical labor required for the coal wholesale suppliers in the area. Prior to the construction of this facility, these coal suppliers had to employ large amounts of labor to manually unload the coal barges at the waterfront, where men in the coal barge would shovel the <b>coal</b> into <b>buckets</b> and hoist it up to the dock. The coal would be dumped into wheelbarrows, and wheeled two blocks east to the coal bins. Where it was dumped into street level bins.

According to the cause and mechanism of the bucket dropping accident in main shaft hoisting systems, the conclusion that overloading promotion {{was the main}} cause of bucket crash accident was obtained with the fault tree analysis method. One theoretical analysis model was established in order to prevent the occurrence of overloaded bucket dropping accident. The model provided scientific basis and steps in theory for qualitative and quantitative analysis on the cause of falling bucket accident and for the study on accident prediction and prevention. This article proposed several feasible technical measures to prevent the bucket crash accident, which had important guiding significance in practical application. ...|$|R

So, many industry makes a decision to change from those popular energy resources to other alternative energy resources like <b>coal.</b> <b>Bucket</b> elevator is one of material handling equipment which used to lift bulk material from bottom upward. But, lack in designing a bucket elevator can cause failure in operation of bucket elevator.

40|$|Citation: Fay, Scott Stuart. Relative {{calorific value}} of some coals on Kansas markets. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: The fuel value of coals, {{while it is}} a subject that {{hitherto}} has attracted but little attention, is one that the engineers of today are beginning to consider seriously; {{but it is not}} only these thoughtful engineers that are wide awake to the question, but practically all scientists as well, and even many coal dealers, and to a less extent the general public. Ordinarily coal is priced not on its real or its practical value as a producer of heat, but on an entirely different basis, namely, the cost necessary to lay it down, on the market. After calculating the expenditure, of wealth in mining, transportation, storing and a reasonable: profit for all concerned, and considering nothing more its market value is determined. Now this, while it must need be borne in mind, is not the principal item be used in ascertaining their commercial values. Since coal is used for the production of energy the all-important question in rating the article should be how much energy will it produce compared with others? It is to be hoped that further investigation will revise this, and give us a more scientific price list. Certainly it would be a valuable piece of work that would assign each its proper place in the system. It is the object of this experiment to arrive at some conclusions regarding the calorific value of a few coals on Kansas markets. Of the fourteen samples used thirteen were obtained from the dealers, while the other one the college coal coming from Lansing is not on the market at all. Sampling was done in the manner about to be described: A sample filling an ordinary <b>coal</b> <b>bucket</b> was taken from various parts of the bin. This was broken into small pieces, not larger than walnuts, and then spread out upon the sampling table, letting each shovel- full fall upon the same spot giving each particle an equal opportunity to roll in the direction and to the distance it would...|$|E
