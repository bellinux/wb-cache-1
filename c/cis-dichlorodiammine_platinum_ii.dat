40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of Adriamycin (ADR), daunomycin (DMN) and <b>cis-dichlorodiammine</b> <b>platinum</b> (<b>II)</b> (DDP) {{on the ability of}} murine renal tubular epithelium and erythropoiesis to respond to an acute proliferative stress was investigated. Folic acid (FA) and acute anaemia induced by bleeding were used as acute proliferative stimuli for renal-tubule epithelium and erythropoiesis respectively. The ability of these normal cell-renewal systems to mount a regenerative proliferative response was evaluated by radioisotopic, morphological and gravimetric techniques 4 months after drug treatment. The results indicate that pretreatment with these agents produce a long-lasting reduction in the ability of these cell-renewal systems to mount regenerative proliferation. In the kidney, the ability to respond to FA was most severely compromised by ADR and DDP, whereas in the erythropoietic system all 3 agents induced a long-lasting proliferative defect...|$|E

40|$|Summary. -Cis-dichlorobis(cyclopentylamine) {{platinum}} II (DBCP) {{belongs to}} the group of platinum complexes which have recently been reported to have anti-tumour activity. Its cytotoxic activity in CHO cells is not cell-age-dependent, but enhancement of the effect of ionizing radiation is both dose-and cell cycle phase-dependent. In asynchronous cell populations DBCP acts as a dose-modifying factor for ionizing radiation. Doses of DBCP reducing survival of CHO cells to 26 % and 4 % applied 1 h before irradiation reduce the Do value of radiation dose-survival curves by factors of 1 - 34 and 1 59 respectively. In synchronized CHO populations enhancement by DBCP of the effect of radiation is most pronounced in G 1 and in late S while it is reduced in mid-S. Possible mechanisms of DBCP-radiation interaction are discussed. PLATINUM complexes were reported by Rosenberg et al. (1969) to have antibiotic and antitumour activities.

40|$|Pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (PAs) {{are natural}} plant compounds found {{in hundreds of}} plant species worldwide and are reported to have cytotoxic, carcinogenic, antimitotic, and gentotoxic activity. PAs are metabolized by the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) sytem to the pyrrole or the N-oxide form. They pyrroles are bifunctional electrophillic alkylators that bind cellular nucleophiles such as DNA and proteins and disrupt normal cell processes, including DNA replication and gene transcription, and can cause megalocytosis. The pyrroles dehyrosenecionine (DHSN) and dehydromoncrotaline (DHMO) {{are among the most}} potent PA cross-linkers and inducers of megalocytosis. DHSN and DHMO-induced cross-links in cultured normal (MDBK) and neoplastic (MCF 7) cells were nalyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot and both were found to contain the protein actin. Actin is crucial to DNA replication and is known to be involved in cross-links induced by <b>cis-dichlorodiammine</b> <b>platinum</b> <b>II</b> (cistplatin), a well known cross-linking drug used for the treatment of cancer. Actin cross-linking may explain the antimitotic, megalocytotic, and anticarcinogenic effects of PAs. Since protein cross-linking is an important mode of action for PAs, we were interested in what characteristics of the protein might make it a good nucleophilic target. Thus, further research was undertaken based on the hypothesis that cysteine residues, and specifically free sulfhydryl groups, are attractive targets for the bifunctional electrophilic alkylators DHSN and DHMO. Nucleophiles were selected for their abundance in the cell, their cysteine content, and their relationship to the documented side effects of PAs. Actin, glutathione (GSH), metallothionein, topoisomerase II, and cysteine were all found to cross-link with DHSN and DHMO in vitro while methionine, with no free sulfhydryl groups, did not cross-link. Our results support the hypothesis that cysteine residues are a key characteristic of proteins that are cross-linked by PAs. The cross-links could have negative effects to the cell {{as in the case of}} binding actin or topoisomerase II to alter normal DNA processes and replication, or beneficial effects such as binding to electrophillic scavengers like GSH or metallothionine as a detoxifying mechanism. the nucleophiles we tested in vitro and found to form cross-links with DHSN and DHMO may help to explain the antimitotic carcinogenic, and anticarcinogenic effects of PAs...|$|E
