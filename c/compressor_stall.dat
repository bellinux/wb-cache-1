5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in <b>compressor</b> <b>stall</b> and complete loss of engine thrust. The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} both engines failed due to ice ingestion, {{which led to}} <b>compressor</b> <b>stall,</b> destruction of the compressors and over-temperature of the turbine blades. Citing significant damage to the aircraft and engines, the investigators were unable to determine where the ice came from.|$|E

50|$|As a result, the engine's <b>compressor</b> <b>stalled,</b> surged, and {{substantially}} lost thrust, {{leading the}} plane to stall.|$|R

2500|$|A V-22 {{experienced}} <b>compressor</b> <b>stalls</b> in {{its right}} engine {{in the middle}} of its first transatlantic flight to the United Kingdom for the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough Airshow on 11 July 2006. [...] It had to be diverted to Iceland for maintenance. A week later it was announced that other V-22s had been having <b>compressor</b> surges and <b>stalls,</b> and the Navy launched an investigation into it.|$|R
25|$|In this situation, {{the surge}} {{can raise the}} {{pressure}} of the air to a level that can cause damage. This is because if the pressure rises high enough, a <b>compressor</b> <b>stall</b> occurs—stored pressurized air decompresses backward across the impeller and out the inlet. The reverse flow back across the turbocharger makes the turbine shaft reduce in speed more quickly than it would naturally, possibly damaging the turbocharger.|$|E
25|$|Garrison {{worked closely}} with the project after one of the test {{aircraft}} was lost in combat on January 25 because its engine experienced <b>compressor</b> <b>stall</b> from ingesting the cannons' propellent gases. He regularly flew GunVal Sabres on missions before the testing ended on May 1, and despite firing limitations imposed by the stall risk, scored a MiG victory in a cannon-equipped F-86F, near Sui-ho Reservoir on March 26.|$|E
25|$|According to Mason, the {{controls}} of the Vampire {{were considered to be}} relatively light and sensitive, employing an effective elevator arrangement that enabled generous acceleration from relatively little control inputs along with highly balanced ailerons that could achieve high rates of roll. In comparison to the elevator and ailerons, the rudder required more vigorous actuation in order to achieve meaningful effect. Pilots converting from piston-engined types would find themselves having to adapt to the slower acceleration of turbojet engines and the corresponding need to moderate rapid throttle movements to avoid instigating a <b>compressor</b> <b>stall.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe <b>compressor</b> <b>stalls.</b> Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the <b>compressor</b> <b>stalls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{appropriate}} response to <b>compressor</b> <b>stalls</b> {{varies according to}} the engine type and situation, but usually consists of immediately and steadily decreasing thrust on the affected engine. While modern engines with advanced control units can avoid many causes of stall, jet aircraft pilots must continue to take this into account when dropping airspeed or increasing throttle.|$|R
25|$|The W.2B/23C engines {{upon which}} the Welland was based {{produced}} 1,700lbf (7.58kN) of thrust each, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of 417mph (670km/h) at 3,000m {{and a range of}} 1,006miles (1,610km). It incorporated a hydraulically driven engine starter developed by Rolls-Royce, which was automated following the press of a starter button in the cockpit. The engines also drove hydraulic and vacuum pumps as well as a generator via a Rotol gearbox fixed on the forward wing spar; the cockpit was also heated by bleed air from one of the engines. The acceleration rate of the engines was manually controlled by the pilot; rapid engine acceleration would frequently induce <b>compressor</b> <b>stalls</b> early on; the likelihood of <b>compressor</b> <b>stalls</b> was effectively eliminated upon further design refinements of both the Welland engine and the Meteor itself. At high speeds, the Meteor had a tendency to lose directional stability, often during unfavourable weather conditions, leading to a 'snaking' motion; this could be easily resolved by throttling back to reduce speed.|$|R
25|$|The airfoil {{profiles}} are optimized and matched {{for specific}} velocities and turning. Although compressors can be run at other conditions with different flows, speeds, or pressure ratios, this {{can result in}} an efficiency penalty or even a partial or complete breakdown in flow (known as <b>compressor</b> <b>stall</b> and pressure surge respectively). Thus, a practical limit {{on the number of}} stages, and the overall pressure ratio, comes from the interaction of the different stages when required to work away from the design conditions. These “off-design” conditions can be mitigated to a certain extent by providing some flexibility in the compressor. This is achieved normally through the use of adjustable stators or with valves that can bleed fluid from the main flow between stages (inter-stage bleed).|$|E
25|$|During the Vietnam War, the CH-46 {{was one of}} {{the prime}} US troop {{transport}} helicopters in the theatre, slotting between the smaller Bell UH-1 Iroquois and larger Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion. During the 1972 Easter Offensive, Sea Knights saw heavy use to convey US and South Vietnamese ground forces to and around the front lines. CH-46 operations were plagued by major technical problems; the engines, being prone to foreign object damage (FOD) from debris being ingested when hovering close to the ground and subsequently suffering a <b>compressor</b> <b>stall,</b> had a lifespan as low as 85 flight hours; on 21 July 1966, all CH-46s were grounded until more efficient filters had been fitted. By the end of US military operations in Vietnam, over a hundred Sea Knights had been lost to enemy fire.|$|E
25|$|The Me 262 was {{difficult}} to counter because its high speed and rate of climb {{made it hard to}} intercept. However, as with other turbojet engines at the time, the Me 262's engines did not provide sufficient thrust at low air speeds and throttle response was slow, meaning in certain circumstances such as takeoff and landing, the aircraft became a vulnerable target. Another disadvantage that pioneering jet aircraft of the World War II era shared, was the high risk of <b>compressor</b> <b>stall</b> and if throttle movements were too rapid, the engine(s) could suffer a flame out. The coarse opening of the throttle would cause fuel surging and lead to excessive jet pipe temperatures. Pilots were instructed to operate the throttle gently and avoid quick changes. German engineers introduced an automatic throttle regulator later in the war but it only partly alleviated the problem.|$|E

50|$|The Grumman F-14 Tomcat {{with the}} TF30-P-414A was underpowered, {{because it was}} the Navy's intent to procure a jet fighter with a thrust-to-weight ratio (in clean configuration) of unity or better (the US Air Force had the same goals for the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon). However, due to the intent to {{incorporate}} as many of the systems of the failed Navy version of the F-111, the F-111B, into the project, it was deemed that the initial production run of F-14s utilize the F-111B's powerplant. The F-14A's thrust-to-weight ratio was similar to the F-4 Phantom II; however the new fuselage and wing design provided greater lift and a better climb profile than the F-4. The TF30 was found to be ill-adapted to the demands of air combat and was prone to <b>compressor</b> <b>stalls</b> at high angle of attack (AOA) if the throttles were moved aggressively. Because of the Tomcat's widely spaced engine nacelles, <b>compressor</b> <b>stalls</b> at high AOA were especially dangerous because they tended to produce asymmetric thrust that could send the Tomcat into an upright or inverted spin, from which recovery was very difficult.|$|R
25|$|Due to a fan {{designed}} to smooth airflow before {{it enters the}} compressor, the F404 has high resistance to <b>compressor</b> <b>stalls,</b> even at high angles of attack. It requires less than two shop visits per 1,000 flight hours and averages 6,500 hours between in-flight events. It also demonstrates high responsiveness to control inputs, spooling from idle to full afterburner in 4 seconds. The engine contains an in-flight engine condition monitoring system (IECMS) that monitors for critical malfunctions and keeps track of parts lifetimes.|$|R
25|$|The two 117 engines {{incorporate}} thrust vectoring (TVC) nozzles whose rotational axes {{are each}} canted at an angle, {{similar to the}} nozzle arrangement of the Su-35S. This configuration allows the aircraft to produce thrust vectoring moments about all three rotational axes, pitch, yaw and roll. Thrust vectoring nozzles themselves operate in only one plane; the canting allows the aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently. The engine inlet incorporates variable intake ramps for increased supersonic efficiency and retractable mesh screens to prevent foreign object debris being ingested that would cause engine damage. The 117 engine is to also incorporate infrared and RCS reduction measures. In 2014, the Indian Air Force openly expressed concerns over the reliability and performance of the 117 engines; during the 2011 Moscow Air Show, a T-50 suffered a <b>compressor</b> <b>stall</b> that forced the aircraft to abort takeoff.|$|E

40|$|Results of a {{high-speed}} 10 -stage axial-flow compressor test involving overall compressor and individual stage performance while stalling and operating in quasi-steady rotating stall are described. Test procedures and data acquisition {{methods used to}} obtain the dynamic stalling and quasi-steady in-stall data are explained. Unstalled and in-stall time-averaged data obtained from the compressor operating at five different shaft speeds and one off-schedule variable vane condition are presented. The effects of compressor speed and variable geometry on overall compressor in-stall pressure rise and hysteresis extent are illustrated {{through the use of}} quasi-steady stage temperature rise and pressure rise characteristics. The results indicate that individual stage performance during overall <b>compressor</b> rotating <b>stall</b> operation varies considerably throughout the length of the compressor. Time-resolved in-stall data acquired at two different shaft speeds are presented in support of the notion that stage operation varies significantly from entrance to exit of the compressor. Both time-averaged and time-resolved individual stage results suggest that stage matching is important, not only for unstalled performance but also for in-stall performance and recoverability from stall;The measured high-speed 10 -stage test compressor individual stage pressure and temperature characteristics were input into a stage-by-stage dynamic compressor performance model. The analytical model had been previously validated for the prediction of low-speed <b>compressor</b> <b>stalling</b> and in-stall performance. Dynamic pressures measured during stalling of the high-speed 10 -stage test compressor are compared with analytical model results. The comparison of the model results and the measured pressures provided the additional validation necessary to demonstrate the model 2 ̆ 7 s ability to predict high-speed multistage <b>compressor</b> <b>stalling</b> and in-stall performance...|$|R
