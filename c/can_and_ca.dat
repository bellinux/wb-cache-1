40|$|ABSTRACTIntramuscular fat (IMF) {{content in}} {{chickens}} significantly contributes to meat quality. The main {{objective of this}} study was to assess the expression of calcineurin (<b>CaN)</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) in lipogenesis in chicken muscle. Chickens were slaughtered and sampled at 4, 8, and 16 weeks of age. IMF content and the expression of CaN subunits and CaMK isoforms were measured in the thigh muscle tissue. The results showed that the IMF contents were greater at 16 weeks compared with those at 4 and 8 weeks (p< 0. 05). Transcription of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and fatty acid translocase CD 36 (FAT/CD 36) mRNA significantly increased with age, from four to 16 weeks (p< 0. 05). The mRNA levels of CaNB and CaMK IV were significantly lower at 16 weeks than at four weeks (p< 0. 05), but CaMK II mRNA levels were significantly higher than at four weeks (p< 0. 05). In order to evaluate the role of CaMK and CaN in adipogenesis, SV cells were incubated in standard adipogenic medium for 24 h and treated with specific inhibitor of CaMK and CaN. The expressions of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein b (C/EBPb, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP 1),and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor g (PPAR&# 947;) were dramatically enhanced by the CsA, CaN inhibitor (p< 0. 05). KN 93, CaMK II inhibitor, dramatically repressed the expression of those lipogenic gene (p< 0. 05). These results indicated that CaN and CaMK had different effects on adipogenesis in the muscle of chickens...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{composite}} multiphysics model of excitation-contraction coupling for a rat ventricular myocyte under voltage clamp (VC) conditions to: (1) probe mechanisms underlying {{the response to}} Ca 2 +-perturbation; (2) investigate the factors influencing its electromechanical response; and (3) examine its rate-dependent behavior (particularly the force-frequency response (FFR)). Motivation for {{the study was to}} pinpoint key control variables influencing calcium-induced calcium-release (CICR) and examine its role {{in the context of a}} physiological control system regulating cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration and hence the cardiac contractile response. Our cell model consists of an electrical-equivalent model for the cell membrane and a fluid-compartment model describing the flux of ionic species between the extracellular and several intracellular compartments. The model incorporates frequency-dependent calmodulin (CaM) mediated spatially heterogenous interaction of calcineurin (<b>CaN)</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMKII) with their principal targets and accounts for rate-dependent, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -mediated up-regulation. We also incorporate a biophysical model for cardiac contractile mechanics to study the factors influencing force response. The model reproduces measured VC data published by several laboratories, and generates graded Ca 2 +-release with high Ca 2 + gain by achieving negative feedback control and Ca 2 +-homeostasis. We examine the dependence of cellular contractile response on: (1) the amount of activator Ca 2 + available; (2) the type of mechanical load applied; (3) temperature (22 to 38 ºC); and (4) myofilament Ca 2 + sensitivity. We demonstrate contraction-relaxation coupling over a wide range of physiological perturbations. Our model reproduces positive peak FFR observed in rat ventricular myocytes and provides quantitative insight into the underlying rate-dependence of CICR. The role of Ca 2 + regulating mechanisms are examined in handling induced Ca 2 +-perturbations using a rigorous cellular Ca 2 + balance. Extensive testing of the composite model elucidates the importance of various direct and indirect modulatory influences on the cellular twitch-response with wide agreement with measured data on all accounts. We identify cAMP-mediated stimulation, and rate-dependent CaMKII-mediated up-regulation of Ca 2 +-trigger current (ICaL) as the key mechanisms underlying the aforementioned positive FFR. Our model provides biophysically-based explanations of phenomena associated with CICR and provides mechanistic insights into whole-cell responses to a wide variety of testing approaches used in studies of cardiac myofilament contractility...|$|E

40|$|The {{dendrites}} of mammalian pyramidal neurons {{contain a}} rich collection of active conductances that <b>can</b> support Na+ <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + action potentials (for a review see ref. 1). The presence, site of initiation, {{and direction of}} propagation of Na+ <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + action potentials are, however, controversial, and seem {{to be sensitive to}} resting membrane potential, ionic composition, and degree of channel inactivation, and depend on the intensity and pattern of synaptic stimulation. This makes it difficult to extrapolate from in vitro experiments to the situation in the intact brain. Here we show that two-photon excitation laser scanning microscopy can penetrate the highly scattering tissue of the intact brain. We used this property to measure sensory stimulus-induced dendritic [Ca 2 +] dynamics of layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons of the rat primary vibrissa (Sm 1) cortex in vivo. Simultaneous recordings of intracellular voltage and dendritic [Ca 2 +] dynamics during whisker stimulation or current injection showed increases in [Ca 2 +] only in coincidence with Na+ action potentials. The amplitude of these [Ca 2 +] transients at a given location was approximately proportional to the number of Na+ action potentials in a short burst. The amplitude for a given number of action potentials was greatest in the proximal apical dendrite and declined steeply with increasing distance from the soma, with little Ca 2 + accumulation in the most distal branches, in layer 1. This suggests that widespread Ca 2 + action potentials were not generated, and any significant [Ca 2 +] increase depends on somatically triggered Na+ action potentials...|$|R

40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether clinical evaluation and duplex ultrasonography (DUS) alone can replace contrast cerebral arteriography (CA) for the detection of patients suitable for surgery at our institution. Methods. During an 18 -month period, 100 patients underwent DUS <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> during evaluation forcarotid endarterectomy (CEA). All patients were studied prospectively; in each case an initial decision for or against CEA on the basis of DUS evaluation of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) was subsequently compared with the surgeon’s final management plan after CA. Of the 200 ICAs evaluated, 113 were considered for CEA but 14 were excluded from the study because the patient could not be evaluated before <b>and</b> after <b>CA.</b> This left 99 ICAs (86 patients) available for comparative analysis. Results. The outcome of the 2 diagnostic modalities was perfectly consistent in 95. 3 % of the ICAs (κ = 0. 969). The clinical management decision was altered by the CA findings in only 2 cases (2 %). Of the 99 ICAs considered suitable, 97 underwent CEA. No arteriographic complications occurred among the 100 patients undergoing CA. The perioperative stroke risk and mortality rates were 0 %. Conclusions. Ninety-eight percent of the ICAs considered for surgery would have received appropriate clinical treatment on the strength of the patients’ neurologic history and the outcome of DUS alone. Our results indicate that DUS is sufficient to establish the need for surgery in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients being considered for CEA <b>and</b> <b>can</b> replace <b>CA</b> in most clinical circumstances...|$|R

Methods: A total of 70 patients with breast cancer were selected and randomly divided into observation group and control group. Control group was conducted with conventional radical mastectomy but didn’t receive the chemotherapy intervention, while observation group was first given neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CAF regimen) : intravenous injection of 500 mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide and 500 mg/m 2 5 -fluorouracil on d 1 and d 8, intravenous injection of 30 mg/m 2 adriamycin on d 1, 21 d as one cycle, 2 cycles in total. The efficacy of two groups was evaluated after treatment. The levels of TSGF, <b>CA</b> 153, <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> 125 of two groups before, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after treatment were compared. And the correlation between TSGF <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> 125, TSGF <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> 153, <b>CA</b> 125 <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> 153 was analyzed. Results: The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were higher in observation group (68. 6 % and 88. 6 %) than control group (42. 6 % and 72. 3 %), but only with the statistical difference in ORR between two groups (P< 0. 05). The levels of TSGF, <b>CA</b> 153 <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> 125 all decreased significantly in both groups after treatment compared with pretreatment, and observation group receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery decreased more significantly than control group after treatment (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Some {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that earth alkali metals promote agglomeration: however, others have shown that they inhibit the generation of agglomeration. The earth alkali metals (Mg <b>and</b> <b>Ca)</b> may cause both inhibition and promotion of agglomeration/defluidization. Therefore, this study focuses on the effect of Mg, <b>Ca</b> <b>and</b> the operating temperature on the agglomeration/defluidization of sodium during incineration in a fluidized bed reactor. The results indicate that the added Mg <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> inhibit agglomeration <b>and</b> increase the defluidization time. At low Na/Mg and Na/Ca mole ratios, Mg <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> inhibit defluidization significantly. However, the inhibition reduces as the concentration of Na increases. When the mole ratio (Na/Mg and Na/Ca) exceeds two, the inhibition of Mg <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> is not apparent. Under these conditions, the operation temperature is the main factor with regard to agglomeration/defluidization. When Mg <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> are added to reduce the agglomeration/defluidization. both the concentration of Na and operating temperature must be considered.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The diterpenoids carnosol (CS) <b>and</b> carnosic acid (<b>CA)</b> from Salvia spp. exert {{prominent}} anti-inflammatory activities {{but their}} molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Here we investigated {{the effectiveness of}} CS <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> in inflammatory pain and the cellular interference with their putative molecular targets. Experimental Approach: The effects of CS <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> in different models of inflammatory pain were investigated. The inhibition of key enzymes in eicosanoid biosynthesis, namely microsomal prostaglandin E 2 synthase- 1 (mPGES- 1) and 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO) was confirmed by CS <b>and</b> <b>CA,</b> <b>and</b> we determined the consequence on the eicosanoid network in activated human primary monocytes and neutrophils. Molecular interactions and binding modes of CS <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> to target enzymes were analyzed by docking studies. Key Results: CS <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> displayed significant <b>and</b> dose-dependent anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects in carrageenan-induced mouse hyperalgesia 4 h post injection of the stimuli, and also inhibited the analgesic response in the late phase of the formalin test. Moreover, both compounds potently inhibited cell-free mPGES- 1 and 5 -LO activity and preferentially suppressed the formation of mPGES- 1 and 5 -LO-derived products in cellular studies. Our in silico analysis for mPGES- 1 and 5 -LO supports that CS <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> are dual 5 -LO/mPGES- 1 inhibitors. Conclusion and Implications: In summary, we propose that the combined inhibition of mPGES- 1 and 5 -LO by CS <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> essentially contributes to the bioactivity of these diterpenoids. Our findings {{pave the way for}} a rational use of Salvia spp., traditionally used as anti-inflammatory remedy, in the continuous expanding context of nutraceuticals...|$|R

Results J'aw NO was not correlated with <b>CA</b> NO, <b>and</b> thus asthmatic subjects were grouped into four eNO categories based on upper limit thresholds of non-asthmatics for J'aw NO (≥ 1. 5 nl/s) <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> NO (≥ 2. 3 ppb) : Type I (normal J'aw NO <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> NO), Type II (elevated J'aw NO <b>and</b> normal <b>CA</b> NO), Type III (elevated J'aw NO <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> NO) <b>and</b> Type IV (normal J'aw NO <b>and</b> elevated <b>CA</b> NO). The rate of inhaled corticosteroid use (lowest in Type III) and atopy (highest in Type II) varied significantly amongst the categories influencing J'aw NO, but {{was not related to}} CA NO, asthma control or morbidity. All categories demonstrated normal to near-normal baseline spirometry; however, only eNO categories with increased <b>CA</b> NO (III <b>and</b> IV) had significantly worse asthma control and morbidity when compared to categories I and II. Conclusions J'aw NO <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> NO reveal inflammatory categories in children with asthma that have distinct clinical features including sensitivity to inhaled corticosteroids and atopy. Only categories with increase CA NO were related to poor asthma control and morbidity independent of baseline spirometry, bronchodilator response, atopic status, or use of inhaled corticosteroids. </p...|$|R
40|$|Homogenates of mouse liver with {{isotonic}} sucrose solution {{were separated}} by the cell fractionation with repeating centrifugation. The supernatants {{were used for the}} inhibition test with the reagents such as 3, 5 diiodosalicylic acid lithium salt (LIS), guanidine and azide, heat, acid and alkali. After various treatments, the remaining catalase activities were measured and showed as a relative enzyme activity. Stability of catalase in liver supernatants was compared normal (C 3 H/C(as) <b>C(as))</b> <b>and</b> mutant mice which were designated acatalasemia (C 3 H/C(bs) C(bs)), hypocatalasemia (C 3 H/C(cs) C(cs)) and acatalasemic heterozygote (C 3 H/C(as) C(bs)). In both treatments of LIS and guanidine, catalase of C(as) C(as) was most stable, C(bs) C(bs) were unstable, and catalase of C(cs) C(cs) <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs) showed midle stability between the stability of <b>C(as)</b> <b>C(as)</b> <b>and</b> C(bs) C(bs) in this order. On the contrary in azide treatment within the range from O to 1 mM azide, C(bs) C(bs) was most stable, <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> <b>C(as),</b> C(cs) C(cs) <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs) were unstable in this order, but more than 1 mM azide, C(cs) C(cs), <b>C(as)</b> <b>C(as)</b> <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs) were unstable in this order. After incubation at various temperatures changing from 30 ℃ to 60 ℃ for 10 min, C(as) C(as) was most stable, <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs), C(cs) C(cs) and C(bs) C(bs) were unstable in this order. After acid and alkali treatments in the range of pH 5. 5 to 9. 0, relative activities of C(cs) C(cs) <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs) were similar to that of C(as) C(as), but C(bs) C(bs) was less stable than C(as) <b>C(as),</b> C(cs) C(cs) <b>and</b> <b>C(as)</b> C(bs) in the same range. It is considered that the structure of catalase molecule in the liver is different between normal, mutant mice and heterozigote of normal and mutant mice with regard to the difference of the stability to LIS, guanidine, azide, heat, acid and alkali treatments...|$|R
40|$|Hydroquinone (HQ) <b>and</b> {{catechol}} (<b>CA)</b> are two positional isomers of dihydroxybenzene. They usually coexist {{in environmental}} samples and bring about pollution {{in our living}} environment. This research has developed a cheap, sensitive, and rapid method for the electrochemical determination of HQ <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> in aqueous pH 6. 0 buffer solution without previous separation. By employing both anodically pretreated screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE*) and square wave voltammetric techniques, a direct and simultaneous determination of the two positional isomers was achieved. The oxidation peak potentials for HQ <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> were completely separated at the SPCE*, exhibiting well-defined and quasi-reversible redox peaks and showing greatly enhanced activity. Under optimized conditions, the linear calibration ranges for HQ <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> were in the ranges of 0. 1 - 50 and 0. 1 - 70 µM, with detection limits (S/N = 3) of 0. 05 and 0. 05 µM, respectively. This method {{was applied to the}} direct determination of HQ <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> in river water with satisfactory recovery results...|$|R

40|$|Background Despite being {{extensively}} {{studied in}} adults, investigation of worry and it's associated cognitive variables remains {{in its infancy}} in paediatric samples. Aims This study aimed to investigate 1) whether the child cognitive variables of intolerance of uncertainty (IU), positive beliefs about worry (PBW), negative beliefs about worry (NBW), negative problem orientation (NPO) <b>and</b> cognitive avoidance (<b>CA)</b> were associated with child worry, 2) whether parental worry and cognitive variables were associated with child worry, 3) whether the relationship between child and parent worry was mediated by child cognitive variables and 4) whether the relationships between specific parent cognitive factors and child worry were mediated by specific child cognitive factors. Method Participants were 114 children plus one of their parents. Parents and children completed questionnaires assessing {{each of the five}} cognitive variables and worry. Results When examined together, child NBW <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> significantly predicted child worry. Parent worry, IU <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> were significantly <b>and</b> positively related to child worry. The relationship between parent worry and child worry was mediated by child NBW <b>and</b> <b>CA.</b> The relationship between parent IU, NPO <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> <b>and</b> child worry was mediated by child IU, NPO <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> respectively. Conclusions Child NBW <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> may be particularly important to child worry and may represent potential treatment targets. Parental worry and cognitive variables {{may play a role in}} the development and / or maintenance of child worry. Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyNo Full Tex...|$|R
