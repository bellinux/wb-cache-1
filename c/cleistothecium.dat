5000|$|Powdery mildew fungi {{reproduce}} both sexually and asexually. Sexual {{reproduction is}} via chasmothecia (formerly <b>cleistothecium),</b> {{a type of}} ascocarp.

50|$|Powdery mildew is a {{polycyclic}} disease (one {{which produces}} a secondary inoculum) that initially infects the leaf surface with primary inoculum, which is conidia from mycelium, or secondary inoculum, {{which is an}} overwintering structure called a <b>cleistothecium.</b> When the disease begins to develop, {{it looks like a}} white powdery substance.|$|E
50|$|The disease {{cycle of}} rose powdery mildew starts when the sexual spores, ascospores, of the {{pathogen}} survive {{the winter in}} a structure composed of hyphae called an ascocarp. The specific ascocarp is a chasmothecium, or <b>cleistothecium,</b> and has a circular shape to it. Under the right conditions the chasmothecium will break open to reveal the asci, which is another long tube-like structure which contain the ascospores. These ascospores are then released and spread by wind, insects, and rain until they land on a susceptible rose for a host and land, attach, and germinate on the plant. They will also produce condia, the asexual spores of Podosphaera pannosa, which will spread throughout the summer. It is these long chains of white conidia which give the fungi its characteristic “powdery” appearance. Late in the year as the plant is dying cleistothecia will again form when the ascogonium receives the nucleus from the antheridium.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cleistothecium</b> is a globose, {{completely}} closed {{fruit body}} with no special {{opening to the}} outside. The ascomatal wall is called peridium and typically consists of densely interwoven hyphae or pseudoparenchyma cells. It may be covered with hyphal outgrowth called appendages. The asci are globose, deliquescent, and scattered throughout the interior cavity i.e. as in Eurotium or arising in tufts from the basal region of ascocarps as in Erysiphe. In this case the ascocarp is round with the hymenium enclosed, so the spores do not automatically get released, and fungi with cleistothecia have had to develop new strategies to disseminate their spores. The truffles, for instance, have solved this problem by attracting animals such as wild boars, which break open the tasty ascocarps and spread the spores over a wide area. Cleistothecia are found mostly in fungi that have little room available for their ascocarps, for instance those that live under tree bark, or underground like truffles.|$|E

In compatible parents, nuclear genomes and cytoplasm usually mix in the vegetative hyphae prior to the formation of the sexual stage after which any cleistothecial composition is possible. In incompatible parents, the maternal strain contributes the nuclei for the cleistothecial wall and one nucleus as well as mitochondria for the ascospore origin.

40|$|Abstract We have {{previously}} isolated ε-COP, the α-COP interactor in COPI of Aspergillus nidulans, by yeast two-hybrid screening. To understand {{the function of}} ε-COP, the aneA+ gene for ε-COP/AneA was deleted by homologous recombination using a gene-specific disruption cassette. Deletion of the ε-COP gene showed no detectable changes in vegetative growth or asexual development, but resulted in decrease {{in the production of}} the fruiting body, <b>cleistothecium,</b> under conditions favorable for sexual development. Unlike in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in A. nidulans, over-expression of ε-COP did not rescue the thermo-sensitive growth defect of the α-COP mutant at 42 oC.

40|$|Certain {{species of}} fungi {{of the genus}} Aspergillus produce a type of cells around the <b>cleistothecium</b> that are called hülle cells.

Hülle cells from this strain were allowed to grow on dialysis membranes, where it was possible to observe their nuclei. The material was fixed with Carnoy, hydrolyzed with HCl and stained with Giemsa. Several nuclei approximately equal in size to the nuclei of hyphae and conidia were observed during the phase of hülle cell formation. The formation of a macronucleus measuring approximately 3. 1 µm was observed in mature hülle cells. To compare the DNA amount, hülle cells and conidia of the CH- 89 strain were isolated and submitted to DNA extraction (Tuyl, 1977).

40|$|The major fungal {{pathogen}} of humans, Aspergillus fumigatus, lacks {{a defined}} sexual cycle, although {{the presence of}} genes encoding putative mating type idiomorphs and regulators of Aspergillus sexual development heightens the potential for cryptic sexuality in this deuteromycete. To test the functionality of these genetic determinants, we transferred the alpha box-encoding mat 1 - 1 idiomorph from an A. fumigatus isolate to the homothallic fertile species Aspergillus nidulans. Abundant formation of fruiting bodies (cleistothecia) containing viable ascospores establishes functionality of this mating type gene product in the transgenic strain. Using a similar approach, we also established that the conserved transcriptional regulator from A. fumigatus, the nsdD gene product, {{can act as a}} functional, positively acting factor for A. nidulans <b>cleistothecium</b> development; moreover, high-level expression of NsdD in the endogenous host A. fumigatus profoundly alters hyphal development by triggering the formation of coiled hyphae.

40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus (teleomorph: Neosartorya fumigata) {{was assumed to be}} absent or cryptic until recently, when fertile crosses among geographically restricted environ-mental isolates were described. Here, we provide evidence for mating, fruiting body development, and asco-sporogenesis accompanied by genetic recombination between unrelated, clinical isolates of A. fumigatus, and this evidence demonstrates the generality and reproducibility of this long-time-undisclosed phase in the life cycle of this heterothallic fungus. Successful mating requires the presence of both mating-type idiomorphs MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2, as does expression of genes encoding factors presumably involved in this process. Moreover, analysis of an A. fumigatus mutant deleted for the nsdD gene suggests a role of this conserved regulator of <b>cleistothecium</b> development in hyphal fusion and hence heterokaryon formation. For decades, aspergilli have served as model organisms in genetic studies, based on their multifaceted life cycle.

This transformant contains {{a very large number}} of plasmid copies integrated at a single site inseparable from the wA locus. Passage of this transformant through the sexual cycle generated a variety of novel phenotypes for L-proline utilization, the number and frequency of which depended upon the <b>cleistothecium</b> from which the progeny were obtained, suggesting that the altered phenotypes were due to premeiotic events. The most extreme phenotype was severe hypersensitivity to L-proline. Hypersensitive progeny had a much reduced number of integrated plasmid copies enabling us to identify and clone putative prn-wA fusion sequences and subsequently retrieve wA sequences from a wild-type gene library. One of the wild-type clones overlapped the different sites of the insertional mutations in two wA(-) transformants and complemented the wA 3 allele.

40|$|From General Introduction: Toward {{the last}} half of the nineteenth century, the {{structure}} and mode of development of the ascocarp has aroused much interest. De Bary (1887) recognised the fruiting bodies of the Ascomycetes as 'compound sporophores' made up of interwoven hyphae or of pseudoparenchyma consisting of a peripheral layer separate from an inner tissue. These fruiting bodies included the discocarp or apothecium, the pyrenocarp or perithecium and the cleistocarp or <b>cleistothecium.</b> The name, Pyrenomycetes, has been variously applied to a group of Ascomycetes but mainly to the perithecial types, inclusive of the true perithecia and the loculate forms. The perithecium itself was described as a 'cup-shaped discomycetous' sporocarp with margins incurved to form a pyriform structure (de Bary, 1887). The presence or absence of a stroma had been long considered as a basis for the separation of the major groups of the Ascomycetes. Separation on these grounds was found unacceptable as it grouped together clearly unrelated species or separated related ones. As the subdivisions of the pyrenomycetous Ascomycetes are dependent upon the morphological features of the ascocarp, it would be pertinent to discuss the following: a) The Stroma. b) The various forms of ascocarp which mayor may not be associated with such a stroma. i) Perithecia: free or immersed in a stroma. ii) Uni- or multiloculate stromata. c) The centrum, the details associated with the centrum and the use of these details in the taxonomy of the pyrenomycetes...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Fungi are {{increasing}} in incidence as human pathogens and newer and rarer species are continuously being encountered. Identifying these species from growth on regular culture media may be challenging {{due to the}} absence of typical features. An indigenous and cheap medium, similar to the natural substrate of these fungi, was standardised in our laboratory as an aid to species identification in a conventional laboratory setting. Materials and Methods: Ripe banana peel pieces, sterilised in an autoclave at 121 °C temperature and 15 lbs pressure for 15 min promoted good growth of hyphae and pycnidia or acervuli in coelomycetes, flabelliform and medusoid fruiting bodies of basidiomycetes and fruit bodies such as <b>cleistothecium</b> in ascomycetes. The growth from the primary isolation medium was taken and inoculated onto the pieces of double-autoclaved ripe banana peel pieces in a sterile glass Petri dish with some moisture (sprinkles of sterile distilled water). A few sterile coverslips were placed randomly inside the Petri dish for the growing fungus to stick on to it. The plates were kept at room temperature and left undisturbed for 15 – 20 days.

Results: Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Macrophomina phaseolina, Nigrospora sphaerica, Chaetomium murorum, Nattrassia mangiferae and Schizophyllum commune were identified by characteristic features from growth on banana peel culture.

Chapter 1 : Introduction The selection arena hypothesis {{states that}} overproduction of zygotes -a widespread phenomenon in animals and plants- {{could be explained}} {{as part of a}} quality control mechanism: An enlarged array of zygotes is created of which only a genetically superior subset will fully develop; zygotes with a low future fitness fail, while zygotes with a high future fitness thrive. In this way, parental energy for reproduction is invested in the most promising zygotes. This hypothesis further assumes that 1) zygotes are cheap to produce, 2) parental time, energy and/or risk are invested in the zygotes, 3) offspring vary in fitness, and 4) this fitness difference can be identified. In this introducing chapter, we review several examples which strongly suggest the operation of selection arenas in nature. Yet, although the idea of the selection arena is appealing and plausible, it has been difficult to actually demonstrate a mechanism of selection against low quality zygotes in favour of the production of higher quality ones. This thesis examines the selection arena hypothesis in the filamentous ascomycete fungus Aspergilus nidulans. This fungus may overproduce dikaryotic fruit initials, called dikaryons, like animals and plants may overproduce zygotes. Then, progeny choice might involve selection on which of these dikaryons will thrive to produce thousands of zygotes. These zygotes each produce eight sexual spores which together fill up one fruiting body, named <b>cleistothecium.</b> In this introducing chapter we explain that A. nidulans is highly suited to study the selection arena hypothesis as it fulfils the first three of the four conditions of the selection arena hypothesis. Moreover, the predicted result of the arena can be tested in this fungus, namely that dikaryotic fruit initials with a low future fitness fail, while dikaryotic fruit initials with a high future fitness thrive. Chapter 2 : The male and female role in fruiting body formation Only if a dikaryon passes the selection arena, it will eventually develop into a ripe fruiting body. However, t he initiation of a fruiting body and especially - in the case of outcrossing - the roles of the nuclei and mitochondria from the two parental strains in its formation have remained unclear. In chapter 2 we resolved these roles by analysing the genetic constituents of these fruiting bodies (called cleistothecia) from crosses between vegetatively compatible parents and from crosses between vegetatively incompatible parents. In compatible parents, nuclear genomes and cytoplasm usually mix in the vegetative hyphae prior to the formation of the sexual stage, after which any cleistothecial composition is possible. In incompatible parents, the maternal strain contributes the nuclei for the cleistothecial wall and one nucleus as well as mitochondria for the ascospore origin. The paternal strain donates one nucleus for the ascospore origin. Only in crosses between vegetatively incompatible partners, it is possible to assign a female and male role to the parental strains. Our results confirm that the vegetative heterokaryotic stage is not a prerequisite for <b>cleistothecium</b> formation. Chapter 3 - 5 : Testing the selection arena in Aspergillus nidulans In these chapters we tested the selection arena hypothesis in A. nidulans with emphasis on the predicted outcome, namely that dikaryons with a low future fitness would fail, while dikaryons with a high future fitness would thrive. We reformulated this into a testable prediction for this mycelial fungus: Nuclei with deleterious mutations will not be transmitted via the sexual route, or at least less easily than via the asexual route. In chapter 3, we analysed 2 mitochondrial and 15 auxotrophic mutations for consequences on sexual and asexual reproduction. We found that many of these mutations confer sexual self-sterility as pleiotropic effect under conditions of normal asexual spore production: fruiting bodies were very tiny and contained hardly any ascospores. This confirms an important prediction of the selection arena, namely that dikaryons carrying a (slightly) deleterious mutation are not able to proliferate and produce sexual spores. So, no reproductive energy is invested in sexual spores carrying deleterious mutations, while asexual spore production is unaffected. Note that asexual and sexual spores would have carried the same genotype. Although self-sterility has been previously reported for a few mutations, these results have never been discussed as a manifestation of a selection arena. In chapter 4 we tested the selection arena theory using a different approach. We exploited the coexistence of asexual and sexual reproduction in A. nidulans, especially in cases of sexual self-fertilisation, where offspring from the sexual and asexual pathway have the same genotype. The selection arena hypothesis predicts that nuclei with deleterious mutations will not be transmitted via the sexual route, or at least less easily than via the asexual route. This implies t hen that the sexual spores - produced by selfing - will have a higher average fitness than the asexual spores with the same genotype. To investigate this, we started a mutation accumulation experiment with 40 asexual and 40 sexual selfing lines, all derived from one single ancestral strain of A. nidulans. In these lines, mutations were allowed to accumulate during 40 generations by single-spore transfer of respectively asexual and sexual spores. After 40 generations of mutation accumulation, the fitness of each line was estimated relative to that of the founder. Fitness was estimated by measuring the colony diameter grown in a fixed time period (RCD = relative colony diameter). The results show that mutations accumulate in both groups, but, in accordance with the selection arena hypothesis, with a significantly lower 'fitness impact' in the sexual lines than in the asexual lines. We argue that genetic recombination can be excluded as an explanation for this result. In chapter 5 we estimated the fitness of the mutation accumulation lines using a different measure, namely asexual spore production under competitive conditions (W ij). Such competition is harsh and provides a condition that likely amplifies potential differences in fitness between mutation accumulation lines and the ancestor. However, we did not find such a result. Instead, we found that the two fitness measures RCD (relative colony diameter) and W ij (asexual spore production under competitive conditions) were uncorrelated. This appeared to be due to an 'ultra-sexual' phenotype in {{more than half of the}} sexual lines: these lines produced many sexual spores at the expense of asexual spores. The 'ultra-sexual' phenotype must have been caused by the experimental history in the mutation accumulation procedure and made the fitness estimate W ij based on asexual spore production problematic. We discuss difficulties in fitness estimation in modular organism in general, especially when they produce progeny (spores) via both a sexual and an asexual pathway. Chapter 6 : Summary and discussion In this chapter we summarize the findings of this thesis. Furthermore, we speculate about the actual mechanism of the selection arena. The generality of the selection arena mechanism is discussed as well as directions for future research...|$|E
