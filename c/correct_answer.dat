5|$|A {{drawing method}} found by Kazimierz Zarankiewicz has been conjectured {{to give the}} <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> for every {{complete}} bipartite graph, and the statement that this is true {{has come to be}} known as the Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture. The conjecture remains open, with only some special cases solved.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} choice section is scored {{immediately after the}} exam by computer. One point is awarded for each <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> no points are credited or deducted for unanswered questions, and points are no longer deducted for having an incorrect answer.|$|E
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
30|$|The {{questionnaire}} had 14 items {{related to}} knowledge of prostate cancer. The level of knowledge was categorised as low (0 – 4), moderate (5 – 9) or high (10 +), based on {{the total number of}} <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> A score of zero to four <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> was regarded as a low level of knowledge, five to nine <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> as a moderate level of knowledge, and ten or more <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> as a high level of knowledge.|$|R
30|$|Table 10 {{indicates}} a tendency that the MI <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> {{appear in the}} good-rated question items {{more than in the}} bad-rated items, while it {{indicates a}}n opposite tendency for MD <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> Note that the MI options are favourable for the <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> This means that the result of the ICRP analysis based on the test taker responses (evaluation 1) is consistent with the judgement by the human experts (evaluation 2).|$|R
50|$|In round one, <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> to {{the cash}} {{question}} are worth £100. In round two, with fewer categories left to choose from, <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> are worth £300, whilst in round three they are worth £601.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} round, the contestants {{are asked to}} predict the most popular answer to each of three {{question}}s. Each question has three multiple choice options, and was asked {{to a group of}} 100 men. The panel is allowed to offer their opinion on the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> while the contestants submit their answers on their tablet computers. Each correct prediction is worth $200.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the bout, the {{contestant}} {{with the}} higher score wins and either retains the Money Chair or replaces its current occupant. If the bout ends in a tie score, a tiebreaker question is asked; the contestant who locks in the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> first is the winner. If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a question is in play when the clock runs out, it is completed under the normal rules.|$|E
5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E
5000|$|Triple Threat {{questions}}: Triple Threat {{questions have}} three <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> The contestant had {{to provide all}} three <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> (incorrect guesses are allowed) within a ten-second time limit to earn $3,000. Running out of time resulted in a wrong.|$|R
30|$|Assessing a CBCT {{increased}} {{the percentage of}} <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> after OPG assessment, both for OS and ORTH. When given a printed 3 D model after CBCT, an additional increase in <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> could be observed for ORTH, but not for OS (Fig.  2 versus Fig.  1).|$|R

5|$|The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), {{also known}} as the Baby, was {{designed}} as a test-bed for the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory, rather than as a practical computer. Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> of 131,072.|$|E
5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a {{category}} is revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> earns the respective team 100 points; an incorrect answer loses 100 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must {{wait until after the}} host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.|$|E
5|$|The SSEM had a 32-bit {{word length}} and {{a memory of}} 32words (1 kilobit). As it was {{designed}} to be the simplest possible stored-program computer, the only arithmetic operations implemented in hardware were subtraction and negation; other arithmetic operations were implemented in software. The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), a calculation that was known would {{take a long time to}} run—and so prove the computer's reliability—by testing every integer from 218−1 downwards, as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor. The program consisted of 17instructions and ran for 52minutes before reaching the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> of 131,072, after the SSEM had performed 3.5million operations (for an effective CPU speed of 1.1 kIPS).|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} 30 episodes, if a team got seven <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> they would double their {{money from the}} main game; if they got ten correct, the main-game {{winnings}} were tripled. For the following 35 episodes, the requirements were reduced to only five and seven <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> respectively.|$|R

5000|$|During the game, <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> {{would be}} {{replaced}} by a golden star on a black circle, where as [...] "wipeouts" [...] (wrong answers) {{would be replaced}} by the blue and yellow Wipeout [...] "W" [...] (in the Monkhouse version, green ticks were used for <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> and red Xs for wipeouts).|$|R
5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the bonus}} round begins, the winning {{contestant}} chooses {{one of three}} categories {{for his or her}} puzzle (prior to season 35, the puzzle and category were predetermined). After doing so, the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize. He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed. The contestant provides three more consonants (four if he/she is holding the Wild Card) and one more vowel, then has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle after his or her other letters (if any) are revealed. The contestant may make as many guesses as necessary, so long as the contestant begins the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> before time expires. Whether or not the contestant solves the puzzle, the host opens the envelope {{at the end of the}} round to reveal the prize at stake. Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts (with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000), a vehicle (or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams), and a top prize of $100,000.|$|E
5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to the opponents. However, the team could dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents could double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control was challenged to a double dare, they had to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25.|$|E
50|$|During the course, {{theoretical}} evaluations must amount 70% of <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of this game is available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|E

50|$|The {{person with}} the fewest <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> is then {{expelled}} from the show. In most series this process continues until only two contestants and the Mole remain. The winner is the {{person with the}} most <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in the final test and he or she gets all of the money earned during the previous stages of the game.|$|R
5000|$|In round three, all <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> to {{questions}} were worth 30 points. The first letter of each answer {{was a letter}} in that day's [...] "Inspiration Word" [...] (the number of letters varied per episode). Giving <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> allowed players to solve the word. Solving the word scored an additional 100 points and ended the game.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to use {{systematic}} teaching in a clinical setting using software to teach reading and writing in one boy with learning difficulties and obtain accurate performance in dictation. In the pre-test, the student showed good performance in matching-to-sample tasks (96 % in matching printed words to dictated words; 88 % in matching pictures to dictated words), although he obtained a low percentage of <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in the dictation of constructed responses (52 %) and manuscripts (24 %). The teaching strengthened the selection of printed words matched to dictated words and copying words. The student obtained 100 % <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in the teaching tasks. In post-tests of dictation, he obtained 100 % <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in constructed response and 96 % <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in manuscripts. The results indicate that carefully teaching copying may promote accuracy in the performance of responding to minimal units in dictation tasks...|$|R

50|$|The object for {{the first}} team was to get five <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> as quickly as possible. The game clock counted up to 99 seconds or until the team {{achieved}} five <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> whichever happened first. The opposing team then attempted either to score five <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in less time or to score more <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> than the first team in 99 seconds, {{in order to win}} the round. If they failed, the first team won the round. The team winning the round scored points. The first team to accumulate at least 1,500 points won the game. Play continued for up to four rounds, with each team alternating first-play honors. The point award to the winning team of a round escalated from 250 points for round one, to 500 points for round two, 750 points for round three, and 1,250 points for round four (if necessary).|$|R
5|$|The {{third round}} {{consists}} of two questions. In season 1, the first required the team to rank three answers in a stated order and started with a value of $15,000. The second had an opening value of $25,000 and {{any or all of}} the answers could have been correct; the contestants had select all <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> and only the <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in order to get credit. Starting in season 2, the $15,000 question has two or all three <b>answers</b> being <b>correct,</b> and the team must select all of the <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> and only the correct answers; the $25,000 question requires the team to rank the three <b>answers</b> in the <b>correct</b> order.|$|R
40|$|Quality {{assurance}} {{remains a}} key topic in human computation research. Prior work indicates that independent agreement is effective for low difficulty tasks, but performs poorly for moderately difficult tasks since {{the majority of}} responses may be inaccurate. We present experimental results showing that humans are better at identifying <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> than producing <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in such moderately difficult tasks. This motivates us to propose a simple quality control process based on tournament selection. We demonstrate that tournament selection repeatably finds the <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in as few as 3 to 5 rounds. We also compare {{the efficiency of the}} tournament selection method and elimination selection method. ...|$|R
