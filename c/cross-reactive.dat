Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is <b>cross-reactive</b> with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E

25|$|There {{appears to}} be an {{association}} of autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis (ARA) both with GSE and gluten allergies. ARA in GSE/CD may be secondary to tTG autoimmunity. In a recent study in Turkey, 8 of 20 ARA patients had wheat reactivities on the RAST tests. When this allergic food and all other patient specific RAST+ foods were removed half of the patients had improved ARA by serological markers. In patients with wheat allergies, rye was effectively substituted. This may indicate that some proportion of RA in GSE/CD is due to downstream effects of allergic responses.

2500|$|Only one {{vaccine for}} dengue is {{currently}} approved in three countries (Brazil, Mexico, Philippines). Several vaccines are under development by {{private and public}} researchers. Developing a vaccine against the disease is challenging. With four different serotypes of the dengue virus that can cause the disease, the vaccine must immunize against all four types to be effective. Vaccination against only one serotype could possibly lead to severe dengue hemorrhagic shock (DHS) when infected with another serotype due to antibody-dependent enhancement. When infected with dengue virus, the immune system produces <b>cross-reactive</b> antibodies that provide immunity to that particular serotype. [...] However, these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing other serotypes upon reinfection and actually increase viral replication. When macrophages consume the ‘neutralized’ virus, the virus is able to replicate within the macrophage, causing disease. These <b>cross-reactive,</b> ineffective antibodies ease access of virus into macrophages, which induces more severe disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome). A common problem faced in dengue-endemic regions is when mothers become infected with dengue; after giving birth, offspring carry the immunity from their mother and are susceptible to hemorrhagic fever if infected {{with any of the}} other three serotypes. One vaccine was in phase III trials in 2012 and planning for vaccine usage and effectiveness surveillance had started.|$|E

50|$|The {{virus was}} found to be a novel strain of {{influenza}} for which extant vaccines against seasonal flu provided little protection. A study at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in May 2009 found that children had no preexisting immunity to the new strain but that adults, particularly those older than 60, had some degree of immunity. Children showed no <b>cross-reactive</b> antibody reaction to the new strain, adults aged 18 to 60 had 6-9%, and older adults 33%. While it has been thought that these findings suggest the partial immunity in older adults may be due to previous exposure to similar seasonal influenza viruses, a November 2009 study of a rural unvaccinated population in China found only a 0.3% <b>cross-reactive</b> antibody reaction to the H1N1 strain, suggesting that previous vaccinations for seasonal flu and not exposure may have resulted in the immunity found in the older U.S. population.|$|E

As CCDs apparently do not elicite allergic symptoms, a positive in vitro test based on IgE binding to CCDs must be rated as false positive.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Yuzo Arima and {{his colleagues}} at WHO report [...] "While poultry {{exposure}} appears to be a common risk factor, the age distribution among reported cases also raises the question why so few young adults (i.e. those of working age exposed to poultry as vendors/LBM live bird market workers/breeders/transporters) have been reported. This not only suggests greater exposure among elderly men but also a possible greater biological susceptibility to more severe outcomes." [...] Danuta M. Skowronski, MD, of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control and three colleagues put forward the hypothesis that older Chinese men have more lifetime exposure to H7 avian flu viruses and thus have immune responses which are weakly <b>cross-reactive</b> but not protective. This immune phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and is perhaps best known in cases of Dengue fever when a person who has previously been infected with one serotype of Dengue fever becomes infected many months or years later with a different serotype. It is thought to occur when weakly <b>cross-reactive</b> antibodies form bridging complexes to facilitate uptake and replication of related but non-identical variants.|$|E
50|$|The {{etiology}} and pathogenesis of PANDAS is {{not completely}} understood.

The Abs are produced against components of the GAS cell wall, and through molecular mimicry, cross-react with neuronal components of cells in the basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, and internal segment of the globus pallidus) in animal models.|$|E

50|$|Epitopes are {{sometimes}} <b>cross-reactive.</b> This property is exploited by {{the immune system}} in regulation by anti-idiotypic antibodies (originally proposed by Nobel laureate Niels Kaj Jerne). If an antibody binds to an antigen's epitope, the paratope could become the epitope for another antibody that will then bind to it. If this second antibody is of IgM class, its binding can upregulate the immune response; if the second antibody is of IgG class, its binding can downregulate the immune response.|$|E
50|$|Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a 17 kDA {{secreted}} {{protein that}} in humans is encoded by the ISG15 gene. The main cellular {{function of the}} protein is ISGylation, its covalent addition to cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, similar to ubiquitination. In addition, ISG15 has anti-viral activity. ISG15 shares several common properties with other ubiquitin-like molecules (UBLs), but its activity is tightly regulated by specific signaling pathways that {{have a role in}} innate immunity. ISG15 was identified as an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) since its expression is induced in response to type I interferons or lipopolysaccharide treatment. Upon interferon treatment, ISG15 can be detected in both free and conjugated forms, and is secreted from monocytes and lymphocytes where it can function as a cytokine. In the cell, ISG15 co-localizes with intermediate filaments and ISGylation may modulate the JAK-STAT pathway or certain aspects of neurological disease. It is also known as UCRP (ubiquitin <b>cross-reactive</b> protein) since it contains 2 tandem ubiquitin homology domains and is <b>cross-reactive</b> with ubiquitin antibodies. In contrast to other UBLs, ISG15 has not been identified in lower eukaryotes (yeast, nematode, insects, plants) indicating its role in specialized functions.|$|E
50|$|Five serogroups of lentiviruses are recognized, {{reflecting}} the vertebrate hosts {{with which they}} are associated (primates, sheep and goats, horses, domestic cats, and cattle). The primate lentiviruses are distinguished by the use of CD4 protein as a receptor and the absence of dUTPase. Some groups have <b>cross-reactive</b> gag antigens (e.g., the ovine, caprine, and feline lentiviruses). Antibodies to gag antigens in lions and other large felids indicate the existence of other as yet unidentified viruses related to feline lentivirus and the ovine/caprine lentiviruses.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the wide}} variety of {{clinical}} presentations, diagnosis of disease related to this agent is often challenging and cannot be accomplished using on clinical features alone. Laboratory confirmation of the organism in biopsy or secretion specimens is necessary. Currently there are no available serological testing procedures available for H. duboisii, and the species is antigenically <b>cross-reactive</b> with the closely related H. capsulatum. The feasibility of a specific polymerase chain reaction-based test for H. duboisii has been suggested, but none is presently available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cross-reactive</b> {{carbohydrate}} determinants (CCDs) {{play a role}} in {{the context}} of allergy diagnosis. The terms CCD or CCDs describe protein-linked carbohydrate structures responsible for the phenomenon of cross-reactivity of sera from allergic patients towards a wide range of allergens from plants and insects. In serum-based allergy diagnosis, antibodies of the IgE class directed against CCDs therefore give the impression of polysensitization. Anti-CCD IgE, however, does not seem to elicit clinical symptoms. Diagnostic results caused by CCDs are therefore regarded as false positives.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the exact}} role of Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} in PA remains controversial, evidence indicates H. pylori {{is involved in}} the pathogenesis of the disease. A long-standing H. pylori infection may cause gastric autoimmunity by a mechanism known as molecular mimicry. Antibodies produced by the immune system can be <b>cross-reactive</b> and may bind to both H. pylori antigens and those found in the gastric mucosa. The antibodies are produced by activated B cells that recognise both pathogen and self-derived peptides.
