25|$|The premium film {{services}} Encore and MoviePlex, {{which are}} also owned by Starz, Inc., operate as separate services; as such, subscribers {{to one of the}} services do not have to subscribe to any of the others. Some providers offer Encore and MoviePlex's multiplex channels on a separate digital <b>cable</b> <b>tier</b> from Starz. However, Encore and, depending on its carriage, MoviePlex are frequently sold together in a package with Starz.|$|E
25|$|The Quebec-based francophone network TVA {{as well as}} {{specialty}} channels TV5 Québec Canada and Ici RDI {{are available}} on all Ontario cable systems, as these channels are mandated by the CRTC for carriage by all Canadian cable operators. Where there is sufficient local demand for French-language television, Ontario cable systems may also offer French-language channels such as V, Ici ARTV, MusiquePlus and RDS, although these channels only have discretionary status outside Quebec and are typically offered only on a digital <b>cable</b> <b>tier</b> rather than in basic cable packages.|$|E
25|$|Fox News Channel: Until 2004, the CRTC's {{apparent}} {{reluctance to}} grant a digital license to Fox News Channel {{under the same}} policy which {{made it difficult for}} RAI to enter the country – same-genre competition from foreign services – had angered many conservative Canadians, who believed the network was deliberately being kept out due to its perceived conservative bias, particularly given the long-standing availability of services such as CNN and BBC World in Canada. On November 18, 2004, however, the CRTC approved an application by cable companies to offer Fox News Channel on the digital <b>cable</b> <b>tier.</b> Fox commenced broadcasting in Canada shortly thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|Audience reach - By {{taking over}} Speed's {{transponder}} space, Fox Sports 1 {{was expected to}} reach 90 million households {{at the time of}} its launch (with most cable and satellite providers carrying it on the channel slot, almost entirely through distribution on basic <b>cable</b> <b>tiers,</b> that Speed had occupied on their channel lineups). While that number is relatively less than ESPN's total reach at that time (99 million homes), it is also more than the 77.9 million homes that NBCSN reached at the beginning of 2013, which was hamstrung by some of its reach being only through carriage on digital <b>cable</b> <b>tiers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Not all subchannels are {{available}} on cable in all areas. An agreement between the American Cable Association, the Association of Public Television Stations and PBS requires them to be carried on digital <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> after the digital transition date of June 12, 2009.|$|R
50|$|As ESPN Classic's {{carriage}} {{has declined}} more into specialty <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> due to bandwidth conservation concerns and low viewership, {{along with the}} fact that ESPN Classic does not yet have an HD simulcast channel (the former factors eventually led ESPN to transition ESPN Classic into a video on demand service beginning in 2014), ESPNEWS has become the primary overflow network for situations in which ESPN and ESPN2 carry live sports coverage.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} September Spitfire {{detained}} the American merchantman Robust, on {{passage from}} Baltimore to Amsterdam, off the Eddystone. Kean put a mate and six men on board as a prize crew and sent her to Plymouth. On the way, while three men were aloft trimming the sails, two in the hold stowing the <b>cable</b> <b>tier,</b> one at the helm, and the prize-master having breakfast, the Americans, armed with pistols, seized the steersman and the prize master. The Americans threatened to shoot the men aloft and below if the prize crew did not give up the ship. The Americans put the prize crew into a boat, and after a long pull the seven men reached Salcombe. Robust resumed her voyage, reaching Amsterdam.|$|E
50|$|The Harrisonburg {{market has}} only one station for PBS (in-market member station WVPT); the market's other network {{affiliates}} are WHSV's MyNetworkTV-affiliated third digital subchannel and a CW-affiliated subchannel of WVIR. Prior to 2006, many of these stations {{were on the same}} basic <b>cable</b> <b>tier,</b> but were dropped to preserve bandwidth and eliminate the redundancy of multiple affiliates. All of the stations that were not mentioned in the basic <b>cable</b> <b>tier</b> are now moved over to digital cable.|$|E

5000|$|In late 1999, Hot Choice began leaning towards more [...] "R"-rated films; more adult {{programming}} began being {{distributed throughout}} its daily schedule until 2000 when Hot Choice adopted a mostly adult programming format. Some {{of the cable}} systems moved this channel to their digital <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> or removed it from their listings altogether. In September 2001, Hot Choice had changed their format to featuring only softcore adult programming.|$|R
50|$|The Local AccuWeather Channel is an American {{broadcast}} {{television network}} that {{is owned by}} AccuWeather. Operating as a 24-hour advertiser-supported network, it provides national weather forecasts with local forecasts inserted several times an hour by its affiliates. The network operates from AccuWeather's headquarters in State College, Pennsylvania. Primarily carried on the digital subchannels of broadcast television stations, the network is also distributed on the digital <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> of certain providers {{at the discretion of}} the local affiliate.|$|R
5000|$|CrEaTe and CET Arts {{are also}} {{available}} on the digital <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> of local <b>cable</b> providers Time Warner Cable and Insight Communications. [...] "CETWorld", affiliated with PBS World (now branded as simply World), was carried on channel 48.2 from 2003 to January 5, 2009, and on 48.3 from September 24 of that year to February 1, 2010. During this time, it was also carried by Time Warner Cable. World programming continues to be carried on ThinkTV World, a subchannel of sister station WPTO.|$|R
50|$|On April 1, 2002, {{a dispute}} arose between Time Warner Cable's Milwaukee-area system and WWRS {{regarding}} must-carry regulations. Must-carry regulations require cable television providers within the Grade B contour of a full-power, full service television station to carry that station on their basic tier. When the dispute was settled, the FCC judged that {{the station was}} not required to be carried on the cable systems in the more distant counties of Kenosha, Racine and Walworth. However, WWRS was able to exercise must-carry to the Time Warner Cable lineup in southeastern Wisconsin. This, combined {{with the lack of}} available channel space, caused the forced move of Madison's PBS member and Wisconsin Public Television flagship station WHA-TV (channel 21) to the digital <b>cable</b> <b>tier</b> in order to air WWRS on the basic <b>cable</b> <b>tier.</b>|$|E
50|$|Time Warner Cable & RCN do {{not allow}} internet-only and basic cable {{subscribers}} to access ESPN3; only those who subscribe to a standard <b>cable</b> <b>tier</b> or higher (and thus access ESPN's linear networks) can use the service. Thus, in these cases {{the cost of the}} service is bundled into the cable bill and not the Internet bill.|$|E
50|$|The premium film {{services}} Encore and MoviePlex, {{which are}} also owned by Starz, Inc., operate as separate services; as such, subscribers {{to one of the}} services do not have to subscribe to any of the others.

50|$|Originally, it {{planned to}} {{broadcast}} its digital {{signal from the}} Nassau Valley tower, but station officials decided instead to install its digital transmitter at a tower southwest of Lewes, that is also used by radio station WGMD (92.7 FM). (The station's over-the-air signal reaches {{as far north as}} Milford; as far east as Cape May, New Jersey; as far south as Ocean City, Maryland; and as far west as Seaford.) In October 2008, WRDE-LP was added on the digital <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> of local <b>cable</b> providers, including Comcast.|$|R
50|$|Some {{affiliates}} eventually signed carriage {{deals with}} Time Warner Cable, {{but not all}} of the CW affiliates received carriage on the provider's basic <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> (for example, Syracuse, New York affiliate WSTQ-LP can only be viewed on digital cable channel 266 in the Ithaca market). Currently, the largest market without a known affiliate is the Johnstown-Altoona market, whose closest CW station is CBS-owned WPCW-TV/Pittsburgh, which is carried on TWC's Johnstown and Altoona area systems; WPCW was originally targeted to serve that area before it refocused its programming toward the Pittsburgh market in the late 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{services}} also broadcast over Time Warner <b>Cable's</b> digital <b>tier</b> on that provider's southeastern Wisconsin systems, and began to be carried on Charter Communications systems on October 15, 2008.|$|R
50|$|On May 19, 2009, ESPN {{announced}} it {{had reached a}} carriage agreement with Comcast, which allows the cable provider to carry ESPNU on a widely distributed digital <b>cable</b> <b>tier,</b> instead of a less popular sports tier. ESPNU was added to most Comcast systems {{in time for the}} start of the 2009-10 college football season. This ended several years of negotiations and somewhat of a feud between Comcast and ESPN over carriage of ESPNU.|$|E
50|$|BET Hip-Hop is a {{spin-off}} {{network of}} Black Entertainment Television. It {{appears on the}} digital <b>cable</b> <b>tier</b> of cable systems across the United States. The channel airs former BET programming and specials daily. The channel also airs BET's vintage Music video programming, and runs on an automated loop schedule having the same episodes repeated multiple {{times a day and}} throughout the week.In 2016, the channel was updated and programming now largely consists of hip-hop and rap videos, very similar to sister channel BET Jams.|$|E
50|$|Five {{months before}} KOWH's sign-on, The WB and UPN {{announced}} that they would close and form The CW Television Network. Pappas had obtained the affiliation for KOWH {{by the time it}} signed on, and to reflect this affiliation, the station changed its callsign to KCWL-TV on August 2, 2006. KCWL operated as a member of The CW Plus, successor of The WB 100+. On September 1, 2006, KCWL was added to the primary cable system in Lincoln, Time Warner Cable, on channel 18 in their low basic <b>cable</b> <b>tier.</b>|$|E

50|$|In September 2007, the CRTC refused Shaw's {{request to}} carry USA Network in Canada {{on the basis}} that the channel carried too much {{programming}} that overlapped with the English language digital cable specialty channel Mystery TV (which is then owned by Canwest - later Shaw Media - and formerly, Groupe TVA). However, on September 20, the CRTC stated that it would reconsider their denial of the eligible foreign carriage proposal for USA Network at a later date, when Shaw instead offered to carry the channel on the digital <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> of its Shaw Cable systems. In spite of this, the CRTC has since rejected the restructured proposal {{on the basis that}} USA's programming would be competitive with Mystery TV.|$|R
5000|$|On February 26, 2008, KMBC-TV {{launched}} a digital subchannel on virtual channel 9.2 under the brand [...] "First Alert Weather 24 Hours", initially {{serving as an}} affiliate of The Local AccuWeather Channel. The channel - which was immediately made available on the digital <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> of Time Warner Cable (on digital channel 1422), Comcast (on channel 247) and Everest Broadband (on channel 611) - provided regional and national forecasts provided by the AccuWeather-operated network, along with pre-recorded local forecasts presented by meteorologists from KMBC's [...] "First Alert Weather" [...] team (which were updated {{two to three times}} per day), and a half-hour block of syndicated children's programs compliant with FCC educational programming guidelines on Monday through Saturday afternoons.|$|R

50|$|In 1999, Disney Channel {{placed a}} mandate to cable {{operators}} that continued to carry it as a premium service to move the channel to a basic <b>cable</b> <b>tier</b> or stop carrying it altogether, stipulating {{that it would not}} renew carriage agreements with providers (such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast, the last major cable providers to carry the channel as a pay service) that chose to continue offering the network as a premium channel. With the shift towards children as its target audience, some of the off-network programs acquired by the channel during the early-mid 2000s (such as Boy Meets World and later Sister, Sister) began to be edited for content such as profanity and sexual references that were deemed inappropriate for younger audiences.|$|E
50|$|The term {{community}} channel {{may also}} {{refer to a}} conventional broadcast station — such as, CFTV-DT in Leamington, Ontario, CFSO-TV in Cardston, Alberta, CHCO-TV in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, and CIMC-TV in Arichat, Nova Scotia — {{owned and operated by}} a local non-profit organization to serve a similar function. Terrestrial community stations are offered only where a local group has presented a viable business plan to the CRTC and been awarded a license — unlike cable community channels, it is not mandatory that a terrestrial community channel be made available in any given market. Cable companies may also apply to the CRTC for relief of carriage responsibilities on the basic <b>cable</b> <b>tier,</b> such {{as in the case of}} CFTV, which is carried on digital basic cable.|$|E
50|$|In September 2013, WMLW's {{main channel}} and {{subchannel}} feeds moved exclusively to Time Warner <b>Cable's</b> digital <b>tier</b> as that provider begins {{the transition to}} an all-digital system by 2015, requiring a QAM-compatible television or a DTA set-top box to view the station.|$|R
50|$|Programs {{that air}} during free preview events of premium {{channels}} {{generally do not}} expurgate content deemed inappropriate for basic cable or broadcast television, meaning {{that some of the}} programs shown during the period may include graphic violence; nudity; overt sexual content; strong profanity or any combination thereof, potentially allowing children to observe such content if parental controls (such as the V-chip) are not activated. This was a particular issue before the advent of digital cable as these preview events usually ran on local origination channels that are available on basic <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> accessible to any subscriber. However, some of the more risque content featured on premium networks, such as Cinemax's After Dark block of softcore adult series and films, usually does not air on free preview weekends.|$|R
5000|$|According to a February 2008 {{report in}} The Wall Street Journal, NFL Network chief {{executive}} officer and former ESPN chairman Steve Bornstein had been in [...] "high-level discussions" [...] with NFL and executives from The Walt Disney Company including Disney CEO Robert Iger and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. An analyst quoted in the report suggested combining NFL Network with ESPN Classic, which has a wide distribution on expanded basic <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> but attracts a modest audience. ESPN could use its market weight and demand more than the 16 to 17 cents per month that it currently receives from ESPN Classic. Though such a merger has not occurred as of 2010, ESPN Networks and NFL Network do share some programming (such as NFL's Greatest Games).|$|R
50|$|Turner Classic Movies is {{available}} in many other countries around the world. In Canada, TCM began to be carried on Shaw Cable and satellite provider Shaw Direct in 2005. Rogers Cable started offering TCM in December 2006 as a free preview for subscribers of its digital <b>cable</b> <b>tier,</b> and was added to its analogue tier in February 2007. While the schedule for the Canadian feed is generally {{the same as that}} of the U.S. network, some films are replaced for broadcast in Canada due to rights issues and other reasons. Other versions of TCM are available in Australia, France, Middle East, Africa, Spain, Asia, Latin America, Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta. The UK version operates two channels, including a spinoff called TCM 2.|$|E
50|$|Two {{examples}} of the SV channel preservation on digital cable {{and at the same}} time, CATV favoring a non-designated DMA is Belvidere, New Jersey along the Delaware River. Phillipsburg, Milford, Frenchtown, and Lambertville, all downstream on the Delaware River, sometimes lean towards this as well. Belvidere used to lean towards the Philadelphia market solely on television reception, since it was not able to receive New York City area stations. However, since it is located in Warren County, it is officially part of the New York City television market. When cable providers advanced with premium programming and later digital cable service, the Philadelphia stations disappeared from basic cable tiers but KYW-TV, WCAU and WTXF-TV were later moved to the digital <b>cable</b> <b>tier.</b>|$|E

An analyst quoted in the report suggested a merger of NFL Network with ESPN Classic due to the latter's wide distribution on expanded basic <b>cable</b> <b>tiers.</b> Though a consolidation of the two channels did not materialize, ESPN's networks and NFL Network would begin to share programming (for instance, an episode of NFL's Greatest Games may air on NFL Network one night, then air on ESPN2 the next). Eventually however, NFL Network was able to obtain full carriage on most providers on its own {{by the middle of}} the 2012 season, no longer necessitating a need to merge the two channels.|$|R
5000|$|Some or all {{of these}} {{services}} are available on the digital <b>cable</b> <b>tiers</b> of many <b>cable</b> providers, on free-to-air (FTA) television via C-band satellite, as well as via direct broadcast satellite. With the exception of Sprout, some of these services, including those from PBS member stations and networks, have not made contracts with Internet-distributed over-the-top MVPD services such as PlayStation Vue and Sling TV. With the transition to over-the-air digital television broadcasts, many of the services are also often now available as standard-definition multicast channels on the digital signals of some member stations, while PBS-DT2 serves as a secondary HD feed. With the absence of advertising, network identification on these PBS networks was limited to utilization {{at the end of the}} program, which includes the standard series of bumpers from the [...] "Be More" [...] campaign.|$|R
