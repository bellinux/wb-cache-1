60|$|But here came Miguel and two strong men {{laden with}} steel bars, <b>cold</b> <b>chisels</b> and picks. For a {{time it was}} a quandary where to attack the wall, but Arthur finally chose the place just back of the bed and bade the men begin their work.|$|E
60|$|His {{tremendous}} {{legs are}} his only weapons, and his kick is almost, if not quite, {{equal to that}} of a horse. Possessing enormous feet, with two toes on each, the horny points of which can cut and rip like <b>cold</b> <b>chisels,</b> he rushes at an adversary and kicks, or hits out, straightforward, like a prize-fighter. No unarmed man on earth could stand long before a furious male ostrich without being killed. But there are one or two weak points about him, which abate somewhat the danger of his attack. In the first place his power lies only in his mighty legs, the thighs of which--blue-grey and destitute of feathers-- are like two shoulders of mutton. With his beak he can do nothing, and his long neck is so weak that if you can only lay hold of it and pull his head to the ground you are comparatively safe, for he cannot kick effectively in that position, and devotes all his energies, when thus caught, to useless attempts to pull his head out of your grasp. But, then, how are you to get hold of that neck--the root of which stands nearly as high as your own head--in the face of two claws that go like battering-rams wrought by lightning? As well might you attempt to lay hold of a prize-fighter's nose while his active fists are darting out at you.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>chisels</b> come in {{a variety}} of sizes, from fine {{engraving}} tools that are tapped with very light hammers, to massive tools that are driven with sledgehammers. <b>Cold</b> <b>chisels</b> are forged to shape and hardened and tempered (to a blue colour) at the cutting edge. The head of the chisel is chamfered to slow down the formation of the mushroom shape caused by hammering and is left soft to withstand hammer blows.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of <b>cold</b> <b>chisels</b> are made of steel, a few are manufactured from beryllium copper, for use in special situations where non-sparking tools are required.|$|E
50|$|Chisels {{are made}} of high carbon steel. They are {{hardened}} and tempered {{at the cutting edge}} while the head is left soft so it will not crack when hammered. Chisels are of two types, hot and <b>cold</b> <b>chisels.</b> The cold chisel is used for cutting cold metals while the hot chisel is for hot metals. Usually hot chisels are thinner and therefore can not be substituted with <b>cold</b> <b>chisels.</b> Also many smiths shape chisels as to have a simple twisted handle as to resemble a hammer, they can be used at a greater distance away from the hot metals. They are very useful and found throughout the world.|$|E

In October the group replaced Prestwich with former Divinyls drummer, Charley Drayton, and the album was issued in April 2012.

50|$|A {{cold chisel}} {{is a tool}} made of {{tempered}} steel used for cutting 'cold' metals, meaning {{that they are not}} used in conjunction with heating torches, forges, etc. <b>Cold</b> <b>chisels</b> are used to remove waste metal when a very smooth finish is not required or when the work cannot be done easily with other tools, such as a hacksaw, file, bench shears or power tools.|$|E
50|$|The name {{cold chisel}} comes from its use by blacksmiths to cut metal {{while it was}} cold as {{compared}} to other tools they used to cut hot metal. Because <b>cold</b> <b>chisels</b> are used to form metal, they have a less-acute angle to the sharp portion of the blade than a woodworking chisel. This gives the cutting edge greater strength {{at the expense of}} sharpness.|$|E

50|$|Beryllium copper is {{non-sparking}} but physically {{tough and}} nonmagnetic, fulfilling {{the requirements of}} ATEX directive for Zones 0, 1, and 2. Beryllium copper screwdrivers, pliers, wrenches, <b>cold</b> <b>chisels,</b> knives, and hammers are available for environments with explosive hazards, such as oil rigs, coal mines, and grain elevators. An alternative metal sometimes used for non-sparking tools is aluminium bronze. Compared to steel tools, beryllium copper tools are more expensive, not as strong, and less durable, but the properties of beryllium copper in hazardous environments may outweigh the disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} common types of <b>cold</b> <b>chisels.</b> These are the flat chisel, {{the most widely}} known type, {{which is used to}} cut bars and rods to reduce {{surfaces}} and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling.|$|E
5000|$|Only three 10-inch (300-pounder) saw service {{during the}} war, all placed on Morris Island during the {{campaign}} against Charleston harbor. It was mounted on a center pintle, barbette carriage. It was essentially an enlarged 8-inch Parrott rifle, although it {{was believed to be}} somewhat more accurate than the 8-inch rifle [...] One 10-inch Parrott rifle on Morris Island was disabled soon after it first opened fire by the premature detonation of a shell, which blew about 18 inches off its muzzle. The ragged end of the muzzle was trimmed even by soldiers working with <b>cold</b> <b>chisels,</b> and the gun fired another 370 times without any appreciable difference in range or accuracy. The gun was subsequently permanently disabled by additional premature detonation of shells.|$|E

5000|$|The {{techniques}} {{used to collect}} fossils {{vary depending on the}} sediment or rock in which the fossils are to be found. For collecting in rock a geological hammer, a variety of <b>cold</b> <b>chisels</b> and a mallet are used to split and break rocks to reveal fossils. Since the rock is deposited in layers, these layers may be split apart to reveal fossils. For soft sediments and unconsolidated deposits, such as sands, silts, and clays, a spade, flat-bladed trowel, and stiff brushes are used. Sieves in a variety of mesh sizes are used to separate fossils from sands and gravels. Sieving is a rougher technique for collecting fossils and can destroy fragile ones. Some times, water is run through a sieve to help remove silt and sand. This technique is called wet sieving ...|$|E
50|$|The bellows {{consists}} of a skin bag about a foot long, held open with wooden hoops. It is provided with a valve and a nozzle. A forge, crucibles, an anvil, and tongs are used during the melting process. Molds, the matrix and die, <b>cold</b> <b>chisels,</b> scissors, pliers, files, awls, and emery paper also come into play. A soldering setup, consisting of a blowpipe and a torch made of oil-soaked rags used with borax, is manipulated by the smith. The silversmith uses a grinding stone, sandstone dust, and ashes for polishing the jewelry, and a salt called almogen is used for whitening. Navajo jewelers began sand casting silver around 1875; silver was melted and then poured into a mold, which would be carved from sandstone. When cooled and set, the piece normally required additional of filing and smoothing. Cast jewelry was also occasionally engraved. Sterling silver jewelry was soldered, and surrounded by scrolls, beads, and leaf patterns.|$|E
