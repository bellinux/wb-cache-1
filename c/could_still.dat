König was awarded the German Cross in Gold for his fanatical leadership.|$|E

5|$|A {{party of}} 40 senior German {{officers}} and civilians {{who were on}} a tour of Campbeltown were killed. In total, the explosion killed about 360 men. The wreck of Campbeltown <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be seen inside the dry dock months later when RAF photo reconnaissance planes were sent to photograph the port.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona's UEFA {{coefficient}} {{placed them}} in the top eight seeds for the draw, meaning that they would avoid having to play against Internazionale, Liverpool, Chelsea or holders and their semi-final opponents from 2007–08, Manchester United. However, they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> draw Bayern Munich, Roma or Juventus. In the end, Barcelona were drawn into Group C against Sporting CP, Basel and Shakhtar Donetsk.|$|E
5|$|Danaus– Featured in God of War comic #3, {{he was the}} {{champion}} of Hermes that could magically command beasts. With the animals in his village dying of a plague, Danaus was forced to seek the Ambrosia. He was decapitated in battle by Barbarian Prince Alrik, who retained Danaus' head as it <b>could</b> <b>still</b> command beasts.|$|E

5|$|If {{there is}} a clause in {{which one of the}} clause's two {{variables}} has already been set, and the clause <b>could</b> <b>still</b> become either true or false, then the other variable is set in a way that forces the clause to become true.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also said}} that GRCs serve more as {{administrative}} tools than to ensure minority representation. The size of GRCs was increased {{to take advantage of}} economies of scale when managing the wards. However, whether GRCs are required for this purpose is arguable, as Goh Chok Tong stated in 1988 that MPs in SMCs <b>could</b> <b>still</b> group together after elections to enjoy economies of scale.|$|E

5|$|Manchu shamans {{typically}} wore an apron, a feathered cap denoting {{their ability}} to fly to the spirit world, and a belt with dangling bells, and carried a knife, two wooden sticks with bells affixed to the top, and a drum they used during ceremonies. These attributes <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be observed among shamans from Manchuria and Mongolia {{in the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
5|$|Note: {{before the}} 1974 season, the final Coaches Poll, also known {{then as the}} UPI Poll, was {{released}} before the bowl games, so a team that lost its bowl game <b>could</b> <b>still</b> claim the UPI national championship. This was changed {{as a result of}} Alabama winning the 1973 Coaches Poll national championship despite losing to Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{also had}} {{significant}} political repercussions, shaking the British Army's confidence. The {{fact that the}} siege had taken so long exposed the British forces' vulnerabilities and encouraged the native Indian states– in particular the old Maratha Confederacy in central India– to continue their resistance against British imperialism {{in the hope that}} they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be defeated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush, children, this is shocking,' said Wilmet, {{in the low}} {{impressive}} voice {{by which}} she <b>could</b> always <b>still</b> a tumult. 'How could you take advantage of my absence to do this?' ...|$|R

5|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention from}} film critics. The Morning Telegraph praised {{it as the}} best work from the new Thanhouser Company. The The New York Dramatic Mirror found it to have good acting which <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be more expressive, but was more indifferent {{to the use of}} unnecessary connecting scenes. The Moving Picture World stated, in a brief review, that the acting and photography was good.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{large quantities of}} hydrogen and helium on Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, and Kepler-11f suggest that these planets formed within the first few million years of the system's existence, when gas <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be captured from the forming protoplanetary disc.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the first}} century AD, the Coptic {{alphabet}} started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet {{with the addition of}} some Demotic signs. Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests <b>could</b> <b>still</b> read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt, but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.|$|E

5|$|As American fighters {{took over}} the {{long-range}} escorting of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) daylight bombing raids, the Griffon-engined Spitfires progressively took up the tactical air superiority role, and {{played a major role}} in intercepting V-1 flying bombs, while the Merlin-engined variants (mainly the Mk IX and the Packard-engined Mk XVI) were adapted to the fighter-bomber role. Although the later Griffon-engined marks lost some of the favourable handling characteristics of their Merlin-powered predecessors, they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> outmanoeuvre their main German foes and other, later American and British-designed fighters.|$|E
5|$|As the 1960s {{came to a}} close, folk rock {{changed and}} evolved away from the jangly {{template}} pioneered by The Byrds, but, Unterberger argues, the band's influence <b>could</b> <b>still</b> {{be heard in the}} music of Fairport Convention. Since the 1960s, The Byrds' jangly, folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music up to the present day, with authors Chris Smith, Johnny Rogan, Mark Deming, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine all noting the band's influence on such acts as Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., The Long Ryders, The Smiths, The Bangles, The Stone Roses, Teenage Fanclub, and The La's.|$|E
5|$|Boot {{wrote for}} the CFR through 2010 and 2011 for various {{publications}} such as Newsweek, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The Weekly Standard among others. He particularly argued that President Obama's health care plans made maintaining the U.S.' superpower status harder, that withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq occurred prematurely while making another war there more likely, and that the initial U.S. victory in Afghanistan had been undone by government complacency though forces <b>could</b> <b>still</b> pull off a victory. He also wrote op-eds criticizing planned budget austerity measures in both the U.S. and the U.K. as hurting their national security interests.|$|E
