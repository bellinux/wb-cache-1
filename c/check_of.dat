40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} approach to model <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> software programs suggested by T. Ball and S. Rajamani with their " model checker. This approach is novel in that it allows fast <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> terminating programs, even if they include procedure calls or recursion. An extension to this model checker is then described. This extension allows the <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary conditions for nonterminating programs, while still supporting procedure calls and recursion. Finally, some open questions are presented...|$|R
40|$|Model <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> {{isolated}} {{software components}} is inherently not possible because a component does not form a complete program with an explicit starting point. To overcome this obstacle, it is typically necessary {{to create an}} environment of the component which is the intended subject to model checking. We present our approach to automated environment generation that is based on behavior protocols [9]; to our knowledge, this is the only environment generator designed for model <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> software components. We compare it with the approach taken in the Bandera Environment Generator tool [12], designed for model <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> sets of Java classes. Key words: Software components, behavior protocols, model <b>checking,</b> automated generation <b>of</b> environment...|$|R

5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a <b>check</b> <b>of</b> the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E

A thorough <b>check</b> <b>of</b> both the Como and NBC publicity offices found that neither was responsible for the release of the photos to the media; it was done by the Vatican's press department. When Perry and Roselle became Knight Commander and Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1952, it was a news item only after Archbishop Fulton J.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} D-League, Clinkscales signed in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-professional American Basketball League (ABL), with no {{indication}} that he joined any other team since his tenure with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a loss to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his teammates) endured financial and domestic difficulties. He lived with five other teammates in a duplex house in Bay County, Florida. Because of financial issues, the league failed to pay the players—with Clinkscales solely receiving a <b>check</b> <b>of</b> $400—and canceled several games on its schedule. Later in the season, the players' duplex was supposedly leased by Breeze's head coach, Ty Fisher. A local broker filed a civil lawsuit against Fisher to evict the players, and county sheriff deputies soon forced them to leave the house. While living in the area, the players received aid from a local resident, Vonda Gainer, who they met at a Dollar Tree store. Gainer gave them food and washed their clothes. Despite their poor living conditions, the players failed to receive any aid by the league, with no contact or assurance from league CEO Steve Haney.|$|E

Noah (Sisko) enters and gives a monologue about how he will destroy the world, and shows a big red button he will push to do it. He has Bashir and Garak taken below ground, where they are handcuffed to a laser. As the time ticks down before the laser is activated, Bare performs a final <b>check</b> <b>of</b> the laser. Bashir flirts for her, and she slips him a key and hurries out. Bashir unlocks himself and Garak, who protests that it is too dangerous to continue as the safeties are turned off in the program which could result in their deaths. Garak is about to close the program and kill the other crew members when Bashir shoots him, grazing him with a bullet. Garak is shocked, but impressed and agrees to continue the programme. Bashir is concerned as he knows the program will end with either the death of Professor Bare or Colonel Komananov following the defeat of Noah.|$|E

40|$|Two {{decision}} {{problems are}} very close in spirit: module check-ing of CTL/CTL * and model <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> ATL/ATL*. The latter {{appears to be a}} natural multi-agent extension of the former, and it is commonly believed that model <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> ATL(*) subsumes module <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> CTL(*) in a straight-forward way. Perhaps because of that, the exact relationship between the two has never been formally established. A more careful look at the known complexity results, however, makes one realize that the relationship is some-what suspicious. In particular, module <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> CTL is EXPTIME-complete, while model <b>checking</b> <b>of</b> ATL is only P-complete. Thus, the (seemingly) less expressive frame-work yields significantly higher computational complexity than the (seemingly) more expressive one. This suggests that the relationship may not be as simple as believed. In this paper, we show that the difference is indeed fundamen-tal. The way in which behavior of the environment is un-derstood in module checking cannot be equivalently char-acterized in ATL(*). Conversely, if one wants to embed module checking in ATL(*) then its semantics must be ex-tended with two essential features, namely nondeterministic strategies and long-term commitment to strategies...|$|R
