According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones {{it was not the}} lack of combat troops and the <b>caveats</b> were the problem, but the lack of adequate helicopters and military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether the depth of tissue resection affected either immediate outcome or subsequent restenosis in patients treated by directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) in the Coronary Angioplasty Versus Excisional Atherectomy Trial (<b>Caveat)</b> I and II studies. Background. The relation between the depth of tissue resection, immediate outcome and subsequent restenosis in lesions treated with DCA has been controversial. Methods. In <b>Caveat</b> I, 412 patients undergoing DCA had tissue samples available for analysis by the core laboratory, whereas in <b>Caveat</b> II, 113 patients had vein graft tissue specimens available. Results. Subintimal deep arterial wall resection was demonstrated in 169 patients (41 %) in <b>Caveat</b> I and 40 (35 %) in <b>Caveat</b> II. The depth of tissue resection did not affect initial procedural outcome in either <b>Caveat</b> I or <b>Caveat</b> II, nor did it affect subsequent restenosis rates at 6 months in native coronary lesions (<b>Caveat</b> I, 50. 8 % for intimal resection vs. 51. 2 % for subintimal resection). In patients treated with vein graft disease (<b>Caveat</b> II), restenosis rates varied; when resection was limited to the intima, a restenosis rate of 40. 4 % was documented, whereas in patients with subintimal resection, the restenosis rate was 57. 1 %. This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0. 144). Conclusions. This combined randomized series of DCA for treatment of primary native coronary artery and vein graft stenoses with quantitative coronary angiography and core laboratory pathologic assessment resolves the controversy created by previous experimental and clinical data regarding deep vessel wall resection and immediate and longer outcome. Directional atherectomy with deep arterial wall resection as practiced in these studies is safe and does not jeopardize initial success rates. More important, deep wall resection is not associated with significantly increased restenosis rates...|$|R

5000|$|Evenson {{argues that}} it was not Wilber who leaked Gray's ideas to Bell's {{attorney}} Anthony Pollok after Gray's <b>caveat</b> was filed with the patent office, but somebody in the office of Gray's attorney William D. Baldwin, perhaps Baldwin himself, who leaked the variable resistance idea and the water transmitter idea to Bell's attorney before Gray's <b>caveat</b> and Bell's application were filed. It was Baldwin who advised Gray to abandon his <b>caveat</b> and not turn it into a patent application, because, Baldwin said, Bell had invented the telephone before Gray and Bell's application was notarized before Gray began his <b>caveat.</b> Baldwin urged Gray to write a letter to Bell congratulating him on his new telephone invention and [...] "I do not claim even the credit of inventing it...”. Baldwin also failed to represent Gray's interests in the Dowd case. Baldwin was on the payroll of the Bell Telephone Company {{at the same time he}} was representing Gray in a patent office action involving the Bell company. Gray did not tell anybody about his new invention for transmitting voice sounds until Friday, February 11, 1876 when Gray requested that Baldwin prepare a <b>caveat</b> for filing. Sometime on the weekend of February 12-13, Bell's lawyers learned of Gray's <b>caveat.</b> They then rushed to get Bell's application filed on Monday before Gray's <b>caveat,</b> or to make it appear that Bell's application was filed first.|$|R
5000|$|Gray's lawyer William D. Baldwin {{had been}} told that Bell's {{application}} had been notarized on January 20, 1876. Baldwin advised Gray and Gray's sponsor Samuel S. White to abandon the <b>caveat</b> and not to file a patent application for the telephone. Whether Bell's application was filed before or after Gray's <b>caveat</b> no longer mattered, because Gray abandoned his <b>caveat</b> and did not contest Bell's priority, which resulted in Bell being granted [...] for the telephone on March 7, 1876.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Caveat</b> emptor [...] is Latin for [...] "Let {{the buyer}} beware" [...] (from <b>caveat,</b> [...] "may he beware", a subjunctive form of cavēre, [...] "to beware" [...] + ēmptor, [...] "buyer"). Generally, <b>caveat</b> emptor is the {{contract}} law principle {{that controls the}} sale of real property after the date of closing, but may also apply to sales of other goods. The phrase <b>caveat</b> emptor and its use as a disclaimer of warranties arise {{from the fact that}} buyers typically have less information about the good or service they are purchasing, while the seller has more information. The quality of this situation is known as 'information asymmetry'. Defects in the good or service may be hidden from the buyer, and only known to the seller.|$|R
25|$|Despite <b>caveats</b> in the {{introduction}} to the DSM, it has long been argued that its system of classification makes unjustified categorical distinctions between disorders and uses arbitrary cut-offs between normal and abnormal. A 2009 psychiatric review noted that attempts to demonstrate natural boundaries between related DSM syndromes, or between a common DSM syndrome and normality, have failed. Some argue that rather than a categorical approach, a fully dimensional, spectrum or complaint-oriented approach would better reflect the evidence.|$|E
25|$|Additional <b>caveats</b> include {{difficulties}} in estimating the global and regional climatic {{impacts of the}} eruption and lack of conclusive evidence for the eruption preceding the bottleneck. Furthermore, genetic analysis of Alu sequences across the entire human genome {{has shown that the}} effective human population size was less than 26,000 at 1.2 million years ago; possible explanations for the low population size of human ancestors may include repeated population bottlenecks or periodic replacement events from competing Homo subspecies.|$|E
25|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} escitalopram compared to its predecessor citalopram. The importance of this issue follows from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic mixture of isomers citalopram prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of evergreening. Accordingly, this issue has been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. The most recent of these have concluded (with <b>caveats</b> in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to citalopram in efficacy and tolerability.|$|E
25|$|Meucci and his {{business}} partners hired an attorney (J.D. Stetson), who filed a <b>caveat</b> on behalf of Meucci with the patent office. They had wanted to prepare a patent application, but the partners did not provide the $250 fee, so all that was prepared was a <b>caveat,</b> since the fee for that was only $20. However, the <b>caveat</b> did not contain a clear description of how the asserted invention would actually function. Meucci advocates claim the attorney erased margin notes Meucci had added to the document.|$|R
5000|$|The {{filing fee}} of $10 for a <b>caveat</b> was less costly than the filing fee $15 {{for a full}} patent {{application}}. [...] As stated by the USPTO: [...] "In 1861, the fee for obtaining a full patent was $35, of which $15 was to be paid {{at the time of}} application and $20 when the patent was granted. In 1922, the patent filing fee increased from $15 to $20." [...] However the patent <b>caveat</b> fee remained $10 per year until the <b>caveat</b> system was abolished.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{mortgagor}} to lodge a <b>caveat,</b> where an allegation is raised of serious impropriety by a mortgagee in exercising power of sale, may be a critical protective tool for a mortgagor. The mortgagor’s capacity, as caveator, to lodge a <b>caveat</b> over the mortgagor’s own title {{and the nature of}} the interest necessary to support the <b>caveat</b> are contentious issues. This article examines the different judicial approaches that have been adopted to date and states a case for a uniform approach to this issue across Australia in the future...|$|R
25|$|Many issues {{damage the}} {{relationship}} of science {{to the media and}} the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and <b>caveats.</b> However, politicians' ability to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in the United Kingdom include the controversy over the MMR inoculation, and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie, for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{version of}} {{hypothesis}} testing is {{a hybrid of}} the two approaches that resulted from confusion by writers of statistical textbooks (as predicted by Fisher) beginning in the 1940s. (But signal detection, for example, still uses the Neyman/Pearson formulation.) Great conceptual differences and many <b>caveats</b> {{in addition to those}} mentioned above were ignored. Neyman and Pearson provided the stronger terminology, the more rigorous mathematics and the more consistent philosophy, but the subject taught today in introductory statistics has more similarities with Fisher's method than theirs. This history explains the inconsistent terminology (example: the null hypothesis is never accepted, but there is a region of acceptance).|$|E
