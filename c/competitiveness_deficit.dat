30|$|This {{paper will}} {{consider}} the basis and consequences of this French decision, which we will compare to the example set {{by the success of}} other European countries, such as Sweden. Initially, the CCE was liable to be revised after it was criticized by the Constitutional Council {{on the grounds that it}} contained too many exemptions, and it was finally withdrawn by the French government. The Prime Minister justified this on the grounds that “a decision must be taken jointly with the other countries of Europe or our <b>competitiveness</b> <b>deficit</b> will be increased further” (quoted in Le Monde on 24 March 2010).|$|E
40|$|EU {{agriculture}} and arable crops {{in particular are}} suffering from <b>competitiveness</b> <b>deficits</b> compared to other producers in the world economy. One potential strategy to cope with competitiveness challenges {{is to focus on}} research and technological innovation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the results of the project EUROCROP (Agricultural research for improving arable crop competitiveness – EUROCROP - [URL] aimed at the identification of research priorities for arable crop competitiveness. The project adopts a definition of competitiveness based on a combination of economic competitiveness and social/environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the project utilises both a crop chain and a horizontal issue perspective, and develops research priorities through the interaction of the scientific level (expert group approach) and the stakeholder level (scenario analysis). The main result of the project is the elaboration of approximately eighty research topics. Among these, the main areas for research identified are A: Risk management and adaptation of arable farming; B: Innovation in cropping systems for high environmental and economic performances; C: Limiting the impact of arable crop cropping systems on green-house gas emissions; D: Better understanding of public concern about arable crop production and products and communication with global and local societies. The project confirms that a number of well established research topics retain their importance (e. g. yield improvement, plant protection). However, they require cautious coordination with an increasingly complex system of short term priorities. Arable crops, crop chain, competitiveness, research priorities, foresight, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{panel of}} 23 {{emerging}} markets for the period 1965 ? 2008 to study the determinants of per capita GDP growth in the Philippines. The Philippines is an outlier in terms of agricultural exports, investment, research and development, population growth, and political uncertainty. Panel regressions reveal that these factors, along with the deficit, inflation, trade openness, the current account balance {{and the frequency of}} crisis episodes are siginificant determinants of growth. A growth index confirms that these determinants also capture the absolute and relative performance of each country over time and suggests that the Philippines has lacked a sustained period of relatively strong economic reforms.

40|$|The central {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the competitiveness of European Union through the prism of its influence factors: public debt, budget <b>deficit,</b> <b>competitiveness</b> of national economies, credit default swap. Based on these factors were obtained three regression functions for EU competitiveness. The results of the analysis reveal that the EU competitiveness is influenced by two main factors: sovereign risk and competitiveness of national economies. In the current economic situation, sovereign risk rate of 48. 52 % influences on EU competitiveness, and competitiveness of national economies at a rate of 33. 63 %. Among the three risk variables underlying the sovereign risk, public debt ratio is most important, thus showing that any sovereign debt crisis would adversely affect the competitiveness of the European Union, followed by the value of the CDS and by the budgetary equilibrium. The second factor, the competitiveness of national economies is mainly determined by the global competitiveness index. The model proposed in this study identifies the factors underlying the central {{objective of}} the Lisbon Strategy, namely to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world...|$|R
40|$|The {{policies}} of economic austerity are invoked whenever a country's public deficit is spiralling out of control. Given the intricate channels through which deficits and debt can be financed, i. e. either through borrowing or money creation, manipulation of public deficits may pose significant constraints on economic growth, social cohesion and political stability. In this context, austerity {{is a policy}} expedient that, if applied irresponsibly, might have irreversible effects on both economic and social structures. In Greece economic {{policies of}} austerity, in conjunction with internal devaluation, have been adopted {{in an attempt to}} improve <b>competitiveness,</b> correct external <b>deficits</b> and promote export-led growth. In this paper, by scrutinising a range of key economic indicators, we argue that austerity has depressed significantly the real economy in Greece, threatening further an already crippled economic environment with a danger of further stagnation. We also provide econometric evidence for the period 2000 - 2013 which shows that the positive contribution of net exports to economic growth in Greece has been as a result of relatively low domestic demand, not to relative gains in the international price competitiveness of Greek enterprises. Finally, it is envisaged that the lack of adequate endogenous capacity as a means of galvanising economic growth has the potential to usher in prolonged periods of economic depression...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis and recession have highlighted {{a range of}} problems with the ‘euro project’, but these problems and difficulties are related to some fundamental issues for the euro. The convergence criteria established by the Maastricht Treaty focused on nominal rather than real variables, failed to relate to issues such as current account positions. There are well-known difficulties of macroeconomic policies under the Stability and Growth Pact including its deflationary nature and the ‘one size fits all problem’ of imposing common deficit requirements on all countries. The economic performance of the eurozone countries is briefly reviewed with attention paid to the differential inflation rates; also accounted for are the changes in competitiveness {{as well as the}} current account deficits, and their implications for the future of economic performance within the eurozone, and the euro itself. The patterns of current account deficits and surpluses are linked with unemployment, lack of <b>competitiveness</b> and budget <b>deficit</b> issues. The nature of the reforms to the operations of the eurozone is examined. The political limits (including those arising from the nature of the Treaty of Lisbon) and the ideological constraints (associated with the neo-liberal agenda) on serious reforms are discussed from which the general conclusion is that the needed reforms will not be carried through. This discussion also includes consideration of the possible role for a substantial EU-level fiscal policy and some other aspects of political union. It is argued that the deep-seated problems are unlikely to be resolved, casting a dark shadow over the future of the euro. ...|$|R
