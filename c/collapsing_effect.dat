40|$|Abstract – Since {{the year}} 1955, when the salt {{deposits}} exploitation activities {{were carried out}} in the city of Tuzla and surroundings, dramatic ground collapsing phenomena occurred. Up to 10 meters of sinking in the last half century produced several damages with regards to buildings and infrastructures, leading to the demolition of the most compromised part of the city by the inhabitants. Traditional topographic survey was used in order to monitor the land deformations from the 50 ' to year 2000 with the establishment of a dense topographic network around the sinking area. The analisys of the huge dataset of altimetric data, the correlation with the boreholes activities and the introduction of more productive modern technologies (satellite GPS for geodesy) for repeated land monitoring are the object of this paper. deeply investigate the <b>collapsing</b> <b>effect</b> by means of modern survey technologies, a joint project between the CIRSA, Province of Ravenna (Italy) and Tuzla (Bosnia & Herzegovina) has been created in the year 2002.

We studied the spatial network of two tropical butterfly species, Heliconius erato and H. melpomene, using a mark-recapture database from a 2 -year survey in an Atlantic Forest remnant in Brazil. The overall network structure of both species was similar in number of vertices and average connectivity. Heliconius erato had a smaller, more disconnected network structure, suggesting shorter traveling paths. The distribution of connectivity of both species was better adjusted by a power-law distribution. We found hubs in both species; hubs are points of high capture and their location is correlated with the location of flowering plants visited by adults. In complex systems, hub elimination can have a notable <b>collapsing</b> <b>effect</b> in network structure.

40|$|The {{assumption}} that wave function collapse {{is a real}} occurrence has very interesting consequences - both experimental and theoretical. Besides predicting observable deviations from linear evolution, it implies that these deviations must originate in nondeterministic effects {{at the elementary level}} in order to prevent superluminal signaling, as demonstrated by Gisin. This lack of determinism implies that information cannot be instantiated in a reproducible form in isolated microsystems (as illustrated by the No-cloning theorem). By stipulating that information is a reproducible and referential property of physical systems, one can formulate the no-signaling principle in strictly physical terms as a prohibition of the acquisition of information about spacelike-separated occurrences. This formulation imposes tight constraints on the way in which <b>collapse</b> <b>effects</b> are induced. These constraints indicate that wave function collapse results from (presumably small) nondeterministic deviations from linear evolution associated with nonlocally entangling interactions. This hypothesis can be formalized in a stochastic collapse equation and used to assess the feasibility of testing for <b>collapse</b> <b>effects.</b> Comment: 32 pages, New title, extended argument, collapse equation adde...|$|R

We previously demonstrated that in subjects aged above 50 the airway resistance did not change in response to baroreceptor activation, whereas in younger volunteers the airway resistance significantly decreased. Objective The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of carotid baroreceptor inactivation on the reflex change of respiratory resistance, in the course of aging. Materials and methods 80 healthy men, divided in four groups: aged 20 - 30 (Group I), 31 - 40 (Group II), 41 - 50 (Group III), and 51 - 60 (Group IV) were included in the study. The selective inactivation of carotid baroreceptors was induced by generating a positive pressure of 40 mmHg for 5 s in two capsules placed bilaterally on the neck over the bifurcation of the carotid arteries. The oscillatory method (Siregnost FD 5, Siemens) was used to measure continuously respiratory resistance. Results Inactivation of carotid baroreceptors produced a short increase in respiratory resistance by 0. 38 ± 0. 01 SE mbar/l/s, i. e., 21. 7 % above the resting level in Group I and by 0. 25 ± 0. 01 mbar/l/s in Group II. In the two older groups (III and IV) respiratory resistance did not change in response to baroreceptors inactivation. Conclusions In humans aged above 40, carotid baroreceptors do not contribute to bronchodilator tone, which causes imbalance between the activities of upper airway and chest wall inspiratory muscles leading to a <b>collapsing</b> <b>effect</b> on the upper airway. </p...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} evidence {{during the last}} several years that the core neutronics methods that have been developed for uranium fueled LWRs do not perform satisfactorily when applied to the same cores fueled with mixed oxide, or more generally to heterogeneous cores with very different neutron spectra. A two-dimensional, 97 group MOX benchmark problem was developed and applied to analyze deficiencies of the current generation of LWR analysis methods. The errors in the current two group, coarse mesh nodal diffusion methods were described in terms of four primary effects: (1) a homogenization effect, (2) a spatial discretization effect, (3) a group <b>collapsing</b> <b>effect,</b> and (4) a transport effect. The specific objective of the research here was to address the first three of these effects with the development of a four energy group advanced nodal method. Several methods have been proposed over {{the last several years}} for extending the current class of nodal methods to four energy groups. A Taylor series analysis was performed of the order of error in the various analytic nodal methods proposed. The analysis showed that the harmonic part of the error dominated in the Taylor expansion and it was therefore prudent to retain the harmonic solution in all four energy groups. A new nodal kernel referred to as the Harmonic Analytic Nodal Method (HANM) was developed and implemented within the framework of the nonlinear nodal method. HANM was applied to a MOX benchmark problem and results were compared to a 97 group reference solution. The errors in the two group solution were reduced by about 50 % through the application of a four group HANM with minimal increase in the computational burden. ...|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2015 This {{dissertation}} examines representations in {{art of the}} Victorian {{woman in}} “altered states. ” Though characterized in Victorian art {{in a number of}} ways, women are most commonly stereotyped as physically listless and mentally vacuous. The images examined show the Victorian female in a languid and at times reclining or supine pose in these representations. In addition, her demeanor implies both emotional and physical depletion, and there is both a pronounced abandonment of the physical and a <b>collapsing</b> <b>effect,</b> as if all mental faculties are withdrawing inward. Each chapter is dedicated to examining one of these distinct but interrelated types of femininity that flourished throughout British and American art from c. 1850 to c. 1910. The chapters for this dissertation are organized sequentially to demonstrate a selected progression of various states of consciousness, from the most obvious (the sleeping woman) to the more nuanced (the female Aesthete and the female medium). In each chapter, there is the visual perception of the Victorian woman as having access to otherworldly conditions of one form or another. In this compelling strand of imagery, the Victorian woman is depicted in a variety of altered states of consciousness. For the first time, this pervasive representation of Victorian femininity is linked to the period’s medical and cultural discourse. New analysis reveals that these depictions were part of a much greater cultural and artistic fixation that emerged in several forms and originated, in many ways, from within the scientific and medical communities at large. Accordingly, focus is given to the complex interplay between medical “fact” and pictorial interpretation or outright fiction. In addition, a portion of this dissertation delves into the representation of the female Aesthete both in fine art and popular culture. The final chapter contextualizes the female medium within the Spiritualist movement...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{diffusion}} of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) under crowded environments is of ubiquitous importance to modelling related dynamics in biological systems. In the present work, {{we proposed a}} theoretical framework to study the diffusion behavior of IDPs in polymer solutions. IDP is modeled as an ensemble of particles {{with a wide range}} of gyration radius subject to Flory-Fisk distribution, where the <b>collapse</b> <b>effect</b> which leads to the shrink of IDP due to polymer crowding is included. The diffusion coefficient of IDP is calculated as the average, denoted by 〈D〉, over the values of the particle samples. By properly incorporating the scaling relations for diffusion coefficient of nanoparticle (NP) in polymer solutions, we are able to evaluate 〈D〉 straightforwardly and reveal the disorder and <b>collapse</b> <b>effects</b> on IDP’s diffusion in an explicit manner. Particular attentions are paid on comparison between the diffusion coefficient of an IDP and that of a NP. Results demonstrate that both disorder and collapse can enhance IDP diffusion rate. Our analysis shows that the crossover behavior reported by experiments can be actually a general phenomenon, namely, while a NP with smaller size than that of an IDP diffuses faster in simple solutions, the IDP may become the faster one under crowded conditions. We apply our theory to analyze the {{diffusion of}} several types of IDP in a few different polymer solutions.
