5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Feynman {{delivered}} the Caltech commencement {{address on the}} topic of <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience {{due to a lack of}} [...] "a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty" [...] on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{recent work}} has debated the {{suitability}} of the term <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> arguing {{that it does not}} refer to an identifiable empirical reality, and that the emphasis on [...] "cargo" [...] says more about Western ideological bias than it does about the movements concerned. Nancy McDowell argues that the focus on <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> isolates the phenomenon from the wider social and cultural field (such as politics and economics) that gives it meaning. She states that people experience change as dramatic and complete, rather than as gradual and evolutionary. This sense of a dramatic break is expressed through <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> ideology.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> is a millenarian {{movement}} {{first described}} in Melanesia which encompasses {{a range of}} practices and occurs {{in the wake of}} contact with more technologically advanced societies. The name derives from the belief which began among Melanesians in the late 19th and early 20th century that various ritualistic acts such as the building of an airplane runway will result in the appearance of material wealth, particularly highly desirable Western goods (i.e., [...] "cargo"), via Western airplanes.|$|E
25|$|Contact with colonizing groups {{brought about}} a {{considerable}} transformation in the way indigenous peoples of Melanesia have thought about other societies. Early theories of <b>cargo</b> <b>cults</b> began from the assumption that practitioners simply failed to understand technology, colonization, or capitalist reform; in this model, <b>cargo</b> <b>cults</b> are a misunderstanding of the systems involved in resource distribution and an attempt to acquire such goods {{in the wake of}} interrupted trade. However, many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new social relationships, with material relations being secondary.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} the {{movement}} which presages features of later <b>cargo</b> <b>cults</b> is the so-called [...] "imitation of the white man". The leaders of the movement would drill the [...] {{as if they were}} soldiers, they enforced a curfew after the manner of regimented life at plantations, and they held a ceremony which looked {{for all intents and purposes}} like having tea in the European fashion. A table would be decorated with crotons, and food would be served for the participants to eat while sitting on stools. According to Francis Edgar Williams, the anthropologist who observed this, under no other circumstances would an indigenous person suffer through sitting at a table in this way. However, there was no explanation linking this to the ancestors, for instance. This illustrates another aspect of <b>cargo</b> <b>cults,</b> which is that some activities described as <b>cargo</b> <b>cults</b> could be rituals with secret meanings, or their description as such could be an outcome of the observer's expectation of secret meanings.|$|R

2500|$|The John Frum cult, one of {{the most}} widely {{reported}} and longest-lived, formed on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu. This movement started before the war, and became a <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> afterwards. Cult members worshiped certain unspecified Americans having the name [...] "John Frum" [...] or [...] "Tom Navy" [...] who they claimed had brought cargo to their island during World War II and who they identified as being the spiritual entity who would provide cargo to them in the future.|$|E
2500|$|Discussions {{of cargo}} cults usually {{begin with a}} series of {{movements}} that occurred {{in the late nineteenth century}} and early twentieth century. [...] The earliest recorded <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> was the Tuka Movement that began in Fiji in 1885 at the height of British colonial plantation era. The movement began with a promised return to a golden age of ancestral potency. Minor alterations to priestly practices were undertaken to update them and attempt to recover some kind of ancestral efficacy. Colonial authorities saw Tuka as a rebel, and he was exiled, although he kept returning.|$|E
2500|$|Symbols {{associated}} with Christianity and modern Western society {{tend to be}} incorporated into their rituals; for example the use of cross-shaped grave markers. Notable examples of <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> activity include the setting up of mock airstrips, airports, airplanes, offices, and dining rooms, {{as well as the}} fetishization and attempted construction of Western goods, such as radios made of coconuts and straw. Believers may stage [...] "drills" [...] and [...] "marches" [...] with sticks for rifles and use military-style insignia and national insignia painted on their bodies to make them look like soldiers, thereby treating the activities of Western military personnel as rituals to be performed for the purpose of attracting the cargo.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to a strong tendency in recent studies of Melanesian religious and political movements that want to discard the term 'cargo cult' for reasons of analytical—and ethical—inadequacy, this article argues that the term remains useful to delineate an empirical field for comparative purposes. Further, it suggests that the central moral and existential crisis that underlies <b>cargo</b> <b>cults</b> {{has to do with}} pressure on the traditional exchange system and concomitant notions of personhood and fairness. Finally, it argues that the study of <b>cargo</b> <b>cults</b> provides a vantage point for a culture-critical approach to Western society, as it challenges the sharp distinction between religious and economic values that makes it difficult to understand contemporary moral paradoxes...|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "cargo cult" [...] {{has been}} used metaphorically to {{describe}} an attempt to recreate successful outcomes by replicating circumstances associated with those outcomes, although those circumstances are either unrelated to the causes of outcomes or insufficient to produce them by themselves. [...] In the former case, this is an instance of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. The metaphorical use of [...] "cargo cult" [...] was popularized by physicist Richard Feynman at a 1974 Caltech commencement speech, which later became a chapter in his book Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!, where he coined the phrase [...] "cargo cult science" [...] to describe activity that {{had some of the}} trappings of real science (such as publication in scientific journals) but lacked a basis in honest experimentation. Later the term <b>cargo</b> <b>cult</b> programming developed to describe computer software containing elements that are included because of successful utilization elsewhere, unnecessary for the task at hand.|$|E

40|$|This DIIS {{working paper}} explores the current celebration of {{remittances}} in Tanzania as a magic bullet {{for the creation}} of development and economic growth.

Within the past few years, the Tanzanian state has started to think of remittances sent by the Tanzanian diaspora as an untapped source of investment and development potential. The paper argues that the celebration of remittances by Tanzanian politicians and bureaucrats is similar to the religious sects developing across Melanesia in the 1950 s and 1960 s - known as <b>cargo</b> <b>cults.</b> Both remittance thinking and policy formation in Tanzania and <b>cargo</b> <b>cults</b> celebrate the transformation of the local by the miraculous arrival of wealth and goods sent by relatives living...|$|R
