40|$|AbstractThe ITER {{cryoplant}} {{is composed}} of helium and nitrogen refrigerators and generator combined with 80  K helium loop plants and external purification systems. Storage and recovery of the helium inventory is provided in warm and cold (80  K and 4. 5  K) helium tanks. The conceptual design of the ITER cryoplant has been completed, the technical requirements defined for industrial procurement and contracts signed with industry. Each contract covers the design, manufacturing, installation and commissioning. Design is under finalization and manufacturing has started. First deliveries are scheduled by end of 2015. The various cryoplant systems are designed based on recognized codes and international standards to meet the availability, the reliability and the time between maintenance imposed by the long-term uninterrupted operation of the ITER Tokamak. In addition, ITER has to consider the constraint of a nuclear installation. ITER Organization (IO) {{is responsible for the}} liquid helium (LHe) Plants contract signed end of 2012 with industry. It {{is composed of}} three LHe Plants, working in parallel and able to provide a total average <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> of 75 <b>kW</b> at 4. 5 K. Based on concept designed developed with industries and the procurement phase, ITER has accumulated data to broaden the scaling laws for costing such systems. After describing the status of ITER cryoplant part of the cryogenic system, we shall present the economics of the ITER LHe Plants based on key design requirements, choice and challenges of this ITER Organization procurement...|$|R
40|$|Sweden has 352 ice rinks in {{operation}} which annually use approximately 1000 MWh. A refrigeration system usually {{accounts for about}} 43 % of the total energy consumption and can present a significant energy saving potential. More than 97 % of the Swedish ice rinks use indirect refrigeration system and thermo-physical properties of secondary fluid have {{a direct impact on}} the heat transfer and pressure drop. A theoretical model and two case studies focusing on the importance of the secondary fluid choice were investigated. The results showed that potassium formate had the best heat transfer properties while ammonia lead to the lowest pressure drops and pumping power. Propylene glycol showed the worst performance in both cases. Ammonia and potassium formate showed respectively 5 % and 3 % higher COP than calcium chloride for typical heat loads of 150 kW. When controlling the pump over a temperature difference (ΔT), the existence of the optimum pump control or optimum flow was highlighted. For typical <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> of 150 <b>kW</b> optimum pump control temperature difference ΔT was around 2, 5 K for calcium chloride and around 2 K for ammonia. Järfälla case study showed a potential energy saving of 12 % for the refrigeration system when increasing the freezing point of the secondary fluid. An energy saving of around 10, 8 MWh/yr per 1 K increase of the secondary fluid freezing point was found. QC 20171102 </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolar cooling {{has been}} proved to be {{technically}} feasible. It is particularly an attractive application for solar energy, because of the near coincidence of peak cooling loads with the available solar power. Currently, most of the solar cooling systems commonly used are the hot water driven lithium bromide absorption chillers. Solar absorption cooling systems are available from various reports, in large capacities up to several hundred kilowatts. In this paper, a minitype solar absorption cooling system was designed and installed in Shanghai Jiao tong University. The system mainly contains 96 m 2 solar collector arrays, one absorption chiller with the rated <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> of 8 <b>kW,</b> and a heat storage water storage tank of 3 m 3 in volume. The chilled water can be delivered either into fan coils or into radiant cooling panels which are installed to satisfy the indoor thermal environment of the test room. As for the fan coil cooling mode, {{it was found that}} the average cooling output reached 3. 62 kW during 8 h operation under typical weather condition of Shanghai. With regard to radiant cooling mode, an individual fresh air unit was installed for the purpose of preventing the cooling panels from condensation. Compared with the experimental results of the fan coil cooling mode, the average cooling output of the radiant cooling mode reached 4. 47 kW, which increased by 23. 5 %. Furthermore, the PMV inside the test room was between - 0. 5 and 0. 5, which showed great advantage in meeting the indoor thermal comfort...|$|R
40|$|Ejector {{refrigeration}} is {{a promising}} {{technology for the}} integration into solar driven cooling systems because of its relative simplicity and low initial cost. The major drawback of such a system is associated to its relatively low coefficient of performance (COP) under variable operating conditions. In order to overcome this problem, an advanced ejector was developed that changes its geometrical features depending on the upstream and downstream conditions. This paper provides a short overview of the development process and results of a small <b>cooling</b> <b>capacity</b> (1. 5 <b>kW)</b> solar driven cooling system using a variable geometry ejector. During the design steps, a number of theoretical works have been carried out, including {{the selection of the}} working fluid, the determination of the geometrical requirements and prototype design. Based on the analysis, R 600 a was selected as working fluid. A prototype was constructed with two independent variable geometrical factors: the area ratio and the nozzle exit position. A test rig was also assembled in order to test the ejector performance under controlled laboratory conditions and to elaborate a control algorithm for the variable geometry. Ejector performance was assessed by calculation of cooling cycle COP, entrainment ratio and critical back pressure. The results show that for a condenser pressure of 3 bar, an 80 % increase in the COP was obtained when compared to the performance of a fixed geometry ejector. Experimental COP values varied between 0. 4 and 0. 8, depending on operating conditions. Currently the cooling cycle is being integrated into a solar driven demonstration site for long term in situ assessment...|$|R
