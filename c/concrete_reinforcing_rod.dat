One example is a process based on the heat treatment undergone by the metal bars leaving the final stand of the rolling mill train. In this way, the mechanical and technological properties can be graduated, thereby enhancing strength (particularly yield point) without altering the deformability of the material. This procedure does away with the need to alter the chemical composition of the steel used to manufacture the rods. Process adjustment still relies on the experience of the production manager, however.

40|$|Abstract. Objectives Modern {{building}} codes prescribe {{the calculation of}} building structures {{taking into account the}} nonlinearity of deformation. To achieve this goal, the task is to develop a methodology for calculating prestressed <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams, taking into account physical and geometric nonlinearity. Methods The methodology is based on nonlinear calculation algorithms implemented and tested in the computation complex PRINS (a program for calculating engineering constructions) for other types of construction. As a tool for solving this problem, the finite element method is used. Non-linear calculation of constructions is carried out by the PRINS computational complex using the stepwise iterative method. In this case, an equation is constructed and solved at the loading step, using modified Lagrangian coordinates. Results The basic formulas necessary for both the formation and the solution of a system of nonlinear algebraic equations by the stepwise iteration method are given, taking into account the loading, unloading and possible additional loading. A method for simulating prestressing is described by setting the temperature action on the reinforcement and stressing steel rod. Different approaches to accounting for physical and geometric nonlinearity of <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beam <b>rods</b> are considered. A calculation example of a flat beam is given, in which the behaviour of the beam is analysed at various stages of its loading up to destruction. Conclusion A program is developed for the calculation of flat and spatially <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams taking into account the nonlinearity of deformation.

40|$|The use of fibre <b>reinforced</b> {{composite}} <b>rods</b> as <b>concrete</b> reinforcement material {{seems to}} be an effective solution to overcome durability problems of traditional steel <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> structures. The main advantages of fibre reinforced composite materials over steel include the excellent corrosive resistance, mechanical properties similar to steel, high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent fatigue resistance, among others [Alsayed et al, 2000], [Lees, J. M., 2001]. Typically, fibre <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> are produced by pultrusion, although, besides this technique, composite rods can also be produced using braiding techniques [Kadioglu, F. & Pidaparti, R. M., 2005], [Saikia, B. et al, 2005]. Braiding is a low cost technique that allows in-plane multiaxial orientation, conformability, excellent damage tolerance and core reinforcement [Soebroto et al, 1990], the production of ribbed structures and a wide range of mechanical properties may be improved when the core braided fabrics are reinforced with the appropriate type of fibres [Fangueiro et al, 2004, 2005 & 2006]. The current research work deals with the development of braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> for civil engineering applications, namely to <b>reinforce</b> <b>concrete</b> structures as a substitute of steel rebars. The mechanical properties of composite rods, produced by braiding, are influenced by the type of fibre used as braided fabric core reinforcement, among other parameters. The objective of this experimental work is to evaluate the influence of the type of core reinforcement fibres on the mechanical performance of braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods.</b> Several samples of braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> were produced using polyester fibres, for the production of braided fabrics, E-glass, carbon and HT polyethylene fibres, as braided fabrics core reinforcement, and polyester resin as polymeric matrix. Braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> were produced on a vertical braiding machine incorporating an impregnation system specially developed for this purpose. Different braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> were produced maintaining the braided fabric structure and varying the type of core reinforcement fibre. Composite <b>rods</b> were <b>reinforced</b> with a single type of reinforcement fibres as well as with two and three types of fibres, varying the percentage of each type. In order to evaluate the volume fraction of the different braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> produced, tests were performed according to the Portuguese Standard NP 2216 / 1988 (determination of mass loss by calcinations of glass fibre reinforced plastics). In order to evaluate the mechanical performance of the different braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> produced, tensile tests were carried out according to ASTM D 3916 - 94 standard, with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. A post-load of 50 KN was applied to the rods prior to performing the tensile tests. When compared to the steel rebars currently used in the construction industry, composite rods higher tensile strength. Current steel rebars, A 235 NL, A 400 NR/ER and A 500 NR/ER have values of tensile strength of 360 MPa, 460 MPa, and 550 MPa respectively. Composite rods present tensile strength higher than 550 MPa. Even though the tensile strength braided <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>rods</b> is higher than that of steel rebars, composite rods have a lower modulus of elasticity when compared with the 210 GPa of steel rebars...|$|R
