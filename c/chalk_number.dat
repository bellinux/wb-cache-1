2500|$|Each {{parachute}} infantry regiment (PIR), a unit {{of approximately}} 1800 men organized into three battalions, was transported by three or four serials, formations containing 36, 45, or 54 C-47s, and separated from each other by specific time intervals. The planes, sequentially designated within a serial by <b>chalk</b> <b>numbers</b> (literally <b>numbers</b> <b>chalked</b> on the airplanes to aid paratroopers in boarding the correct airplane), were organized into flights of nine aircraft, in a formation pattern called [...] "vee of vee's" [...] (vee-shaped elements of three planes arranged in a larger vee of three elements), with the flights flying one behind the other.

The flatboats were large enough to carry Conestoga wagons and other large vehicles. Due to the volume of traffic, however, wagons, freight, supplies and people often became backed-up in the river town, with waiting periods of several days to cross the river.

Eight shafts were fully excavated. They contained various deposits including antler, animal and human bone, flints and carved chalk. A single Grooved ware pottery sherd was recovered from one pit, and a later Beaker sherd was recovered from the fill of another pit. The henge had a single entrance on the northeast side.

One trunk attracted his attention by the extraordinary number of old travelling labels left on it. The porter was marking it at the moment--and the number was, '13 A.' Francis instantly looked at the card fastened on the lid. It bore the common English name, 'Mrs. James'! He at once inquired about the lady. She had arrived early that morning, and she was then in the Reading Room. Looking into the room, he discovered a lady in it alone.

The purpose of these projects is not merely to <b>chalk</b> up <b>numbers</b> but to provide data for a better understanding of quiltmaking as an important expression of identity and accomplishments of women. To those accustomed to think of quilts as bedcovers, pleasant but old-fashioned, this book will be a revelation.

40|$|During {{the sixth}} {{quarter of this}} {{research}} project the research team developed a method and the experimental procedures for acquiring the data needed for ultrasonic tomography of rock core samples under triaxial stress conditions as outlined in Task 10. Traditional triaxial compression experiments, where compressional and shear wave velocities are measured, provide little or no information about the internal spatial distribution of mechanical damage within the sample. The velocities measured between platen-to-platen or sensor-to-sensor reflects an averaging of all the velocities occurring along that particular raypath across {{the boundaries of the}} rock. The research team is attempting to develop and refine a laboratory equivalent of seismic tomography for use on rock samples deformed under triaxial stress conditions. Seismic tomography, utilized for example in crosswell tomography, allows an imaging of the velocities within a discrete zone within the rock. Ultrasonic or acoustic tomography is essentially the extension of that field technology applied to rock samples deforming in the laboratory at high pressures. This report outlines the technical steps and procedures for developing this technology for use on weak, soft chalk samples. Laboratory tests indicate that the chalk samples exhibit major changes in compressional and shear wave velocities during compaction. Since chalk is the rock type responsible for the severe subsidence and compaction in the North Sea it was selected for the first efforts at tomographic imaging of soft rocks. Field evidence from the North Sea suggests that compaction, which has resulted in over 30 feet of subsidence to date, is heterogeneously distributed within the reservoir. The research team will attempt to image this very process in chalk samples. The initial tomographic studies (Scott et al., 1994 a,b; 1998) were accomplished on well cemented, competent rocks such as Berea sandstone. The extension of the technology to weaker samples is more difficult but potentially much more rewarding. The chalk, since it is a weak material, also attenuates wave propagation more than other rock types. Three different types of sensors were considered (and tested) for the tomographic imaging project: 600 KHz PZT, 1 MHz PZT, and PVDF film sensors. 600 KHz PZT crystals were selected because they generated a sufficiently high amplitude pulse to propagate across the damaged <b>chalk.</b> A <b>number</b> of different configurations were considered for placement of the acoustic arrays. It was decided after preliminary testing that the most optimum arrangement of the acoustic sensors was to place three arrays of sensors, with each array containing twenty sensors, around the sample. There would be two horizontal arrays to tomographically image two circular cross-sectional planes through the rock core sample. A third array would be vertically oriented to provide a vertical cross-sectional view of the sample. A total of 260 acoustic raypaths would be shot and acquired in the horizontal acoustic array to create each horizontal tomographic image. The sensors can be used as both acoustic sources or as acoustic each of the 10 pulsers to the 10 receivers...|$|R
40|$|All {{the samples}} yielded {{relatively}} abundant palynofloras; allochthonous palynomorphs of Carboniferous, Jurassic, Cretaceous, ?Palaeogene and Quaternary age are present. The organic contents of these associations are similar, hence the succession studied is interpreted {{as belonging to}} the same genetic unit. Carboniferous spores are normally the predominant component. The most common Carboniferous spores are Densosporites spp. and Lycospora pusilla, but other forms were also recognised. The majority of these spores are consistent with input from the Namurian-Westphalian interval and this association of Namurian and Westphalian forms {{is typical of the}} Quaternary of the UK. These spores were most likely to be derived from the Pennines, north-east England or southern Scotland. Jurassic miospores and microplankton are also present in relatively large proportions throughout, with miospores being more abundant than microplankton. The presence of key pollen genera indicates the incorporation of Toarcian and Mid-Late Jurassic strata respectively. This configuration is mirrored by the microplankton, which is indicative of input from the late Pliensbachian-early Toarcian. The remainder of the Jurassic dinoflagellate cysts are indicative of input from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation. No late Kimmeridgian markers were observed, hence the majority of this input is probably from the Lower Kimmeridge Clay Formation. The source of this reworking is probably from the East Midlands Shelf and/or the Yorkshire Basin. Cretaceous palynomorphs were generally recorded in small numbers and most of these forms are relatively long-ranging dinoflagellate cysts. Some stratigraphically diagnostic dinoflagellate cysts were observed however, and these are indicative of the Hauterivian/Barremian interval. They are probably locally-derived from, for example, the Tealby Clay and/or the Tealby Limestone. Some of the longer ranging forms such as Odontochitina operculata may be from the Chalk Group. The previous discussion refers to the matrix of the till. Individual clasts of Chalk from four of the samples proved organically sparse. These associations are hence likely to be from the Lower and/or Middle <b>Chalk</b> Group. Low <b>numbers</b> of possible Palaeogene dinoflagellate cysts were recorded from samples 6 and 3 and these may represent the reworking of Palaeogene strata from the North Sea Basin. Typically Quaternary pollen is present and these elements were probably derived locally. Non age-diagnostic palynomorphs are also consistently present. The Welton Till yielded the lowest proportion of Carboniferous spores, generally high levels of Cretaceous dinoflagellate cysts and the highest proportions of non age-diagnostic palynomorphs. The Calcethorpe Till appears to have a low palynological productivity and the Marsh Till is dominated by Carboniferous and Jurassic miospores...|$|R
