25|$|Further, from 1995 {{designs were}} {{required}} {{to be drawn from}} a reference plane (template), and strict limitations were enforced as to the minimum and maximum tolerances for aspects of the vehicle such as the size of the cockpit opening (an idea well known in Champ Car for a decade) and of aerodynamic devices, commonly called wings. Further, maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.5 litres to 3 litres. Further changes were mandated as the FIA continued to try to curb the increase in speeds of Formula One cars as the years progressed. These changes included the increase in size of the cockpit opening (to ensure driver egress was easy and to minimise possible side head impacts), introducing grooved tyres (to reduce cornering speeds by reducing grip) and narrower bodywork (this would complicate cooling and also reduce <b>cornering</b> <b>speed),</b> raising and reducing wing sizes and elements (cutting aerodynamic downforce, thus reducing <b>cornering</b> <b>speed),</b> and introducing comprehensive checks on stiffness tolerances and measurements to ensure cars conformed completely with the regulations (for example, weight tests on wings and bodywork to ensure that they maintained integrity and did not flex to give an aerodynamic advantage in a straight line).|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} in {{darkness}} McLaren merged with Ron Dennis's Formula Two Project-4 team. The McLaren MP4/1 (McLaren Project-4) introduced the first carbon fiber composite chassis in 1981, an innovation which, despite initial doubts over its likely performance in a crash, had been taken up by all the teams {{by the middle of}} the decade. The use of carbon fibre composite in place of aluminium honeycomb produced cars that were significantly lighter, yet also far stiffer which improved grip and therefore <b>cornering</b> <b>speed.</b> Significant skepticism regarding the use of carbon fiber chassis remained, but John Watson's 1981 crash in the MP4/1 showed that the new technology was sufficiently safe, with the violent accident leaving Watson unscathed, where similar previous incidents had resulted in death or serious injury.|$|E

5000|$|Both turn rate, (degrees per second), {{and turn}} radius, (diameter of the turn), {{increase}} with speed, until the [...] "corner speed" [...] is reached. At this point, the growing turn radius begins {{to decrease the}} turn rate, so the aircraft will reach its best turn performance at its particular <b>corner</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>Corner</b> <b>speed</b> {{is defined as the}} minimum speed at which the maximum sustainable g-force load can be generated (the load at which power equals drag), and varies with the fighter's structural design, weight (including added weight from missiles, drop-tanks, etc...), and thrust capabilities. It often falls in the area of 250 - 400 kn. The maximum sustainable-load the aircraft can generate also varies, but is typically between 3 and 5 g's. At the <b>corner</b> <b>speed,</b> the fighter can attain its maximum turn-rate, flying the craft just at the edge of buffeting (the turbulence preceding a stall). Below this speed, the aircraft will be limited to flying at lower g's, resulting in a decrease in turn rate. If the pilot attempts to [...] "pull" [...] more g's, the aircraft will buffet and aerodynamically stall. On the other hand, if the fighter is flown above its <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> {{it will be able to}} pull higher g's, but doing so will cause it to lose airspeed from the excess drag created. Turning at the maximum sustainable-load at <b>speeds</b> above the <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> will result in an increase in turn radius which, respectively, will cause a decrease in turn rate.|$|R
500|$|The Malaysian {{race was}} the first at which the tyre {{compounds}} used on the cars were differentiated by a white stripe painted in the tyre treads. Since {{the beginning of the}} 2007 Formula One season, teams had been obliged to use two different kinds of tyre on each car during the race: a 'prime' tyre and an 'option' tyre. The prime tyre has a harder rubber compound and the option tyre a softer one. In general terms, a softer tyre is likely to grip better and provide a higher <b>cornering</b> <b>speed.</b> Conversely, a harder tyre will often be slower, but may last longer. Formula One cars typically use between two and four sets of tyres during a race and using harder tyres may allow fewer pit stops to change tyres. Track conditions, the car characteristics or driving style can reduce or even reverse these differences. In Australia two weeks earlier, the softer tyres were marked with a small white circle to facilitate understanding of each driver's tyre strategy, but commentators and spectators were unable to distinguish the two compounds even at slow speeds. The idea of the white stripe was tested during the test session a week before the Malaysian round of the season. The white stripe was applied with paint marker pens. Over the weekend 160 pens were used. Overall reaction to this system was positive, with the Williams team's technical director Sam Michael, {{who came up with the}} initial idea, calling it a [...] "pretty good solution".|$|E
500|$|Schumacher won six of {{the first}} seven races and was leading the , before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear. Schumacher {{finished}} the race in second place. Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence {{that it had been}} used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of [...] "launch control" [...] that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. However, there was no evidence to suggest that this software was actually used. [...] At the , Schumacher was penalised for overtaking on the formation lap. He then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag, which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team. Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the [...] after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skidblock, a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence <b>cornering</b> <b>speed.</b> Benetton protested that the skidblock had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb, but the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block. These incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap, and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race in Australia. On lap 36 Schumacher hit the guardrail {{on the outside of the}} track while leading. Hill attempted to pass, but as Schumacher's car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire. As a result, Schumacher won a very controversial championship, the first German to do so (Jochen Rindt raced under the Austrian flag). At the FIA conference after the race, the new World Champion dedicated his title to Ayrton Senna.|$|E

2500|$|The {{other major}} factor {{controlling}} the <b>cornering</b> <b>speed</b> {{of the cars}} is {{the design of the}} tyres.

Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the <b>cornering</b> <b>speed</b> of the cars. Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the [...] season. Suspension is double wishbone or multilink front and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis – one exception being that of the 2009 specification Red Bull Racing car (RB5) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first car to do so since the Minardi PS01 in 2001. Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their [...] car. Both Ferrari (F138) and McLaren (MP4-28) of the 2013 season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear.|$|E

[...] The Swiss Federal Railways Tilt Train RABDe 500 (InterCityNeigezug) also achieves this norm, but the train itself was given the designation R. [...] Technically, locomotives of the class R can also operate to the standards of class N, but in practice the maximum cornering speeds are lower, to improve passenger comfort by reducing lateral forces.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>cornering</b> <b>speed</b> of Formula One cars {{is largely}} {{determined}} by the aerodynamic downforce that they generate, which pushes the car down onto the track. This is provided by [...] "wings" [...] mounted at {{the front and rear}} of the vehicle, and by ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance and the current generation of cars sport a large number of small winglets, [...] "barge boards", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the wheelbase increase (47mm), overall length has increased by [...] and track [...] by [...] The bodywork and aerodynamics have been altered to offer maximum down-force, featuring a longer front bonnet with flaps, a closed underbody and a new rear overhang with adjustable rear wing and race-derived diffuser. These are intended to translate into increased aerodynamic efficiency and down-force for maximum <b>cornering</b> <b>speed.</b> It is {{also noted that the}} car's new rear bodywork is minimal in the extreme, being composed mostly of vent. This is thought to be symptomatic of the need to keep the engine cool enough, even under hard track use. Again, this is similar to the gutted bodywork of the Ferrari FXX Evoluzione.|$|E
2500|$|While {{significant}} changes {{could not be}} made to cars in 1994, the FIA required all Formula One cars' airboxes to be perforated to reduce their [...] "ram-air" [...] effect, to reduce power. For the same reason special racing fuels, previously an exotic mixture of benzenes and toluenes, were banned and only those with similar characteristics to everyday unleaded petrol would be permitted. To reduce downforce, and therefore the <b>cornering</b> <b>speed</b> of the cars, a wooden [...] "plank" [...] was to be fitted beneath the central portion of the chassis, forcing a large section of the floor further away from the track. If the plank was worn over a certain tolerance (approximately 10mm), the car would be deemed illegal. This wooden plank remains under F1 cars today.|$|E

50|$|The ARES {{has very}} good turning {{performance}} {{as a result of}} low wing loading. Its turn rate is 32 degree/second at 6G and 36 degree/second at 7G (the structure is limited to 8G). The <b>corner</b> <b>speed</b> is 210 kt (390 km/h) the stall speed is 78 kt (145 km/h).|$|R

5000|$|During testing [...] in 2009 it {{was found}} that the new ETR 610 trains were too heavy for the main Gotthard route from Zurich to Milan for which they had been ordered.

50|$|There {{were also}} two changes {{implemented}} to the cars {{in order to}} reduce <b>cornering</b> <b>speeds.</b> The first was the reduction of the cars' track, from 2.15 m to 2 m; the second was a considerable reduction in tyre width (particularly the rears), so as to provide less grip than the previously 'fat' slicks.|$|R
