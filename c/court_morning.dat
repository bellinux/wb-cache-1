50|$|In the Ming dynasty, the Emperor held <b>morning</b> <b>court</b> {{sessions}} at the Gate of Supreme Harmony to discuss state affairs with his ministers, although {{throughout most of}} the Ming dynasty the court sessions were purely ceremonial, a demonstration of the Emperors diligence and the status of the titular first minister. In the Qing dynasty, when the Emperor attended court far more frequently, <b>morning</b> <b>court</b> sessions were held at the Gate of Heavenly Purity, which is much closer to the Emperors living quarters. The Gate of Supreme Harmony was used occasionally for banquets and other ceremonies.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you both press and public were {{literally}} flabbergasted. You see, Mr. Errington was a well-known and very popular member of a certain smart section of London society.

60|$|In {{the brief}} silence that {{followed}} I could hear the windows rattle under {{the impact of the}} driving snow and the eerie scream of the blast.

60|$|July 6.--I {{did little}} this morning but correct some sheets, {{and was at}} the <b>Court</b> all <b>morning.</b> About two I called at Mr. Cadell's, and I learned the {{dividend}} was arranged. Sir Adam fell in with us, and laid anchors to windward to get an invitation to Cockenzie for next year, being struck with my life-like description of a tiled haddock. I came home much fagged, slept for half-an-hour (I don't like this lethargy), read I Promessi Sposi, and was idle. Miss Kerr dined and gave us music.|$|R

60|$|The committal {{was read}} out, and Bernard Maddison {{was removed from}} the court. On the {{following}} day he was to be taken to York, there to be tried at the forthcoming assizes. Mr. Thurwell bade him keep up his courage in a tone which, though it was intended to be cheerful, was not particularly sanguine. There was but one opinion in the court, and despite all his efforts its influence had a certain effect upon him. But Bernard Maddison never carried himself more proudly than when he bowed to Lord Lathon, and left the <b>court</b> that <b>morning.</b>|$|R
60|$|The term had commenced, and my {{guardian}} {{found an}} intimation from Mr. Kenge {{that the cause}} would come on in two days. As I had sufficient hopes of the will {{to be in a}} flutter about it, Allan and I agreed {{to go down to the}} <b>court</b> that <b>morning.</b> Richard was extremely agitated and was so weak and low, though his illness was still of the mind, that my dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported.

60|$|When Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve left Spa, he {{left with}} a ruddy glow of {{recovered}} health on his bronzed red cheek; for in spite of anxiety and repentance and doubt, the man's iron frame would somehow still assert itself. When he took his seat on the bench in <b>court</b> that <b>morning,</b> he looked so haggard and ill with fatigue and remorse that even Elma Clifford herself pitied him. A hushed whisper ran round among the spectators below that the judge wasn't fit to try the case before him. And indeed he wasn't. For {{it was his own}} trial, not Guy Waring's, he was really presiding over.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{close that}} it almost {{looks as if}} it had been shaved. Exactly. That is what struck me most when I elbowed my way into the <b>court</b> that <b>morning</b> and first caught sight of the millionaire in the dock. He was a tall, soldierly-looking man, upright in stature, his face very bronzed and tanned. He wore neither {{moustache}} nor beard, his hair was cropped quite close to his head, like a Frenchman's; but, of course, what was so very remarkable about him was that total absence of eyebrows and even eyelashes, which gave the face such a peculiar appearance--as you say, a perpetually astonished look.|$|R
5000|$|M'Naghten {{appeared}} at the Bow Street magistrates' <b>court</b> the <b>morning</b> after the assassination attempt.

They follow, persecute me wherever I go, and have entirely destroyed my peace of mind... It can be proved by evidence. That is all I have to say." [...] It was indeed {{all he had to}} say. He never spoke about the assassination again (apart from a dozen words when asked to plead guilty or not guilty at arraignment).|$|R
