50|$|Silvaplana {{is located}} on Lake Silvaplana in the Upper Engadine Oberengadin. Before 2017, it was located in the Oberengadin sub-district of the Maloja, after 2017 {{it was part of}} the Maloja Region. Above the village at 2284 m, the Julier Pass connects the Engadine valley to the rest of Graubünden and the Rhine watershed. While the stream Ova dal Vallun, which connects Lake Silvaplana and Lake <b>Champfèr,</b> runs through the village, it {{consists}} of the village of Silvaplana and the hamlets of Surlej and Albana, as well as part of the village of <b>Champfèr.</b>|$|E
50|$|Probably built circa 1820, the Campbell House is a two-story, gable-roofed frame {{building}} on dry-laid stone foundation. The exterior stone chimneys have stuccoed brick stacks. The 3x2 bay {{main body of}} the house is complemented by a shed porch across the front and shed rooms across the rear. Both front and rear doors are replacements, but the windows still retain 6/6 sash. The front porch is nicely detailed with flush siding, bold <b>champfered</b> posts with lambs' tongues, and molded railing.|$|R
50|$|Original doors sash windows {{skirting}} tiling and banisters {{are present}} inside. The original corniced {{ceiling of the}} main hall is currently concealed by a lowered fake ceiling. Platform 3 has kept its original canopy with its elaborate cast iron brackets which depict cherries. some of the original <b>champfered</b> wood and cast iron supports of the original canopy survive on platform 2 {{although it has been}} crudely extended width onto the front of the original canopy in the early 20th century.|$|R

50|$|The Restaurant Talvo is a {{traditional}} gourmet restaurant in a historic building at the Via Gunels {{in the village of}} <b>Champfèr</b> in the Engadin in Switzerland. For a certain time the restaurant was once managed by the Badrutt's Palace Hotel.|$|E
5000|$|Before 2017, the {{municipality}} {{was located in}} the Oberengadin sub-district of the Maloja district, after 2017 {{it was part of}} the Maloja Region. It consists of the settlements of St. Moritz-Dorf (elev. [...] ), Bad (...) , <b>Champfèr</b> (...) , and the village section of Suvretta.|$|E
5000|$|The {{etymology}} of <b>Champfèr</b> is unclear. One {{possibility is}} that it is based on a glacier. In 1129, its name was [...] "Campofare", in 1471, Campher, and in 1519 Chiamfer (from Campus ferri). Another explanation could be that the name is meant to say fruitful fields or meadows, chan'ver.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Champfèr</b> (...) is {{a village}} in the Upper Engadin valley of the canton of Graubünden, Switzerland. The Western part of the village belongs to the {{municipality}} of Silvaplana {{and part of the}} village belongs to the municipality of St. Moritz. The two halves of the town are separated by the creek Ova da Suvretta.|$|E

50|$|Lake Silvaplana (Silvaplanersee; Lej da Silvaplauna) is a {{lake in the}} Upper-Engadine {{valley of}} Grisons, Switzerland. It {{takes its name from}} the village of Silvaplana. The lake is also {{connected}} to the nearby Lej da <b>Champfèr.</b> Together with its larger neighbour, Lake Sils, it is among the largest lakes of the Grisons. Lake Silvaplana is overlooked by several mountains over 3,000 metres, notably Piz Corvatsch, Piz Julier and Piz Surlej. The lake's drainage basin culminates at Piz Corvatsch (3,451 m) and comprises several glaciers, the largest being the Vadret dal Tremoggia.|$|E
5000|$|For three {{weekends}} every February, horse {{races are}} {{held on the}} frozen lake. This races called [...] "White Turf" [...] are held since 1907 and brings the wealthy tourists to the lake for champagne and betting. This is also the location, where sports enthusiasts invented the sport of skijoring. In this type of race, thoroughbred horses compete without riders on their backs, but instead skiers in tow. While the sport is also played in other alpine countries, it still is mainly found in the region in which it as originated. The sport has evolved since the first race in 1906; the race as held on the road from St. Moritz to <b>Champfer</b> and as won by the President of Alpina Ski Club Philip Mark and his horse Blitz (German for lightning). Today, the race is run similar to other horse races, with all horses starting {{at the same time}} and running around the track. Steering is very difficult complicating the race significantly requiring great strength and skill on behalf of the athletes. The skier with the most points after the three races on consequitive Sundays is crowned the [...] "King of the Engadin Valley". In addition to skijoring, traditional flat and trotting races over different distances are held. Until recently visitor parking was also located on the lake, but this practice has since been prohibited.|$|E
40|$|To {{reconstruct}} the vegetation {{history of the}} Upper Engadine, continuous sediment cores covering the past 11 800 years from Lej da <b>Champfer</b> and Lej da San Murezzan (Upper Engadine Valley, c. 1800 m a. s. l., southeastern Switzerland) have been analysed for pollen and plant macrofossils. The chronologies of the cores are based on 16 and 22 radiocarbon dates, respectively. The palaeobotanical records of both lakes are in agreement for the Holocene, but remarkable differences exist between the sites during the period 11 100 to 10 500 cal. BP, when Lej da <b>Champfer</b> was affected by re-sedimentation processes. Macrofossil data suggest that Holocene afforestation began at around 11400 cal. BP. A climatic deterioration, the Preboreal Oscillation, stopped and subsequently delayed the establishment of trees until c. 11000 cal. BP, when first Betula, then Pinus sylvestrislmugo, then Larix 300 years later, and finally Pinus cembra expanded within the lake catchment. Treeline was at c. 1500 m during the Younger Dryas (12 542 - 11 550 cal. BP) in the Central Alps. Our results, along with other macrofossil studies from the Alps, suggest a nearly simultaneous afforestation (e. g., by Pinus sylvestris in the lower subalpine belt) between 1500 and 2340 m a. s. l. at around 11 400 to 11 300 cal. BP. We suggest that forest-limit species (e. g., Pinus cembra, Larix decidua) could expand faster at today's treeline (c. 2350 m a. s. l.), than 550 m lower. Earlier expansions at higher altitudes probably resulted from reduced competition with low-altitude trees (e. g. Pinus sylvestris) and herbaceous species. Comparison with other proxies such as oxygen isotopes, residual A 14 C, glacier fluctuations, and alpine climatic cooling phases suggests climatic sensitivity of vegetation during the early Holocene...|$|E
