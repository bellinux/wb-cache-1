40|$|Conventional full-waveform {{inversion}} (FWI) {{using the}} least-squares norm (L^ 2) as a misfit function {{is known to}} suffer from <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping.</b> This {{increases the risk of}} computing a local rather than the global minimum of the misfit. In our previous work, we proposed the quadratic Wasserstein metric (W_ 2) as a new misfit function for FWI. The W_ 2 metric has been proved to have many ideal properties with regards to convexity and insensitivity to noise. When the observed and predicted seismic data are regarded as two density functions, the quadratic Wasserstein metric corresponds to the optimal cost of rearranging one density into the other, where the transportation cost is quadratic in distance. The difficulty of transforming seismic signals into nonnegative density functions is discussed. Unlike the L^ 2 norm, W_ 2 measures not only amplitude differences, but also global phase shifts, which helps to avoid <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> issues. In this work, we build on our earlier method to cover more realistic high-resolution applications by embedding the W_ 2 technique into the framework of the adjoint-state method and applying it to seismic relevant 2 D examples: the Camembert, the Marmousi, and the 2004 BP models. We propose a new way of using the W_ 2 metric trace-by-trace in FWI and compare it to global W_ 2 via the solution of the Monge-Ampère equation. With corresponding adjoint source, the velocity model can be updated using the l-BFGS method. Numerical results show the effectiveness of W_ 2 for alleviating <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> issues and sensitivity to noise. Both mathematical theory and numerical examples demonstrate that the quadratic Wasserstein metric is a good candidate for a misfit function in seismic inversion.

Stellate cells drive inhibitory interneurons to cause rebound from inhibition in an alternating set of stellate cells that drive interneurons to activate {{the first set of}} cells.

As a result, monotone frequencies tend to be dominant in the waveforms recorded by some OBSs. Since these waveforms are intrinsically similar to each other, CC values are artificially high.

40|$|International audienceFull {{waveform}} inversion {{using the}} conventional L 2 distance {{to measure the}} misfit between seismograms is known to suffer from <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping.</b> An alternative strategy is proposed in this study, based on {{a measure of the}} misfit computed with an optimal transport distance. This measure allows to account for the lateral coherency of events within the seismograms, instead of considering each seismic trace independently, as is done generally in full waveform inversion. The computation of this optimal transport distance relies on a particular mathematical formulation allowing for the non-conservation of the total energy between seismograms. The numerical solution of the optimal transport problem is performed using proximal splitting techniques. Three synthetic case studies are investigated using this strategy: the Marmousi 2 model, the BP 2004 salt model, and the Chevron 2014 benchmark data. The results emphasize interesting properties of the optimal transport distance. The associated misfit function is less prone to <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping.</b> A workflow is designed to reconstruct accurately the salt structures in the BP 2004 model, starting from an initial model containing no information about these structures. A high-resolution P-wave velocity estimation is built from the Chevron 2014 benchmark data, following a frequency continuation strategy. This estimation explains accurately the data. Using the same workflow, full waveform inversion based on the L 2 distance converges towards a local minimum. These results yield encouraging perspectives regarding the use of the optimal transport distance for full waveform inversion: the sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial model is reduced, the reconstruction of complex salt structure is made possible, the method is robust to noise, and the interpretation of seismic data dominated by reflections is enhanced...|$|R
40|$|Conventional full-waveform seismic {{inversion}} {{attempts to}} find {{a model of the}} subsurface that is able to predict observed seismic waveforms exactly; it proceeds by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted data directly, iterating in a series of linearized steps from an assumed starting model.

Adaptive waveform inversion (AWI) provides a new form of full-waveform inversion (FWI) that appears to be immune to the problems otherwise generated by <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping.</b> In this method, least-squares convolutional filters are designed that transform the predicted data into the observed data. The inversion problem is formulated such that the subsurface model is iteratively updated to force these Wiener filters toward zero-lag delta functions. As that is achieved, the predicted data evolve toward the observed data and the assumed model evolves toward the true model. This new method is able to invert synthetic data successfully, beginning from starting models and under conditions for which conventional FWI fails entirely. AWI has a similar computational cost to conventional FWI per iteration, and it appears to converge at a similar rate. The principal advantages of this new method are that it allows waveform inversion to begin from less-accurate starting models, does not require the presence of low frequencies in the field data, and appears to provide a better balance between the influence of refracted and reflected arrivals upon the final-velocity model.

40|$|Least-squares {{inversion}} of seismic arrivals can provide remarkably detailed {{models of the}} Earth's subsurface. However, <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> associated with these oscillatory arrivals is the main cause for local minima in the least-squares objective function. Therefore, {{it is often difficult}} for descent methods to converge to the solution without an accurate initial large-scale velocity estimate. The low frequencies in the arrivals, needed to update the large-scale components in the velocity model, are usually unreliable or absent. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a multi-objective inversion scheme that uses the conventional least-squares functional along with an auxiliary data-domain objective. As the auxiliary objective effectively replaces the seismic arrivals by bumps, we call it the bump functional. The bump functional minimization can be made far less sensitive to <b>cycle</b> <b>skipping</b> and can deal with multiple arrivals in the data. However, it can only be used as an auxiliary objective since it usually does not provide a unique model after minimization even when the regularized-least-squares functional has a unique global minimum and hence a unique solution. The role of the bump functional during the multi-objective inversion is to guide the optimization towards the global minimum by pulling the trapped solution out of the local minima associated with the least-squares functional whenever necessary. The computational complexity of the bump functional is equivalent to that of the least-squares functional. In this paper, we describe various characteristics of the bump functional using simple and illustrative numerical examples. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective inversion scheme by considering more realistic examples. These include synthetic and field data from a cross-well experiment, surface-seismic synthetic data with reflections and synthetic data with refracted arrivals at long offsets.

This multiscale process required defining low-frequency augmented signals to seed the frequency sweep at zero frequency. Custom adjoint sources were then defined from the warped waveforms. The new method, referred to as registration-guided least-squares, was successfully applied to a few scenarios of model velocity estimation in the transmission setting.
