It is built of stone with large voussoirs and retaining walls of <b>coursed</b> <b>masonry</b> and is 7.4 m wide with triangular buttresses. The brook was culverted in about 1805 and Store Street was built over it. The canal is about 4.6 m wide and 1.45 m deep.

50|$|Elliston Castle {{measured}} 42 ft by 33 ft, with {{end walls}} around 9 ft thick and side walls around 6 ft thick. Built before the regular use of canons, gun-ports {{have been discovered}} in the walls. The walls were still 20 ft to 30 ft high in 1836, however by 1856 {{the north and south}} walls stood only stood at that height. Low courtyard walls of a rectangular shape were present in 1856. The castle's tower was rectangular, built with rough <b>coursed</b> <b>masonry.</b> A vaulted basement existed and in the thickened south-eastern wall a stairway and mural chamber may have existed. The end walls probably had opposing arched windows.|$|E
5000|$|The wall, an {{impressive}} example of standing Roman masonry, is dated to approximately 125-30 AD, {{and so is}} nearly 2000 years old. It measures 23 metres (75 ft) long, 8 metres (26 ft) high and 2.5 metres (8 ft) thick. It is among the largest pieces of surviving civil Roman architecture in Britain, and {{is comparable to the}} [...] "Old Work" [...] at Wroxeter. The structure comprises alternate bands of Roman brick and <b>coursed</b> <b>masonry,</b> of local granite, limestone and sandstone. In the centre of the wall are two large arched openings about 3 metres (10 ft) wide and 4 metres (13 ft) high; and there are further arched alcoves on the eastern side.|$|E
50|$|The {{village had}} a church by AD 1074. The current Church of England parish church of Saint Mary {{may have been}} rebuilt {{in the latter part}} of the 15th century, but only the Perpendicular Gothic tower survives from that time. Major repairs to the roof and south aisle were made in 1668 and 1769, but by the 1860s the nave and chancel were in a poor {{condition}} again. The architect Thomas Talbot Bury, a pupil of A.W.N. Pugin, demolished all except the tower in 1865, and rebuilt them in a Gothic Revival interpretation of Perpendicular Gothic. This Victorian building has extremely regular <b>coursed</b> <b>masonry,</b> which departs conspicuously from the traditional Medieval rubble masonry of the tower and, presumably, the previous church building. Bury preserved only a handful of features from the Medieval church: a Perpendicular Gothic window in the north wall of the chancel, a piscina, a tomb recess and a 13th-century effigy of a priest.|$|E

50|$|The watchtower was {{the last}} of the series of Mary Colter-designed visitor {{concession}} structures at the Grand Canyon until her renovation of the Bright Angel Lodge in 1935. The tower was designed to resemble an Ancient Pueblo Peoples watchtower, but its size dwarfs any known Pueblan-built tower. The closest prototypes for such a structure may be found at Hovenweep National Monument. The structure is composed of a circular <b>coursed</b> <b>masonry</b> tower rising from a rubble base. The base was intentionally designed to convey a partly ruinous appearance, perhaps of an older structure on which the watchtower was later built. The base is arranged within a large circle with the tower to the north. Tiny windows are irregularly disposed, some of which are themselves irregular in shape. The main space is the Kiva Room in the base structure, apparently roofed with logs that were salvaged from the old Grandview Hotel. The ceiling is a false structure concealing the roof structure that supports an observation deck. The Kiva Room features a fireplace with a large picture window directly above where the chimney would ordinarily go. Smoke is drawn away through an offset, concealed flue. The room still contains its original furnishings, which are part of the historic designation. A separate, apparently ruinous structure was actually built in that form to provide a storage place for firewood.|$|E
40|$|At present {{only limited}} {{evaluation}} of multi-leaf <b>coursed</b> <b>masonry</b> is {{possible with the}} help of current standards. In the present work the load bearing performance of multi-leaf constructions, the external leaves of which consist of raw rubble stone of in regular layer bonding shall be experimentally and theoretically investigated. The experiments demonstrate that the failure loads are a function of the ratio of the stone height to the joint thickness and that the external leaves of a multi-leaf body of masonry having an internal leaves of test pieces without grouting. In order to verify this performance a failure criterion was devised for the single-leaf wall and/or the external leaves of the multi-leaf wall consisting of ashlar or random rubble. This failure criterion takes into consideration both building stone and mortar failure. Thus the influence of individual material and geometry parameters can be more easily evaluated. (orig.)

40|$|The {{strengthening}} and {{stabilization of}} damaged compressed masonry columns with composites based on fabrics of high-strength fibers and epoxy resin, or polymer-modified cement mixtures, belongs to novel, partially non-invasive and reversible progressive methods. The stabilizing and reinforcing {{effect of these}} fabrics significantly applies to masonry structures under concentric compressive loading whose failure mechanism {{is characterized by the}} appearance and development of vertical tensile cracks accompanied by an increase in horizontal masonry strain. During the appearance of micro and hairline cracks (10 − 3 to 10 − 1 mm), the effect of non-pre-stressed wrapping composite is very small. The favorable effect of passive wrapping is only intensively manifested after the appearance of cracks (10 − 1 mm and bigger) at higher loading levels. In the case of “optimum” reinforcement of a masonry column, the experimental research showed an increase in vertical displacements δy (up to 247 %), horizontal displacements δx (up to 742 %) and ultimate load-bearing capacity (up to 136 %) compared to the values reached in unreinforced masonry columns. In the case of masonry structures in which no intensive “bed joint filler–masonry unit” interaction occurs, e. g., in regular <b>coursed</b> <b>masonry</b> with little differences in the mechanical characteristics of masonry units and the binder, the reinforcing effect of the fabric applies only partially...|$|E
