25|$|Non-Mandarin Chinese {{language}} speakers {{have complained}} that their <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> study two foreign languages — English and Mandarin. This is contrasted to a possible alternative policy of English and their native language, and that the emphasis on Mandarin threatens family ties, as older generations are often not conversant in Mandarin (unless it is their native tongue). Some critics include that the Mandarin education system's goal of promoting cultural identity has left many younger generations of Mandarin speakers unable to communicate with their non-Mandarin Chinese language-speaking grandparents.|$|E
25|$|Society in Willow Bunch {{has changed}} {{dramatically}} over time. The school is closed down so <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> attend school in Coronach and Assiniboia. Graduation rates are higher because girls have fewer duties at home and attending school is free. Most women now have employment outside of their homes. Fewer families make a living by farming and people in Willow Bunch often find work in neighbouring towns. Since most of their day is spent outside of Willow Bunch they tend to buy necessary items, such as groceries, elsewhere. This has affected the town greatly and businesses in Willow Bunch have suffered and even shut down because of this change.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, {{school fees}} for grades 1 to 10 were officially {{abolished}} but hidden costs remained. Other costs include loss of children's wages or unpaid labour for agriculture, tending livestock or housework. Whether children work depends on relative household wealth. Labour-intensive assets such as farms can hire labour if they generate sufficient profit but poorer households may need {{their children to}} help with these assets. This can relate to family size, with larger families sending their younger children to school because older children can help their parents. Attendance is reduced when <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel long distances to school since this increases personal risk and transport costs. There are also cultural attitudes against educating girls since education will only benefit her husband's household.|$|E

From outside, they hear an explosion, as Tony attacks the house. Fighting his way through the grounds, he kills Sosa's security people, before shooting and killing Sheffield. Heading further into the estate, he kills Gomez. Eventually, he confronts Sosa, who tells Tony he warned him not to betray him, but Tony did, referring to the planned assassination of a journalist which Tony refused to carry out because there were children in the journalist's car. Sosa says that in their business, sometimes <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be killed. Tony then kills him. As he leaves the mansion, Tony finds one of Sosa's men still alive. The survivor begs for his life, and Tony offers him a job.|$|E

There has been an increase in acknowledgment that a child who is exposed to domestic abuse during their upbringing will suffer developmental and psychological damage. During the mid 1990s, the Adverse Childhood Experiences study (ACE) found that children who were exposed to domestic violence and other forms of abuse had a higher risk of developing mental and physical health problems. Because of the awareness of domestic violence that some <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> face, it also generally impacts how the child develops emotionally, socially, behaviorally as well as cognitively.|$|E

2500|$|Pre-school in Saskatchewan is {{relatively}} unregulated, {{and is not}} compulsory. The first exposure many <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learning with others outside of traditional parenting is day care or a parent run playgroup. This sort of activity is not generally considered [...] "schooling". Pre-school education is separate from primary school. Pre-schools are usually run by local councils, community groups or private organisations. Pre-school is offered to three- to five-year-olds, although voluntary attendance numbers vary widely. The year before a child is due to attend primary school is the main year for pre-school education. This year is far more commonly attended, and usually {{takes the form of}} a few hours of activity five days a week.|$|E

In the same study of street children in Bombay, 29.6 percent of children reported bathing in the sea and 11.5 percent reported bathing in pipes, wells, or canals. Open air bathing of street children {{is in fact a}} very common sight in all parts of India. These <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put their naked bodies on display {{for a very long time}} before, during and after bathing. As a result, they develop hardly any sense of modesty.

Street children also lack restroom facilities, demonstrated by the fact that 26.4 percent of the children used the roadside or railway line for their toilet. For water, the children reported asking restaurants or hotels for water (69.1 percent) or using pipes and water taps (15.6 percent).|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{is at the}} {{beginning}} of language learning. <b>Children</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn to distinguish different sounds and to segment the speech stream they are exposed to into units – eventually meaningful units – in order to acquire words and sentences. Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging: When you read, there are spaces between the words. No such spaces occur between spoken words. So, if an infant hears the sound sequence “thisisacup,” it has to learn to segment this stream into the distinct units “this”, “is”, “a”, and “cup.” Once the child is able to extract the sequence “cup” from the speech stream it has to assign a meaning to this word. Furthermore, the child {{has to be able to}} distinguish the sequence “cup” from “cub” in order to learn that these are two distinct words with different meanings. Finally, the child has to learn to produce these words.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is a large}} debate {{regarding}} {{whether or}} not bilingualism is truly beneficial to children. Parents of children often view learning a second language throughout {{elementary and high school}} education beneficial to the child. Another perspective dictates that the second language just confuses the child and prevents them from mastering their primary language. Studies have shown that American bilingual children have greater cognitive flexibility, better perceptual skills and tend to be divergent thinkers than monolingual {{children between the ages of}} five to ten. [...] Better executive functioning skills are likely because bilingual <b>children</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> choose one language to speak while actively suppressing the other. This builds stronger selective attention and cognitive flexibility because these skills are being exercised more. In addition, bilingual children have a better understanding of universal language concepts, such as grammar, because these concepts are applied in multiple languages. However, studies comparing Swedish-Finnish bilingual children and Swedish monolingual children between the ages of five to seven have also shown that the bilingual children have a smaller vocabulary than monolingual children. In another study throughout America, elementary school English-monolingual children performed better in mathematics and reading activities than their non-English-dominant bilingual and non-English monolingual peers from kindergarten to grade five. Learning two languages simultaneously can be beneficial or a hindrance to a child's language and intellectual development. [...] Further research is necessary to continue to shed light on this debate.|$|E
