5000|$|Adults of the <b>common</b> <b>{{cockchafer}}</b> reach {{sizes of}} 25-30 mm; the forest cockchafer {{is a bit}} smaller (20-25 mm). The two species can best be distinguished by the form of their tail end: it is long and slender in the <b>common</b> <b>cockchafer,</b> but shorter and knob-shaped at the end in the forest cockchafer. Both have a brown colour. Male cockchafers have seven [...] "leaves" [...] on their antennae, whereas the females have only six.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{appear at}} the end of April or in May and live for about five to seven weeks. After about two weeks, the female begins laying eggs, which she buries about 10 to 20 cm deep in the earth. She may do this several times until she has laid between 60 and 80 eggs. The <b>common</b> <b>cockchafer</b> lays its eggs in fields, whereas the Forest Cockchafer stays in the {{vicinity}} of the trees. The preferred food for adults is oak leaves, but they will also feed on conifer needles.|$|E
40|$|The study deals the {{efficiency}} of light trapping of the <b>Common</b> <b>Cockchafer</b> (Melolontha melolontha L.) (Coleoptera: Melolonthidae) {{in connection with the}} ozone concentration of air. The data of the Hungarian forestry light trap network w ere used for the years 1997 through 2006. We calculated relative catch values of from the number of caught insects. We assigned these to the ozone values of the respective days. For the classified d ate pairs regression equations were calculated. We established that the light trapping is most effecti ve if the ozone concentration is high. As opposed t o this, low ozone concentration reduces the success o f the catch. Our results may be utilized in plant protection and forest protection prognose...|$|E

50|$|In 1929, Josef Ganz started {{contacting}} German motorcycle manufacturers Zündapp, Ardie and DKW {{for collaboration}} {{to build a}} prototype, small people's car. This resulted in a first prototype, the Ardie-Ganz, built at Ardie in 1930 and a second one completed at Adler in May 1931, which was nicknamed the Maikäfer (‘May-Beetle’, <b>common</b> European <b>cockchafer</b> Melolontha melolontha). News about the prototypes spread through the industry. At Adler, Josef Ganz was assigned as a consultant engineer at Daimler-Benz and BMW where {{he was involved in}} the development of the first models with independent wheel suspension: the Mercedes-Benz 170 and BMW AM1 (Automobilkonstruktion München 1).|$|R
40|$|An 80 -kDa parasporal {{crystal protein}} was {{detected}} in protein extracts of sporangia of Bacillus popilliae isolated from a diseased larva of the <b>common</b> <b>cockchafer</b> (Melolontha melolontha L.). Amino acid analysis of tryptic peptides revealed significant homology to the Cry 2 Aa endotoxins of Bacillus thuringiensis. The gene cryBP 1 (cry 18 Aa 1), which codes for the parasporal crystal protein, {{was found in}} a putative cry operon on the bacterial chromosome, which contains at least one further (smaller) open reading frame, orf 1. The 706 -amino-acid-long CryBP 1 (Cry 18 Aa 1) protein has a predicted molecular mass of 79 kDa and shows about 40 % sequence identity to the Cry 2 polypeptides of B. thuringiensis. In the light of published observations which suggest that the parasporal crystal proteins of B. popilliae are slightly toxic to their grub hosts, we propose the following survival strategy of B. popilliae. As an obligate pathogen of grubs, B. popilliae germinates in the gut of a grub and the parasporal crystal proteins are released and activated. The activated protein does not cause colloid osmotic lysis but instead damages the gut wall somehow to allow the vegetative cells to enter the hemolymph more easily. By becoming a parasite, B. popilliae can continue to proliferate efficiently while the living grub provides a food supply. This process is in contrast to that of B. thuringiensis, which rapidly kills the insect and is then limited to growth on the larval carcass...|$|E
40|$|Plants produce {{large amounts}} of {{secondary}} metabolites in their shoots and roots and store them in specialized secretory structures. Although secondary metabolites and their secretory structures are commonly assumed to have a defensive function, evidence that they benefit plant fitness under herbivore attack is scarce, especially below ground. Here, we tested whether latex secondary metabolites produced by the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale agg.) decrease the performance of its major native insect root herbivore, the larvae of the <b>common</b> <b>cockchafer</b> (Melolontha melolontha), and benefit plant vegetative and reproductive fitness under M. melolontha attack. Across 17 T. officinale genotypes screened by gas and liquid chromatography, latex concentrations of the sesquiterpene lactone taraxinic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G) were negatively associated with M. melolontha larval growth. Adding purified TA-G to artificial diet at ecologically relevant concentrations reduced larval feeding. Silencing the germacrene A synthase ToGAS 1, an enzyme that was identified to catalyze the first committed step of TA-G biosynthesis, resulted in a 90 % reduction of TA-G levels and a pronounced increase in M. melolontha feeding. Transgenic, TA-G-deficient lines were preferred by M. melolontha and suffered three times more root biomass reduction than control lines. In a common garden experiment involving over 2, 000 T. officinale individuals belonging to 17 different genotypes, high TA-G concentrations {{were associated with the}} maintenance of high vegetative and reproductive fitness under M. melolontha attack. Taken together, our study demonstrates that a latex secondary metabolite benefits plants under herbivore attack, a result that provides a mechanistic framework for root herbivore driven natural selection and evolution of plant defenses below ground...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of studies on the life span, survival, weight and fecundity of the forest cockchafer (Melolontha hippocastani, Fabricius, 1801) and the <b>common</b> <b>cockchafer</b> (Melolontha melolontha, Linnaeus, 1758) beetle feeding on Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn., Betula pendula Roth., Carpinus betulus L., Fagus sylvatica L., Larix decidua Mill., Prunus serotina (Ehr.) Borkh., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Quercus robur L., Robinia pseudoacacia L., Sambucus nigra L. and Sorbus aucuparia L. em. Hedl. The lifespan and weight of beetles as well as female fertility were examined in 2011 and 2013. Specimen for laboratory tests were collected in the field shortly after leaving their overwintering sites in the soil and identical experimental protocols were applied to both examined species. 576 and 432 beetles were tested in 2011 and 2013, respectively. In 2011, beetles were feeding on A. glutinosa, B. pendula, F. sylvatica, L. decidua Q. petraea leaves and on C. betulus, P. serotina, R. pseudoacacia, S. aucuparia and S. nigra in 2013. Both years, beetles feeding on Q. robur leaves were examined as a control. Our results showed that feeding on leaves of Q. robur and Q. petraea had the largest positive impact on the life time, weight and fecundity of the studied beetles. Leaves of F. sylvatica and L. decidua also constituted an adequate food source for the development of M. melolontha. M. hippocastani, however, did not perform as well when feeding on these two tree species. Females of M. melolontha reared on leaves of B. pendula did not lay eggs. The following plant species had a negative impact on the survival and development of the collected specimen and female fertility: A. glutinosa, S. nigra, P. serotina and R. pseudoacacia. Neither beetle species fed on the leaves of A. glutinosa or S. nigra. Przemysław Szmi...|$|E
