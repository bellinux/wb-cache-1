5|$|Later in {{his career}} Alvarez served on {{multiple}} high level advisory committees related to civilian and military aviation. These included a Federal Aviation Administration task group on future air navigation and air traffic control systems, the President's Science Advisory Committee Military Aircraft Panel, and a committee studying how the scientific <b>community</b> <b>could</b> help improve the United States' capabilities for fighting a nonnuclear war.|$|E
5|$|She {{was known}} for her honesty and {{moderate}} life style. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 {{as soon as she}} began earning her keep. She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific <b>community</b> <b>could</b> do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} she also {{decided to leave the}} Carmelite convent in Paris, since she knew the Carmelite <b>community</b> <b>could</b> not manage the {{maintenance}} and the expense after her death.|$|E

5000|$|The Alhambra Decree {{that had}} {{expelled}} the Jews was formally rescinded on December 16, 1968. [...] Synagogues were {{opened and the}} <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> hold a discreet activity.|$|R
25|$|On January 19, 1883, the world's first {{electric}} lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, and {{was built by}} Thomas Edison to demonstrate that an entire <b>community</b> <b>could</b> be lit by electricity.|$|E
25|$|A local {{developer}} {{suggested it}} would be months before the <b>community</b> <b>could</b> even begin to rebuild homes lost in the fire, Local home builders {{were expected to be}} overwhelmed by the task, while Slave Lake's remote location posed additional challenges to the rebuild process, including questions of where workers brought in to help rebuild the town would be housed.|$|E
25|$|After {{teaming up}} with his good friend and noted lawyer Luis Kutner (co-founder of Amnesty International), Hills decided to search {{the world for a}} spot to {{establish}} a Center where a dedicated <b>community</b> <b>could</b> live and test his World Constitution for Self-Government by Nature's Laws, which he published in a book with an introduction by Bertrand Russell.|$|E
3000|$|To this end, {{appliances}} {{could be}} “humanized” and {{equipped with a}} personality – which could be as complex and involving as many character traits as desired, possibly inspired to the user’s own personality – and “put in the arena” both to support multi-user gaming on some suitable platforms, and to play on social networks in a post-based, Facebook-like fashion. Note that participating to today’s <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> be just {{the starting point of}} some new kind of “mixed” (human/appliance) social network, which could evolve in forms hard to guess today. In principle, appliance <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> grow up with different goals and forms: [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Glyn was {{commenting on}} a report underscoring {{the dilemma of}} rocketing house prices outstripping what locals could pay, with the report warning that [...] "...traditional Welsh <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> die out..." [...] as a consequence.|$|R

25|$|In pre-colonial times, {{the rules}} of {{customary}} law in {{much of what is}} today Malawi attributed the ownership of land to the African communities that occupied it. Community leaders could allow community members to use specified areas of communal land, but did not usually grant its use to outsiders. Neither the leaders nor the current members of a <b>community</b> <b>could</b> alienate its land, which they held in trust for future generations.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the formation of a Korean Economic <b>Community</b> <b>could</b> be a way to ease in unification of the Korean peninsula. Lee Myung-bak, departing from the Saenuri Party's traditional hardline stance, has outlined a comprehensive diplomatic package on North Korea that includes setting up a consultative body to discuss economic projects between the two Koreas. He proposed seeking a Korean economic community agreement to provide the legal and systemic basis for any projects agreed to in the body.|$|E
25|$|Gloria Alvarez {{claims the}} riots {{did not create}} social {{distance}} between Hispanics and blacks, but rather united them. Although the riots were perceived in different aspects, Alvarez argues it brought {{a greater sense of}} understanding between Hispanics and blacks. Even though Hispanics now heavily populate the area that was once predominantly black, such transition has improved over time. The building of a stronger and more understanding <b>community</b> <b>could</b> help to prevent social chaos arising between the two groups. Hate crimes and widespread violence between the two groups continue to be a problem in the L.A. area, however.|$|E
50|$|Lori is {{also home}} to a tiny Greek {{community}} of 655 individuals who speak the Pontic dialect. Small Greek <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> be found in the towns of Alaverdi, Akhtala, Stepanavan, Noyemberyan and Vanadzor. The majority of the Yaghdan village is Greek.|$|R
50|$|XESRD {{migrated}} to FM in 2011 as XHSRD-FM, {{but it was}} required to maintain its AM station, as <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> lose radio service were the AM station to go off the air. The FM transmitter is located atop Cerro China.|$|R
40|$|Communities {{in forest}} areas {{can be trained}} to carry out forest mapping and {{standard}} forest inventory, though an intermediary organisation is needed for technical support in some tasks. - Costs of community carbon monitoring {{are likely to be}} much lower than professional surveys, and accuracy appears to be relatively good. The precision levels depend {{on the size of the}} sample and there is an important trade-off between costs of increasing sample size and the amount of carbon that <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> claim as a result. - Entrusting forest inventory work to <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> have other advantages within a national REDD programme, such as transparency, and could highlight the value of community forest management in providing carbon services...|$|R
25|$|Even {{though this}} solar {{technology}} {{may have a}} higher starting cost than that of conventional fossil fuel, the low maintenance and operation cost {{and the ability to}} operate without fuel makes the solar powered systems cheaper to keep running. A small rural <b>community</b> <b>could</b> use a system like this indefinitely, and it would provide clean drinking water at a negligible cost after the initial equipment purchase and setup. In a larger community, it could at least contribute to the water supply and reduce pressures of daily survival. This technology is capable of pumping hundreds of gallons of water per day, and is limited only by the amount of water available in the water table.|$|E
25|$|Rejecting an {{outright}} ban, the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley launched on 15 March 2012 a voluntary pledge to remove artificial trans fats {{by the end}} of the year. Asda, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Tesco, Unilever and United Biscuits are some of 73 businesses who have agreed to do so. Lansley and his special Adviser Bill Morgan previously worked for firms with interests in the food industry and some journalists have alleged that this results in a conflict of interest. Many health professionals are not happy with the voluntary nature of the deal. Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, felt that justifying intake on the basis of average figures was unsuitable since some members of the <b>community</b> <b>could</b> considerably exceed this.|$|E
25|$|Consensus (ijma) {{could in}} {{principle}} elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty. This classical doctrine drew its authority {{from a series}} of hadiths stating that the Islamic <b>community</b> <b>could</b> never agree on an error. This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community. However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development. A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion. The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.|$|E
50|$|Scotland and its rural <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> benefit {{greatly from}} action in these areas. It is {{estimated}} that each additional 10,000 tonnes of salmon creates an additional £96 million for the Scottish economy, of which over £43 million is at the farm gate.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{before the}} visit of Pope John Paul II, the local Ukrainian {{authorities}} passed the Cathedral to the Armenian Apostolic Church under the condition both the Armenian Catholic and Armenian Apostolic <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> use it.

25|$|Following {{the failure}} of the second revolt against the Romans and the exile, Jewish <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> be found in nearly every notable center {{throughout}} the Roman Empire, as well as scattered communities found in centers beyond the Empire's borders in northern Europe, in eastern Europe, in southwestern Asia, and in Africa. Farther to the east along trade routes, Jewish <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> be found throughout Persia and in empires even farther east including in India and China. In the Early Middle Ages of the 6th to 11th centuries, the Radhanites traded along the overland routes between Europe and Asia earlier established by the Romans, dominated trade between the Christian and the Islamic worlds, and used a trade network that covered most areas of Jewish settlement.|$|R
25|$|The error {{would not}} have {{rendered}} his work worthless – each part of Wiles's work was highly significant and innovative by itself, as were the many developments and techniques he had created {{in the course of}} his work, and only one part was affected. However without this part proved, there was no actual proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Wiles spent almost a year trying to repair his proof, initially by himself and then in collaboration with his former student Richard Taylor, without success. By the end of 1993, rumours had spread that under scrutiny, Wiles's proof had failed, but how seriously was not known. Mathematicians were beginning to pressure Wiles to disclose his work whether or not complete, so that the wider <b>community</b> <b>could</b> explore and use whatever he had managed to accomplish. But instead of being fixed, the problem, which had originally seemed minor, now seemed very significant, far more serious, and less easy to resolve.|$|E
500|$|Under {{previous}} legislation, a <b>community</b> <b>could</b> incorporate as {{a summer}} village if it had [...] "a minimum of 50 separate buildings occupied as dwellings {{at any time during}} a six-month period". A community can no longer incorporate {{as a summer}} village under the MGA.|$|E
500|$|A better {{understanding}} of airplane ground deicing and anti-icing issues is a crucial prerequisite {{to the implementation of}} feasible and effective safety improvements. To achieve this goal, the FAA sponsored a conference at which the international aviation <b>community</b> <b>could</b> exchange thoughts and offer recommendation on a variety of issues concerning safe winter operations. [...] more than 750 participants discussed the problems posed by aircraft deicing and examined possible solutions.|$|E
50|$|Law 2539 in 1997, named “Ioannis Kapodistrias,” took 441 {{municipalities}} and the 5382 {{communities and}} merged them into 900 municipalities and 133 communities. Newly merged municipalities and <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> further subdivide their territory into municipal or communal departments {{to give some}} local authority to merged areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{conflict}} between rural communities and cities {{has always existed}} and still does. Rural children loved the small communities from which they sprang and enjoyed the freedom {{of life in the}} country. But education in rural <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> never hope to compete with that of the city.|$|R
25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, Canadian Gaelic was the third-most widely spoken {{language}} in Canada and Gaelic-speaking immigrant <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> be {{found throughout the}} country. Gaelic poets in Canada produced a significant literary tradition. The number of Gaelic-speaking individuals and communities declined sharply, however, after the First World War.|$|R

Prior to the release, several creators had been consulted to suggest tools <b>Community</b> <b>could</b> incorporate that they would find useful; these YouTubers included Vlogbrothers, AsapScience, Lilly Singh, The Game Theorists, Karmin, The Key of Awesome, The Kloons, Peter Hollens, Rosianna Halse Rojas, Sam Tsui, Threadbanger and Vsauce3.|$|E
500|$|North Dakota and Minnesota leaders {{initially}} {{asked the}} federal government for $100 million in disaster relief, but increased their projections to $500 million for Grand Forks and East Grand Forks. Pat Owens went to Washington D.C. to persuade Congress to provide the funds contained in a $5.5 billion relief bill. Although the bill was initially vetoed by President Clinton since he disagreed with additional unrelated legislation being added to the bill, he signed it on June 11. East Grand Forks Mayor Lynn Stauss, reflected on the government assistance to the city, saying: [...] "This <b>community</b> <b>could</b> not have survived without the help of the state and federal government." ...|$|E
500|$|Parry {{asked an}} old friend to notify the Welsh {{community}} in the United States {{that he would be}} visiting and would adjudicate at eisteddfodau, lecture or lead cymanfaoedd canu if desired. [...] The <b>community</b> <b>could</b> arrange for Parry to visit by contacting Rev. Thomas Edwards of Edwardsville, Pennsylvania. [...] Parry and his family visited many cities and towns in the eastern US and were warmly received wherever they went. [...] He kept those back in Cardiff advised of his travels through letters to The Western Mail which were printed by the newspaper. Parry's last journey to the United States in 1898 included a visit to Salt Lake City, where he adjudicated at the third Salt Lake eisteddfod which was held in the Mormon Tabernacle. His last major work, an opera entitled The Maid of Cefn Ydfa, premiered at the Grand Theatre in Cardiff in late December 1902.|$|E
30|$|If there are, indeed, {{too many}} paid developers, OSS {{communities}} {{may need to}} better explore these workforces. For instance, instead of concentrating too many paid developers in one single OSS project, OSS <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> try to gather some paid developers to OSS projects that are more in need.|$|R
50|$|A further {{important}} aspect of the new policy was the recognition that First Nation and Inuit <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> take over any or all aspect(s) of the administration of their own community health programs, at their discretion and {{with the support of the}} Department of National Health and Welfare.|$|R
50|$|However, {{efforts on}} the part of Portugal to prevent their {{commercial}} contacts failed, and Vili <b>communities</b> <b>could</b> be found all over Kongo and Ndongo-Matamba as well as neighboring regions between them.
