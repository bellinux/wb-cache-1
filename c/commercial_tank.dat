40|$|The {{presence}} of the sporophytic 'Falkenbergia rufolanosa' phase of the invasive algal species Asparagopsis armata was first recorded in South Africa 57 years ago. The introduction of this highly invasive alga, of Australian/New Zealand origins, to Europe in the 1920 's has since led {{to a number of}} recorded invasions by the gametophytic Asparagopsis phase in both the Mediterranean and Atlantic oceans. Recently however, a number of commercial uses for both phases of A. armata have been identified, which have given rise to industrial interest in the species as a candidate for commercial cultivation. Previous studies on European strains of F. rufolanosa and A. armata have identified a number of life history traits, which not only increase A. armata 's invasive ability, but also make it a useful species for <b>commercial</b> <b>tank</b> cultivation. However, different strains are known to have different environmental parameters which regulate their survival, growth and reproduction capabilities.

With increasing <b>commercial</b> <b>tank</b> bioleaching operations, understanding their microbial consortia {{is essential for}} process robustness. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that the consortia implicated in tank mineral bioleaching of gold-containing pyritic ores are dynamic, responding to the leaching environment. Factors driving the microbial dynamics of these consortia are under investigation, with emphasis also placed on determining the metabolic role of the key players in these consortia. Here, the combined influence of solids loading and organic carbon availability on microbial community dynamics and performance has been studied in agitated, aerated slurry bioreactors at 45 °C. The control (autotrophic) and experimental (organic carbon added) reactors performed comparably at low solids loadings (4 %, 7 % and 10 %). At 20 % solids loadings, higher ferric iron concentrations (31 g/L vs 25 g/L) and sulphide oxidation (66 % vs 45 %) were observed in the experimental reactor over the control. Under operating conditions used, a shift from bacterially-dominated cultures with L. ferriphilum as major species towards increasing archaeal abundance was observed. Archaeal abundance was higher in the organic carbon supplemented reactor at all solids loadings.

40|$|AbstractIn {{oxy-fuel}} combustion {{it is generally}} accepted that fed O 2 into the boiler diluted together with CO 2 is advantageous when similar combustion conditions as in air-firing case want to be reached.

However, this fact entails high operational costs in addition to scale prices are not applied in experimental size plants. A reduction of these costs could be achieved by supplying the required CO 2 through flue gas recirculation, as it would happen in an industrial oxy-fuel plant. However, transition from air-firing to oxy-firing, {{and changes in the}} flue gas composition during operation can vary conditions inside the boiler. This issue becomes particularly important when oxy-fuel combustion takes place inside a fluidized bed boiler, where fluidization conditions must be kept inside a narrow optimum range, i. e. fluidization velocity or oxygen content at inlet, although changes in recirculation rates or flue gas composition could disturb it. With this aim, an efficient recycled flue gas control strategy has been modeled and validated through experiments in a test rig. This system could be easily adapted to any experimental oxy-fuel pilot plant, since it has been designed for controlling conventional instrumentation, valves and drives...|$|R

Due to the low density of the hydrogen, high pressures are required inside the tanks {{in order to have}} autonomy comparable to conventional vehicles. The compression of the hydrogen during refueling (performed in less than 5 minutes), produces the warming of the gas inside the tank. Different strategies are being studied in order to find the most practical, safe and efficient refueling; the aim is to reach a State of Charge (SOC) value above 95 % in the shortest time without surpassing the safety temperature and pressure limits. There are different parameters affecting the average and maximum temperature of the gas achieved during a refueling. Some are related to the filling conditions (inlet temperature and mass flow rate) while others are related to tank characteristics (e. g. the type of liner, manufacturing materials, geometry or dimensions of the inlet opening). In this paper, an extensive analysis performed using different injector configurations to refuel 70 MPa composite reinforced <b>commercial</b> <b>tanks</b> is shown.
