A common use of these different [...] "screw" [...] head <b>type</b> <b>sockets</b> is to attach to power versions of the socket wrenches (impact sockets) which allow the fasteners to be loosened or tightened much faster and more powerfully than can be done by hand.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the integration of}} MATLAB and LabVIEW {{for the implementation of}} testing system for control panel of medium voltage switchgear. This system tests two <b>types</b> of <b>sockets</b> of control panel i. e. nonstandard socket and standard socket. The standard socket is the one who has universal wiring diagram (64 pins socket) and nonstandard socket (generally 8, 16, 24 or even 32 pins socket) is the one who‟s wiring diagram changes from panel to panel. For testing of nonstandard <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> system needs its wiring diagram, which is to be decoded by Image processing algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The LabVIEW is central controlling element and it is also used to test nonstandard socket along with DAQ hardware. The system checks „Normally closed ‟ and „Normally open ‟ status of pin pairs of control panel mentioned in the wiring diagram in case of non standard socket while in case of standard socket there is no such need of scanning the wiring diagram as it has universal wiring diagram, so those pin pairs are already mentioned in LabVIEW those need to be checked. Also use of other made hardware than national instruments with LabVIEW is described in nonstandard <b>type</b> <b>socket</b> testing...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} interchangeable sockets is that, {{instead of a}} separate wrench {{for each of the}} many different fastener sizes and <b>types,</b> only separate <b>sockets</b> are needed for each size and type. Because of their versatility, nearly all screw and bolt <b>types</b> now have <b>sockets</b> of different <b>types</b> made to fit their bolts or nuts. Sockets often come as a [...] "socket set" [...] with many different sizes or <b>types</b> of <b>sockets</b> to fit the heads of different-sized fasteners. A ratchet of the [...] "set size" [...] is often included with the socket set. Sockets are commonly available in fractional inch and metric sizes, and in short (shallow) and longer (deep) varieties.|$|R
40|$|The {{quadrilateral}} (Quad) socket {{has been}} the socket of choice for the transfemoral since the 1950 s. It was developed {{as a result of}} extensive research work undertaken at the University of California, Berkely and San Francisco {{at the request of the}} veterans administration (VA) in USA following the 2 nd world war. However, these sockets were mainly designed for maimed but otherwise young and fit amputees, and there arose a doubt regarding whether they are also appropriate to be provided to the aged geriatric amputees which consists most of the today's amputee population. Since the 1970 s researchers started to point out the weaknesses of the Quad socket and advocated a newer <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> which has a bone-locking system by containing the amputee's ischial ramas inside to socket when being worn. This <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> is called Ischial-ramal containing (IC) socket and there have been many comments heard from researchers and amputees in favour of this newer <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> This project was designed to provide back up to the possible explanation for these voices to introduce this new <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> to be more widely available. We looked at the interface pressure distributed of Quad and IC socket for comparison as an index for the comfort level of the amputees wearing those two sockets.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveA {{retrospective}} assessment {{of differences in}} congenital cholesteatoma CT findings {{with a focus on}} type of cholesteatoma mass. Materials and methodsThe medical records and CT images of 14 patients with congenital cholesteatomas in the middle ear who underwent surgery at our institution between January 2009 and July 2014 were reviewed. Cholesteatomas were classified as <b>closed</b> <b>type,</b> open type, or mixed type based on intraoperative findings. The CT findings including cholesteatoma size, location, and shape were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsEight patients had <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> cholesteatomas, four had mixed type, and two had open type. The mean size of all cholesteatomas was 5. 1 mm. None of the cholesteatoma types indicated a tendency towards a certain location. The round shape was observed more frequently in <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> cholesteatomas than in other types (closed: 5 / 8; mixed: 1 / 4; open: 0 / 2). Two large <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> cholseteatomas and two mixed type cholesteatomas exhibited a constricted shape. Both of the open type cholesteatomas displayed an irregular shape. ConclusionSmall <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> congenital cholesteatomas were typically observed as round shaped lesions, but large <b>closed</b> <b>type</b> cholesteatomas and other type cholesteatomas tended to display shapes other than round...|$|R
5000|$|The {{disadvantages}} of LIF connectors {{are that the}} grip force between the contacts is lower, and the contacts can oxidize faster and decrease the lifespan of the connector. With the advent of frequent changes in PC processors, a need arose for these systems. Intel introduced the LIF socket system, in which the processor is inserted into the socket, rather than fixed by a lever. This <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> was used for some types of 386s and early 486s. This <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> {{has been replaced by}} the ZIF socket, although LIF sockets are now used in modern 1.8" [...] hard disks.|$|R

40|$|A new <b>type</b> of above-knee <b>socket</b> {{has been}} {{designed}} to provide total surface support and to dispense with ischial bearing as the primary weight bearing area. The socket is based upon the hypothesis that if the soft tissues of an above-knee stump are adequately supported in a suitably shaped container they will behave under load as an elastic solid with low stiffness. A method has been devised for taking the cast for the new <b>type</b> <b>socket</b> using an elastic sleeve as a “compliant socket”. The grip of the elastic sleeve and the use of traction weights deform the stump tissues to the required shape while the cast is setting. The results of laboratory measurements of the transinterface pressures in these sockets under axial loading conditions have correlated well with the figures forecast by calculation. The new socket is now available to patients at a number of Centres in England...|$|R
