25|$|In France, avocats, or attorneys, were, {{until the}} 20th century, the {{equivalent}} of barristers. The profession included several grades ranked by seniority: avocat-stagiaire (trainee, who was already qualified but needed to complete two years (or more, depending on the period) of training alongside seasoned lawyers), avocat, and avocat honoraire (senior barrister). Since the 14th century and {{during the course of}} the 19th and 20th in particular, French barristers competed in territorial battles over respective areas of legal practice against the conseil juridique (legal advisor, transactional solicitor) and avoué (procedural solicitor), and expanded to become the generalist legal practitioner, with the notable exception of notaires (notaries), who are ministry appointed lawyers (with a separate qualification) and who retain exclusivity over conveyancing and probate. After the 1971 and 1990 legal reforms, the avocat was fused with the avoué and the conseil juridique, making the avocat (or, if female, avocate) an all-purpose lawyer for matters of <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> analogous to an American attorney. French attorneys usually do not (although it they are entitled to) act both as litigators (trial lawyers) and legal consultants (advising lawyers), known respectively as avocat plaidant and avocat-conseil. This distinction is however purely informal and does not correspond to any difference in qualification or admission to the roll. All intending attorneys must pass an examination to be able to enrol in one of the Centre régional de formation à la profession d'avocat (CRFPA) (Regional centre for the training of lawyers). The CRFPA course has a duration of two years and is a mix between classroom teachings and internships. Its culmination is the stage final (final training), where the intending attorney spends 6 months in a law firm (generally in his/her favoured field of practice and in a firm in which he/she hopes to be recruited afterwards). The intending attorney then needs to pass the Certificat d'Aptitude à la Profession d'Avocat (CAPA), which is the last professional examination allowing him/her to join a court's bar (barreau). It is generally recognised that the first examination is much more difficult than the CAPA and is dreaded by most law students. Each bar is regulated by a Bar Council (Ordre du barreau).|$|E

5000|$|Today {{the only}} objects of <b>contentious</b> ecclesiastical <b>jurisdiction</b> (in which, however, the State often takes part or interferes) are: {{questions}} of faith, {{the administration of}} the sacraments, particularly the contracting and maintenance of marriage, the holding of church services, the creation and modification of benefices, the appointment to and the vacation of ecclesiastical offices, the rights of beneficed ecclesiastics as such, the ecclesiastical rights and duties of patrons, the ecclesiastical rights and duties of religious, the administration of church property. As to the criminal jurisdiction of the Church it now inflicts on the laity only ecclesiastical penalties, and solely for ecclesiastical offences. If ever civil consequences ensue, only the civil authority can take cognizance of them. As regards ecclesiastics, the power of the Church to punish their disciplinary offences and maladministration of their offices, is widely acknowledged by the State. Where Church and State are not separated, the State aids in investigating these offences, as well as in executing the canonically rendered decisions of the Church. As to the civil offences of ecclesiastics, ecclesiastical jurisdiction carries with it no secular consequences, though the Church is free to punish such offences by ecclesiastical penalties. According to the Papal Bull [...] "Apostolicae Sedis moderationi" [...] (12 October 1869), those persons fall under the excommunication reserved to the pope speciali modo, who directly or indirectly hinder the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the external forum or in the internal forum, {{as well as those who}} appeal from ecclesiastical to civil jurisdiction; finally every legislator or person in authority who directly or indirectly compels a judge to cite ecclesiastical persons before a civil tribunal. In various concordats with the civil power, the Church has more or less abandoned the privilegium fori of ecclesiastics.|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis traces the efforts of successive Governments of both persuasions to reform the ancient jurisdiction of the spiritual courts over the validity of wills of personal property. Those non-partisan efforts spanned three decades and resulted in the 1857 Court of Probate Act. A Royal Commission, reporting in 1832, recommended in effect that the jurisdiction be centralised in London by transferring it from the Province of York and from the diocesan and inferior courts to the Prerogative Court of Canterbury at Doctors' Commons, where the specialist civilian lawyers practised their separate and monopolistic body of law. Because the Real Property Commission preferred a secular solution, the 1832 Report was endorsed by a Commons Select Committee in 1833 and modified by a Lords Select Committee in 1836 to allow a limited non <b>contentious</b> local <b>jurisdiction.</b> Several early attempts to bring in reforming measures based upon the centralising 1832 Report failed because of local opposition, a lack of resolve {{on the part of}} Ministers and the pressure of other business. Two Government Bills were introduced during Peel's Second Ministry. The 1843 Bill failed because it pursued a centralising policy. The 1844 Bill failed because it departed from that policy and offered to keep the diocesan courts. The Whig Opposition introduced its own centralising Bill in 1845 but it too failed. After the inactivity of Russell's administration, efforts at reform were resumed in the 1850 s by rapidly changing Governments, but were hampered by local opposition, pressure of other business, and the Crimean War. By then the 1854 Report of the Chancery Commission had recommended that the entire jurisdiction should be removed to a secular court, and the debate raged about which practitioners should benefit. Finally, after pressures in the Commons to secure appropriate compensation and district probate offices with extended powers, the 1857 Act ushered in the present system...|$|R

Although the ICC has been equipped with the legal tools necessary to prosecute human trafficking, it has not yet brought a single trafficking case to the Court. In order to fully comprehend the bar for prosecution of human trafficking as a CAH at the ICC, the paper applies the CAH framework to the situation of the persecuted Rohingya minority in Myanmar and Thailand in Southeast Asia. Chapter 1 will briefly introduce the rationale behind the hypothesis as well as present the limitations of the scope of the thesis. Chapter 2 shall examine the general characteristics of human trafficking including the universal definition in the Palermo Protocol. Chapter 3 will deal with the CAH framework, including the customary nature of human trafficking as CAH, as well as conducting an in-depth analysis of the chapeau requirements of CAH in the Rome Statute. Chapter 4 will study the complementarity requirement and the gravity threshold, two of the most <b>contentious</b> concepts concerning <b>jurisdiction</b> and admissibility of the ICC. Finally, chapter 5 will apply the international law on human trafficking and the CAH framework to the case study on the Rohingya minority. The objective is to analyse whether there is a prima facie case concerning the CAH perpetrated against Rohingya in Myanmar and Thailand that may justify human trafficking persecutions by the ICC engaging individual criminal responsibility...|$|R

5000|$|The Catholic Church {{considers}} to have has the right, as {{a perfect}} and independent society provided with all the means for attaining its end, to decide according to its laws disputes arising concerning its internal affairs, especially as to the ecclesiastical rights of its members, also {{to carry out its}} decision, if necessary, by suitable means of compulsion, <b>contentious</b> or civil <b>jurisdiction.</b> This implies the right to admonish or warn its members, ecclesiastical or lay, who have not conformed to its laws, and if needful to punish them by physical means, that is, coercive jurisdiction. The church has the power to judge sin, in the internal forum, but a sin can be at the same time externally a misdemeanour or a crime (delictum, crimen), when threatened with external ecclesiastical or civil punishment. The Church also judges ecclesiastical crimes in the external forum by infliction of penalties, except when the wrongdoing has remained secret. In this case it contents itself, as a rule, with penance voluntarily assumed. A last distinction is to be drawn between necessary jurisdiction and voluntary jurisdiction; the latter contemplates voluntary subjection {{on the part of those}} who seek in legal matters the co-operation of ecclesiastical agencies, e.g. notarially executed instruments, testaments, etc. The judicial power described above, jurisdiction strictly so called, was given by Christ to His Church, was exercised by the Apostles, and transmitted to their successors (Matthew 18:15 sqq.; 1 Corinthians 4:21; 5:1 sqq.; 2 Corinthians 13:10; 1 Timothy 1:20; 5:19 sq.).|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is critical for global survival and progress in the 21 st century. Unfortunately, after over six decades in existence, the Court’s influence is declining. This work argues that to revitalize the influence and {{effectiveness of}} the Court, some vital reforms must be undertaken in the ICJ system. These reforms must address: (1) the process of election and re-election of ICJ judges; (2) the conflict of interest arising from the presence of {{permanent members of the}} United Nations Security Council on the Court; (3) the issue of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction; and (4) the appointment of ad hoc judges under Article 31 of the Statute of the Court. Under the United Nations system, the ICJ is the “principal judicial organ” charged with two main functions, to wit; to assist in the resolution of disputes between states, and to provide advisory opinions to specified international organizations. Although established under the UN Charter, the Court is nevertheless governed by the Charter, the Statute of the ICJ, the Rules of Procedure adopted by the judges and amended from time to time, as well as the Practice Directions adopted in October 2001. Though many rules governing the ICJ strive to create an unbiased and honorable entity, the Court’s legitimacy and impartiality have nevertheless been compromised by issues surrounding the election and re-election of its judges, the UN Security Council’s permanent members’ roles in the ICJ, the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction, and the nomination of ad hoc judges by parties before the Court. After six decades, the ICJ is at a crossroads as it braces to adjudicate the disputes arising in the 21 st century. Modern issues concerning environmental protection, terrorism, and human trafficking—among many others—are global problems deserving of attention from a global court. This article argues that the ICJ is ill-equipped to tackle modern international disputes if the jurisdictional and compositional problems outlined above are not remedied, while also offering recommendations for reform. Part I introduces the reader to the inner-workings of the ICJ by discussing the composition of the Court, beginning with an explanation of its roots. Next, Part II critically dissects the challenging preliminary issues of jurisdiction and admissibility. Part III provides an in-depth analysis of the different bases for the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction, with particular focus on <b>contentious</b> and advisory <b>jurisdiction.</b> Part IV highlights four main challenges facing the International Court of Justice, while Part V concludes by proffering recommendations for a more efficient ICJ in the 21 st century.

50|$|Excommunication {{is an act}} of ecclesiastical {{jurisdiction}}, {{the rules}} of which it follows. Hence the general principle: whoever has proper jurisdiction can excommunicate, but only his own subjects. Therefore, whether excommunications be a jure (by the law) or ab homine (under form of sentence or precept), they may come from the pope alone or a general council for the entire Catholic Church; from the provincial council for an ecclesiastical province; from the bishop for his diocese; from the prelate nullius for quasi-diocesan territories; and from regular prelates for religious orders. Moreover, anyone can excommunicate who, by virtue of his office, even when delegated, has <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in the forum externum; for instance, papal legates, vicars capitular, and vicars-general. But a parish priest cannot inflict this penalty. The subjects of these various authorities are those who come under their jurisdiction chiefly on account of domicile or quasi-domicile in their territory; then by reason of the offense committed while on such territory; and finally by reason of personal right, {{as in the case of}} regulars. As to excommunications ab homine, absolution from them is reserved by law to the ordinary who has imposed them.|$|E
50|$|The Church's {{jurisdiction}} {{in the external}} forum has reference to matters touching the public and social good of the corporate body.

Thus the absolution of sins belongs to the internal forum, but the concession of the faculty for performing such absolution {{is an act of}} the external forum. The jurisdiction of the external forum is subdivided into voluntary and necessary. Voluntary, or extrajudicial, is that which a superior can exercise towards those who invoke his power, or even against those who are unwilling, but without his using the formalities prescribed in law. Necessary or <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is that which the judge employs in punishing crimes or deciding disputes according to prescribed forms. In general, the acts of jurisdiction of the external forum are the decision of disputes concerning faith, morals or discipline, the making and enforcing of laws, the punishment of transgressors of ecclesiastical statutes, and the like.|$|E

5000|$|In {{regard to}} ecclesiastical {{jurisdiction}} in criminal matters, the Church exercised jurisdiction at first only in purely ecclesiastical offences, and inflicted only ecclesiastical punishments, e.g. excommunication, {{and in the}} case of clerics deposition. The observance of these penalties had to be left to the conscience of the individual, but with the formal recognition of the Church by the State and the increase of ecclesiastical penalties proportioned to the increase of ecclesiastical offences, came an appeal from the Church to the secular arm for aid in enforcing the said penalties, which aid was always willingly granted. Some offence, especially deviations from the Catholic Faith, were by the State made punishable in civil law and secular penalties were attached to them, also to certain disciplinary misdemeanours of ecclesiastics. Conversely, the Church in the Middle Ages increased its penal jurisdiction in the civil domain by infliction of varied penalties, some of them purely secular in character. Above all, by means of the privilegium fori it withdrew the so-called [...] "criminous clerks" [...] from the jurisdiction of the civil courts. Then it obtained for the court held by the bishop during his diocesan visitation (the send) not only the punishment of those civil misdemeanours which involved the element of sin and consequently affected both Church and State, but it also punished, and as such, purely civil offences. The penal jurisdiction of the medieval Church included, therefore, first the merely ecclesiastical offences, e.g. heresy, schism, apostasy etc.; then the merely civil offences; finally the mixed offences, e.g. sins of the flesh, sacrilege, blasphemy, (diabolical 'black') magic, perjury, usury etc. In punishing offences of a purely ecclesiastical character the Church disposed unreservedly of the aid of the State for the execution of the penalty. When in the aforesaid send court held by the bishop during his visitation, it inflicted punishment on the civil offences of the laity, the penalty, as a rule, was enforced by the imperial count (Graf) who accompanied the bishop and represented the civil power. The principle prevailed later that an offence already punished by a secular judge was no longer punishable by the ecclesiastical judge. When the send began to disappear, both ecclesiastical and secular judges were in general held equally competent for mixed offences. Prevention (previous adjudication of the case by one judge or the other) was decisive. If the matter were brought before the ecclesiastical judge he inflicted at the same time the civil penalty, not, however, corporal punishments such as the death penalty. If the accusation was brought before the secular judge, the civil penalty was inflicted by him and the action of the Church was limited to the imposition of a penance. The Church eventually lost by far the greater part of its criminal jurisdiction for the same reasons which, since the end of the Middle Ages, led to the loss of most of its <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> and in the same manner. Moreover, from the fifteenth century on, the recursus ab abusu which first arose in France (appel comme d'abus), that is the appeal from an abuse of power by an ecclesiastical authority, did much to weaken and discredit ecclesiastical jurisdiction.|$|E
5000|$|The Church {{founded by}} Christ for the {{salvation}} of men needs, like every society, a regulating power (the authority of the Church). The Decree [...] "Lamentabili sane", of 3 July 1907, rejects the doctrine that Christ did not desire to found a permanent, unchangeable Church endowed with authority It is customary {{to speak of a}} threefold office of the Church: the office of teaching (prophetic office), the priestly office and the pastoral office (governing office), and therefore of the threefold authority of the Church: the teaching authority, ministerial authority and ruling authority. Since the teaching of the Church is authoritative, the teaching authority is traditionally included in the ruling authority; then only the ministerial authority and the ruling authority are distinguished. By ministerial authority, which is conferred by an act of consecration, is meant the inward, and because of its indelible character permanent, capacity to perform acts by which Divine grace is transmitted. By ruling authority, which is conferred by the Church (missio canonica, canonical mission), is understood the authority to guide and rule the Church of God. Jurisdiction, insofar as it covers the relations of man to God, is called jurisdiction of the internal forum or jurisdiction of the forum of Heaven (jurisdictio poli). (See Ecclesiastical Forum); this again is either sacramental or penitential, so far as it is used in the Sacrament of Penance, or extra-sacramental, e.g. in granting dispensations from private vows. Jurisdiction, insofar as it regulates external ecclesiastical relations, is called jurisdiction of the external forum, or briefly jurisdictio fori. This jurisdiction, the actual power of ruling is legislative, judicial or coactive. Jurisdiction can be possessed in varying degrees. It can also be held either for both fora, or for the internal forum only, e.g. by the parish priest. Jurisdiction can be further sub-divided into ordinary, quasi-ordinary and delegated jurisdiction. Ordinary jurisdiction is that which is permanently bound, by Divine law or human law, with a permanent ecclesiastical office. Its possessor is called an ordinary judge. By Divine law the pope has such ordinary jurisdiction for the entire Church and a bishop for his diocese. By human law this jurisdiction is possessed by the cardinals, officials of the Roman Curia and the congregations of cardinals, the patriarchs, primates, metropolitans, archbishops, the praelati nullius and prelates with quasi-episcopal jurisdiction, the chapters of orders or the superior generals of orders, cathedral chapters in reference to their own affairs, the archdiaconate in the Middle Ages, and parish priests in the internal forum. If however jurisdiction is permanently connected with an office, but the office itself is said to be quasi-ordinary, or jurisdictio vicaria. This form of jurisdiction is possessed, for example, by a vicar-general. Temporary exercise of ordinary and quasi-ordinary jurisdiction can be granted, in varying degrees, to another as representative, without conferring on him an office properly so called. In this transient form jurisdiction is called delegated or extraordinary, and concerning it canon law, following the Roman law, has developed exhaustive provisions. This development began when the popes, especially since Alexander III (1159-81), found themselves obliged, by the enormous mass of legal business which came to them from all sides as the [...] "judices ordinarii omnium" [...] to hand over, with proper instruction, a large number of cases to third parties for decision, especially in matters of <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|E

The study proceeds as follows. The first chapter sets out the history of international adjudication and the relationship between international adjudicatory mechanisms and political international organisations. It also includes a review of the legal basis and extent of the relationship between the ICJ and the UN. The second and third chapters aim to throw light upon the advisory role of the ICJ and the manner in which the Court, through this jurisdiction, plays a role in interpreting and developing the institutional law of the UN. The fourth chapter addresses the Court's role in facilitating the realisation of the purposes and principles of the UN through its <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> This chapter discusses the basis of the <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Court, then examines the practice of the Court in achieving these purposes and principles.

40|$|The goal of {{this chapter}} is to {{describe}} briefly {{the functions of the}} Commission and the Inter-American Court and provide some examples on how these organs have addressed human rights violations in regard to English-speaking States. The States of the Americas currently have a more constructive relationship with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (‘Commission’) and the Inter-American Court, which includes {{a better understanding of the}} complementary role that such organs play within their national institutions. This atmosphere allows for better dialogue and coordinated action between civil society, States, the Commission and the Inter-American Court in the common goal of safeguarding human rights. Several States have recently adopted national legislation and practices that broadened effective implementation of standards and decisions. The increasing growth and impact of the Inter-American system, however, has simultaneously adversely affected it. This is exemplified by the hesitance of Organization of American States (‘OAS’) members in allocating essential additional funding for the Commission and the Inter-American Court. Additionally, there is a lack of universal ratification by all of the OAS State members of the core treaties of the Inter-American human rights system, in particular, the American Convention on Human Rights (‘IACHR’). Although the Commission monitors human rights compliance in the US, Canada, and a number of Caribbean States under the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man, the effectiveness of that supervision would strengthen if those States became parties to the IACHR. Furthermore, the case law developed by the Inter-American Court demonstrates that access to this tribunal would also benefit the protection of human rights in many of the English-speaking States that have not yet accepted its <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Section 2 focuses on the Commission’s powers and functions and contains an overview of the work carried out in monitoring the protection of human rights in the so-called war against terrorism. Section 3 describes the scope of the Inter-American Court’s powers and functions within its <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> and there is a brief review of a group of emblematic human rights issues which the Inter-American Court addresses, in the context of cases arising from English-speaking Caribbean States.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the direct enforceability of economic, social, and cultural (ESC) {{rights in the}} Inter-American System, also called ‘the direct approach’. It starts by presenting two apparent conflicts between certain provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”) and the Protocol of San Salvador (“the Protocol”) related to the ESC rights recognised in Article 26 of the Convention and the mechanisms of protection of such rights. The author concludes that ESC rights were never intended to be directly enforceable before the Inter-American System and therefore the direct approach is not feasible, except {{for the right to}} unionisation and the right to education, the only rights expressly conceived as directly enforceable by the Protocol. The recent decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Acevedo-Buendía et al. v. Peru is also studied. The Court declared that it has <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over alleged violations of ESC rights, but it took no notice of the Protocol. This article stresses that every interpretation on ESC rights in the Inter-American System must not ignore the Protocol of San Salvador...|$|E
40|$|The International Court of Justice (2 ̆ 2 ICJ 2 ̆ 2), the {{judicial}} {{arm of the}} United Nations, recently issued an advisory opinion concerning the legal consequences of Israel 2 ̆ 7 s construction of a wall separating it from the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Although issued {{under the auspices of}} advisory power, this case concerned the interests of two entities: the state-like Palestinian Authority and the state of Israel. The subject matter was contentious, with the entities engaged in a politically charged border dispute. In a traditional contentious matter, the ICJ may only adjudicate cases between consenting states. However, a truly contentious proceeding was not possible in this case. Palestine was and remains incapable of consenting to <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> because it is {{not a member of the}} UN, and Israel has steadfastly refused to offer its consent. In choosing to resolve the legal questions submitted by the General Assembly, the ICJ has created two distinct problems. First, the legal ramifications of issuing an advisory opinion in a contentious matter establish opportunities for future entities, through the use of the General Assembly, to achieve favorable judgments exparte. Second, because Palestine may not actually appear in a contentious proceeding, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion here can only be understood as a political statement. Each problem raises issues of the relevancy and the continued vitality of the Court, and each may give significant pause to those states who continue to consent to the ICJ 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction...|$|E
40|$|During {{its more}} than three decades of history, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has been {{consolidated}} as a fundamental instance for the protection of human rights in the continent. It has been an instance for the relief of hundreds of victims of human rights, and a promoter of important changes within Latin-America. Indubitable, the Inter-American Court has become a regional and international referent for the protection of human rights. However, {{in spite of all the}} developments, the Court and in general the Inter-American system of human rights still face the strong resistance and opposition from several States. Until now, the region still has 10 countries which have never ratified the ACHR, whereas from the 25 countries that have adopted the ACHR, 2 have already denounced it, 3 have never recognized the <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Court, and 1 more attempted to withdraw that recognition. Now, it seems that we can add the Dominican Republic to the list. Its Constitutional Tribunal, through the judgment TC/ 0256 / 14 of November 2014, ruled that the Instrument through which the Dominican State recognized the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court breaches provisions of its National Constitution. This situation has been interpreted as the withdrawal of the Dominican Republic from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court. The purpose of the present thesis is to analyze the possible Dominican withdrawal from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court. Firstly, I will analyze the context under which the Constitutional judgment was decided in order to know the reasons that motivated the decision. Next, I will analyze whether the Dominican withdrawal, based on the Constitutional judgment, would comply with international law, Inter-American law, and Dominican law. Finally, I will analyze the possible implications of the Dominican withdrawal for the protection of human rights, for the Inter-American human rights system, and for the government of the Dominican Republic, if any...|$|E
40|$|Women’s Conventions, {{endorsing}} {{and approach}} {{based on the}} recognition of structural discriminatory social patterns and cultural practices, have been adopted in the Universal System, with limited national impact, and in the Regional ones. Such systems present different structures, conditions and resources, which contribute to determine the conditions for plausibility of the rights enshrined. The Inter-­ American System adopted the Belém do Pará Convention (BdPC) back in 1994, nevertheless, it largely failed to attract attention in legal scholarship, particularly in Western countries. We argue that, given its high degree of comparability with the European System, analysis of such experience provides valuable informative material to shape a European response. Our first objective is, hence, to analyse the process of internalisation of the BdPC in the Inter-­‐American System. Analysing Inter-­‐American Institution’s case law on VAW since 1994 {{and the evolution of}} relevant national legislation in the region, we find evidence of the role of a coalition of civil society organisations and scholars’ in compensating Inter-­‐American Institutions’ lack of previous experience wit gendered analyses, enabling an incremental learning process and triggering BdPC full justiciability, initially unclear due to BdPC ambiguous wording. At the same time, the availability of authoritative precedents to hold before national governments in a relatively culturally homogeneous context enhanced national implementation of regionally constructed principles and standards, harmonised with those of the Universal System. The IACrtHR plays a crucial interpretive function, clarifying the implications of an inherently incomplete instrument in concrete cases. On the basis of the identification of early setbacks, we suggest a reform of the IACommHR filtering function, which should be limited to the evaluation of petitions’ admissibility and to coordinate the availability of crucial contextual information. This function should be performed with the support of Inter-­‐ American Commission of Women’s expertise. Such procedural reform would improve analyses of complex cases emerging from intersectionality and cultural diversity, still unsatisfactorily developed. Our second, and consequent, objective is to use our findings to identify a generalizable method to ensure women’s rights plausibility. We argue that both ECrtHR’s case law and CoE Member States’ legislations on VAW are still at an early stage. However, the Istanbul Convention does not grant the ECrtHR competence on the protection mechanism established. On the basis of our findings, we argue the need to reconsider ECrtHR role with respect to the Istanbul Convention and present a concrete proposal to guarantee the feasibility of its <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> avoiding further clogging-­‐up, valorising the recently introduced Pilot Judgment Procedure and the specific expertise provided by GREVIO...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho tem por finalidade {{investigar}} a disciplina do procedimento monitório no ordenamento jurídico brasileiro, o qual foi introduzido, como uma modalidade de tutela jurisdicional diferenciada, através da Lei 9. 079, de 14 de julho de 1995. Para tanto, foi empreendida uma ampla pesquisa bibliográfica com o objetivo de analisar os mais remotos antecedentes históricos da tutela jurídica sob análise, bem como a transformação por esta sofrida no decorrer dos tempos, além de algumas experiências alienígenas satisfatórias em relação ao tema, sobretudo a italiana e a alemã. No que tange ao perfil impresso pelo legislador pátrio a esse procedimento especial de jurisdição contenciosa, seus principais aspectos polêmicos também foram analisados, não apenas no que se refere à natureza jurídica de alguns pronunciamentos judiciais passíveis de serem emitidos durante a tramitação desta modalidade procedimental, como outros temas que têm gerado muita dissensão, sobretudo aqueles relacionados à adequação dessa tutela em face de algumas pessoas, como, por exemplo, a Fazenda Pública. A nova disciplina conferida ao cumprimento das sentenças, introduzida no ordenamento jurídico por meio da Lei 11. 232 de 22 de dezembro de 2005, afetou sobremaneira o procedimento ora analisado, de modo que também foi objeto de analise, ainda que de forma sucinta, por fugir aos escopos fundamentais que nortearam a execução desse trabalhoThis work aims at {{investigating the}} regular procedure of tutelage in the juridical order of Brazil, which was introduced {{as a form}} of differentiated juridical tutelage by the Law 9079, from July 14, 1995. A wide bibiographycal research was made with the objective of analysing the former historical records of the juridical tutelage, which {{is the subject of this}} analysis, as well as the changes it suffered with the years, besides some successful foreign experiences concerning this issue, especially the ones in Italy and germany. As for the defined profile by the national legislator to this procedure of <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> its main polemic aspects were also analysed, not only in relation to the juridical nature of some juridical procedures likely to be released during the development of this procedure form, but also other topics which have brought in a lot of discussion, especially those related to the suitability of this tutelage when faced, for instance, to the Public Administration. The new regulation given to the fullfilment of the sentences introduced in the juridical order by the Law 11232, from December 22, 2005, has affected tremendously the procedure here analysed. Therefore it was also object of analysis, although in a brief way, once it was not relevant to the frame which guided the accomplishment of this wor...|$|E
40|$|En aquesta Tesi s'ha tractat de realitzar un estudi unitari sobre els acomiadaments col·lectius i bàsicament s'han analitzat quatre línies d'investigació: En primer lloc, la reforma de 1994 i de 1997 sobre la causalitat, l'element teleològic i sobre alguns aspectes més del procediment, van aconseguir dotar els acomiadaments per causes empresarials d'una flexibilitat que xocava amb la rigidesa que havia predominat fins aleshores. Per altra banda, la reforma de 1994 va suposar un impuls {{important}} del període de consultes i va convertir el període de consultes en una vertadera negociació col·lectiva sobre la reestructuració empresarial. A partir de les modificacions introduïdes per la reforma, les parts no només hauran de negociar i programar un número determinat d'acomiadaments i les corresponents indemnitzacions, sinó que hauran d'esforçar-se per reduir l'abast i l'impacte de la reestructuració, amb la qual cosa tot el que està relacionat amb la reestructuració esdevé més complicat per la diversitat de mesures que es poden negociar i per les relacions que ha de mantenir l'acord sobre la reestructuració respecte al conveni col·lectiu i inclús respecte als contractes de treball. Tanmateix, el nou tractament que va rebre el període de consultes a partir de la reforma de 1994, no ha aconseguit diversificar els continguts dels acords sobre la reestructuració. No obstant, aquesta tendència podria canviar. Cada vegada més, comencem a familiaritzar-nos amb un nou concepte "les reestructuracions socialment responsables". Segons es desprèn d'aquests plantejaments, en una reestructuració no només hem de tenir en compte els interessos econòmics, sinó també els socials i cal buscar la participació i la implicació de totes les parts implicades a través de la informació i la consulta oberta. Per tant, aquests nous plantejaments poden suposar un nou impuls del període de consultes i evitar que els acord es limiten a recollir mesures reparadores dels acomiadaments. Alhora, aquestes reformes han deixat sense resoldre altre tipus de problemes que tal vegada haurien de fer que ens replantejarem el paper que ha de tenir l'autoritat laboral en els expedients de regulació d'ocupació. De fet els importants conflictes competencials entre la jurisdicció contenciosa i la social, aconsellen actuar en aquest sentit. In this Thesis one {{has been}} to make a unitary study on the collective dismissals and basically four lines of investigation have been analyzed: In the first place, the reform of 1994 and 1997 on the causality, the purpose and on some aspects more of the procedure, was able to equip to the dismissals by enterprise causes of a flexibility that hit the rigidity that had predominated until then. On the other hand, the 1994 reform supposed an important impulse of the period of consultations and turned the period of consultations a true collective negotiation on the enterprise reconstruction. From the modifications introduced by the reform, the parts will {{not only have to}} negotiate and to program a determined number of dismissals and the corresponding indemnifications, but that they will have to make an effort to reduce to the reach and the impact of the reconstruction, to which all whatever is related to the complica reconstruction more by the diversity of measures that can be negotiated and by the relations that it has to even maintain the agreement on the reconstruction respect to the collective agreement and respect to work contracts. However, the new treatment that received the period of consultations from the 1994 reform, {{has not been able to}} diversify the contents in the agreements on the reconstruction. However, this tendency could change. More and more, we began to become familiar with a new concept "the socially responsible reconstructions". According to it is come off these expositions, in a reconstruction we not only must consider the economic interests, but also the social ones and is precise to look for the participation and the implication of all the childbirths implied through the information and the open consultation. Therefore, these new expositions can suppose a new impulse of the period of consultations and avoid that the agreements are limited in gathering repairing measures of the dismissals. Simultaneously, these reforms have left without solving another kind of problems that they would perhaps have to do that we will reframe the paper that must have the labor authority in the files of use regulation. In fact the important competential conflicts between the <b>contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and the social one, advise to act in this sense...|$|E
