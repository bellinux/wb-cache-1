This system operates at <b>chain</b> <b>speed</b> and makes use of 2 D x-ray images taken of the carcass to identify cutting lines. The opportunity exists to replace this x-ray system with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) system which meets robotic image requirements while also enabling the determination of body composition. This study tested a prototype DEXA design that we {{have developed}} with the hypothesis that this system could determine body composition at <b>chain</b> <b>speed.</b> 12 Merino lamb carcasses with weights ranging between 14 and 16. 3 kg were scanned using the prototype D EXA system to derive an estimate of fat composition. The carcasses were then scanned using Computed Tomography (CT) to determine fat, lean and bone weights which were then expressed {{as a percentage of}} carcase weight. Composition of these carcases varied between 9 - 15. 5 % for CT fat, 68 - 72. 5 % for CT lean, and 16. 2 to 20. 7 % for CT bone. The DEXA estimate of fat composition was then used to predict CT fat, lean, and bone percentage. Our findings supported the hypothesis as the DEXA system was able to predict carcase composition with a precision (R 2) of 0. 88, 0. 34, and 0. 60 for predicting the percentage of CT fat, CT lean and CT bone in the carcase.

Lančane sjekačice se koriste za izradu horizontalnih i vertikalnih rezova, a primjenu su našle u površinskoj i podzemnoj eksploataciji u slabo do srednje abrazivnim i mekim do srednje tvrdim stijenama. Učinkovitost lančane sjekačice pri eksploataciji arhitektonskog kamena ovisi o pravilnom izboru radnih veličina stroja, reznih elemenata te uvjeta i načina eksploatacije u određenoj vrsti stijene. Iako su lančane sjekačice tehnološki napredovale, one još uvijek rade uz određene nedostatke. Dosadašnjim istraživanjima ustanovljeno je da sjekačice ne rade pri optimalnim radnim veličinama, a postojeće konstrukcije lanca nisu dovoljno optimalne. U radu su prikazane postojeće metode za određivanje učinka lančanih sjekačica, a na temelju dosadašnjih istraživanja izložene su smjernice za daljnja istraživanja. Chain saw {{machines}} {{are used for}} cutting vertical or horizontal cuts in underground and surface exploitation of dimension stone. Chainsaw performance in quarrying dimension stone depends on the right choice of machine’s operational parameters, cutting elements {{as well as the}} conditions and methods of quarrying in the certain type of rock. The key operational parameters which the operator must arrange on a chain saw are <b>chain</b> <b>speed</b> and cart speed movement, while the values of this parameters are based on manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations and/or the operator experience. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the relationship between the operational parameters, chain design and chainsaw performance. Based on previous research, despite the limited literature on chain saw performance, it can be concluded that chain saws do not operate with optimum operational parameters, and current chain designs are not efficient enough. Influence of the cutting chain design on the chainsaw performance can be analyzed by laboratory tests using a linear cutting machine. Although previous researches provide specific guidelines to increase chainsaw performance, further research should be directed to determine the optimal arrangement and the number of tools in the cutting segment as well as to the influence of the cutting geometry on the force and cutting energy. It is also reported that insufficient efficiency of chainsaw machines is due the shallow depth of cuts taken by the cutting tools. Chain saw performance can be increased with the increase of the depth of cutting tools or with the decrease of <b>chain</b> <b>speed</b> respectively. Optimal <b>chain</b> <b>speed</b> cannot be determined solely on the basis of the specific energy since the optimal speed also depends on the cutting force and the wear of cutting tools as well as on the amount of material created during the cutting. Additional laboratory and field experiments should analyse the influence of the above quantities on chain saw performance in order to determine optimum constructional and operational parameters...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{interest}} expressed by consumers toward food products quality {{as well as}} toward their linkage to the territory, has led producers to fit to the continuous rising demand for “typical products”, and to look for new and more efficient production and marketing strategies. An emblematic case is represented by Tropea red onion that, as a typical product, {{plays an important role}} in economical and rural development of the territory to which it is linked. The organoleptic features offered by “Tropea Red Onion”, PGI certified (Calabria), have to be associated as well to the quality of services that accompanies its processing. Technology application in post-harvest operations, has certainly contributed to make faster and less tiring all processing tasks. The main problem related to the mechanization of Tropea red onion post-harvest operations lies in the removal of the various layers of the external tunic, making it impossible for optical or electronic grader to achieve this task in a satisfactory way since the sensors are not able yet to separate the “bulb” from its involucre. In this context, the current study aims to assess the productivity of three different machines used for round Tropea red onion grading, and determine their work efficiency.

40|$|With {{concurrent}} chains {{arranged for}} a pigeon's key pecks, pecks on two concurrently available initial-link keys (left and right) respectively produce separately operating terminal links (A and B).

Baseline preferences, however, are often variable and typically are determined indirectly (e. g., with unequal A and B, reversing left-right assignments of A and B over sessions and estimating the baseline from differences between the relative rates generated).

Even as the baselines fluctuated, preference was observable within sessions as the difference between relative initial-link response rates in the two components. The first experiment demonstrated the rapid development of preferences when terminal links A and B consisted of fixed-interval 15 -s and 30 -s schedules.
