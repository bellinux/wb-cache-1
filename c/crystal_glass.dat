As a reference to a brief appearance by Nimoy's character William Bell, sound editor Bruce Tanis was instructed to create bells as a recurring motif in the scene when Bell encounters Olivia and gives her vital information about the parallel universe. Tanis explained that because he couldn't put the sound of bells in everything, he [...] "took some dry ice recordings and pitched them down considerably and reverbed them to become ringing tones that I played underneath the whole scene". Tanis also used some [...] "reversed" [...] ship's bells as well as <b>crystal</b> <b>glass</b> rubs in order to make Bell's office sound like multiple layers of glass and bell sounds; he referred to the scene as [...] "a little ominous" [...] but not [...] "too cliche".|$|E

60|$|But to proceed; I observ'd several kind of hairs {{that had}} been Dyed, and {{found them to be}} a kind of horny Cylinder, being of much about the {{transparency}} of a pretty cleer piece of Oxe horn; these appear'd quite throughout ting'd with the colours they exhibited. And 'tis likely, that those hairs being boyl'd or steep'd in those very hot ting'd liquors in the Dye-fat, And the substance of the hair being much like that of an Oxes Horn, the penetrant liquor does so far mollifie and soften the substance, that it sinks into the very center of it, and so the ting'd parts come to be mix'd and united with the very body of the hair, and do not (as some have thought) only stick on upon the outward surface. And this, the boiling of Horn will make more probable; for we shall find by that action, that the water will insinuate it self to a pretty depth within the surface of it, especially if this penetrancy of the water be much helped by the Salts that are usually mix'd with the Dying liquors. Now, whereas Silk may be dyed or ting'd into all kind of colours without boiling or dipping into hot liquors, I ghess the reason to be two-fold: First, because the filaments, or small cylinders of Silk, are abundantly smaller and finer, and so have a much less depth to be penetrated then most kind of hairs; and next, because the substance or matter of Silk, is much more like a Glew then the substance of Hair is. And that I have reason to suppose: First, because when it is spun or drawn out of the Worm, it is a perfect glutinous substance, and very easily sticks and cleaves to any adjacent body, as I have several times observed, both in Silk-worms and Spiders. Next, because that I find that water does easily dissolve and mollifie the substance again, which is evident from their manner of ordering those bottoms or pods of the Silk-worm before they are able to unwind them. It is no great wonder therefore, if those Dyes or ting'd liquors do very quickly mollifie and tinge the surfaces of so small and so glutinous a body. And we need not wonder that the colours appear so lovely in the one, and so dull in the other, if we view but the ting'd cylinders of both kinds with a good Microscope; for whereas the substance of Hair, at best, is but a dirty duskish white somewhat transparent, the filaments of Silk have a most lovely transparency and cleerness, the difference between those two being not much less then that between a piece of Horn, and a piece of Crystal; the one yielding a bright and vivid reflection from the concave side of the cylinder, that is, from the concave surface of the Air that incompasses the back-part of the cylinder; the other yielding a dull and perturb'd reflection from the several Heterogeneous parts that compose it. And this difference will be manifest enough to the eye, if you get a couple of small Cylinders, the smaller of <b>Crystal</b> <b>Glass,</b> the other of Horn, and then varnishing them over very thinly with some transparent colour, which will represent to the naked eye much the same kind of object which is represented to it from the filaments of Silk and Hair by the help of the Microscope. Now, since the threads of Silk and Serge are made up of a great number of these filaments, we may henceforth cease to wonder at the difference. From much the same reason proceeds the vivid and lovely colours of Feathers, wherein they very farr exceed the natural as well as Artificial colours of hair, of which I shall say more in its proper place.|$|E

How all these attributes did bend Themselves to work our life, Through the Christ whom God did send To save us by his might. 23.

Immortal are they every one, Wrapt up in health and light, Mortality from them is gone, Weakness is turn'd to might. 48. The stars are not so clear as they, They equalize the sun; Their glory shines to perfect day, Which day will ne'er be done. 49. No sorrow can them now annoy, Nor weakness, grief or pain; No faintness can abate their joy, They now in life do reign. 50. They shall not there, as here, be vex'd With Satan, men, or sin; Nor with their wicked hearts perplex'd, The heavens have cop'd[8] them in. 51. Thus, as they shine in their estate, So, too, in their degree; Which is most goodly to relate, And ravishing to see. 52. The majesty whom they adore, Doth them in wisdom place Upon the thrones, and that before The angels, to their grace. 53. The saints of the Old Testament, Full right to their degree; Likewise the New, in excellent Magnificency be. 54. Each one his badge of glory wears, According to his place; According as was his affairs Here, {{in the time of}} grace. 55. Some on the right hand of the Lamb, Likewise some on the left, With robes and golden chains do stand Most grave, most sage, and deft.[9] 56. The martyr here is known from him Who peaceably did die, Both by the place he sitteth in, And by his dignity. 57. Each father, saint, and prophet shall, According to his worth, Enjoy the honour of his call, And plainly hold it forth. 58. Those bodies which sometimes were torn, And bones that broken were For God's word; he doth now adorn With health and glory fair. 59. Thus, when in heav'nly harmony These blessed saints appear, Adorn'd with grace and majesty, What gladness will be there! 60. The light, and grace, and countenance, The least of these shall have, Will so with terror them advance, And make their face so grave, 61. That at them all the world will shake, When they lift up their head; Princes and kings will at them quake, And fall before them dead. 62. This shall we see, thus shall we be, O would the day were come, Lord Jesus take us up to thee, To this desired home. 63. Angels also we shall behold, When we on high ascend, Each shining like to men of gold, And on the Lord attend. 64. These goodly creatures, full of grace, Shall stand about the throne, Each one with lightning in his face, And shall to us be known. 65. These cherubims with one accord Shall cry continually, Ah, holy, holy, holy, Lord, And heavenly majesty. 66. These will us in their arms embrace, And welcome us to rest, And joy to see us clad with grace, And of the heavens possess'd. 67. This we shall hear, this we shall see, While raptures take us up, When we with blessed Jesus be, And at his table sup. 68. Oh shining angels! what, must we With you lift up our voice? We must; and with you ever be, And with you must rejoice. 69. Our friends that lived godly here, Shall there be found again; The wife, the child, and father dear, With others of our train. 70. Each one down to the foot in white, Fill'd to the brim with grace, Walking among the saints in light, With glad and joyful face. 71. Those God did use us to convert, We there with joy shall meet, And jointly shall, with all our heart, In life each other greet. 72. A crown to them we then shall be, A glory and a joy; And that before the Lord, when he The world comes to destroy. 73. This is the place, this is the state, Of all that fear the Lord; Which men nor angels may relate With tongue, or pen, or word. 74. No night is here, for to eclipse Its spangling rays so bright; Nor doubt, nor fear to shut the lips, Of those within this light. 75. The strings of music here are tun'd For heavenly harmony, And every spirit here perfum'd With perfect sanctity. 76. Here runs the crystal streams of life, Quite through all our veins. And here by love we do unite With glory's golden chains. 77. Now that which sweet'neth all will be The lasting of this state; This heightens all we hear or see To a transcendant rate. 78. For should the saints enjoy all this But for a certain time, O, how would they their mark then miss, And at this thing repine? 79. Yea, 'tis not possible that they Who then shall dwell on high, Should be content, unless they may Dwell there eternally. 80. A thought of parting with this place Would bitter all their sweet, And darkness put upon the face Of all they there do meet. 81. But far from this the saints shall be, Their portion is the Lord, Whose face for ever they shall see, As saith the holy word. 82. And that with everlasting peace, Joy, and felicity, From this time forth they shall increase Unto eternity.|$|E
