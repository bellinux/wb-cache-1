Rather, agencies use minority-based preferences in order to reduce their workload, thereby awarding contracts for convenience rather than to redress disadvantage and discrimination. We demonstrate that, when agencies use these expedient measures to sidestep the intent of public policy, they risk diverting contracts from deserving to undeserving firms.

40|$|We study own and rival risk in {{a dynamic}} duopoly with a homo-geneous output good, {{stochastic}} industry demand, and real options to expand or <b>contract</b> <b>capacity.</b> We focus on asymmetric cost functions and sequential option exercise. In general, a competitor’s options to adjust capacity reduce own-firm risk. Intuitively, {{improvements in the}} product market bring the offsetting bad news that rival expansion is nearer. Similarly, negative demand shocks are counterbalanced by an increased likelihood of competitor contraction in the near future. The magnitude of these hedging effects increases as the rival moves closer to its expansion or contraction boundaries. As a consequence, own firm and industry risk move together when contraction options are exercised and oppositely during expansions. Thus, the commonly recommended practice of using competitor or industry betas to proxy for own-firm risk should work well in certain environments, but not in others, pro-viding testable new empirical predictions...|$|E

Importantly, in all but ’mature ’ industries, i. e. industries where all real options have been exercised, the existence of a rival reduces risk due to the ability of a rival to either expand or contract.

40|$|Since the {{promulgation}} of the Third Energy Package by the European Commission, relevant {{efforts have}} taken place to harmonize country-level regulatory frameworks and constitute the Single natural gas market. One of the main changes is the ownership unbundling of transmission assets, {{the creation of an}} Independent System Operator and the adoption of an entry-exit system for third party access. Within this new regulatory framework, shippers that are in charge of conveying gas from producers to consumers must <b>contract</b> <b>capacity</b> and operate in gas facilities. This paper develops an optimization model to analyze shippers behavior in entry-exit markets, which can be used equally by shippers, independent system and facility operators, and regulatory authorities. The model has been applied to an actual gas market, like the Iberian natural gas market. Results indicate that different optimal contracting and operation behaviors take place in gas facilities. Moreover, after a market efficiency examination, the paper proposes regulatory measures that would support the objectives of the European Commission (competition, security of supply and sustainability) such as the merger of balancing zones and the constitution of competitive balancing and secondary capacity markets. info:eu-repo/semantics/draf...|$|E

40|$|Objectives Contracting health {{services}} outside the public, statutory health system entails purchasing capacity from domestic non-public providers or from providers abroad. Over the last decade, these practices {{have made their}} way into European health systems, brought about by performance-oriented reforms and EU principles of free movement. The aim of the article is to explain the development, functioning, purposes and possible implications of cross-border contracting. Methods Primary and secondary sources on purchasing from providers abroad have been collected in a systematic way and analysed in a structured frame. Results We found practices in six European countries. The findings suggest that purchasers from benefit-in-kind systems <b>contract</b> <b>capacity</b> abroad when this responds to unmet demand; pressures domestic providers; and/or offers financial advantages, especially where statutory purchasers compete. Providers which receive patients tend to be located in countries where treatment costs are lower and/or where providers compete. The modalities of purchasing and delivering care abroad vary considerably depending on contracts being centralised or direct, the involvement of middlemen, funding and pricing mechanisms, cross-border pathways and volumes of patient flows. Conclusions The arrangements and concepts which cross-border contracting relies on suggest that statutory health purchasers, under pressure to deliver value for money and striving for cost-efficiency, experiment with new ways of organising {{health services}} for their populations.

40|$|Inspired by the {{observation}} that <b>capacity</b> <b>contracts</b> are used by some retailers to increase their transport provider's investments in green transport solutions, we investigate and compare a service provider's optimal investment, and its environmental implications under a volume and a <b>capacity</b> <b>contract</b> respectively. We solve the service provider's investment problem {{under the assumption that}} the retailer uses the service to replenish a warehouse with storable goods. We then show that a <b>capacity</b> <b>contract</b> leads to more green transports, but not necessarily a larger investment in green transport solutions. At the same time, the optimal solution involves heavy investment in inventory at the retailer. The investment in inventory is non-decreasing in the cost benefit of the green transports, which may have a significant negative environmental impact. The implication is that a <b>capacity</b> <b>contract</b> will lead to better environmental performance than a volume contract only when the green transports' cost benefit is within a given interval. Whether the <b>capacity</b> <b>contract</b> is the more profitable option for the service provider within this interval depends on inventory related costs and the relative environmental costs from transportation and inventory. Interestingly, owing to this, regulation that target the price of the conventional vehicles, such as a carbon tax, may lead to both an increase or a decrease in environmental performance...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In a {{manufacturing}} environment with volatile demand, inventory management can be coupled with dynamic capacity adjustments for handling the fluctuations more effectively. In {{this study we}} consider the integrated management of inventory and flexible capacity management under seasonal stochastic demand and uncertain labor supply. The capacity planning problem is investigated from the workforce planning perspective. We consider a manufacturing firm that can temporarily increase its production capacity by utilizing contingent workers from an external labor supply agency. The uncertainty of contingent capacity arises from the (un) availability of contingent workers, the pool size and {{the behavior of the}} labor supply agency. Using a dynamic programming approach, we formulate an infinite horizon model determining the optimal levels of permanent and <b>contracted</b> <b>capacity,</b> in order to minimize the total cost of operations. Within the dynamic program, we determine the optimal operational capacity decisions, namely the size of <b>contracted</b> and contingent <b>capacity</b> to be utilized in each period. The characteristics of the optimal policies are analyzed under an infinite horizon setting. In addition we consider temporary labor contracts, that diminish the effects of supply uncertainty on the manufacturer, at a specific contracting cost. Our analysis shows that as the supply uncertainty and/or the expected cost of utilizing contingent workers increase, the value of temporary labor contracts also increase. In contrast increasing demand variability reduces the incentive of the manufacturer to own capacity and increases the utilization of contingent resources. Paç, Mehmet FazılM. S...|$|R

30|$|VNOs, {{placed at}} the top of the hierarchy, require {{wireless}} connectivity to be offered to their subscribers, not owning any radio access infrastructure [8, 9]. VNOs ask for RAN-as-a-service (RANaaS) from the RAN provider with physical infrastructure [25]. VNOs do not have to deal with the management of virtual RANs; they just define requirements, such as <b>contracted</b> <b>capacity,</b> in their SLAs with RAN providers. The role of VRRM is to translate VNOs’ requirements and SLAs into a set of policies for the lower levels [8]. These policies contain data rates for different services, in addition to their priorities. Although VRRM optimises the usage of virtual radio resources, it does not deal with physical ones. However, VRRM has to consider practical issues, as the effect of the collision rate in WLANs on network data rate, in order to have an effective management of virtual radio resources. Reports and monitoring information provided by CRRM enables VRRM to improve policies. Load balancing among RANs, controlling the offloading procedure, is the duty of CRRM also known as Join RRM.
