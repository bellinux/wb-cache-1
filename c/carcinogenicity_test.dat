40|$|This {{survey is}} a {{compendium}} of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity information of 838 marketed drugs, whose expected clinical use is continuous for at least 6 months or intermittent {{over an extended period}} of time. Of these 838 drugs, 366 (43. 7 %) do not have retrievable genotoxicity or carcinogenicity data. The remaining 472 (56. 3 %) have at least one genotoxicity or <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test</b> result. Of the 449 drugs with at least one genotoxicity test result, 183 (40. 8 %) have at least one positive finding. Of the 338 drugs with at least one <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test</b> result, 160 (47. 3 %) have at least one positive result. Concerning the predictivity of genetic toxicology findings for long-term carcinogenesis assays, of the 315 drugs which have both genotoxicity and carcinogenicity data 116 (36. 8 %) are neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic, 50 (15. 9 %) are non-carcinogens which test positive in at least one genotoxicity assay, 75 (23. 8 %) are carcinogenic in at least one sex of mice or rats but test negative in genotoxicity assays, and 74 (23. 5 %) are both genotoxic and carcinogenic. Only 208 (24. 8 %) of the 838 drugs considered have all data required by current guidelines for testing of pharmaceuticals. However, it should be noted that a large fraction of the drugs considered were developed and marketed prior to the present regulatory climate. Although the laws do not require re-testing based on revised standards, in the absence of epidemiological studies excluding a carcinogenic risk to humans, a re-evalutation would be appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Tumor {{promoters}} {{are known}} to induce ODC activity in mouse skin and that this induction can be inhibited by the application of 13 -cis-retinoic acid. These two properties of tumor promoters were utilized for screening new tumor promoters in our environment. Two new classes of tumor promoters are presented: indole alkaloids (teleocidin and lyngbyatoxin A) and polyacetates (aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin). Teleocidin from streptomyces and lyngbyatoxin A, from the blue-green alga, Lgngbya majuscula, were able to induce ODC activity in mouse skin and showed various biological activities {{similar to those of}} TPA. Teleocidin and lyngbyatoxin A are indole alkaloids. Their tumor promoting activities became apparent in the mouse skin through a two-stage <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test.</b> The tumor incidence of the group treated with DMBA plus teleocidin was 100 % at week 30, which was {{similar to that of the}} group given DMBA and TPA. The in vivo <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test</b> with lyngbyatoxin A is still underway. The tumor incidence of the group treated with DMBA plus lyngbyatoxin A is 80 % at week 21. A second new class of tumor promoter is polyacetate. Aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin were isolated from another variety of blue-green alga. Aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin induce ODC to the same degree of potency. However, aplysiatoxin induced various membrane effects, such as adhesion of cells and turnover of phospholipid with a similar concentration of TPA, teleocidin and lyngbyatoxin A. On the other hand, debromoaplysiatoxin required an amount almost 100 times greater to achieve the same effects. We are convinced of the possibility that various classes of tumor promoters exist in our environment...|$|E

Conventional 2 -year rodent bioassays {{are one of the most}} resource-consuming tests in terms of animals, time, and costs. Development of rapid <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> systems that can assess carcinogenicity within a short period has become a social demand and is essential to improve efficacy in the identification of environmental carcinogens as well as in the development of new drugs. In this review we introduce the rapid <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> system using transgenic (Tg) mice carrying the human prototype c-Ha-ras gene, namely rasH 2 mouse (CB 6 F 1 -TgHras 2 mouse is the same mouse). The studies have been conducted to validate the rasH 2 mouse as a model for the rapid <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> system. Our current validation studies revealed that rasH 2 mice are able to detect various types of mutagenic carcinogens within 6 months. The rasH 2 mice may also be able to detect various nonmutagenic carcinogens. The validation studies also revealed that rasH 2 mice are generally much more susceptible to both mutagenic and nonmutagenic carcinogens than control non-Tg mice. No significant tumor induction has been observed in rasH 2 mice with either mutagenic or nonmutagenic noncarcinogens. More rapid onset and higher incidence of more malignant tumors can be expected with a high probability after treatment with various carcinogens in the rasH 2 mice than in control non-Tg mice. The rasH 2 mouse appears to be a promising candidate as an animal model for development of a rapid <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> system.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the carcinogenic susceptibility of rasH 2 mice to 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 - f]quinoline (IQ), 7 -week-old rasH 2 mice and their wild-type littermates (non-Tg mice) {{of both the}} sexes were fed a diet containing 0 or 300 ppm IQ for 26 weeks. Microscopical examinations revealed that the proliferative lesions of the forestomach, including squamous cell hyperplasias, papillomas, and carcinomas, were frequently encountered in male and female rasH 2 mice fed with IQ. In non-Tg mice, {{no significant differences in}} the incidence of forestomach lesions were observed between the 0 ppm and 300 ppm groups. Histopathological changes such as periportal hepatocellular hypertrophy and oval cell proliferation in the liver were more apparent in female rasH 2 and non-Tg mice than in males, and the incidence of hepatocellular altered foci significantly increased in female rasH 2 mice in the 300 ppm group as compared to that in the 0 ppm group.

Activated compounds were assayed by reaction with 4 -(4 -nitrobenzyl) pyridine (NBP). A model nucleophile of 7 -alkylguanine of nucleic acids, NBP produces a violet color following alkylation. Twenty compounds from several chemical classes were tested. The test generally gave positive and negative responses where expected. Two compounds, trichloroethylene and diethylnitrosamine, exhibited a linear Beer's law relationship in the concentration range tested. A high degree of linear correlation (r> 0. 97) was obtained for these compounds. Other compounds showed varying degrees of linear correlation from high correlation (r= 0. 94) to weak correlation (r= 0. 44). The CAS-NBP assay results were compared to bacterial mutagenicity and animal <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test</b> results when information was available. A good correlation (r= 0. 80) existed between direct alkylating activity and direct mutagenicity. Similar correlations existed between NBP alkylation following activation and mutagenicity following microsomal activation (r= 0. 73).

40|$|Although {{much has}} been elucidated about the {{mechanism}} of cellular carcinogenesis, evaluation of the carcinogenicity of substances is still difficult. Since {{a number of new}} synthetic materials for drugs and food have been developed, it is necessary to sufficiently evaluate their carcinogenicities. In carcinogenicity tests performed at present, the test substance is administered to rodents for 2 years (their life span) and its carcinogenicity in each organ is evaluated by macroscopic and pathological examinations. Such carcinogenicity tests require considerable time and resources. In this study, we attempted to develop a new <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test</b> by global gene expression analysis, which is independent of target organ-specific activity of carcinogens. All food and chemicals are primarily transported to the liver via the portal vein, both of which are independent of the routes of intake. Therefore, we selected the liver as the best organ with which to assess carcinogenicity in gene expression analysis.

40|$|Acceptance of new {{tests that}} are {{alternatives}} to currently used toxicology tests {{is a topic}} of considerable importance {{in the field of}} toxicology. <b>Carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> today normally includes 2 -year studies in rats and mice of both sexes, following widely accepted procedures for husbandry; selection of dose levels; pathology and toxicity observations; and statistical interpretation of tumor data. These studies are usually preceded by tests for genetic toxicity and subchronic toxicity studies to select dose levels for the 2 -year studies. Although these data are used for quantitative risk assessment, the mechanistic basis for effects is usually unknown. The series of studies is very expensive and requires 5 years or more to conduct. Alternative approaches are being developed that would provide more mechanistic information and hopefully would permit decisions to be made about carcinogenic potential without the need to conduct 2 -year studies in rats and mice of both sexes.

40|$|To {{estimate}} potential human risk {{of exposure}} to a food-derived, genotoxic hepatocarcinogen, 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), a 2 -year <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test</b> was conducted using male F 344 rats administered MeIQx-containing diet at doses of 0 (control), 0. 001, 1, and 100 ppm. The lowest dose 0. 001 ppm was established as equivalent to the daily intake of this carcinogen in humans (0. 2 to 2. 6 µg/man/day). Significant decreases of survival rate and body weight gain were observed in rats treated with 100 ppm MeIQx. Histopathological examination revealed significant induction of hepatocellular carcinomas, adenomas, and development of glutathione S-transferase placental form–positive foci with MeIQx at 100 ppm. Moreover, the incidences of Zymbal’s glands carcinoma, mammary fibroadenoma, and subcutaneous fibroma were found significantly increased in a 100 ppm MeIQx group.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether long, straight MWCNT have an asbestos-like effect and whether possibly carcinogenic and other adverse effects can be detected in in vitro screening assays and in in vivo assays with short durations. For this purpose, a <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test</b> was conducted and a BrdU test was developed. Inhalation tests (short-term and 90 day inhalation) were performed to determine MWCNT migration and clearance. In addition, in vitro experiments were carried out as a screening test to enable early prediction of possible toxicity or carcinogenicity. In this study, it could be shown that all four MWCNT tested in the <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test</b> caused a dose-dependent increase in mesothelioma and mortality in rats. These results, however, did not enable any conclusion to be drawn as to whether the length or the diameter of MWCNT is decisive for mesothelioma development. There was evidence though that a more needlelike and rigid structure of MWCNT leads to a higher mesothelioma rate. The BrdU test after a single i. p. injection of MWCNT is suitable for earty detection of a possible carcinogenic potential. The best time for this determination was found to be three months after treatment with MWCNT. A subchronic (90 day) inhalation test hardly demonstrated any migration of the MWCNT. Macrophage accumulations (particle- or fiber-loaded) were found in all treatment groups throughout the observation period. In addition, inflammatory reactions (microgranuloma and fibrosis) were observed in the MWCNT, Printex 90 (no microgranuloma) and amosite-exposed groups. Findings were more pronounced in animals after Printex 90 and amosite inhalation. These effects were not reversible in MWCNT 1 -exposed animals and in Printex 90 or amosite-exposed animals, compared with MWCNT 2 and 3 a-exposed animals. Retention analysis revealed a strongly delayed dearance in MWCNT 1 and 2 -exposed animals. MWCNT 3 a-exposed animals showed a processing-induced, unusually short clearance of 38 days for WHO fibers (length-to-diameter ratio: >= 3 / 1, length > 5 m and diameter m). For MWCNT 3, hydrolysis of the lungs would have to be optimized. In a short-term inhalation test with 60 Co-activated MWCNT, migration of MWCNT from the lungs to the blood-rich organs was measured. The strongest migration was found after one day. High 60 Co activity, however, was also measured in the gastrointestinal tract, so that it must be assumed that the animals swallowed a large proportion of MWCNT during inhalation. In the in vitro tests, treatment especially with MWCNT 3 showed an increased toxic potential in the RICC test, LOH assay, and comet assay. Among the in vitro methods evaluated in this study, the most suitable screening test for in vivo experiments seems to be the RICC test, in which MWCNT 1, 2 and 3 a led to a reduction of cell growth or an increase in cell mortality. At present, in vitro experiments can thus provide a first indication of increased toxicity, but subsequent in vivo tests are so far inevitable...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} in {{response}} to the challenge issued to the scientific community by the National Toxicology Program to predict the carcinogenicity potential of 30 chemicals previously selected for long-term <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing.</b> Utilizing the available toxicologic, genetic, and structural information on 30 chemicals previously selected for long-term <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing,</b> we predict that 16 chemicals (53 %) would induce some indication of carcinogenic activity in rodents; we further predict that 10 chemicals (33 %) would be associated with weak or equivocal carcinogenic responses, and another 4 (13 %) would give no indication of carcinogenicity.

40|$|In this article, {{we explain}} the {{emergence}} of new short-term <b>tests</b> for <b>carcinogenicity</b> involving genetically engineered animals for the purposes of pharmaceutical regulation. Drawing on some long-standing theories of technological innovation, we argue that the alteration of carcinogenic risk assessment of pharmaceuticals, which occurred from 1998, did not result solely, or perhaps even mainly, from internal logical and technical developments in the experimental sciences of toxicology or genetics. Rather, this process innovation in regulatory science resulted from a complex interaction between scientist activism around molecularization of toxicology in powerful US government institutions, on the one hand, and a powerful research-based trans-national pharmaceutical industry committed to deregulatory mobilization, on the other, seeking to reduce <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> of its products and capable of marshalling significant support from governments and regulators, especially in Europe and Japan, to achieve that goal. The new techno-scientific basis for regulatory decisions about whether pharmaceuticals are carcinogenic risks to the public was, in effect, an accommodation in “bio-political“ trading between two power-blocks of expert scientists.

40|$|It is now {{accepted}} that screening for carcinogens in animals is expensive and demonstrates carcinogenic potential rather than actual carcinogenicity in man. A number of short-term tests which depend on mutagenicity, stimulation of DNA repair, {{ability to produce}} chromosome damage or other actions, and which correlate {{at least to some}} extent with carcinogenic potential, have been devised. These have the advantages of being rapid and cheap. Some can be carried out by using human cells. They may have advantages in the context of air pollution since they are sensitive down to very low dose levels and since they can deal with complex mixtures. Combinations of such tests may be of more value than any single test. Their particular value may be as a preliminary screening procedure in a tiered testing programme which may have high predictive efficiency. Urban air contains a number of different mate-rials, some of which have been shown to have car-cinogenic potential in experimental animal systems [...] In particular, a number of polycyclic aromatic hy-drocarbons have been recognized (1, 2). It is not, however, clear whether the presence of these ma-terials is causally related to the excess of malignant disease, particularly of carcinoma of the lung, in urban areas as compared with rural areas. The pres-ence of potential carcinogens is not in doubt. What is not known is whether these compounds are pres-ent in a form which is capable of reaching sensitive tissues and, if so, in sufficient quantity to cause cancer. Nor is it known whether the interactions between compounds will affect carcinogenic poten-tial of the individual compounds present in these complex mixtures.

Laws and Flaks (1966) in their original paper describing the technique, stressed the need when studying the role of the host in tumorigenesis to avoid the transfer of free carcinogen when explants were implanted, as it had been suggested that the carcinogenic stimulus may act primarily on tissues at a distance from the site of tumour formation, e. g. lymphoid tissue. In addition we considered the transfer of free carcinogen might induce sarcomatous changes in the subcutaneous tissue rather than in the epithelial cells of the implant. Peacock (1962) and Peacock and Dick (1963) reported a short term <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>test</b> involving several types of mouse embryo tissue brought into contact with chemical carcinogens and implanted deeply into the thigh muscle of host mice.

40|$|AbstractThe {{carcinogenicity}} (cancer-inducing potential) of pharmaceuticals is {{an important}} risk factor for health when considering whether thousands of patients on drug trials or millions/billions of consumers in the marketplace should be exposed to a new drug. Drawing on fieldwork involving over 50 interviews and documentary research spanning 2002 – 2010 in Europe and the US, and on regulatory capture theory, this article investigates how the techno-regulatory standards for <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> of pharmaceuticals have altered since 1998. It focuses on the replacement of long-term <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>tests</b> in rodents (especially mice) with shorter-term tests involving genetically-engineered mice (GEM). Based on evidence regarding financial/organizational control, methodological design, and interpretation of the validation and application of these new GEM tests, {{it is argued that}} regulatory agencies permitted the drug industry to shape such validation and application in ways that prioritized commercial interests over the need to protect public health. Boundary-work enabling industry scientists to define some standards of public-health policy facilitated such capture. However, as the scientific credibility of GEM tests as tools to protect public health by screening out carcinogens became inescapably problematic, a regulatory resurgence, impelled by reputational concerns, exercised more control over industry’s construction and use of the tests, The extensive problems with GEM tests as public-health protective regulatory science raises the spectre that alterations to pharmaceutical carcinogenicity-testing standards since the 1990 s may have been boundary-work in which the political project of decreasing the chance that companies’ products are defined as carcinogenic has masqueraded as techno-science...|$|R

The lack of mutagenic activity of T- 2 toxin and diacetoxyscirpenol supports the negative results that have been obtained with in vivo <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>tests.</b> The negative mutagenicity of the four other 12, 13 -epoxytrichothecenes tested, and of zearalenone and moniliformin, could not be correlated with in vivo tests because published accounts of their chronic toxicity were not available...|$|R
40|$|The {{approaches}} {{for evaluating the}} carcinogenic potential of substances, including whether carcinogenicity studies should be conducted, differ substantially across sectors. Despite variations in testing schemes, the two-year bioassay study in rodents represents the standard element across all sectors. The validity of the two-year bioassay though has been questioned in the last decade. Uncertainty {{is associated with the}} extrapolation of data from rodents to humans. Furthermore, these studies are extremely time and resource-consuming; the high animal burden has raised ethical concerns. For all these reasons, there is a strong demand for alternative strategies and methods. The development of new in vitro methods for <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing,</b> however, has progressed slowly and those available are far from being accepted for regulatory decision making, especially when evaluating the carcinogenicity of non-genotoxic chemicals or specific classes of compounds such as biologicals, microorganisms and nanomaterials. The European Union Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) has carried out an analysis of <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> requirements and assessment approaches across different sectors. This consisted of: a systematic review of the different testing requirements; a review of the number of animals used per sector; an estimation of the number of carcinogenicity and genotoxicity studies conducted or waived in respect of the number of substances authorized per sector per year; a review of the type of justifications for waiving the two-year bioassay and how opportunities for waiving are being used. Results from this analysis will provide context for initiatives aimed at: 1) reducing the need for animal use where animal testing is still a requirement; 2) ensuring an adequate carcinogenicity assessment in sectors where animal use is banned or limited; and 3) improving the process of cancer hazard identification where existing methods are not suitable.

50|$|A Tg-rasH2 mouse is an {{innovative}} transgenic mouse, developed in Central Institute for Experimental Animals (CIEA), carrying the three copies of human prototype c-Ha-ras oncogenes with endogenous promoter and enhancer in tandem. Under Alternative <b>Carcinogenicity</b> <b>Testing</b> (ACT) project conducted by International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) and ILSI Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI), comprehensive evaluation {{studies on the}} Tg-rasH2 mouse bioassay system were performed and {{the usefulness of the}} system was validated for carcinogenicity studies by 23 international pharmaceutical companies. In the studies, it was confirmed that Tg-rasH2 mice are sensitive to both genotoxic and non-genotoxic human carcinogens and show no response to non-carcinogens. As a consequence, the Tg-rasH2 mice have been accepted as a short-term carcinogenicity study system enabling to reduce the conventional two-year study period to 26 weeks.|$|R
40|$|Previously, it {{has been}} shown that {{parallels}} exist between the effects of tumour promoters and co-carcinogens in specific genetic tests and their effects in carcinogenicity assays. While tumour promoters were antimutagenic and co-recombinogenic, cocarcinogens had the reverse effects. We have now examined a class of substances which are either tumour promoters or anticarcinogens in <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>tests,</b> depending on the mouse strain used and age of the animals. In the genetic test without activation these substances were antimutagenic and co-recombinogenic. In the presence of activating S 9 -mix they showed co-mutagenic and antirecombinogenic effects. The parallels between the occurence of specific genetic effects and specific effects in carcinogenicity assays do not prove that a causal relationship exists between the two processes, but they offer at least plausible explanations for several contrasting results obtained from carcinogenicity experiments...|$|R
40|$|Can an AI program {{contribute}} to scientific discovery? An area where this gauntlet has been thrown {{is that of}} understanding the mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis. One approach is to obtain Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) relating molecular structure to cancerous activity. Vital to this are the rodent <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>tests</b> conducted within the US National Toxicology Program by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). This {{has resulted in a}} large database of compounds classified as carcinogens or otherwise. The Predictive-Toxicology Evaluation project of the NIEHS provides the opportunity to compare carcinogenicity predictions on previously untested chemicals. This presents a formidable challenge for programs concerned with knowledge discovery. Desirable features of this problem are: (1) involvement in genuine scientific discovery; (2) availability of a large database with expert-certified classifications; (3) strong competition fro [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In the afore {{mentioned}} article, Cohen {{discusses the}} alter-native models for <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> that were evaluated {{under the auspices of}} the Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI) branch of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). The assays included numerous transgenic in vivo models, and the in vitro Syrian Hamster Embryo Cell (SHE) transformation model. Cohen concluded that the SHE model “does not provide a useful discriminatory as-say for utilization in the risk evaluation process ” Cohen’s statement appears to be based on two inaccurate conclusions, that the SHE assay “does not appear to have discriminatory capabilities with respect to genotoxic versus nongenotoxic chemicals or for rodent carcinogens versus noncarcinogens. ” We would like to briey address the two elements of this statement, namely the lack of discrimination of genotoxi...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -Two {{proprietary}} semi-permanent hair dyes {{were tested}} for carcino-genicity in A and DBAf mice by repeated topical applications in aqueous acetone. Mice of both strains developed lymphoid tumours but experimental differences were marked only in DBAf mice. A number of tumours of the ovary and uterus, and some skin papillomas near the penis, occurred in dye-treated {{but not in}} control DBAf mice. As many hair-dye constituents are known mutagens, adequate carcinogenicity test-ing of these substances, and epidemiological study of exposed human populations, are needed for evaluating possible health hazards from hair dyeing. EXISTING methods for <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>testing</b> of chemicals in animals are slow and expensive,-and quite impracticable for monitoring {{the large numbers of}} new and existing environmental chemicals. There is consequently great current interest in various short-term assays that, thoug...|$|R
