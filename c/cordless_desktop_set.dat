40|$|Audio {{and visual}} {{modalities}} are two common output channels in the user interfaces embedded in today’s mobile devices. However, these user interfaces are typically {{centered on the}} visual modality as the primary output channel, with audio output serving a secondary role. This paper argues for an increased need for shared input multimodal user interfaces for mobile devices. A shared input multimodal interface can be operated independently using a specific output modality, leaving users to choose the preferred method of interaction in different scenarios. We evaluate {{the value of a}} shared input multimodal menu system both in a single-task <b>desktop</b> <b>setting</b> and in a dynamic dual-task setting, in which the user was required to interact with the shared input multimodal menu system while driving a simulated vehicle. Results indicate that users were faster at locating a target item in the menu when visual feedback was provided in the single-task <b>desktop</b> <b>setting,</b> but in the dual-task driving setting, visual output presented a significant source of visual distraction that interfered with driving performance. In contrast, auditory output mitigated some of the risk associated with menu selection while driving. A shared input multimodal interface allows users to take advantage of multiple feedback modalities properly, providing a better overall experience. STUDY HIGHLIGHT...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Whether low-intensity {{radiofrequency}} radiation {{damages the}} blood-brain barrier {{has long been}} debated, but little or no consideration {{has been given to}} the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In this cross-sectional study we tested whether long-term and/or short-term use of wireless telephones was associated with changes in the serum transthyretin level, indicating altered transthyretin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, possibly reflecting an effect of radiation. Methods One thousand subjects, 500 of each sex aged 18 – 65 years, were randomly recruited using the population registry. Data on wireless telephone use were assessed by a postal questionnaire and blood samples were analyzed for serum transthyretin concentrations determined by standard immunonephelometric techniques on a BN Prospec ® instrument. Results The response rate was 31. 4 %. Logistic regression of dichotomized TTR serum levels with a cut-point of 0. 31 g/l on wireless telephone use yielded increased odds ratios that were statistically not significant. Linear regression of time since first use overall and on the day that blood was withdrawn gave different results for males and females: for men significantly higher serum concentrations of TTR were seen the longer an analogue telephone or a mobile and <b>cordless</b> <b>desktop</b> telephone combined had been used, and in contrast, significantly lower serum levels were seen the longer an UMTS telephone had been used. Adjustment for fractions of use of the different telephone types did not modify the effect for cumulative use or years since first use for mobile telephone and DECT, combined. For women, linear regression gave a significant association for short-term use of mobile and cordless telephones combined, indicating that the sooner blood was withdrawn after the most recent telephone call, the higher the expected transthyretin concentration. Conclusion In this hypothesis-generating descriptive study time since first use of mobile telephones and DECT combined was significantly associated with higher TTR levels regardless of how much each telephone type had been used. Regarding short-term use, significantly higher TTR concentrations were seen in women the sooner blood was withdrawn after the most recent telephone call on that day. </p...|$|R

This was the A1 mount, which was replaced within 2 years by the B1 mounting set, which featured an integrated design in streamlined shape. It still had the same circular footprint of the candlestick, which proved too unstable when dialing numbers, and was henceforth replaced with a wider design using an oval footprint, the D1 mounting base in 1930.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Coping with an {{increasing}} number of files is one of the challenges of current desktops. Adding semantic capabilities is one possible solution. Aligned with this proposal, this work introduces the notion of “knowledge folder ” as a coarse set of documents bound together by a common ontology. The ontology plays the role of a clipboard which can be transparently accessed by the file editors to either export (i. e. annotation) or import (i. e. authoring) metadata within the knowledge folder. Traditional desktop operations are now re-interpreted and framed by this ontology: copy&paste becomes annotation&authoring, and folder digging becomes property traversal. However, a <b>desktop</b> <b>setting</b> requires seamless tooling for these ideas to get through. To this end, this work proposes the use of the mouse as the “semantic device”. Through the mouse, the user can classify, annotate, author, and locate a file as a resource of the underlying ontology. Moreover, being editor-independent, the mouse accounts for portability and maintainability to face the myriad of formats and editors which characterizes current desktops. The “semantic mouse ” is implemented as a plug-in for Windows. ...|$|R

An emerging alternative to conventional vacuum based deposition of such structures is the additive deposition and sintering of conductive nanoparticles, to enable low temperature, low- cost and low energy fabrication. While significant work {{has gone into}} additive deposition of nanoparticles, {{the realization of the}} above potential needs nanoparticle sintering methods that are equally low-cost, in-situ, ambient condition and desktop- sized in nature. This thesis demonstrates the integration of non-laser based, low-cost and small footprint optical energy sources for ambient condition sintering of conductive nanoparticles, with wide-area aerosol jet based additive printing of nanoparticle inks. The nanoparticle sintering is characterized by quantifying the sintering temperatures, sintered material conductivity, crystallinity, optical properties, thickness and microscale morphology in terms of the sintering parameters. The characterization results of metallic (Ag) and non-metallic conductive (ITO) films indicated densification, increased film conductivity and reduction in film’s optical absorption. This showed that the integrated aerosol jet – continuous wave light (CWL) system is capable of sintering nanoparticles at low-cost, ambient condition and <b>desktop</b> <b>setting...</b>|$|R

The earPod prototype was developed and then evaluated in a series of four experiments. In the first two experiments, earPod was first compared against an iPod-like (visual) interface and then against a fuller set of competitive techniques that included dual vs. single modality presentations, audio vs. visual modalities, and radial vs. linear mappings. The third experiment consisted of a longitudinal study designed to understand the learning patterns that occurred with these techniques. The fourth experiment examined performance in a conventional (single task) <b>desktop</b> <b>setting</b> and in a driving simulator (i. e., a dual task situation where participants carried out the driving task while interacting with the mobile device). The results of these experiments, comparing earPod with an iPod-like visual linear menu technique on fixed-sized static menus, indicated that earPod is comparable both in terms of speed and accuracy. Thus it seems likely that earPod should be an effective and efficient eyes-free menu selection technique. The comprehensive 3 x 2 study implemented in Experiment...|$|R

50|$|The term {{itself has}} its roots in social {{software}} and Groupware, computer applications designed for the desktop environment and aiming at facilitating various forms of social interaction, with the former being oriented to Internet-based informal exchanges, daily tasks and entertainment and the latter focusing on collaborative work (CSCW) or learning (CSCL) within a well defined group. Two typical groups that would benefit from these applications are work colleagues or school classmates. While the term social software, introduced by Clay Shirky in recent years, has gained much popularity, Groupware is not anymore a trendy word, even if it has a strong tradition that goes back to the Eighties. Scientific research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) provides results which are still valid in the mobile environment. However, three important differences between desktop and mobile environments should be taken into account when conducting research on MoSoSo: firstly, the physical context of use moves from static <b>desktop</b> <b>setting,</b> where the user is typically sitting in front of his computer, to the more dynamic mobile context, which presents higher constraints to human attention, but also provides an opportunity for information or communication at any time and anywhere. Secondly, the social context becomes wider, shifting from the group to the network concept. Rather than relying on static and known membership criteria, where group members usually know each other, social network ties change often and are not as dense as in traditional groups. Therefore, network boundaries cannot be easily identified. A mobile social network is the social space determined by a MoSoSo application. Finally, an important distinction concerns the ultimate goal of MoSoSo applications, designed for usage in everyday life situations, including not only tools for communication, but also for coordination and knowledge sharing. From this perspective, MoSoSo is more similar to social software than Groupware applications, which aimed at increasing productivity and teamwork at work or at school.|$|R

This article {{argues that a}} checkpoint storage system, optimized to operate in these environments, can offer multiple benefits: reduce the load on a traditional file system, offer high-performance through specialization, and, finally, optimize data management by taking into account checkpoint application semantics. Such a storage system can present a unifying abstraction to checkpoint operations, while hiding {{the fact that there}} are no dedicated resources to store the checkpoint data. We prototype stdchk, a checkpoint storage system that uses scavenged disk space from participating desktops to build a low-cost storage system, offering a traditional file system interface for easy integration with applications.

Kenya’s commitment in the fight against corruption has severely been tested. In spite of many laws to address the scourge of corruption, the perception ratings have persistently remained high. While there is corruption in every sector, and in every nation as the Perception Corruption Indices indicates, land related corruption appear to have been given little focus by the media. We have a number of counties in Kenya where land adjudication has never been finalized since 1963 when the country attained independence. The reasons for this slow pace are probably a direct consequence of corruption. A review of literature on land related corruption indicates a paucity of studies on this sector in the country. However, there are many studies on corruption generally around the world. This <b>desktop</b> study <b>set</b> out to establish the types of land related corruption is covered by the media around the world. Findings indicate that the governance challenges in land administration are the same even though their magnitudes vary. The typology includes bribes for various services; malpractices extend to preparing parallel titles for registered and unregistered parcels and title issued outside the Government system among others. Other areas prone to corruption are transfer of property, valuations, buying and selling land, land registration, mutation, Surveying and land revenue officers. Land use planning divisions are amongst the very corrupt institutions. This study supports Borner, Brunetti, and Weder (1995) in calling for the restoration of watchdog journalism who argue that watchdog reporting is “potentially a highly effective mechanism of external control” against corruption. Secondly, given the power of the media to influence opinion, unless salience of land corruption is elevated, the public will not pick it as an issue for debate or least of all a matter of concern for policy makers to address.
