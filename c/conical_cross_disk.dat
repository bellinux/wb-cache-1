Whereas the performance of the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster, density functional theory, and multireference methods had been tested along the excited and ground state paths of PSB 3 in our earlier work, the ability of these methods to correctly describe the potential energy surface shape along a CI branching plane has not yet been investigated. This is the focus of the present contribution. We find, in agreement with earlier studies by others, that standard TDDFT does not yield the correct two-dimensional (i. e., <b>conical)</b> <b>crossing</b> along the branching plane but rather a one-dimensional (i. e., linear) crossing along the same plane. The same type of behavior is found for SS-CASPT 2 (IPEA= 0), SS-CASPT 2 (IPEA= 0. 25), spin-projected SF-TDDFT, EOM-SF-CCSD and, finally, for the reference MRCISD+Q method.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{nucleonic}} propagation through conical {{crossings of}} electronic energy levels, the codimension two conical crossings are the simplest energy level crossings, which affect the Born– Oppenheimer approximation in the zeroth order term. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to develop the surface hopping method for the Schrödinger equation with conical crossings in the Eulerian formulation. The approach is based on the semiclassical approximation governed by the Liouville equations, which are valid away from the <b>conical</b> <b>crossing</b> manifold. At the crossing manifold, electrons hop to another energy level with the probability determined by the Landau–Zener formula. This hopping mechanics is formulated as an interface condition, which is then built into the numerical flux for solving the underlying Liouville equation for each energy level. While a Lagrangian particle method requires the increase in time of the particle numbers, or a large number of statistical samples in a Monte Carlo setting, the advantage of an Eulerian method is that it relies on fixed number of partial differential equations with a uniform in time computational accuracy. We prove the positivity and l 1 -stability and illustrate by several numerical examples the validity and accuracy of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Context. We {{explore the}} {{dynamical}} {{evolution of a}} planet that is embedded in a circumstellar disk, {{as part of a}} binary system where the orbital plane of the companion star is significantly tilted with respect to the initial disk plane. Aims: Our aim is to test whether the planet remains within the disk and continues to migrate towards the star in a Type I/II mode, in spite of the secular perturbations of the companion star. Our findings, could explain why observed exoplanets have significant inclination in relation to the equatorial plane of their host star. Methods: We used two different smoothed particle hydrodynamic codes, VINE and PHANTOM, to model the evolution of a star+disk+planet system with a companion star over time. Results: After an initial coupled evolution, the inclinations of the disk and the planet begin to differ significantly. The period of oscillation of the disk inclination, in relation to the initial plane, becomes shorter for the planet, which evolves independently after about 104 yr, following a perturbed N-body behaviour. However, the planet continues to migrate towards the star because, during its orbital motion, it <b>crosses</b> the <b>disk</b> plane, and friction with the gas causes angular momentum loss. Conclusions: In a significantly inclined binary system, disks and planets are not dynamically coupled for small binary separations but evolve almost independently. The planet abandons the disk, and because of the onset of a significant mutual inclination, it interacts with the gas only when its orbit intersects the disk plane.
