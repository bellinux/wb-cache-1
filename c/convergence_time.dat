50|$|In many cases, {{core network}} <b>convergence</b> <b>time</b> {{after a failure}} is {{dependent}} on the length of time a routing protocol requires to successfully converge (change or re-route traffic around the fault). Depending on the specific routing protocol, this <b>convergence</b> <b>time</b> can cause network interruptions ranging from seconds to minutes. The R-SMLT protocol works with SMLT and distributed Split Multi-Link Trunking (DSMLT) technologies to provide sub-second failover (normally less than 100 milliseconds) so no outage is noticed by end users. This high speed recovery is required by many critical networks where outages can cause loss of life or very large monetary losses in critical networks.|$|E

In Packet Tracer simulation software, the simulation experiments configure EIGRP in a simple network topology.

Metro Ethernet can also utilise Link aggregation or Resilient Packet Ring where appropriate to add link redundancy and recovery in distribution networks.

40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the quasi-standard for the routing between {{autonomous}} {{systems in}} the Internet.

In this work we perform a sensibility analysis of <b>convergence</b> <b>times</b> and number of exchanged updates to the settings of BGP parameters. In particular, the influence of the Minimum Route Advertisement Interval (MRAI) timer is investigated. Further experiments serve to lighten the propagation of updates in succession to the failure of a link.

5000|$|Simple network operation. Various control {{protocols}} {{running on}} different member devices {{as if they}} are running on one device. For example, routing protocols calculate the routes of the IRF virtual device instead of calculating the routes of each member. This avoids a great number of protocol packet exchanges among the members, simplifies network operation, and shortens the <b>convergence</b> <b>time</b> during network flapping. In addition, this advantage of the IRF technology is not delivered by the common cluster technology, which only realizes the unified management of devices, and the devices in a cluster operate as independent nodes.|$|E
50|$|According to the split-horizon rule, node A {{does not}} {{advertise}} its route for C (namely A to B to C) back to B. On the surface, this seems redundant since B will never route via node A because the route {{costs more than}} the direct route from B to C. However, if the link between B and C goes down, and B had received a route from A, B could end up using that route via A. A would send the packet right back to B, creating a loop. With the split-horizon rule in place, this particular loop scenario cannot happen, improving <b>convergence</b> <b>time</b> in complex, highly-redundant environments.|$|E
50|$|Bernard Chazelle {{proved that}} under the {{assumption}} that each bird adjusts its velocity and position to the other birds within a fixed radius, {{the time it takes to}} converge to a steady state is an iterated exponential of height logarithmic in the number of birds. This means that if the number of birds is large enough, the <b>convergence</b> <b>time</b> will be so great that it might as well be infinite. This result applies only to convergence to a steady state. For example, arrows fired into the air at the edge of a flock will cause the whole flock to react more rapidly than can be explained by interactions with neighbors, which are slowed down by the time delay in the bird's central nervous systems—bird-to-bird-to-bird.|$|E

50|$|This {{algorithm}} {{is similar to}} the standard dual subgradient algorithm of optimization theory, using a fixed stepsize of 1/V. However, a key difference is that the dual subgradient {{algorithm is}} typically analyzed under restrictive strict convexity assumptions that are needed for the primal variables x(t) to converge. There are many important cases where these variables do not converge to the optimal solution, and never even get near the optimal solution (this is the case for most linear programs, as shown below). On the other hand, the drift-plus-penalty algorithm does not require strict convexity assumptions. It ensures that the time averages of the primals converge to a solution that is within O(1/V) of optimality, with O(V) bounds on queue sizes (it can be shown that this translates into an O(V2) bound on <b>convergence</b> <b>time).</b>|$|E

40|$|Vicsek et al. {{proposed}} a biologically inspired model of self-propelled particles, {{which is now}} {{commonly referred to as}} the Vicsek model. Recently, attention has been directed at modifying the Vicsek model so as to improve convergence properties. In this paper, we propose two modification of the Vicsek model which leads to significant improvements in <b>convergence</b> <b>times.</b> The modifications involve an additional term in the heading update rule which depends only on the current or the past states of the particle's neighbors. The variation in convergence properties as the parameters of these modified versions are changed are closely investigated. It is found that in both cases, there exists an optimal value of the parameter which reduces <b>convergence</b> <b>times</b> significantly and the system undergoes a phase transition as the value of the parameter is increased beyond this optimal value.
