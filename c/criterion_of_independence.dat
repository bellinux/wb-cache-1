40|$|Planners {{from the}} family of Graphplan (Graphplan, IPP, STAN [...] .) are {{presently}} considered as the most efficient ones on numerous planning domains. Their partially ordered plans can be represented as sequences of sets of simultaneous actions. Using this representation and the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence,</b> Graphplan constrains the choice of actions in such sets. We demonstrate that this criterion can be partially relaxed {{in order to produce}} valid plans in the sense of Graphplan. Our planner LCGP needs fewer levels than Graphplan to generate these plans (the same number in the worst cases). Then we present an experimental study which demonstrates that, in classical planning domains, LCGP "practically " solves more problems than planners {{from the family}} of Graphplan (Graphplan, IPP, STAN [...] .). In most cases, these tests demonstrate the best performances of LCGP. Then, we present a domain-independent heuristic for variable and domain ordering. LCGP is thus improved using this heuristic, and compared with HSP-R, a very efficient non-optimal sequential planner, based on an heuristic backward state space search. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Demixing {{independent}} source {{signals from}} their nonlinear mixtures {{is a very}} important issue in many scenarios. This paper presents a novel method for blindly separating unobservable independent source signals from their nonlinear mixtures. The demixing system is modeled using a parameterized neural network whose parameters can be determined under the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> of its outputs. Two cost functions based on higher order statistics are established to measure the statistical dependence of the outputs of the demixing system. The proposed method utilizes a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the highly nonlinear and nonconvex cost functions. The GA-based global op-timization technique is able to obtain superior separation solutions to the nonlinear blind separation problem from any random initial values. Compared to conventional gradient-based approaches, the GA-based approach for blind source separation is characterized by high accuracy, robustness, and convergence rate. In particular, it is very suitable for the case of limited available data. Simulation results are discussed to demonstrate that the proposed GA-based approach is capable of separating independent sources from their nonlinear mixtures generated by a parametric separation model.

Of the indices examined (weight/height (W/H), weight/height 2 (W/H 2), weight/height 3 (W/H 3) and weight/heightp (W/Hp], W/Hp {{was the only one}} that consistently showed least correlation with height, and so could be regarded as the optimal body mass index by the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> of the index from height. The exponent 'p' of W/Hp is, however, highly dependent on age; the value increases steadily between the age of 3 and 7 - 9 years, and then varies considerably around puberty. Only the age specific exponent ensures a lack of correlation between body mass index (W/Hp) and height. Age specific W/Hp should therefore be used in intrapopulation studies of weight or problems associated with obesity in children. Interpopulation comparison of weight and adiposity by W/H, W/H 2, or W/H 3 may give misleading results because of their dependence on height. Our results also suggest that the conventional weight for height charts may not be accurate enough for clinical use...|$|E
40|$|The Law on Economic Modernization of 4 August 2008 {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} individual entrepreneur, the ‘auto-entrepreneur,’ the goal being to enhance the competitiveness of the French economy by promoting entrepreneurial spirit.

Three forms of autonomy are given precedence: productive (Section 1), concerning the availability of sufficient financing and material to provide professional services; managerial (Section 2), which measures the ability to assume the risks inherent to business, regarding both interested and third parties; and financial (Section 3), or the chances of earning enough money to subsist upon. The result, highlighted in the conclusion to this article, is that the ‘auto-entrepreneur’ regime is contrary to every referenced approach to the firm.

Ninety Ss were subjected to relatively mild and relatively intense startle stimuli. Three GSR units ohms, conductance and the logarithm of conductance) derived from these data were examined in terms of their distribution shape and independence of their initial values. While none of these units met the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence,</b> log conductance units appeared to be the most appropriate unit for defining the Law of Initial Value. In the main, these units effectively normalized the pre-stimulus and GSR scores for both conditions. The issue was raised as to the effectiveness of operationally defining the LIV as a correlation (r) between the GSR and the pre-stimulus level. Some of these problems were seen to relate {{to the question of the}} universality of the Benjamin criterion. The data indicated a relationship between "low" basal resistance Ss, operation of the LIV and change in moisture production level. The evidence suggests that further investigation of the parameters of skin transpiration and eccrine sweat gland function is necessary to effectively relate the GSR effector mechanism(s) to the operation of the LIV...|$|E

40|$|Planners of the Graphplan family (Graphplan, IPP, STAN [...] .) are {{currently}} {{considered to be}} the most efficient ones on numerous planning domains. Their partially ordered plans can be represented as sequences of sets of actions. The sets of actions generated by Graphplan satisfy a strong independence property which allows one to manipulate each set as a whole. We present a detailed formal analysis that demonstrates that the independence criterion can be partially relaxed in order to produce valid plans in the sense of Graphplan. Indeed, two actions at a same level of the planning-graph {{do not need to be}} marked as mutually exclusive if there exists a possible ordering between them that respects a criterion of "authorization", less constrained than the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence.</b> The ordering between the actions can be set up after the plan has been generated, and the extraction of the solution plan needs an extra checking process that guarantees that an ordering can be found for actions considered simultaneously, at each level of the planning-graph. This study lead us to implement a modified Graphplan, LCGP (for "Least Committed GraphPlan"), which is still sound and complete and generally produces plans that have fewer levels than those of Graphplan (the same number in the worst cases).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the European Commission’s approach to investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) in the proposed CETA with Canada and FTA with Singapore.

40|$|The {{implementation}} {{of an effective}} regulatory framework for infrastructure utilities {{represents one of the}} most challenging tasks for policymakers in transition economies.
