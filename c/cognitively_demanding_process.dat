40|$|Simultaneous {{interpretation}} (SI) is a <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> {{that has}} been associated with enhanced memory and executive functions. It is unclear, however, if the previously evidenced interpreter advantages are developed through training and/or experience with SI or rather represent inherent characteristics that allow success in the field. The present study aimed to disentangle these possibilities through a longitudinal examination of students earning a Master of Conference Interpreting and two control populations. The students were tested {{at the beginning and end}} of their programs on measures of memory and executive functioning that have previously demonstrated an interpreter advantage. The results revealed no inherent advantage among the students of interpretation. However, an SI training-specific advantage was revealed in verbal short-term memory; the students of interpretation, but not the two control groups, showed a gain between the testing sessions. This controlled longitudinal study demonstrates that training in simultaneous interpretation is associated with cognitive changes...|$|E

The effectiveness of this feature-based approach is fundamentally limited by the witness's ability to recall and verbalise accurate descriptions of facial features from memory. Recent advances in facial composite methodology have led to software systems that do not rely on this process but instead exploit a <b>cognitively</b> less <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> of recognition.

40|$|The {{sense of}} agency, the {{experience}} of being responsible for the external effects of our actions, is pervasive, but the mechanism of this sensation is not well understood. Recent research has focused on a `comparator model' in which implicit comparisons between predicted and experienced sensory input drive the sense of agency. However, this cannot account for occasions when one feels responsible for an unpredicted outcome, like accidentally knocking over a glass. This study examined whether such judgments involve a more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> interpretive <b>process</b> by comparing the effect of a cognitively taxing verbal shadowing task on agency judgments for expected and unexpected action-consistent outcomes. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that agency judgments for unexpected action-outcomes were not more susceptible to interference from verbal shadowing than judgments for expected action-outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We explore {{whether the}} visual pre- sentation of {{relative}} position vectors (RPVs) improves conflict detection in conditions representing {{some aspects of}} future airspace concepts. Background: To help air traffic controllers manage increasing traffic, new tools and systems can automate more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>processes,</b> such as conflict detection. However, some studies reveal adverse effects of such tools, such as reduced situation awareness and increased workload. New displays are needed that help air traffic controllers handle increasing traffic loads. Method: A new display tool based on the display of RPVs, the Multi-Conflict Display (MCD), is evalu- ated {{in a series of}} simulated conflict detection tasks. The conflict detection performance of air traffic con- trollers with the MCD plus a conventional plan-view radar display is compared with their performance with a conventional plan-view radar display alone. Results: Performance with the MCD plus radar was better than with radar alone in complex scenarios requir- ing controllers to find all actual or potential conflicts, especially when the number of aircraft on the screen was large. However performance with radar alone was better for static scenarios in which conflicts for a target aircraft, or target pair of aircraft, were the focus. Conclusion: Complementing the conventional plan-view display with an RPV display may help control- lers detect conflicts more accurately with extremely high aircraft counts. Applications: We provide an initial proof of concept that RPVs may be useful for supporting conflict detection in situations that are partially representative of conditions in which controllers will be working in the future...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{interpretation}} is a <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> {{that requires a}} high level of language management. Previous studies on bilinguals have suggested that extensive practice managing two languages leads to enhancements in cognitive control. Thus, interpreters may be expected to show benefits beyond those seen in bilinguals, either as an extension of previously-seen benefits or in areas specific to interpretation. The present study examined professional interpreters (N = 23) and matched multilinguals (N = 21) on memory tests, the color-word Stroop task, the Attention Network Test, and a non-linguistic task-switching paradigm. The interpreters did not show advantages in conflict resolution or switching cost where bilingual benefits have been noted. However, an interpretation-specific advantage emerged on the mixing cost in the task-switching paradigm. Additionally, the interpreters had larger verbal and spatial memory spans. Interpreters do not continue to garner benefits from bilingualism, but they do appear to possess benefits specific to their experience with simultaneous interpretation...|$|E
30|$|Using {{learning}} {{journals in}} VET contexts {{can be challenging}} for several reasons. First, the production-oriented rationale of workplaces (Illeris 2011) definitely favors what Schön (1987) called reflection-in-action over reflection-on-action. Obviously, workplaces leave often little time or limited opportunities to discuss with colleagues or supervisors directly after completing a task (reflection-on-action). Second, learners often do not perform all steps required to produce a complete product but only execute isolated segments. Their experiences are often scattered across time and contexts (Mauroux et al. 2015). To understand a whole procedure or production sequence, learners need to integrate those fragmented workplace experiences. Third, learners are commonly asked to document only idealized professional procedures (standardized routines), for example a chef’s recipe, but hardly reflect on critical incidents, including when something went wrong or happened unexpectedly. As the production-oriented rational at the workplace discourages critical incidents or mistakes, it might, therefore, seem uncommon to document errors in learning documentations. Fourth, writing is a <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process,</b> especially for novices (Galbraith 2009). Particularly in VET, where learners might lack proficiency or show reluctance for reflective writing, it becomes important to investigate effective scaffolds (Schneider 1993).|$|E
40|$|Intentional {{response}} distortion or faking among {{job applicants}} completing {{measures such as}} personality and integrity tests is a concern in personnel selection. The present study aimed to investigate whether eye-tracking technology can improve {{our understanding of the}} response process when faking. In an experimental within-participants design, a Big Five personality test and an integrity measure were administered to 129 university students in 2 conditions: a respond honestly and a faking good instruction. Item responses, response latencies, and eye movements were measured. Results demonstrated that all personality dimensions were fakeable. In support of the theoretical position that faking involves a less <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> than responding honestly, we found that response times were on average 0. 25 s slower and participants had less eye fixations in the fake good condition. However, in the fake good condition, participants had more fixations on the 2 extreme response options of the 5 -point answering scale, and they fixated on these more directly after having read the question. These findings support the idea that faking leads to semantic rather than self-referenced item interpretations. Eye-tracking was demonstrated to be potentially useful in detecting faking behavior, improving detecting rates over and beyond response extremity and latency metrics...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the underlying process explanations for observed performance differences across workpaper review environments (paper and electronic) in a due diligence review task. Verbal process traces associated with both accurate and inaccurate judgments in each environment are analyzed to determine what, if any process differences exist across and within environments. ^ In addition to describing the due diligence review task, there are four principal findings. The first two findings help to identify {{the effect of the}} electronic environment on accurate performance of this task. Reviewers accurately performing the task in the electronic environment rely more on their short-term memory and elaborate more than reviewers accurately performing the task in the paper environment. Relying on memory and the task of elaboration are <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>processes.</b> Thus, achieving accuracy is more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> in the electronic environment than in the paper environment. ^ Third, {{the degree to which the}} reviewers stated goals affected performance only in the paper environment. Stating goals as a greater percentage of total activity was associated with better performance. Fourth, reviewers tended to tie amounts and information between workpapers more in the paper environment. ^ These findings have important practical implications. First, the profession needs to be aware of the increased cognitive demands placed on reviewers in the electronic environment and consider ways to help mitigate the potential negative effect of the electronic environment on performance. Second, the structure of the electronic workpaper environment may provide implicit goals or directions for reviewers to follow that reduces the effort expended in the planning stage. This and other decision supports and aids in the electronic environment (e. g., prompts that provide advice or that help develop audit plans) clearly benefit practice. Finally, an important review task is to tie amounts and information between workpapers; however, to ensure that important totals and balances are consistently reflected throughout the various workpapers, this task is less likely to be performed in an electronic environment. Unless software is written to ensure proper tieing between workpapers, this important task may be underperformed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ways that}} {{language}} is understood and produced by people experiencing psychosis {{has been the}} focus of numerous investigations ever since Bleuler in 1911 firstly considered ‘association disturbance’ as one of the fundamental symptoms of schizophrenia is hearing adults that led to the investigation of formal thought disorder. With the explosion of sign psycholinguistics the last couple of decades, researchers have been unravelling the implications of the absence of audition on the development, comprehension and production of language. Not many studies, however, explore how language manifests itself in Deaf adults with psychosis. In the first experimental group psycholinguistic investigation with profoundly prelingually British Deaf adults with psychosis we found a disproportionate increase of handshape errors in classifier production when compared to nouns and lexicalised responses. This finding emphasises the uniquely complicated and <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> morpho-phonological <b>processes</b> of classifiers, which often results in significantly impairing language production at the level of semantics. Outside their theoretical implications on the understanding of language on the whole, these findings also have clinical implications on case formulation, management and clinical assessment of Deaf people with psychosis. The aim of this presentation is to discuss the study finding in the context of clinical practice, with the view to enhance our understanding of the language needs of Deaf people with psychosis in mental health settings and to offer evidence based clinical recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Deceptive {{behavior}} {{is common in}} human social interactions. Researchers {{have been trying to}} uncover the cognitive process and neural basis underlying deception due to its theoretical and practical significance. We used Event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the neural correlates of deception when the participants completed a hazard judgment task. Pictures conveying or not conveying hazard information were presented to the participants who were then requested to discriminate the hazard content (safe or hazardous) and make a response corresponding to the cues (truthful or deceptive). Behavioral and electrophysiological data were recorded during the entire experiment. Results showed that deceptive responses, compared to truthful responses, were associated with longer reaction time (RT), lower accuracy, increased N 2 and reduced late positive potential (LPP), suggesting a <b>cognitively</b> more <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> to respond deceptively. The decrement in LPP correlated negatively with the increment in RT for deceptive relative to truthful responses, regardless of hazard content. In addition, hazardous information evoked larger N 1 and P 300 than safe information, reflecting an early processing bias and a later evaluative categorization process based on motivational significance, respectively. Finally, the interaction between honesty (truthful/deceptive) and safety (safe/hazardous) on accuracy and LPP indicated that deceptive responses towards safe information required more effort than deceptive responses towards hazardous information. Overall, these results demonstrate the neurocognitive substrates underlying deception about hazard information...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} event-related brain potentials elicited by true and false negated statements to evaluate if discrimination {{of the truth}} value of negated information relies on conscious processing and requires higher-order cognitive processing in healthy subjects across different levels of stimulus complexity. The stimulus material consisted of true and false negated sentences (sentence level) and prime-target expressions (word level). Stimuli were presented acoustically and no overt behavioral response of the participants was required. Event-related brain potentials to target words preceded by true and false negated expressions were analyzed both within group and at the single subject level. Across the different processing conditions (word pairs and sentences), target words elicited a frontal negativity and a late positivity in the time window from 600 – 1000 msec post target word onset. Amplitudes of both brain potentials varied {{as a function of}} the truth value of the negated expressions. Results were confirmed at the single-subject level. In sum, our results support recent suggestions according to which evaluation of the truth value of a negated expression is a time- and <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> that cannot be solved automatically, and thus requires conscious processing. Our paradigm provides insight into higher-order processing related to language comprehension and reasoning in healthy subjects. Future studies are neede...|$|E
40|$|Many {{behavioral}} phenomena, including underweighting of rare {{events and}} probability matching, {{can be the}} product of a tendency to rely on small samples of experiences. Why would small samples be used, and which experiences are likely to be included in these samples? Previous studies suggest that a cognitively efficient reliance on the most recent experiences can be very effective. We explore a very different and more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> explaining the tendency to rely on small samples: exploitation of environmental regularities. The first part of our study shows that across wide classes of dynamic binary choice environments, focusing only on experiences that followed the same sequence of outcomes preceding the current task is more effective than focusing on the most recent experiences. The second part of our study examines the psychological significance of these sequence-based rules. It shows that these tractable rules reproduce well-known indications of sensitivity to sequences and predict a nontrivial wavy recency effect of rare events. Analysis of published data supports this wavy recency prediction, but suggests an even wavier effect than these sequence-based rules predict. This pattern, and the main behavioral phenomena documented in basic decisions from experience and probability learning tasks, can be captured with a similarity-based model assuming that people follow sequences of outcomes most of the time but sometimes respond to trends. We conclude with theoretical notes on similarity-based learning...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative data {{analysis}} is a <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process.</b> Inferences from quantitative analyses {{are often used}} to inform matters of public policy and to learn about social phenomena. However, as statistical analysis is typically conducted behind closed office doors, {{little is known about}} how analysts decide on the final statistical model that important policy decisions rely upon for determining the effectiveness of programs and policies. As social programming becomes increasingly reliant on quantitative {{data analysis}}, it becomes imperative to examine the quality of information stemming from these sources of evidence. This project presents the results of a qualitative research project that explores the cognitive processes of quantitative data analysts. Seven quantitative analysts participated in the study. Participants were interviewed and observed during the course of analyzing a quantitative data set to uncover underlying cognitive processes used during data analysis. A typology of the decisions encountered by quantitative analysts in the sample is presented. A framework for decision making in quantitative analyses is presented that is borrowed from the field of cognitive psychology. Metacognition in quantitative data analyses is also explored. Findings suggest that despite prescriptive procedures that are intended to facilitate objective analysis, quantitative analysts are frequently subject o external influences that may affect the results of quantitative analyses. Social factors and context influence how quantitative researchers make decisions during data analysis which call into question the objective nature of quantitative analyses. Quantitative analysts use story telling as a method of making sense of the findings from quantitative analyses. Implications for practice and for the teaching of quantitative methods are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In old age, many {{physiological}} functions decrease and many older people also suffer from multiple chronic conditions. This leads to high drug consumption, {{but may also}} impair the ability to manage these medications. The first objective of this thesis was to describe different aspects of medication management (MM) in the elderly, such as opening medicine containers, tablet swallowing and the cognitive components of MM. A second objective was to explore the relationships between MM and functions, demographics and compliance in an elderly population. Thirdly, we wanted to explore what older people do when facing difficulties with MM. For this thesis, three different populations were used: the Kungsholmen project (paper I and III), the SWEOLD (paper II) and the Swedish National study on Aging and Care (SNAC) (paper IV). In {{the first and second}} studies we used tests of opening of containers and of MM respectively. In the third study data were collected on tablet sizes and volumes and correlated to age, gender, housing and self-reported ability to swallow medicines. For the fourth study we developed a questionnaire regarding several aspects of MM and patient compliance, also including questions of what the elderly do when facing difficulties with MM. We found that a large proportion of older people living in the community have difficulties with MM. In the first study this was exemplified by the finding that a fairly large proportion was not able to open three different kinds of medicine containers. We also found that, among persons that did not manage to open the containers, a large proportion did not receive help with their own medications. In the second study we found that a test of MM including more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>processes</b> of MM, was very difficult to perform without making errors on one item or the other. In addition, the results from this test correlated poorly to the selfreported ability to manage medications. In the third study we looked at self-reported ability to swallow tablets in relation to tablet sizes and volumes. The results show that there are older people that do experience difficulties when swallowing medicines and that they had a larger volume of tablets than others. For the fourth study we used the theoretical framework of the International classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF). The questionnaire contained questions regarding a number of different aspects of MM, functions of importance to MM and patient compliance. We found that functions were highly correlated to activities of MM. We also found that functions and activities of MM both separately correlated to patient compliance. When asked about strategies when experiencing difficulties with their medications, the elderly in our sample reported that they find ways to manage these difficulties with or without help or aids of any kind...|$|R

Continuing that work, the present research had two objectives. First, it investigated the relationship between judgments differing in cognitive demands. Second, it began to identify specific visual attributes that appear to contribute to different judgments. Three experiments are reported. All used the stimuli and viewing time as before. Using a paradigm known to disrupt processing beyond the stimulus offset, Experiment 1 was designed {{to ensure that the}} previous findings could not be attributed to such continued processing.

It also enabled analyses of visual attributes that contributed most to the different judgments. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 2 but using a between-subject design to ensure that no practice effect could occur.

40|$|Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of MIS, University of ArizonaThis paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} knowledge discovery and concept exploration. In order to enhance the concept exploration capability of knowledge-based systems and to alleviate {{the limitations of the}} manual browsing approach, we have developed two spreading activation-based algorithms for concept exploration in large, heterogeneous networks of concepts (e. g., multiple thesauri). One algorithm, which is based on the symbolic Al paradigm, performs a conventional branch-and-bound search on a semantic net representation to identify other highly relevant concepts (a serial, optimal search process). The second algorithm, which is based on the neural network approach, executes the Hopfield net parallel relaxation and convergence process to identify â convergentâ concepts for some initial queries (a parallel, heuristic search process). Both algorithms can be adopted for automatic, multiple-thesauri consultation. We tested these two algorithms on a large text-based knowledge network of about 13, 000 nodes (terms) and 80, 000 directed links in the area of computing technologies. This knowledge network was created from two external thesauri and one automatically generated thesaurus. We conducted experiments to compare the behaviors and performances of the two algorithms with the hypertext-like browsing process. Our experiment revealed that manual browsing achieved higher-term recall but lower-term precision in comparison to the algorithmic systems. However, it was also a much more laborious and <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process.</b> In document retrieval, there were no statistically significant differences in document recall and precision between the algorithms and the manual browsing process. In light of the effort required by the manual browsing process, our proposed algorithmic approach {{presents a}} viable option for efficiently traversing largescale, multiple thesauri (knowledge network) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is {{a common}} {{paradigm}} used to study the interactions between emotions and decision making, yet little consensus exists on the cognitive process determining participants' decisions, what affects them, and how these processes interact with each other. A novel conceptual framework is proposed according to which behavior in the IGT reflects a balance between two dissociable processes; a <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> that tracks each option's long-term payoff, and a lower-level, automatic process that is primarily sensitive to loss frequency and magnitude. Methods A behavioral experiment was carried out with {{a modified version of}} IGT. In this modified version, participants went through an additional phase of interaction, designed to measure performance without further learning, in which no feedback on individual decisions was given. A secondary distractor task was presented in either the first or {{the second phase of the}} experiment. Behavioral measures of performance tracking both payoff and frequency sensitivity in choices were collected throughout the experiment. Results Consistent with our framework, the results confirmed that: (a) the two competing cognitive processes can be dissociated; (b) that learning from decision outcomes requires central cognitive resources to estimate long-term payoff; and (c) that the decision phase itself can be carried out during an interfering task once learning has occurred. Conclusion The experimental results support our novel description of the cognitive processes underlying performance in the Iowa Gambling Task. They also suggest that patients' impairments in this and other gambling paradigms can originate from a number of different causes, including a failure in allocating resources among cognitive strategies. This latter interpretation might be particularly useful in explaining the impairments of patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions and, by extension, the contribution of this brain region to human decision making. </p...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoids (GC) have a {{negative}} effect on age-associated cognitive decline and the GC metabolising enzyme 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 (11 β- HSD 1) plays a key role in these effects. Increased glucocorticoids exert detrimental effects on the volume and function of brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus that are necessary for cognitive functions such as memory and working memory. Previous research has identified changes in cell populations, metabolite levels and structure within the brain as well as altered levels of inflammation with age, and studies have suggested these biomarkers to be associated with cognitive impairments. Aged mice with a deletion in 11 ß-HSD 1 (11 β-HSD 1 -/- mice), resulting in lower levels of glucocorticoids within the brain, exhibit attenuated cognitive decline in hippocampal dependent spatial learning and memory with age. However, the mechanisms through which 11 β-HSD 1 contribute to age-associated cognitive decline remain unknown. However, previous genetic models of 11 β-HSD 1 - /- mice have demonstrated residual 11 β-HSD 1 activity in the brain which may still exert some effects on cognitive processes. Furthermore, the effect of 11 ß-HSD 1 on working memory – a more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> essential for everyday decision making - has yet to be determined. This thesis tests the hypothesis that glucocorticoid action mediates age-associated cognitive impairment in spatial learning and memory and spatial working memory through alterations in cell activity, brain metabolite levels and neuroinflammatory processes. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if complete lifelong 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency would protect against age-associated working memory deficits as well as spatial learning and memory deficits, and its effect on associated neural markers. In particular, we determined changes in hippocampal metabolite levels, cell activity and inflammation as a function of ageing in a longitudinal manner. At 6, 12, 18 and 22 months, male 11 β- HSD 1 -/- and C 57 BL/ 6 J control mice were cognitively assessed in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and Radial Arm Water Maze (RAWM) – tests for spatial reference memory and spatial working memory respectively. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) was performed to examine the hippocampal metabolite profile in the same mice at 6, 18 and 22 months. Following their final scan, mice were culled and brains dissected for analysis. Results revealed unaltered spatial learning with age in C 57 BL/ 6 J and 11 β-HSD 1 -/- mice and pointed to a development of alternative strategies for task completion as a result of repeated testing. Spatial memory was more susceptible to age-associated effects with impairments in wild-type mice but not 11 β-HSD 1 -/- mice, though not completely immune from the effects of repeated testing. These impairments were correlated with glutamate/glutamine levels and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), whilst GFAP was further correlated with 11 β-HSD 1 protein expression. Working memory was impaired with age in both 11 β-HSD 1 -/- and wild-type mice, suggesting 11 β-HSD 1 deletion may be detrimental to cognitive processes in the prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, impaired memory with age may be attributed to increased glial reactivity and altered glutamate/glutamine cycling in the hippocampus, and lifelong removal of 11 β-HSD 1 may alter these processes. However, lifelong removal of 11 β-HSD 1 may not be as beneficial to working memory processes suggesting that 11 β-HSD 1 and glucocorticoid action play a key role in working memory processes...|$|E

The language people use in school is called academic language. The hypothesis is that scientific issues promote the use of <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> speech in children, which is created by predictions, comparisons, explanations and generalizations. In this thesis an investigation is executed about the differences in <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> speech between two tasks. One task {{has to do with a}} scientific object, the other task is a regular school task, like K'nexx. The interactions of 20 teachers with small groups of children were videotaped during the two tasks. Also investigators have controlled for language skills and cognitive capacities of the participating children. After that, analyses of variance repeated measures have been performed. Results indicate that the use of <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> speech is significantly higher during the scientific task. It is striking that this result is only significant for the teachers, not for the children. The only element of <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> speech that is not significantly different in the two tasks is 'prediction'.

40|$|Ochre {{is found}} at many Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites {{and its use}} is often {{attributed}} by archaeologists to enhanced mental abilities and symbolism. However, the links between the visible uses of ochre, cognition and symbolism have not been clearly demonstrated. Here {{it is argued that}} by understanding ochre processing technology and some of the stages involved in using ochre, one can determine the skill, knowledge and cognitive abilities required to execute those activities. In order to understand the usetraces found on ochre, and to enable the identification of them, as well as the types of ochre used, experiments were first performed with geological ochre specimens. Ochre pieces collected from the Sibudu surrounds were used experimentally for a variety of grinding, scoring and rubbing activities. All use-traces created on the ochre piece during an activity were macro- and microscopically examined, recorded and compared. Experimental ochre pieces ground against a coarse or fine-grained slab develop parallel striations. Grinding results in significant changes to the surface shape of the ochre, and often results in faceted edges. Scoring can be performed with the intention to create powder, or to create a design. The incisions created from scoring often do not reach all the edges of the used surface and they regularly have frayed terminations. A frayed incision termination shows that the incision was created by multiple scoring strokes. When ochre is scored to manufacture powder the incisions that are generated are parallel groups of grooves with erratically oriented grooves as well. Grooves created through both grinding and scoring have microstriations within them and they show a range of profile shapes. The most common use-wear from rubbing ochre on soft materials is smoothing, edge rounding and polish. Microstriations and metallic lustre occasionally form during rubbing. The collection of utilised experimental ochre formed a comparative collection for the examination of the Sibudu ochre. The main body of this research comprises a study of the Middle Stone Age ochre assemblage from Sibudu, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Sibudu has a large Middle Stone Age ochre assemblage of over 9000 pieces of ochre from layers dating between 77 ka and 37. 6 ka. All pieces were examined to determine the types of ochre used and to inspect all use-traces present on the pieces. The assemblage comprises 5449 ochre pieces iv > 8 mm, including 682 pieces with markings from use. The pre-Still Bay (77 ka) and Howiesons Poort (65 – 62 ka) layers have the highest percentage of utilised pieces. Bright-red ochre was preferentially selected for use throughout most of sequence. There is evidence of the preferential selection of specific types of ochre for use in the Sibudu assemblage. Shale and pieces with medium hardness values are common throughout the sequence. Grain sizes change through time – pieces with clayey grain sizes are favoured during the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort, whereas silty grain sizes are preferred in the younger Middle Stone Age occupations. High frequencies of bright-red amongst the utilised pieces, coupled with high frequencies of yellow or orange pieces with no evidence of use, suggest that colour choices were deliberate and not a product of postdepositional heating. Chemical analysis of a sample of utilised pieces indicates that they all contain iron, silicon, aluminium and calcium; many pieces contain hematite and some contain maghemite. Use-traces were divided into activity categories, based on experimental results. Combined grinding and rubbing is the most frequent activity for which ochre pieces were used. Grinding and rubbing use-wear also occurs independently on many pieces. Scored pieces are rare, but are more frequent in the pre-Still Bay (77 ka) industry than elsewhere in the sequence. Some of the incisions appear to be deliberate engravings, and parallel lines and fan-like marks are the most often repeated patterns. Use-traces acquired during powder-producing activities predominate, implying a desire to create ochre powder. Powder-producing activities were mainly performed with bright-red pieces, while minimal scoring is mainly present on brown-red pieces. Pieces with mica inclusions are not common, but were frequently used for powder-producing activities. Once the activities performed with ochre were established, thought-and-action sequences, or cognigrams, were constructed. This helped establish the steps involved in each activity and the temporal and physical distance between the commencement of a task to its completion. Inferential sequences were constructed to establish the procedures and knowledge needed to complete an activity, thereby establishing the cognitive prerequisites. Cognitive interpretations are made using the concept of enhanced executive functions of the brain. The construction of the inferential thoughtv and-action sequences showed that the various ways that ochre was used have different cognitive requirements. Powder-production alone is not an indicator of complex cognitive processes, although some planning, foresight and knowledge of materials is required. Some of the powder was used in the creation of hafting adhesives, which is a <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>process</b> requiring attention-switching ability, response inhibition and abstract thought. Grinding ochre and then rubbing the piece on a soft material for the direct transfer of powder does require some complex mental abilities, such as multi-tasking and switching attention. Scoring a piece of ochre with a sharp tool does not necessitate enhanced executive functions, but some engravings demonstrate foresight, intentionality and an awareness of space and symmetry that may demonstrate abstract thought. This research provides a complete description of the Middle Stone Age ochre assemblage at Sibudu, and establishes the way that ochre was used at the site. This contributes to the debate on the advent of enhanced behaviours in the past by providing insight into the cognitive abilities required by the ochre users. It offers a method of analysing ochre use in the past by drawing on cognitive theory and the visible applications of ochre. Both simple and complex cognitive abilities were required for ochre activities at Sibudu. The requirement for cognitively complex abilities in some of the ochre-related activities at Sibudu suggests that the people living there during the MSA had advanced mental capabilities like modern humans living today. This research shows how ochre use can be employed as a proxy for cognitive capabilities, and can therefore shed light on the evolution of the modern mind...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{the effects of}} a variety of mobile phone usage conditions to different levels of alcohol intoxication on simulated driving performance and psychomotor vigilance. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers participated in a crossover design in which each participant completed a simulated driving task on 2 days, separated by a 1 -week washout period. On the mobile phone day, participants performed the simulated driving task under each of 4 conditions: no phone usage, a hands-free naturalistic conversation, a hands-free <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> conversation, and texting. On the alcohol day, participants performed the simulated driving task at four different blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels: 0. 00, 0. 04, 0. 07, and 0. 10. Driving performance was assessed by variables including time within target speed range, time spent speeding, braking reaction time, speed deviation, and lateral lane position deviation. Results: In the BAC 0. 07 and 0. 10 alcohol conditions, participants spent less time in the target speed range and more time speeding and took longer to brake in the BAC 0. 04, 0. 07, and 0. 10 than in the BAC 0. 00 condition. In the mobile phone condition, participants took longer to brake in the natural hands-free conversation, <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> hands-free conversation and texting conditions and spent less time in the target speed range and more time speeding in the <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding,</b> hands-free conversation, and texting conditions. When comparing the 2 conditions, the naturalistic conversation was comparable to the legally permissible BAC level (0. 04), and the <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> and texting conversations were similar to the BAC 0. 07 to 0. 10 results. Conclusion: The findings of the current laboratory study suggest that very simple conversations on a mobile phone may not represent a significant driving risk (compared to legally permissible BAC levels), whereas <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding,</b> hands-free conversation, and particularly texting represent significant risks to drivin...|$|R
40|$|A word-spotting {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate whether rhythmic consistency and phrase-final lengthening facilitate performance in Korean. Listeners had to spot disyllabic and trisyllabic words in nonsense strings organized in phrases with either the same or variable syllable count; phrase-final lengthening was absent, or occurring either in all phrases or only in the phrase immediately preceding the target. The results show that, for disyllabic targets, inconsistent syllable count and lengthening before the target led to fewer errors. For trisyllabic targets, accuracy was at ceiling, but final lengthening in all phrases reduced reaction times. The results imply that both rhythmic consistency (i. e. regular syllable count) and phrase-final lengthening {{play a role in}} word-spotting and, by extension, in speech processing in Korean, as in other languages. However, the results also reflect the language specific role of prosodic cues. First, the cues here were used primarily with disyllabic targets, which were <b>cognitively</b> more <b>demanding</b> to <b>process</b> partly due to their high phonological neighborhood density. Second, the facilitating effect of rhythmic consistency was weak, possibly because strict consistency is not present in spoken Korean. Overall, rhythmic consistency facilitated spotting when targets mapped onto phrases, confirming the importance of phrasal organization in Korean speech processing...|$|R
40|$|Cerebellar {{contributions}} to motor learning are well documented. For example, under some conditions, patients with cerebellar damage are impaired at visuomotor adaptation and at acquiring new action sequences. Moreover, cerebellar activation {{has been observed}} in functional MRI investigations of various motor learning tasks. The early phases of motor learning are <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding,</b> relying on <b>processes</b> such as working memory, which {{have been linked to}} the cerebellum as well. Here, we investigated cerebellar {{contributions to}} motor learning using activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis. This allowed us to determine, across studies and tasks, whether or not the location of cerebellar activation is constant across differing motor learning tasks, and whether or not cerebellar activation in early learning overlaps with that observed for working memory. We found that different regions of the anterior cerebellum are engaged for implicit and explicit sequence learning and visuomotor adaptation, providing additional evidence for the modularity of cerebellar function. Furthermore, we found that lobule VI of the cerebellum, which has been implicated in working memory, is activated during the early stages of explicit motor sequence learning. This provides evidence for a potential role for the cerebellum in the cognitive processing associated with motor learning. However, though lobule VI was activated across both early explicit sequence learning and working memory studies, there was no spatial overlap between these two regions. Together, our results support the idea of modularity in the formation of internal representations of new motor tasks in the cerebellum, and highlight the cognitive processing relied upon during the early phases of motor skill learning...|$|R
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{evidence}} for the effect of environment stimulation upon the human brain is cognitive reserve (a measure of the brain’s resilience to cognitive impairment) {{and the level of}} a person’s education. Not only is higher education linked to a more <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> educational experience, but it also correlates with a person’s general engagement in <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> activities. The more education a person has received, the less the effects of aging, dementia, white matter hyperintensities, MRI-defined brain infarcts, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Also, aging and dementia are less in those that engage in complex cognitive tasks. The cognitive decline of those with epilepsy could also be affected by the level of a person’s education.|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of ERB on drivers is not universal. There {{is evidence that}} as the complexity of driving tasks increases, the benefits of using a HUD are decreased, and in some circumstances, {{they are no longer}} statistically significant. The ERB is diminished, for example, when individuals are driving <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> vehicles, such as industrial vehicles, or when they are asked to multitask while driving. One study has shown that when placed in a <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> condition, individuals shift their focus from the road alone to focus on other tasks such as shifting gears or talking to others. Subsequently, a driver’s ability to process HUD feedback requires diversion of attention, much akin to that which occurs whilst using a HDD.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} why {{various levels of}} task autonomy differ in their learning outcomes. We conducted an experimental study in which 119 undergraduate students learned a computer task. During the learning phase, (no versus moderate versus full) autonomy and (cognitively undemanding versus <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> interruptions) demands were manipulated in a 3 × 2 between-participants design. The results showed that in the no and full autonomy conditions, receiving <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> interruptions decreased learning outcomes compared to receiving cognitively undemanding interruptions. However, having moderate autonomy resulted in equally positive learning outcomes in both cognitive demands conditions. Thus, having autonomy while learning a new task is essential; however, having too much autonomy may lead to adverse learning outcomes when cognitive demands are high...|$|R
