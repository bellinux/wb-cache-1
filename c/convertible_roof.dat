The convertible model forsakes the rear hatchback of the Hardtop Mini, replacing it with a drop down 'tailgate' that is reminiscent of the classic Mini — it incorporates similarly prominent external hinges, and with the roof in the closed position, the rear roof section and luggage shelf can be raised with two handles, semi-tailgate style, to access the luggage space easier. The convertible also adds two small power windows for the rear seat passengers which are lowered automatically when the roof opens. The roof is made from a heavy cloth, with many layers of insulation; the rear window is glass with an integral heater/defroster, but no washer or wiper.|$|E

40|$|This project {{describes}} {{the study of}} computational analysis of two dimensional flows on <b>convertible</b> car <b>roof.</b> The objectives {{of this study are}} to analyze and study the effect of pressure coefficient (Cp) and Drag Coefficient (Cd) on <b>convertible</b> car <b>roof.</b> The structure of model of <b>convertible</b> car <b>roof</b> was modelled using Solidworks software and analysis was performed using Ansys software. In this experiment, four model car <b>convertible</b> <b>roofs</b> were developed through Solidworks software based on the ratio of 1 : 20 of the original size of the vehicle. Then the four models tested in three different wind tunnel to get the best results and very similar to the real situation. The task was done by using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis for expected vehicle speed of 120 km/h. A pressure and drag force was obtained based on inputs from CFD analysis. This pressure and force was used to calculate the pressure coefficient and drag coefficient of the model as a whole. Results showed that the model C has the best compared with other models where the minimum and maximum pressure coefficients for model C is the lowest compared to other models of - 0. 9267 and 0. 0488. While the drag coefficient is 0. 6526 for model C. Surface design and roof arches were found to affect the results of this experiment...|$|R

5000|$|Most of {{the cable}} net roofs are clad with a textile membrane. Textiles allow for lightweight, {{transparent}} roofs and facades that fascinate through their variegated and unusual forms. Due to their negligible weight and inherent foldability, textiles are predestined for <b>convertible</b> <b>roofs.</b> One of the first permanently moveable membrane roofs was the one across the bullfighting arena in Saragossa, Spain, which can be closed and opened like a flower within minutes. This same principle was also applied to the [...] "largest cabriolet of the world," [...] the roof across the Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt. The only things lighter are structures made of air: the pneumatic pillows of the Arenas Nîmes and Madrid change seasonally {{within a couple of}} days or, depending on the weather, within a few minutes.|$|R

A converged statically deformed state, within 1 per cent difference in the displacement variable, is reached after three iterations between the fluid and structural codes. The predictions of membrane deformation are shown to agree well with the experimental results. The key outcome is the demonstration of a methodology that will be useful in the engineering design of <b>convertible</b> car <b>roofs...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{provides a}} toy vehicle incorporating actuators {{made from a}} shape memory alloy material. These actuators {{may be in the}} form of a spring, wire or similar form that has a mechanical response upon the application or removal of heat. In particular, wires may be connected about hinges for doors, hoods, <b>convertible</b> <b>roofs</b> and other such items which, upon the application of heat to the wire of shape memory alloy, causes contraction of the wire and rotation about the hinged joint of the body part. As such shape memory alloy actuators are generally only operably in a single direction, they may be provided in pairs or in opposition to another biasing means to cause the opposed rotation about the joint when desired. The preferred source of heat to the shape memory alloy actuators is through the provision of electrical energy to the wire to create heat through the resistance of the shape memory alloy actuator itself.
