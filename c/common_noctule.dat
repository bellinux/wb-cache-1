2500|$|The park is host to {{many species}} of mammals. The most {{widespread}} are the moose, the roe deer, the mountain hare, the red fox, and the European pine marten. Since the 1980s, one can also see Eurasian beaver near the islands of Torrön and Ängsön as well as near Gysinge. In 2008, it was similarly found that the wild boar was wont to settle the park. More rarely, one sees also the wood lemming in the north part of the park. Four species of mammals present in the park are considered endangered in Sweden. Thus, the Eurasian lynx [...] can be observed regularly around Öbyhalvön, Tinäset and Gärdsvekarna, alongside brown bears and gray wolves, although these are less frequent. The three other endangered species are the European otter that one can see near the rapids, and two species of bats, the pond bat, very rare in Sweden) and the <b>common</b> <b>noctule.</b>|$|E

40|$|Activity of bats {{at an old}} wind park four km off {{the island}} of Gotland in the Baltic Sea was {{monitored}} during 50 nights from August to October 2013, using an automatic bat detector (Pettersson D 500 -X) mounted {{on one of the}} turbines. Single individuals or pairs of <b>common</b> <b>noctules</b> Nyctalus noctula were recorded on five occasions only (26 and 27 August), all in calm weather and when little or no rotor movement occurred. Since such conditions were unusual (five of 50 nights of observation) the visits by the bats were unlikely to be chance events (migrating bats passing the turbine), but more likely involved bats attracted to the turbines. However, no feeding buzzes were recorded and the bats never stayed near the turbine more than one minute. The turbines studied are lit by 250 W white lights and this could have been the reason why bats visited the turbines, because such lights potentially attract insects. The bats could not have been attracted to the turbines by any factor related of the movement of the rotor or the generator, such as Doppler-effects, noise, heat or electric fields...|$|R

5|$|Other mammals {{found in}} Greater London are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels, In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, {{a wide variety}} of mammals are found {{including}} hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and <b>common</b> pipistrelles, <b>noctule,</b> serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.|$|R

50|$|The Fläming {{is rich in}} {{wildlife}} (fallow deer, red deer, {{raccoon dog}} and the mouflon). Among the most noteworthy species in the nature park are the black stork, the <b>common</b> <b>noctule,</b> a microbat, and the middle spotted woodpecker, the mascot of the nature parks. In the creeks the brown trout, the white-throated dipper, the brook lamprey and the European crayfish can be found. The great bustard and the western marsh orchid are native to the lowlands.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the lakes}} {{upstream}} and downstream suffered of crayfish plague in the late 1970s, which makes it likely Ågestasjön was affected too. As signal crayfish {{was introduced in the}} neighbouring lakes recently, it is assumed they are also present in Ågestasjön. Amphibians are represented by moor frog, common frog, true toad, and smooth newt. There are several bats present by the lake: northern bat, Daubenton's bat, <b>common</b> <b>noctule,</b> and whiskered bat. Otters were present in the lake until the 1960s and were spotted nearby in 2003.|$|E

The Chinese noctule, which is endemic to the {{southern}} half of the country and Taiwan, weighs three to four times as much as the Chinese pipistrelle. Known as [...] "mountain bats" [...] in Chinese, noctules live in caves and rock croppings as well as the under the eaves of traditional homes. Noctules droppings are collected for medicinal uses. Other noctule bats in China include the <b>common</b> <b>noctule,</b> lesser noctule, and birdlike noctule.|$|E

40|$|Long-distance {{migration}} {{is a rare}} phenomenon in European bats. Genetic analyses and banding studies show that females can cover distances of up to 1, 600 km, whereas males are sedentary or migrate only short distances. The onset of this sex-biased {{migration is}} supposed to occur shortly after rousing from hibernation and when the females are already pregnant. We therefore predicted that the sexes are exposed to different energetic pressures in early spring, and this should be reflected in their behavior and physiology. We investigated this {{in one of the}} three Central European long-distance migrants, the <b>common</b> <b>noctule</b> (Nyctalus noctula) in Southern Germany recording the first individual partial migration tracks of this species. In contrast to our predictions, we found no difference between male and female home range size, activity, habitat use or diet. Males and females emerged from hibernation in similar body condition and mass increase rate was the same in males and females. We followed the first migration steps, up to 475 km, of radio-tagged individuals from an airplane. All females, {{as well as some of}} the males, migrated away from the wintering area in the same northeasterly direction. Sex differences in long-distance migratory behavior were confirmed through stable isotope analysis of hair, which showed greater variation in females than in males. We hypothesize that both sexes faced similarly good conditions after hibernation and fattened at maximum rates, thus showing no differences in their local behavior. Interesting results that warrant further investigation are the better initial condition of the females and the highly consistent direction of the first migratory step in this population as summering habitats of the <b>common</b> <b>noctule</b> occur at a broad range in Northern Europe. Only research focused on individual strategies will allow us to fully understand the migratory behavior of European bats...|$|E
40|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} for many mammalian coronaviruses, which have received renewed interest after {{the discovery of}} the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV in humans. This study describes the identification and molecular characterization of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses in bats in Italy, from 2010 to 2012. Sixty-nine faecal samples and 126 carcasses were tested using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in seven faecal samples and nine carcasses. A phylogenetic analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence fragments aided in identifying two alphacoronaviruses from Kuhl’s pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii), three clade 2 b betacoronaviruses from lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros), and 10 clade 2 c betacoronaviruses from Kuhl’s pipistrelle, <b>common</b> <b>noctule</b> (Nyctalus noctula), and Savi’s pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). This study fills a substantive gap in the knowledge on bat-CoV ecology in Italy, and extends the current knowledge on clade 2 c betacoronaviruses with new sequences obtained from bats that have not been previously described as hosts of these viruses...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the large}} order of bats, sexual size {{dimorphism}} measured by forearm length and body mass is often female-biased. Several studies have explained this through {{the effects on}} load carrying during pregnancy, intrasexual competition, {{as well as the}} fecundity and thermoregulation advantages of increased female body size. We hypothesized that wing shape should differ along with size and be under variable selection pressure in a species where there are large differences in flight behaviour. We tested whether load carrying, sex differential migration, or reproductive advantages of large females affect size and wing shape dimorphism in the <b>common</b> <b>noctule</b> (Nyctalus noctula), in which females are typically larger than males and only females migrate long distances each year. We tested for univariate and multivariate size and shape dimorphism using data sets derived from wing photos and biometric data collected during pre-migratory spring captures in Switzerland. Females had forearms that are on average 1 % longer than males and are 1 % heavier than males after emerging from hibernation, but we found no sex differences in other size, shape, or other functional characters in any wing parameters during this pre-migratory period. Female-biased size dimorphism without wing shape differences indicates that reproductive advantages of big mothers are most likely responsible for sexual dimorphism in this species, not load compensation or shape differences favouring aerodynamic efficiency during pregnancy or migration. Despite large behavioural and ecological sex differences, morphology associated with a specialized feeding niche may limit potential dimorphism in narrow-winged bats such as common noctules and the dramatic differences in migratory behaviour may then be accomplished through plasticity in wing kinematics...|$|E
