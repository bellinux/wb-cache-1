40|$|For a nontrivial {{connected}} graph G, let c: V (G) → N be a vertex coloring of G where adjacent vertices may be colored {{the same and}} let V 1,V 2, [...] .,Vk be the resulting color classes. For a vertex v of G, the metric color code of v is the k-vector <b>code(v)</b> =(d(v, V 1),d(v, V 2), ·· ·,d(v, Vk)), where d(v, Vi) is the minimum distance between v and a vertex in Vi. If code(u) = <b>code(v)</b> for every two adjacent vertices u and v of G, thenc is a metric coloring of G. The minimum k for which G has a metric k-coloring is called the metric chromatic number of G and is denoted by μ(G). The metric chromatic numbers of some well-known graphs are determined and characterizations of {{connected graph}}s of order n having metric chromatic number 2 and n − 1 are established. We present several bounds for the metric chromatic number of a graph in terms of other graphical parameters and study {{the relationship between the}} metric chromatic number of a graph and its chromatic number...|$|E

[I] Thermo-optical {{simulation}} {{and evaluation}} of 20 -cm aperture CCM in the lunar thermal environment: First, two candidate materials for CCM are sought for higher thermal diffusivity, lower thermal expansion, and higher specific stiffness.

40|$|We {{describe}} the INFN-LNF standard procedure for the optical Far Field Diffraction Pattern (FFDP) test of cube corner laser retroreflectors (CCRs) for space applications, when these CCRs are in air and in isothermal conditions around (22 ± 2) o C. This procedure {{was developed in}} 2007 and 2008, using prototype GLONASS CCRs lent to LNF by IPIE of Moscow and a GPS- 2 flight model CCR array lent to LNF by the University of Maryland at College Park (all using Al-coated fused silica retroreflectors of 27 mm diameter). This {{was done in the}} context of the INFN experiment ETRUSCO 2. The modeling of FFDP measurements is performed with a commercial software, <b>CodeV</b> by O. R. A. Inc., and it has been cross-checked against two independent software programs developed by other two members of the ILRS “Signal Processing Working Group”, D. Arnold and T. Otsubo, finding very good agreement among the three. In summer 2008 this procedure has been validated by performing the FFDP test of the LAGEOS “Sector”, an engineering prototype on loan from NASA-GSFC, equipped with 37 uncoated, fused silica retroreflectors of 38 mm diameter. We report test results for the GLONASS and LAGEOS CCRs. Details of the test procedure and <b>CodeV</b> simulations are given for the particular case of the LAGEOS Sector...|$|E

40|$|Let G be a {{connected}} graph of size at least 2 and c :E(G) →{ 0, 1,..., k− 1 } an edge coloring (or labeling) of G using k labels, where adjacent edges may be assigned the same label. For each vertex v of G, the color code of v {{with respect to}} c is the k-vector <b>code(v)</b> = (a 0, a 1,..., ak− 1), where ai {{is the number of}} edges incident with v that are labeled i for 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. The labeling c is called a detectable labeling if distinct vertices in G have distinct color codes. The value val(c) of a detectable labeling c of a graph G is the sum of the labels assigned to the edges in G. The total detection number td(G) of G is defined by td(G) = min{val(c) }, where the minimum is taken over all detectable labelings c of G. We investigate the problem of determining the total detection numbers of cycles...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a general purpose Coronagraph Performance Error Budget (CPEB) tool {{that we have}} developed under the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program. The CPEB automates many of the key steps required to evaluate the scattered starlight contrast in the dark hole of a space-based coronagraph. It operates in 3 steps: first, a <b>CodeV</b> or Zemax prescription is converted into a MACOS optical prescription. Second, a Matlab program calls ray-trace code that generates linear beam-walk and aberration sensitivity matrices for motions of the optical elements and line-of-sight pointing, with and without controlled coarse and fine-steering mirrors. Third, the sensitivity matrices are imported by macros into Excel 2007 where the error budget is created. Once created, the user specifies the quality of each optic from a predefined set of PSDs. The spreadsheet creates a nominal set of thermal and jitter motions and combines them with the sensitivity matrices to generate an error budget for the system. The user can easily modify the motion allocations to perform trade studies...|$|E
40|$|Thermal and {{structural}} output from ANSYS {{is not in}} a form useful for optical analysis software. Temperatures, displacements and stresses at arbitrarily located FE nodes can not be input directly into optical software. This paper discusses the post-processing steps required to present ANSYS results in a useable format for <b>CODEV,</b> ZEMAX, and OSLO. Specific issues include optical surface deformations, thermo-optic effects, adaptive optics, and dynamic response. Finite element computed optical surface deformations are fit to several polynomial types including Zernikes, aspheric, and XY polynomials. Higher frequency deformations are interpolated to a user-defined uniform grid array using element shape functions to create interferogram files. Three-dimensional shape function interpolation is used to create OPD maps due to thermo-optic effects (dn/dT), which are subsequently fit to polynomials and/or interferogram files. Similar techniques are also used for stress birefringence effects. Adaptive optics uses influence functions to minimize surface error before or after pointing and focus correction...|$|E
40|$|This is part four of {{a series}} on the ongoing optical {{modeling}} activities for James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first two discussed modeling JWST on-orbit performance using wavefront sensitivities to predict line of sight motion induced blur, and stability during thermal transients. The third investigates the aberrations resulting from alignment and figure compensation of the controllable degrees of freedom (primary and secondary mirrors), which may be encountered during ground alignment and on-orbit commissioning of the observatory. The work here introduces some of the math software tools used to perform {{the work of the}} previous three papers of this series. NASA has recently approved these in-house tools for public release as open source, so this presentation also serves as a quick tutorial on their use. The tools are collections of functions written in Matlab, which interface with optical design software (<b>CodeV,</b> OSLO, and Zemax) using either COM or DDE communication protocol. The functions are discussed, and examples are given...|$|E
40|$|Near-space {{platform}} has a {{high signal}} contrast and a long detection time. In order to realize effective detection of low altitude penetration target, a middle wave infrared (MWIR) optical system used in near space detection with high optical performance is given. First, the optical system scheme was described. Then {{on the basis of}} instrument and system consideration, the optical design parameters were distributed reasonably. The system had an effective focal length of 600 mm, an F-Number of F/ 4, a field of view of 2 ω= 1. 16 °, spatial resolution of 18 lp/mm and a working wavelength range of 3 - 5 μm. The system structure is simple. And the requirements of the spot, energy concentration, distortion are all satisfied. Because the change of environment temperature will deeply influence image quality of MWIR optical system, the temperature characteristic of the system is analyzed. Moreover, first-order ghost and narcissus effect of the system are all analyzed in <b>CODEV</b> software. The analysis results show that temperature, first-order ghost and narcissus effect requests are all satisfied. © 2015 SPIE...|$|E
40|$|Wavefront coding is a {{technology}} which {{combination of the}} optical design and digital image processing. By inserting a phase mask closed to the pupil plane of the optical system, the wavefront {{of the system is}} re-modulated. And the depth of focus is extended consequently. In reality the idea is same as the athermalization theory of infrared optical system. In this paper, an uncooled infrared dual field optical system with effective focal as 38 mm/ 19 mm, F number as 1. 2 of both focal length, operating wavelength varying from 8 μm to 12 μm was designed. A cubic phase mask was used at the pupil plane to re-modulate the wavefront. Then the performance of the infrared system was simulated with <b>CODEV</b> as the environment temperature varying from - 40 °C to 60 °C. MTF curve of the optical system with phase mask are compared with the outcome before using phase mask. The result show that wavefront coding technology can make the system not sensitive to thermal defocus, and then realize the athermal design of the infrared optical system. © 2017 SPIE. </p...|$|E
40|$|The atomic vapor laser isotope {{separation}} process uses high-average power lasers {{that have the}} commercial potential to enrich uranium for the electric power utilities. The transport of the laser beam through the laser system to the separation chambers requires high performance optical components, most of which have either fused silica or Zerodur as the substrate material. One of {{the requirements of the}} optical components is to preserve the wavefront quality of the laser beam that propagate over long distances. Full aperture tests with the high power process lasers and finite element analysis (FEA) have been performed on the transport optics. The wavefront distortions of the various sections of the transport path were measured with diagnostic Hartmann sensor packages. The FEA results were derived from an in-house thermal-structural-optical code which is linked to the commercially available <b>CodeV</b> program. In comparing the measured and predicted results, the bulk absorptance of fused silica was estimated to about 50 ppm/cm in the visible wavelength regime. Wavefront distortions are reported on optics made from fused silica and Zerodur substrate materials...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} {{of science and}} technology and the promotion of many local wars in the world, altitude optical sensor mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle is more widely applied in the airborne remote sensing, measurement and detection. In order to obtain high quality image of the aero optical remote sensor, it is important to analysis its thermal- optical performance on the condition of high speed and high altitude. Especially for the key imaging assembly, such as optical window, the temperature variation and temperature gradient can result in defocus and aberrations in optical system, which will lead to the poor quality image. In order to improve the optical performance of a high speed aerial camera optical window, the thermal/structural/optical integrated design method is developed. Firstly, the flight environment of optical window is analyzed. Based on the theory of aerodynamics and heat transfer, the convection heat transfer coefficient is calculated. The temperature distributing of optical window is simulated by the finite element analysis software. The maximum difference in temperature of the inside and outside of optical window is obtained. Then the deformation of optical window under the boundary condition of the maximum difference in temperature is calculated. The optical window surface deformation is fitted in Zernike polynomial as the interface, the calculated Zernike fitting coefficients is brought in and analyzed by <b>CodeV</b> Optical Software. At last, the transfer function diagrams of the optical system on temperature field are comparatively analyzed. By comparing and analyzing the result, it can be obtained that the optical path difference caused by thermal deformation of the optical window is 138. 2 nm, which is under PV <= 1 / 4 lambda. The above study can be used as an important reference for other optical window designs...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{interconnects}} {{are considered}} a promising solution for long distance and high bitrate data transmissions, outperforming electrical interconnects in terms of loss and dispersion. Due to the bandwidth and distance advantage of optical interconnects, longer links have been implemented with optics. Recent studies show that optical interconnects have clear advantages even at very short distances - intra system interconnects. The biggest challenge for such optical interconnects is the alignment tolerance. Many free space optical components require very precise assembly and installation, and therefore the overall cost could be increased. This thesis studied the misalignment tolerance and possible alignment correction solutions for optical interconnects at backplane or board level. First the alignment tolerance for free space couplers was simulated and the result indicated the most critical alignments occur between the VCSEL, waveguide and microlens arrays. An in-situ microlens array fabrication method was designed and experimentally demonstrated, with no observable misalignment with the waveguide array. At the receiver side, conical lens arrays were proposed to replace simple microlens arrays for a larger angular alignment tolerance. Multilayer simulation models in <b>CodeV</b> were built to optimized the refractive index and shape profiles of the conical lens arrays. Conical lenses fabricated with micro injection molding machine and fiber etching were characterized. Active component VCSOA was used to correct misalignment in optical connectors between the board and backplane. The alignment correction capability were characterized for both DC and AC (1 GHz) optical signal. The speed and bandwidth of the VCSOA was measured and compared with a same structure VCSEL. Based on the optical inverter being studied in our lab, an all- optical flip-flop was demonstrated using a pair of VCSOAs. This memory cell with random access ability can store one bit optical signal with set or reset beam. The operating conditions were studied to generate two stable states between the VCSOA pair. The entire functionality test was implemented with free space optical component...|$|E
40|$|An image {{can only}} {{be as good as}} the optics of a camera or any other imaging system allows it to be. An imaging system is merely a {{transformation}} that takes a 3 D world coordinate to a 2 D image plane. This can be done through both linear/non-linear transfer functions. Depending on the application at hand it is easier to use some models of imaging systems over the others in certain situations. The most well-known models are the 1) Pinhole model, 2) Thin Lens Model and 3) Thick lens model for optical systems. Using light-field analysis the connection through these different models is described. A novel figure of merit is presented on using one optical model over the other for certain applications. After analyzing these optical systems, their applications in plenoptic cameras for adaptive optics applications are introduced. A new technique to use a plenoptic camera to extract information about a localized distorted planar wave front is described. <b>CODEV</b> simulations conducted in this thesis show that its performance is comparable to those of a Shack-Hartmann sensor and that they can potentially increase the dynamic range of angles that can be extracted assuming a paraxial imaging system. As a final application, a novel dual PTZ-surveillance system to track a target through space is presented. 22 X optic zoom lenses on high resolution pan/tilt platforms recalibrate a master-slave relationship based on encoder readouts rather than complicated image processing algorithms for real-time target tracking. As the target moves out of a region of interest in the master camera, it is moved to force the target back into the region of interest. Once the master camera is moved, a precalibrated lookup table is interpolated to compute the relationship between the master/slave cameras. The homography that relates the pixels of the master camera to the pan/tilt settings of the slave camera then continue to follow the planar trajectories of targets as they move through space at high accuracies...|$|E
