40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that simultaneous auditory identification of the target in a visual search task can lead to more efficient (i. e. ?flatter?) search functions (Spivey et al., 2001). Experiment 1 replicates the paradigm of Spivey et al., providing subjects with auditory identification of the search target either before (Consecutive condition) or simultaneously with (<b>Concurrent</b> <b>condition)</b> the onset of the search task. RT x Set Size slopes in the <b>Concurrent</b> <b>condition</b> are approximately 1 / 2 as steep as those in the Consecutive condition. Experiment 2 employs a distractor ratio manipulation to test the notion that subjects are using the simultaneous auditory target identification to ?parse? the search set by colour, thus reducing the search set by 1 / 2. The results of Experiment 2 do not support the notion that subjects are parsing the search set by colour. Experiment 3 addresses the same question as Experiment 2, but obtains the desired distractor ratios by holding the amount of relevantly-coloured items constant while letting overall set size vary. Unlike Experiment 2, Experiment 3 supports the interpretation that subjects are using the auditory target identification to parse the search set...|$|E

40|$|Background: Chronic {{constipation}} (CC) is {{a common}} condition but its concurrent conditions are not well characterized. We measured the prevalence and risk of developing 15 pre–specified concurrent conditions in patients with CC. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using the Medicaid database of California, utilizing ICD- 9 codes for detection of cases (CC), controls (patients with GERD) and concurrent conditions. Study period was 01 / 01 / 1995 to 06 / 30 / 2005. Index date was the date 3 months before the first physician visit for CC. Pre-index time (12 months) was compared to post-index time (12 months) to assess the association of every <b>concurrent</b> <b>condition</b> within each cohort. To account for ascertainment bias, an adjusted odds ratio was calculated by comparing the odds ratio for every <b>concurrent</b> <b>condition</b> in the CC cohort {{to that in the}} GERD cohort. Results: 147, 595 patients with CC (mean age 54. 2 years; 69. 7 % women; 36. 2 % white) and 142, 086 patients with GERD (mean age 56. 3 years; 65. 3 % women; 41. 6 % white) were evaluated. The most prevalent concurrent conditions with CC were hemorrhoids (7. 6 %), diverticular disease (5. 9 %), ano–rectal hemorrhage (4. 7 %), irritable bowel syndrome (3. 5 %) and fecal impaction (2 %). When adjusted for ascertainment bias, the most notable associations with CC were Hirschsprung’s disease, fecal impaction and ano-rectal conditions such as fissure, fistula, hemorrhage and ulcers.

40|$|Background: Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is known as}} a repetitive motion disorder, but the role of other diseases in the development or prognosis of CTS is uncertain. We reviewed the literature to determine whether there is evidence for an increased prevalence of specific conditions in CTS patients and whether this evidence would support laboratory screening for these conditions. Methods: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Trial Register were searched for key words related to CTS and associated diseases. Relevant articles were selected according to specific criteria. Sources of bias and heterogeneity attributable to differences in study design and in patient selection were investigated by subgroup analysis. Results: After an initial search, we limited ourselves to three potentially important conditions: diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism (HT), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We identified nine articles with a total of 4908 CTS patients and 7671 controls that met our selection criteria. The nine studies were heterogeneous with respect to clinical and methodologic factors. In general, the prevalence of concurrent diseases was higher in CTS patients than in controls: the pooled odds ratios were 2. 2 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 - 3. 1) for DM, 1. 4 (1. 0 - 2. 0) for HT, and 2. 2 (1. 4 - 3. 4) for RA. Studies of lower methodologic quality reported, on average, higher odds ratios. Only one study provided information about whether the diagnosis of the <b>concurrent</b> <b>condition</b> was already made {{at the time of the}} CTS diagnosis. Conclusions: We found evidence that the prevalences of DM, HT, and RA are higher in CTS patients, but only one study specifically addressed the issue of the prevalence of nonmanifest cases of the <b>concurrent</b> <b>condition.</b> At present, there is insufficient evidence for routine laboratory screening for concurrent conditions in all newly diagnosed CTS patients.

40|$|Although normatively {{irrelevant}} {{to the relationship between}} a cue and an outcome, outcome density (i. e. its base-rate probability) affects people’s estimation of causality. By what process causality is incorrectly estimated is of importance to an integrative theory of causal learning. A potential explanation may be that this happens because outcome density induces a judgement bias. An alternative explanation is explored here, following which the incorrect estimation of causality is grounded in the processing of cue–outcome information during learning. A first neural network simulation shows that, {{in the absence of a}} deep processing of cue information, cue–outcome relationships are acquired but causality is correctly estimated. The second simulation shows how an incorrect estimation of causality may emerge from the active processing of both cue and outcome information. In an experiment inspired by the simulations, the role of a deep processing of cue information was put to test. In addition to an outcome density manipulation, a shallow cue manipulation was introduced: cue information was either still displayed (concurrent) or no longer displayed (delayed) when outcome information was given.

A solution strategy for MCO that overcomes this drawback is proposed here on the grounds of genetic NSGA-II algorithm. It is an adaptive heuristic search technique that controls the distances between the individual and system's feasible region during genetic evolution. In the evolving NSGA-II based non-dominated sorting, the individual threshold of infeasibility degree is reduced gradually via genetic evolution and the individual's feasibility capacity is determined by its infeasibility degree and the threshold. It has been applied to a benchmark example of speed reducer design, and the obtained results demonstrate the proposed technique is comparably more efficient and may offer substantial advantages over the gradient-based optimization methods.

In order to understand how these eye and hand actions are coordinated with the internal perceptual, cognitive and motor processing, {{it is essential to}} establish whether the eye movements incur a processing cost. Current literature is divided on this issue. To examine the costs of eye movement, Experiment 1 involved twenty participants completing a simple sequence execution task where stimuli were presented either Concurrently across the screen, or Consecutively, one after the other, in the centre of the screen. Presentation times in the Consecutive condition were incrementally decreased from 600 ms to 450, 350 and 250 ms. If eye movements result in a processing cost then processing times in the Consecutive condition should be shorter than in the <b>Concurrent</b> <b>condition.</b> The results showed no decrease in the processing time for a given item that would indicate a cost when making eye movements. Experiment 2 involved nineteen participants completing the same sequence execution task, but limited the presentation times of each item to 350 and 450 ms for both presentation conditions. This was closer to the processing time for each item from the Consecutive condition of Experiment 1. Again, no difference in processing time was found. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that eye movements do not contribute to the processing time required to complete choice response time tasks. The implications of the results for theories of stimulus execution are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{spinal cord}} {{dysfunction}} occurs in dogs {{as a consequence}} of diverse aetiologies, including long-standing spinal cord compression and insidious neurodegenerative conditions. One such neurodegenerative condition is canine degenerative myelopathy (DM), which clinically is a challenge to differentiate from other chronic spinal cord conditions. Although the clinical diagnosis of DM can be strengthened by the identification of the Sod 1 mutations that are observed in affected dogs, genetic analysis alone is insufficient to provide a definitive diagnosis. There is a requirement to identify biomarkers that can differentiate conditions with a similar clinical presentation, thus facilitating patient diagnostic and management strategies. A comparison of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein gel electrophoresis profile between idiopathic epilepsy (IE) and DM identified a protein band that was more prominent in DM. This band was subsequently found to contain a multifunctional protein clusterin (apolipoprotein J) that is protective against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis, oxidative stress, and also serves as an extracellular chaperone influencing protein aggregation. Western blot analysis of CSF clusterin confirmed elevated levels in DM compared to IE (p[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05). Analysis of spinal cord tissue from DM and control material found that clusterin expression was evident in neurons and that the clusterin mRNA levels from tissue extracts were elevated in DM compared to the control. The plasma clusterin levels was comparable between these groups. However, a comparison of clusterin CSF levels in a number of neurological conditions found that clusterin was elevated in both DM and chronic intervertebral disc disease (cIVDD) but not in meningoencephalitis and IE.

40|$|James W Swann, 1 Barbara J Skelly 2 1 Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, The Royal Veterinary College, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, 2 Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK Abstract: Immune-mediated {{hemolytic}} anemia {{is one of}} the most common manifestations of canine immune-mediated disease, yet treatment regimens remain nonstandardized and, in some cases, controversial. The main reason for this, as for most diseases in veterinary medicine, is the lack of large-scale placebo-controlled trials so that the efficacy of one treatment over another can be established. Most of the evidence used for treatment comes from retrospective studies and from personal preference and experience, and because of this, treatment regimens tend to vary among institutions and individual clinicians. Management of immune-mediated {{hemolytic anemia}} includes immunosuppression, thromboprophylaxis, and supportive care measures to help prevent and treat <b>concurrent</b> <b>conditions.</b> Keywords: IMHA, canine immune-mediated disease, management regimen...|$|R
40|$|In Minnesota, {{incidence}} of invasive group B streptococcal disease was 3 times greater in older adults in long-term care facilities than in older adults in community settings (67. 7 / 100, 000 vs. 21. 4 / 100, 000) during 2003 – 2007. The overall case-fatality rate was 6. 8 %, and <b>concurrent</b> <b>conditions</b> were common among both groups. Invasive group B streptococcal (GBS) {{disease is a}} major cause of illness and death in older adults (1). A 2 - to 4 -fold increase in invasive GBS disease among US adults has been reported since the 1980 s (2), and incidence increased 32 % in adults from 1999 through 2005 (1). The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the incidence and epidemiology of GBS disease in Minnesota among the elderly in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and in the community...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{effects of}} pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 on {{children in the}} tropics, we examined characteristics of children hospitalized for this disease in Malaysia. Of 1, 362 children, 51 (3. 7 %) died, 46 of whom were in an intensive care unit. Although disease was usually mild,> 1 <b>concurrent</b> <b>conditions</b> were associated with higher death rates. Transmission of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres {{has been well documented}} (1 – 12). These reports described a relatively mild and selflimited clinical illness for most cases. However, data on disease prevalence and severity in children in the tropics are scarce. Malaysia has 132 public and 214 private hospitals. We examined the demographics, clinical presentation, and outcomes of children hospitalized for pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 in 68 Ministry of Health–affiliated public hospitals i...|$|R
