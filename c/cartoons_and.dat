5|$|Despite initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and {{critically}} in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed {{the game to}} Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television <b>cartoons,</b> <b>and</b> dozens of other places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped to position the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s (1996–1999).|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing <b>cartoons</b> <b>and</b> {{instructions}} for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, {{he was wounded}} in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout. Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917. On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat, and—by his own account—upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.|$|E

5|$|Since Alice Comedies in the 1920s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has {{produced}} a series of prominent short films, including the Mickey Mouse <b>cartoons</b> <b>and</b> the Silly Symphonies series. Many of these shorts provided a medium for the studio to experiment with new technologies that they would use in their filmmaking process, such as the synchronization of sound in Steamboat Willie (1928), {{the integration of the}} three-strip Technicolor process in Flowers and Trees (1932), the multiplane camera in The Old Mill (1937), the xerography process in Goliath II (1960), and the hand-drawn/CGI hybrid animation in Off His Rockers (1992), Paperman (2012), and Get a Horse! (2013).|$|E
5|$|Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney {{developed}} an early interest in drawing. He took art classes {{as a boy}} and {{got a job as}} a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, Walt developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length <b>cartoons</b> <b>and</b> technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Fantasia, Pinocchio (both 1940), Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful Cinderella (1950) and Mary Poppins (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Both prank and {{intentionally}} deadly exploding cigars {{have been}} featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, <b>cartoons</b> <b>and</b> others. A well-known use of the exploding cigar in literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his death wish by eagerly smoking a cigar he knows {{to be of the}} prank explosive variety. Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an exploding cigar to Uncle Sam, and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding cigar.|$|E

5|$|Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen {{described}} the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the Second World War. The incident {{came at a}} time of heightened political and social tensions between Muslim majority countries and Western countries, following several, high-profile Islamic terrorist attacks in the Westincluding the September 11 attacksand Western military interventions in Muslim countries, such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The <b>cartoons</b> <b>and</b> the reaction to them aggravated already-strained relations. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolise the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the cartoons or Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{moved to}} Hollywood in July 1923. Although New York {{was the center}} of the cartoon industry, he was {{attracted}} to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from tuberculosis there. Disney's efforts to sell Alice's Wonderland were in vain until he heard from New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler. She was losing the rights to both the Out of the Inkwell and Felix the Cat <b>cartoons,</b> <b>and</b> needed a new series. In October they signed a contract for six Alice comedies, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studiowhich later became The Walt Disney Companyto produce the films; they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to Hollywood to continue production, with Davis on contract at $100 a month. In July 1924 Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City.|$|E
5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of <b>cartoons</b> <b>and</b> provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E

5|$|National {{legislation}} {{requires that}} all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia {{are made in}} Croatian language or with appropriate translations either using dubbing or subtitling. In general, all foreign programming is subtitled, except for <b>cartoons</b> <b>and</b> narrated parts of documentaries and similar programmes. An attempt to change this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when a soap opera was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned. The legislation does not provide for mutually intelligible languages. That led to formal requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding language localisation of television programmes made in Serbian language. Ultimately, that issue was resolved through subtitling using teletext service normally used for closed captioning.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} of all dinosaurs, Stegosaurus has been depicted on film, in <b>cartoons</b> <b>and</b> comics, as children's toys, and was even declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado in 1982. Due to the fragmentary nature of most early Stegosaurus fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations of these animals could be produced. The earliest popular image of Stegosaurus was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of Scientific American, which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the Stegosaurus as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might {{have been based on}} a misinterpretation of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he thought they {{might turn out to be}} small dermal spines.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of <b>cartoons,</b> <b>and</b> a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He {{said they did not}} have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E
