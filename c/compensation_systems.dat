He supported the Republican leadership, although he did cooperate with reformers when their efforts appeared sure of success. Early in his legislative career, Edge worked extensively in developing a workers' compensation law for New Jersey, even traveling to Europe to study <b>compensation</b> <b>systems</b> there. The workers' compensation bill that he sponsored was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Woodrow Wilson.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to humans and flies, some plants also {{make use of}} the XX/XY dosage <b>compensation</b> <b>systems.</b> Silene latifolia plants are also either male (XY) or female (XX), with the Y chromosome being smaller, with fewer genes expressed, than the X chromosome. Two separate studies [...] have shown male S. latifolia expression of X-linked genes to be about 70% of the expression in females. If the S. latifolia did not practice dosage compensation, the expected level of X-linked gene expression in males would be 50% that of females, thus the plant practices some degree of dosage compensation but, because male expression is not 100% that of females, {{it has been suggested that}} S. latiforia and its dosage compensation system is still evolving. Additionally, in plant species that lack dimorphic sex chromosomes, dosage compensation can occur when aberrant meiotic events or mutations result in either aneuploidy or polyploidy. Genes on the affected chromosome may be upregulated or down-regulated to compensate for the change in the normal number of chromosomes present.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} better machine tool {{accuracy}} is discussed {{together with the}} factors which can affect machine tool accuracy. A study is made of the various techniques adopted for the reduction of errors in machine tools. The concept of error compensation is discussed and the different techniques for error compensation are appraised. A critical appraisal is presented of the work undertaken to date {{in the field of}} error compensation. Based on this appraisal a criterion is established for a universally applicable error <b>compensation</b> <b>system.</b> The development of a novel, patented microprocessor based machine tool error <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> which fulfills this criterion is described. This <b>compensation</b> <b>system,</b> which is based on the precalibrated compensation technique, utilizes a unique geometric compensation algorithm. This algorithm allows the <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> to compensate for the geometric error components of any machine tool configuration up to three axes. The development of this geometric algorithm is presented. The integration of this <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> to a large moving column milling machine is described. Measurement tests and cutting tests were performed on this milling machine to establish the effectiveness of the <b>compensation</b> <b>system.</b> The results from these experimental tests are presented, and illustrate the significant improvement in machine tool accuracy achieved through error compensation. This is the first attempt at producing a machine tool error <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> with universal applicability, both in terms of the machine geometric model, and the method of applying the compensation to the machine tool. The error <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> developed gives the potential for compensating for thermally induced and load induced position errors, and will enable further work in this area to be commercially exploited...|$|R

To {{ensure the}} safety and the {{production}} efficiency {{as well as the}} component lifetime of deep-sea mining system, a novel heave <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> of deep-sea mining based on dynamic vibration absorber was proposed in the light of 5000 m deep sea poly-metallic mining system of China in this paper. According to the work condition of heave <b>compensation</b> <b>system,</b> the response of deep-sea mining ship under random wave of sea state 4 in China’s deep sea poly-metallic mining field are numerically simulated in time domain. The proposed heave <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> was simplified to a two-degree-of-freedom system stimulated by the displacement motion of the deep-sea mining ship and its dynamic model was built. Taking the minimum of the displacement variance of the proposed heave <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> as the optimal object and considering the allowed displacement of the dynamic vibration absorber itself, the computation formula of the optimum parameters of dynamic vibration absorber for heave <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> of deep-sea mining is derived. Thus the parameter of dynamic vibration absorber was determined and its effect on the performance index of the heave <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> was simulated and compared.
