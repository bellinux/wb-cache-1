5|$|On February 1, 1968, the PRR {{merged with}} New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The {{remainder}} of the cars were delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray paint with red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The pantographs on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging catenary wires, then draw high currents due to improperly designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved to have a superior pantograph design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July had severe issues with electrical arcing.

40|$|The nonparametric {{framework}} is very often {{considered in the}} social sciences because the hypothesis of normality is generally not tenable. In this context, <b>combined</b> <b>testing</b> has been very useful for comparing means/medians, variability and for the location/scale problem. The aim of the paper is to see whether <b>combined</b> <b>testing</b> is useful also for general two-sample problems that arise {{in the social sciences}}. The framework of <b>combined</b> <b>testing</b> for the general two-sample problem is presented. Some tests are developed according to it. Size and power of the <b>combined</b> <b>tests</b> are investigated in a simulation study and compared to non <b>combined</b> <b>tests.</b> It is shown that the new tests compare favorably with the former ones. In particular, the new tests can be very useful when the practitioner, as very often happens when analyzing social data, has no clear idea on parent population distributions.
