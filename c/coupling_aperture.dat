40|$|A ring resontor for lasers with annular gain {{media is}} presented. The {{resonator}} {{consists of two}} annular mirrors. While the radiation is reflected {{back and forth between}} the tow annular mirrors, diffraction effects induce an additional azimuthal radiation flux.

The azimuthal radiation flux allows the extraction of optical power from the whole gain volume through the <b>coupling</b> <b>aperture.</b> The azimuthal radiation flux can revolve in two direction. The associated modes are degenerate and random jumping between unidirectional and bidirectional operation is observed. Unidirectional operation has been stabilized but remains very sensitive to mirror alignment.

40|$|In recent years, {{the compact}} range {{has become very}} popular for {{measuring}} Radar Cross Section (RCS) and antenna patterns. The compact range, in fact, offers several advantages due to reduced size, a controlled environment, and privacy. On the other hand, it has some problems of its own, which must be solved properly {{in order to achieve}} high quality measurement results. For example, diffraction from the edges of the main reflector corrupts the plane wave in the target zone and creates spurious scattering centers in RCS measurements. While diffraction can be minimized by using rolled edges, the field of an offset single reflector compact range is corrupted by three other errors: the taper of the reflected field, the cross polarization introduced by the tilt of the feed and the aperture blockage introduced by the feed itself. These three errors can be eliminated by the use of a subreflector system. A properly designed subreflector system offers very little aperture blockage, no cross-polarization introduced and a minimization of the taper of the reflected field. A Gregorian configuration has been adopted in order to enclose the feed and the ellipsoidal subreflector in a lower chamber, which is isolated by absorbers from the upper chamber, where the main parabolic reflector and the target zone are enclosed. The coupling between the two rooms is performed through a <b>coupling</b> <b>aperture.</b> The first cut design for such a subreflector system is performed through Geometrical Optics ray tracing techniques (GO), and is greatly simplified by the use of the concept of the central ray introduced by Dragone.
