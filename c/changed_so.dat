5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era.

The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E

5|$|All {{students}} {{enroll in}} one of five magnet programs. The High School University (HSU) magnet offers a traditional college preparatory curriculum with electives. The Math/Science/Technology (MST) magnet specifically prepares students for college programs in engineering, science and math. Minimal requirements for MST students include courses in algebra, trigonometry, calculus (including mandatory AP Calculus), biology, chemistry and computer programming. The Journalism & Communication (J) magnet focuses on journalism, publishing, and media production. To earn class credit, J students can participate in production of the school's national award-winning yearbook (The Crimson), student newspaper (The Crimson Record), award-winning literary magazine (One Blue Wall), multimedia website (RedEye) or a weekly morning television show called Manual AM, which is broadcast to all classrooms. The J program was formerly known as CMA (Communications and Media Arts), but the name was <b>changed</b> <b>so</b> that the Manual program would stand out from others in the district with similar names.|$|E
5|$|At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his {{troubles}} {{and decides to}} renounce love for political ambition ("Come nube che fugge dal vento"). But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina's original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that her efforts to secure the throne for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard the throne for Claudius ("Se vuoi pace"). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have the throne. No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all <b>changed,</b> <b>so</b> Claudius {{in a spirit of}} reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero. He then summons the goddess Juno, who descends to pronounce a general blessing ("V'accendano le tede i raggi delle stelle").|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the Oslo City Council {{voted to}} close the street tramway and replace all routes with either diesel buses or the Oslo Metro. The {{specific}} plans for the Ekeberg Line were not decided, although the line was considered either to be a stand-alone light rail or connected to the metro. From 30 October 1960, the route for the Ekeberg Line trams in the city <b>changed,</b> <b>so</b> they instead followed the route Schweigaards gate – Vognmannsgata – Jernbanetorget – Kirkeristen to Stortorvet instead of the old route via Grønland and Brugata. From 1963, the route terminated at Jernbanetorget, after {{the rest of the}} route was closed due to the construction of the metro.|$|E

5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Prior to the current constitution, {{the duties of the}} office would devolve upon the lieutenant governor, without that person actually becoming governor. The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was <b>changed,</b> <b>so</b> that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.|$|E
5|$|The French won {{a further}} five {{successive}} tournaments {{before they were}} beaten 3–2 by Great Britain in 1933. Australia were the last champions {{before the onset of}} the Second World War. They beat the United States 3–2 in 1939. Upon resumption of the tournament in 1946, it was renamed the Davis Cup after the death of Dwight D. Davis in 1945. The United States regained the title after they beat Australia 5–0. They retained the title until 1950 when Australia won 4–1. This marked the start of Australian dominance of the Davis Cup, as they only lost three times from 1950 to 1967. Prior to 1972, the champion received a bye directly to the final. This was <b>changed</b> <b>so</b> that the champion had to play in every round.|$|E
5|$|The IOC also {{required}} that the long-track speed skating be done indoors. Hamar was awarded the venue, Vikingskipet, after Hamar Municipality guaranteed to cover all costs exceeding NOK200 million. This provided sufficient leverage for Hamar to host additional events. LOOC approved the construction of Vikingskipet in on 15 December 1989 {{and at the same}} time supported proposals to renovate Storhamar Ishall to host Olympic ice hockey matches. A second, temporary training rink was also planned built in Hamar. In addition, the Hamar venue would be used for short track speed skating, while figure skating would be run in Lillehammer. In March, the plans were <b>changed,</b> <b>so</b> Hamar would receive an all-new ice rink in addition to a renovation of Storhamar Ishall.|$|E

5|$|The NHL Entry Draft, {{originally}} {{known as}} the NHL Amateur Draft, is a collective meeting in which the franchises of the National Hockey League (NHL) systematically select the exclusive rights to available amateur players who meet the eligibility requirements to play professional hockey in the NHL. First held in 1963, the draft prior to 1969 was a shorter affair. Any amateur player who was 17 {{years of age and}} older and was not already sponsored by an NHL club was eligible to be drafted. In 1969 the rules were <b>changed</b> <b>so</b> that any amateur player between the ages of 17 and 20 was eligible to be drafted. The draft has grown, and in 2010, 210 players were selected over seven rounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael get in the car and leave Andy outside, then tell him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns to the office and confronts his co-workers; there is a long, awkward silence, and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas and ruin the tension. During filming, it was <b>changed</b> <b>so</b> Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not work very well and cut it, but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the flatulence, while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view <b>changed,</b> <b>so</b> that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
