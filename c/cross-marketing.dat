Exchanges as SROs {{engage in a}} greater range of single-market surveillance of market manipulative practices than securities commissions, but the scope of <b>cross-market</b> surveillance activity is very similar among exchanges and securities commissions. <b>Cross-market</b> surveillance is more effective with information-sharing arrangements, and securities commissions {{are more likely to}} engage in information sharing than exchanges are. Relative to the scope of single-market surveillance, the scope of <b>cross-market</b> surveillance shows a stronger positive association with trading velocity, the number of listed companies, and market capitalization.

Our results provide evidence that <b>cross-market</b> portfolio rebalancing or flight produces <b>cross-market</b> effect of order flow. In particular, while Treasury bonds are the main choice as safe assets in stock-bond flight, corporate bonds are able to substitute Treasury bonds when either the stock or the bond market is more volatile.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{stock market}} co-movements. It {{begins with a}} discussion of several conceptual issues involved in measuring these movements and how to test for contagion. Standard tests examine if <b>cross-market</b> correlation in stock market returns increase during a period of crisis. The measure of <b>cross-market</b> correlations central to this standard analysis, however, is biased. The unadjusted correlation coefficient is conditional on market movements over the time period under consideration, so that during a period of turmoil when stock market volatility increases, standard estimates of <b>cross-market</b> correlations will be biased upward. It is straightforward to adjust the correlation coefficient to correct for this bias. The remainder of the paper applies these concepts to test for stock market contagion during the 1997 East Asian crises, the 1994 Mexican peso collapse, and the 1987 U. S. stock market crash. In each of these cases, tests based on the unadjusted correlation coefficients find evidence of contagion in several countries, while tests based on the adjusted coefficients find virtually no contagion. This suggests that high market co-movements during these periods were a continuation of strong <b>cross-market</b> linkages. In other words, during these three crises there was no contagion, only interdependence. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose an {{empirical}} procedure for examining the time-varying features of <b>cross-market</b> correlations in selected Gulf stock markets. Design/methodology/approach – The paper directly infers the <b>cross-market</b> linkages from the stock data using a multivariate dynamic conditional correlation GARCH model (DCC-GARCH). The paper attempts to date the structural breaks in the time-paths of the conditional correlation indices to investigate whether the <b>cross-market</b> comovement encompasses significant changes in nature or not. Findings – Conditional <b>cross-market</b> correlations between studied markets are shown to be time-varying, past-dependent and subject to structural breaks. However, the comovements are still small within the Gulf region and insignificant between the Gulf stock markets and the world market. Research limitations/implications – Even though the paper attempted to relate the observed changes in market linkages to major economic and political events that the Gulf region experienced during the sample period, a more careful, in-depth analysis is needed since the primary objectives of this paper consist only of measuring stock market comovements and detecting their possible structure changes. Practical implications – For global investors, there is still room for international and regional diversification in Gulf markets, given the low degree of comovements documented in the study. Originality/value – The application of the DCC-GARCH model and structural change test in a linear framework appears to be suitable for studying the time-varying properties of <b>cross-market</b> linkages between markets in the Gulf region. It also provides information about the degree of financial integration of the studied markets with the world stock market through an analysis of the conditional correlation coefficients.

We concentrate on realized volatilities derived from the intra-day prices of the Brent crude oil and four different asset classes (Stocks, Forex, Commodities and Macro), which represent the different “information channels” by which oil price volatility is impacted from. We employ a HAR framework and estimate forecasts for 1 -day to 66 -days ahead.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{marketing strategies}} for {{a manufacturer of}} a composite product (i. e., a product sold in two parts to two separate types of consumers, which has greater value when used jointly by both consumers). It is assumed that expected sales of one product increase {{a different type of}} consumer's willingness to pay for the other product. This is described as a 'cross-market network externality'. Using a parsimonious model, I characterize solutions for a monopolist and for variations on Bertrand-Nash competition with differentiated products. The results demonstrate that {{in the presence of the}} <b>cross-market</b> network externality, it is optimal for the price of one product to increase relative to the price of the other product (by comparison with expected prices in the absence of the externality effect). In competition between firms, it is individually rational for each firm to attempt to maximize its own <b>cross-market</b> network externality. However (and counter-intuitively), as all firms strive to increase the <b>cross-market</b> externality related to their products, a worse industry-wide solution results. In other words, the existence of firm-specific <b>cross-market</b> network externalities in Bertrand-Nash competition creates a form of 'Prisoner's Dilemma'. In some multi-firm competitive markets, compatibility between products is a design choice (for example, compatibility between word processors such as Microsoft Word and WordPerfect). Normally, increasing compatibility between products increases the substitutability of the products, often resulting in more competition and lower profits (absent other effects). In a market with <b>cross-market</b> externalities, however, increased compatibility leads to increased profits. The model utilized in this paper has applications to industries as diverse as television, Internet web portals and certain types of Internet browser software. It is expected that the predictions of the model will be tested on a data set from the software industry. Internet, Software, and Network Externality...|$|R
