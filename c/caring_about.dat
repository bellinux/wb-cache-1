5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|In September 1793 the Sardinian army {{tried to}} {{recapture}} the County of Nice. The French right flank held its ground, but on the left Sérurier gave up the east bank of the Vésubie River and fell back to Utelle on 10 September. Jacques François Dugommier took command of the left wing three days later and Sérurier {{took charge of the}} right wing of the Army of the Alps at Entrevaux. Sérurier was arrested for retreating too much and for being of noble blood. He was reinstated after the representatives on mission and the War Minister Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte termed the charges as unimportant while the citizens of Laon sent a petition vouching for his patriotism. After the fighting petered out in the December snow, Sérurier's division was transferred to form the left flank of the Army of Italy. In January 1794 he was denounced for listening to aristocratic songs and for not <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> desertions, but Bouchotte and the representatives brushed aside these charges. Under army commander Pierre Jadart Dumerbion a French offensive began on 5 April and Oneglia was seized. André Masséna commanded the 20,000-man main column on the right wing while François Macquard directed the center division and Pierre Dominique Garnier led the left division. Sérurier, who commanded Garnier's left brigade, reoccupied Isola and went on to seize the Colle delle Finestre against weak resistance. In the Second Battle of Saorgio on 24 April 1794, Masséna defeated Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi, the French inflicting 2,800 casualties on the Sardinians while losing 1,500 killed and wounded. In the aftermath, Macquard occupied Saorge and the Col de Tende while Masséna held Ormea in the Tanaro valley. At the end of June, Sérurier took part in a small operation in the Valle Stura di Demonte.|$|E
5|$|Returning home, JJ {{sees his}} mother, Cecilia (Juliet Cowan), {{overwhelmed}} {{by all of}} his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook {{to tell him how}} he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. When he visits Effy, however, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone; she refuses but offers to be his friend. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie and shouts at Cook for not <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> how he feels. Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club. In the queue, Effy tells Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) that she knows about Naomi and Emily's relationship. Naomi reveals that she is unsure of her sexuality and realises that Effy is in love with Freddie, not Cook. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) lets them into the club where British electronica duo You Love Her Coz She's Dead are playing, announcing that Emily is already inside. Cook gets into a fight on the dancefloor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept has}} a long history in {{philosophical}} and ethical thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science, Auguste Comte, and has become a major topic for psychologists (especially evolutionary psychology researchers), evolutionary biologists, and ethologists. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> the welfare of other people and acting to help them.|$|E

Others theorise positive effects of playing video games including prosocial behavior in some contexts and argue that the video game industry has served as a scapegoat for more generalised problems affecting some communities.|$|E

Originally, the song was never intended to be released as a single. Spears, however, wanted to shoot a music video for it, and had to convince her record company. It was then released on February 14, 2005 by Jive Records as the second single from the album worldwide except North America.

500|$|The {{multiplayer}} {{component of}} Journey {{was designed to}} facilitate cooperation between players without forcing it, and without allowing competition.

40|$|In an {{important}} paper, Fuhrer and Moore (1995) showed that Taylor (1980) ’s staggered wage setting model does not exhibit persistence in inflation; they proposed a simple modification, in which workers <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> the real wages of other workers, which solves this problem. However, {{we argue that}} the key part of Fuhrer and Moore’s model is not that workers <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the real wages of other workers, but that workers are assumed to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the past real wages of other workers. When that assumption is replaced by the assumption that workers <b>care</b> <b>about</b> current real wages of other workers, the Fuhrer and Moore model reverts identically to the Taylor model. We also show that a simple model in which workers <b>care</b> <b>about</b> their own past real wages, e. g. because unemployment insurance depends on past wages, as noted in Blanchard and Katz (1999), generates negative autocorrelations in inflation...|$|R
