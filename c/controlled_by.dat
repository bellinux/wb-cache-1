40|$|AbstractVoting {{systems are}} common tools {{in a variety}} of areas. This paper studies {{parameterized}} computational complexity of control of Plurality, Condorcet and Approval voting systems, respectively. The types of controls considered include adding or deleting candidates or voters, under constructive or destructive setting. We obtain the following results: (1) constructive <b>control</b> <b>by</b> adding candidates in Plurality voting is W[2]-hard with respect to the parameter “number of added candidates”, (2) destructive <b>control</b> <b>by</b> adding candidates in Plurality voting is W[2]-hard with respect to the parameter “number of added candidates”, (3) constructive <b>control</b> <b>by</b> adding voters in Condorcet voting is W[1]-hard with respect to the parameter “number of added voters”, (4) constructive <b>control</b> <b>by</b> deleting voters in Condorcet voting is W[1]-hard with respect to the parameter “number of deleted voters”, (5) constructive <b>control</b> <b>by</b> adding voters in Approval voting is W[1]-hard with respect to the parameter “number of added voters”, and (6) constructive <b>control</b> <b>by</b> deleting voters in Approval voting is W[2]-hard with respect to the parameter “number of deleted voters”...|$|R

5|$|Empire City {{is built}} on three islands, and the player must work through main story {{missions}} on each island before being able to access the next one, though future missions may require the player to return to an earlier island. Each island is divided {{into a number of}} sectors, {{at the start of the}} game <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> three different gangs, the Neon District being <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> Sasha and her Reaper Gang, the Warren District being <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> Alden and the Dust Men Gang, and the Historic District being <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> Kessler and the First Sons. The player can undertake a side mission in each sector, once certain main story requirements have been met, to free that sector from gang control, reducing or eliminating the presence of the gang in that sector. Other side missions may also unlock medical stations where Cole will re-awaken should he die. Though Cole must travel on foot he eventually gains powers that allow him to grind along power cables and powered, elevated train rails and to hover for a short time. Scattered around the city are hundreds of 'Blast Shards' which Cole can collect to increase the amount of electricity he can store. There are 32 'Dead Drop' satellite transmitters that help to reveal more of the back-story in the game, all being narrated by John White, or being recordings of Kessler and his experiments.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} showed stimulus <b>control</b> <b>by</b> {{either the}} absolute properties of probe stimuli, relational {{properties of the}} probe-list relationship, or both in a serial probe recognition memory task in which a four-item memory list {{was followed by a}} single probe (test) item. In Experiment 1, 3 rhesus monkeys received 39 to 75 repetitions of the same 24 -trial stimulus sequence. Special tests showed stimulus <b>control</b> <b>by</b> the absolute properties of the probe stimuli. Retention of previous relational <b>control</b> was demonstrated <b>by</b> the good transfer (83 %) to novel list and probe stimuli at the beginning of Experiment 2. During Experiment 2, <b>control</b> <b>by</b> absolute properties of the probe stimuli gradually reoccurred. Only a small measure of <b>control</b> <b>by</b> list stimuli could be detected or promoted. In Experiment 3, 4 monkeys were shown to have largely lost their ability to perform {{on the basis of the}} list-probe relationship, and were performing primarily on the basis of the absolute properties of the probe stimuli. Over the next 15 weeks, these monkeys were transferred to new stimuli at the beginning of each week. <b>Control</b> <b>by</b> the relational aspects of the task gradually returned. As transfer performance increased, <b>control</b> <b>by</b> the absolute properties of the probe stimuli was eliminated.
