5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, and one <b>can</b> <b>study</b> quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E

50|$|A {{plane is}} a flat, {{two-dimensional}} surface that extends infinitely far. Planes {{are used in}} every area of geometry. For instance, planes <b>can</b> be <b>studied</b> as a topological surface without reference to distances or angles; it <b>can</b> be <b>studied</b> as an affine space, where collinearity and ratios <b>can</b> be <b>studied</b> but not distances; it <b>can</b> be <b>studied</b> as the complex plane using techniques of complex analysis; and so on.|$|R

5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one <b>can</b> <b>study</b> on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they <b>can</b> <b>study.</b> While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E

5|$|Principal Skinner has put Bart in detention. While dusting a desk, {{he finds}} an Aramaic inscription. Lisa uses an app to {{translate}} it which transports the pair to Hell, {{which is a}} school. Bart excels {{in all of his}} diabolical subjects (including torture, destruction, and making sure that Major League Baseball rules ensure the unending dominance of the New York Yankees) and asks his parents if he <b>can</b> <b>study</b> there permanently. For his final test, he must torture Homer; despite Bart's hesitation, Homer lets him. A disfigured Homer proudly watches Bart graduate from Hell school as valedictorian.|$|E
5|$|The CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made {{friendly}} overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party {{relations with}} the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949). In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC <b>can</b> <b>study</b> them. For instance, the longevity of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party is attributed to the personalization {{of power in the}} al-Assad family, the strong presidential system, the inheritance of power, which passed from Hafez al-Assad to his son Bashar al-Assad, and the role given to the Syrian military in politics.|$|E
50|$|It {{can already}} be seen clearly that {{language}} is highly dualistic for Saussure. Indeed, he maintained that man thought essentially in dichotomies. For Saussure, the way language <b>can</b> be <b>studied</b> is dualistic too. It <b>can</b> be <b>studied</b> synchronically, i.e. {{as a complete}} system within a frozen moment of time, or it <b>can</b> be <b>studied</b> diachronically, which is the examination of its historical development. It {{can be said that}} structuralists focussed on the synchronic aspects of culture, while poststructuralists, as a reaction toward the highly dualistic and deterministic characteristics, focussed on the diachronic aspects of culture in an attempt to invoke a grey area.|$|R

5|$|Crew members Tom Paris, B'Elanna Torres, and Peter Durst {{have gone}} missing on a mission. They have been {{captured}} by the Vidiians. Vidiian Chief Surgeon Sulan has conducted a procedure on Torres, changing her from a half-human, half-Klingon hybrid into two bodies (a full-blooded Klingon and a full-blooded human). He infects Klingon Torres with the Phage, a deadly disease that afflicts his species but to which Klingons have a natural immunity, so he <b>can</b> <b>study</b> her genetics. Commander Chakotay, Security Chief Tuvok, and Ensign Harry Kim form a search party but are discovered by the Vidiians and beam back to USS Voyager. Sulan examines the Klingon Torres while she experiences pain from the Phage. Klingon Torres expresses pride in her Klingon identity, though she remembers hiding her Klingon heritage as a child. Recognizing Sulan's attraction to her, she tries to seduce the scientist and escape, but his desire {{to find a cure}} overcomes his lust. The human version of Torres is kept imprisoned with Paris and Durst. Human Torres is characterized as weaker and more timid than her Klingon counterpart, and is deemed too ill to work in the mines. She secretly works on a security console in the barracks in an attempt to contact Voyager but is caught.|$|E
