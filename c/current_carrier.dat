40|$|Abstract. The {{ground state}} energy of <b>current</b> <b>carriers</b> in {{graphene}} {{considered as a}} zerogap semiconductor was calculated in the two-band approximation. The condition of the electronic (hole) system stability in graphene was obtained. The possibility of the zero-gap semiconductor–semimetal transition was discussed. It is known that thin graphite films exhibit semimetallic properties [1]; however, a singleatomic layer of carbon atoms forming a regular hexagonal lattice (graphene) has such a band structure that the energy gap is zero at six K points of the Brillouin zone. Therefore, graphene {{can be considered as}} a two-dimensional zero-gap semiconductor or a semimetal with zero conduction and valence band overlap [2]. The former approach makes it possible to describe <b>current</b> <b>carriers</b> in graphene within the two-band Dirac model 2 [7, 8] uα · ̂pΨ = εpΨ, (1) 0 σ where α = are Dirac α-matrices, ̂p = −i� ∇ is the two-dimensional momentum σ 0 operator (hereafter � = 1), u = 3 2 γa 0 = 9. 84 · 107 cm/s is the quantity similar to the Kane matrix element of the interband transition rate, γ ≃ 3 eV is the band parameter, and a 0 = 1, 44 ˚A is the interatomic distance in the graphene lattice [9]. In the vicinity of K points of the Brillouin zone, the dispersion relation of <b>current</b> <b>carriers</b> is linear, εp = ±up (+ and − signs correspond to electrons and holes, respectively) ...|$|R

40|$|We present new {{experimental}} evidence that further confirms {{that a combination}} of electrochemical reactions and diffusion-convection (ERDC) mass transfer accounts for the potential oscillations that appear under conditions of transport limited current. A typical example is given for the reduction of Fe(CN) (6) (3 -) in alkaline Solution accompanying periodic hydrogen evolution. No potential oscillations occur by simply replacing the hydrogen evolution with 10 -reduction as the second <b>current</b> <b>carrier.</b> That replacement removes only the convection mass transfer induced by the hydrogen evolution. and retains the negative differential resistance (NDR) from the Frumkin repulsive effect. The key role of hydrogen evolution is thus to restore the Fe(CN) (6) (3 -) surface concentration after its depleting to zero by diffusion-limited reduction, rather than purely a second <b>current</b> <b>carrier.</b> Therefore, the other mechanism, which emphasizes the NDR from the Frumkin interaction due to electrostatic repulsion, is excluded because it does not have a direct connection with the oscillations. Moreover, a crossing cycle in cyclic voltammograms is a more convincible criterion for this category of electrochemical oscillators than the negative impedance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
