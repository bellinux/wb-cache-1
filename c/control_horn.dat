5000|$|The {{controls}} {{of a conventional}} 2-line/"U-Control" [...] system consist of lead-out cables, a bellcrank, push rods and control horns.

Also by convention, most airplanes are flown nominally counter-clockwise as viewed from above, with the leadout cables exiting the left wing. This is not universal and some pilots fly in the opposite direction. Flying clockwise has a slight advantage in some situations because most engines run so that the torque will roll the airplane away from the pilot, increasing line tension in upright level flight.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Measurements ofhistamine {{in control}} and IUCD-containing uterine horns of the rat in di-oestrus and L 4 of {{pregnancy}} showed that device-containing horns had a higher concentration and content per <b>horn</b> than did <b>control</b> <b>horns</b> at both times. In <b>control</b> <b>horns,</b> the histamine content on L 4 was about one-half of the value observed in di-oestrus, while in IUCD-containing horns the histamine content on L 4 {{was the same as}} the di-oestrous value. These data are interpreted in terms of a chronic inflammatory response in the IUCD-containing horn. The contraceptive action of a foreign body in the uterus is still only partially understood, but a number of changes are known to be brought about by an IUCD. The decidual cell reaction is inhibited in the rat uterine horn con¬ taining an IUCD (Doyle & Margolis, 1964) and it has been suggested (Shel¬ esnyak, 1966; Marcus, 1964) that this inhibition may be due to a depletion of the histamine available for stimulation of the decidual response. This paper presents measurements of histamine {{in control and}} IUCD-containing uterine horns of the rat. Female rats of the Holtzmann strain were used. L 0 designates the day spermatozoa were found in the vaginal smear. IUCDs, when present, con¬ sisted of about 1 cm of 3 - 0 surgical silk suture inserted with an atraumatic needle into one horn. Uterine histamine was extracted by the method of Code & Mclntyre (1956) and assayed on the guinea-pig ileum. For each measurement on whole uterine horns, five to eight horns were transected at the utero-tubal and utero-cervicaljunctions and pooled. In addition, some measurements were made on pools of anti-mesometrial tissue, obtained by cutting eight to twelve whole horns longitudinally with scissors into approximately two halves and using only the half opposite the mesometrium. In every case, the measurements on IUCD-containing horns were compared with the measurements on the <b>control</b> <b>horns</b> from the same animals. The anti-histamine, diphenhydramine (Benadryl), at a concentration of 10 " 6 g/ml, completely abolished the contractile response to large doses of the uterine extract.

40|$|Summary. This paper reports {{studies on}} the {{incorporation}} of [U- 14 C]-glucose into lipid, RNA and proteins of the rat uterus in the presence ofan IUD after treatment with oestrogen and progesterone and on Day 5 of pregnancy {{at the time of}} implantation. The results show that there is an increase in the incorporation of [U- 14 C]glucose into lipid, RNA and proteins in the IUD horn compared with that of the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> of ovariectomized and oestrogen-treated animals. The increase in weight of the IUD horn compared with the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> can be interpreted as due to an increased oestrogen-like response by the uterus in the presence of an IUD. This response may be caused by oestrogens, histamines or other amines. A significant decrease in the incorporation of [U- 14 C]glucose into lipid, RNA and proteins of the IUD horn compared with the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> was found on treatment of the animals with oestrogen+progester-one and progesterone alone for 6 hr. Treatment of the animals for 9 days with oestrogen+progesterone also significantly depressed the rate of protein synthesis in the IUD horn compared with the <b>control</b> <b>horn.</b> On Day 5 of pregnancy at the time of implantation, there was a statistically significant decrease in the incorporation of [U- 14 C]glucose into lipid, RNA and proteins of the IUD horn compared with the <b>control</b> <b>horn.</b> These experiments indicated an increased sensitivity of the uterus to progesterone in the presence of an IUD. The uterus shows an increased oestrogen-like response in the presence of an IUD. The increased sensitivity of the uterus to progesterone at the time of implantation produces asynchronous changes in the uterus and results in an anti-implantation effect of the IUD. The mode of action of an IUD in the light of these observations is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Summary. In mice of four genetically {{different}} strains, a silk suture {{was placed}} {{in one of the}} uterine horns while the remaining horn was left untreated. When the females were mated, no evidence of implanta-tion was found in the threaded horn. In the contralateral horn, implanta-tion occurred in only about 50 % of the mice and embryonic mortality was increased. In some females the uterine horns were scratched 3 days after sterile mating to evoke a decidual reaction. Deciduomata were inhibited completely in the threaded horn, and partially in the <b>control</b> <b>horn.</b> The four strains differed both in the proportion of females with im-plantations in the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> and in the degree of decidual growth inhibition. The effects of an IUD on implantation and on decidual reac-tion were correlated. When an IUD was removed after plug formation, but before the blastocysts entered the uterus, implantation occurred in both horns in about 40 % of the females. These results suggest that an IUD in mice may exert its effect on fertility by impairing the uterine sensitivity to mechanical stimuli at the time of implantation and that the extent of this action is genetically determined...|$|E
40|$|Summary. In rats {{provided}} with a surgically created anastomosis be-tween the two uterine horns and subsequently mated, implantation occurs with great regularity. Implantation sites were seen in twenty-six out of the thirty-two rats examined at laparotomy on Day 10 of pregnancy. In rats with such an anastomosis and unilaterally ovariectomized, implantation occurred in both uterine horns. There was evidence of implantation in nine out of twelve rats in the left uterine horn, even though the left ovary had been removed, indicating that the anastomosis was patent. Out of fifteen successfully mated rats with {{a connection between the}} two uterine horns and a silk suture in the lumen of the left uterine horn, only one rat showed evidence of implantation in the left uterine horn on Day 10 of pregnancy. There were no signs of implantation sites in the right horn in any animal in this series. The results demonstrated inhibition of implantation in the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> when an intra-uterine device was placed in the experimental horn in rats with an anastomosis between the two horns. This suggests that the presence of a device in one horn led to the liberation of a substance which passed to the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> through the surgically created anastomosis and there prevented implantation...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} from our laboratory demonstrated that Meishan conceptuses develop more slowly and synchronously to day 30 of gestation than conceptuses of U. S. pig breeds. Furthermore, the reduced {{size of the}} Meishan conceptus on day 30 allows more Meishan than Yorkshire conceptuses to occupy {{the same amount of}} limited uterine space. As a result, Meishan litter size is significantly larger than that of U. S. pig breeds (13 − 14 vs. 9 - 10 piglets/litter). An additional consistent, but unexpected, finding in the Meishan pig was the observation that there was significantly greater amounts of unoccupied uterine space in the Meishan than the Yorkshire female at term. We previously demonstrated that an additional strategy of the Meishan female to increase fecundity was to super-vascularize its placental membranes so that oxygen and nutrient transfer from the sow could be accomplished over a reduced surface area, negating the necessity of further placental growth. These data suggested that when a Meishan conceptus dies, the placenta of its neighbors need not grow into this newly vacated space, whereas the Yorkshire conceptus might increase the size of its less vascular placenta to use the opportunity. Therefore, it was our objective to confirm that Yorkshire conceptuses, but not Meishan conceptuses increase their placental size when adjacent conceptuses are experimentally destroyed on day 40 of gestation. To accomplish this objective, pregnant Meishan and Yorkshire females were laporatomized on day 40. One uterine horn was randomly chosen to be receive alternative fetal crushing (i. e., every other fetus in the horn was crushed by mechanical pressure), whereas the other uterine horn served as the <b>control</b> <b>horn.</b> At slaughter on day 111 of gestation (term = 114 days), we found no differences in fetal weight between the control and treated horns regardless of breed. Similarly, {{there was no difference in}} placental weight or surface area or implantation site length (the length of placental attachment in the uterine horn) between the control and treated horns in the Meishan. In contrast, however, there was a marked increase in placental weight and surface area, as well as implantation site length for conceptuses in the treated horn of the Yorkshire gilts versus the <b>control</b> <b>horn.</b> Furthermore, the unoccupied spaces between Meishan conceptuses in the treated horn were 2 -fold greater than for conceptuses in the <b>control</b> <b>horn,</b> whereas there were no differences in the length of unoccupied spaces between conceptuses in the Yorkshire’s control or treated horns. These data suggest that in the Meishan treated horn, conceptuses do not use this extra space as effectively as conceptuses in the Yorkshire treated horn. The inability of Meishan placenta to grow into adjacent unoccupied spaces may not be detrimental to conceptus survival due to its greater ability to increase vascular density in response to increasing fetal demands. If U. S. pig breeds have the potential to increase placental vascularity, rather than increase in placental size to nourish the growing fetuses, the potential exists for increasing litter size due to a decrease in uterine competition throughout gestation...|$|E

40|$|Background: The horn fly, Haematobia irritans, is an obligate bloodsucking {{ectoparasite}} of pastured {{cattle and}} is a major pest of livestock production in North and South America and Europe. In this study, we investigated the potential to use cattle pastures, infected with non-toxic, "friendly" fungal-endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb., as a strategy for reducing horn fly loads in cattle, and to evaluate the possible bioinsecticide effect on horn fly larvae. Results: When cattle grazed in E+ tall fescue, a decrease in fly-load was observed, compared with other pastures (endophyte-free (E-) pastures). The infestation of horn fly load decreased according {{to an increase in}} the percentage of endophyte present in the different pastures (0 to 100 %). Moreover, two groups of animals with significant differences in the fly-load (high and low fly-load) in the same herd were observed (P < 0. 05). Additionally, it was possible to determine a bioinsecticide effect of cattle dung, upon horn fly larvae (80 %), from animals fed E+ tall fescue. Conclusions: These results constitute the first report on the potential for exploiting pasture management for <b>controlling</b> 1) <b>horn</b> fly-loads on cattle and 2) the normal development of horn fly larvae.

40|$|This NebGuide {{identifies}} ways to <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> flies on cattle. The {{horn fly}} is a blood-feeder that feeds 20 to 30 times per day. A population {{of several thousand}} horn flies may be present on one animal. When large numbers of these flies are on cattle, the cattle bunch and expend considerable effort fighting the flies. They will often stand in water or seek shade trying to get relief from the flies. When they do this, they fail to graze normally. Studies in the United States and Canada show that during the grazing season yearling cattle free from horn flies gain from 15 to 50 pounds more than heavily infested animals. Nebraska studies and others show a 10 - to 15 -pound advantage in calf weaning weights where cows have had good horn fly control.

40|$|Regeneration of the uterine luminal {{epithelium}} was studied {{after its}} mechanical removal in progesterone-primed rats, leaving one <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> intact. Pulse labelling with [3 H]TdR during regeneration, showed a rapid peak of labelling index in remaining glands. A differentiated and highly labelled luminal epithelium reappeared at 34 hr, thereafter showing a rapidly declining LI. After initial depletion, the glandular cell population size was restored within 64 hr, whereas luminal epithelium cell numbers became stabilized at about half normal level. Grain counts after prelabelling showed more rapid dilution in gland cells of stripped uterine horns, indicating accelerated cycling of previously dividing cells. Thymidine labelling indices also show that, after {{removal of the}} epithelium, almost all gland cells became rapidly committed to divide. On average, less than two cell cycles were necessary to restore stable glandular and epithelial population sizes. Numbers of labelled cells were also drastically increased in myometrium and serosa of treated horns. This suggests a non-specific mechanism for stimulation of mitotic activity after ablation of epithelium. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Methoprene, {{an insect}} growth regulator, is being applied to many home and {{community}} pest control problems {{as a general}} use, slow-acting insecticide. This chemical {{can be used to}} control a number of pests, including fleas (PrecorTM), mosquitoes (AltosidTM), pharaoh ants, leaf miners and hoppers, and cucmber beetles. It is also used as an insect control in food production and agriculture (U. S. EPA 1991).

Mode of Action This chemical is an analog to a unique insect-growth regulating hormone, which does not ressemble any known mammalian hormones. Use requires careful attention to timing and patience. Applied at very low rates, while insect populations are still in the egg or larval stage of their life cycle, methoprene prevents development to the adult reproductive stages so that insects die in arrested immaturity.

The incidence of fetal malformation was greater in ischaemic than in <b>control</b> <b>horns</b> although specific treatment effects were not apparent. Fetal weights were reduced in the ischaemic horns, especially at the higher abdominal temperatures. These findings show that abdominal temperature can influence the effects of ischaemia and suggest that the embryo is less resistant to uterine ischaemia than was previously thought...|$|R

40|$|A chronic {{infiltration}} of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was invariably {{found in the}} infertile regions of uteri containing foreign bodies in conventional rats, germfree rats, mice, and rabbits. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were never found in the fertile regions of these uteri.

As judged by measurements of lysozyme in the uterine lumens of rats and rabbits, polymorphonuclear leukocytes released their contents into solution in the uterine lumen.

40|$|Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) is {{considered}} important for blastocyst spacing, implantation, and decidualization in rodent uteri. PGE synthase (PGES) catalyzes the isomerization of PGH(2) to PGE(2). Two isoforms of PGES exist: microsomal PGES (mPGES) and cytosolic PGES (cPGES); however, the expression and regulation of cPGES in the mammalian uterus during early pregnancy are still unknown. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the differential expression of cPGES in mouse uterus during early pregnancy and its regulation under different conditions using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. A strong level of cPGES mRNA signal was exhibited in the stromal cells at the implantation site on Day 5 of pregnancy, whereas cPGES immunostaining was strongly detected in the luminal epithelium. The signals for both cPGES mRNA and immunostaining were strongly detected in the decidualized cells from Days 6 - 8 of pregnancy. A basal level of cPGES mRNA signal and immunostaining was exhibited in the uterus in delayed implantation. After delayed implantation was terminated by estrogen treatment and embryo implantation was initiated, cPGES mRNA signal was strongly detected in the stroma underlying the luminal epithelium at the implantation site, and cPGES immunostaining was strongly observed in the luminal epithelium surrounding the implanting blastocyst. A strong cPGES mRNA signal and immunostaining were detected in decidualized cells under artificial decidualization, whereas only a basal level of cPGES mRNA signal and immunostaining were observed in the <b>control</b> <b>horn.</b> Our data suggest that cPGES may play an important role during implantation and decidualization...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies in}} the rat showed that intrauterine {{instillation}} {{of a variety of}} chemical agents produces significant morphological changes which may prove to be of functional significance in human fertility control. Epithelial tissue was gradually replaced by fibrous and granulomatous tissue, resulting in a gross obstruction of the uterine cavity. This obstructive lesion was related to the loss of fertility in the treated horn, since implantations on the <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> were normal. Some of these agents, such as cadmium and thio-TEPA, did not produce morphological changes, but prevented blastocyst implantation in the presence of ovulation for prolonged periods of time (1). One of these compounds, quinacrine, shows a good potential for human use and has therefore been studied in detail. A suspension of 25 quinacrine in distilled water produced only slight functional changes when locally applied to the uterine lumen of one horn; 50 produced intense functional alterations that were manifested by a refractory response of the endometrium to blastocyst implantation that was normalized two months after instillation; produced obstructive morphological changes in the uterine lumen that lasted for a period of three months, after which morphological and functional normality was reestablished; and 200 produced apparently irreversible changes in uterine structure in animals that were followed for periods of more than four months. It was also demonstrated that a single injection of estradiol benzoate or 500 progesterone prevented the obstruction induced by quinacrine instillation or accelerated the process of recovery if the obstruction was already present (2) ...|$|E
