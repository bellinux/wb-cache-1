These points are known as the break points and should be clearly described on the study sheet. Elements should be as short as can be conveniently timed by the observer. As far as possible, elements - particularly manual ones - should be chosen so that they represent naturally unified and distinct segments of the operation.|$|E

50|$|Network {{survivability}} {{enables the}} network to maintain maximum network connectivity {{and quality of}} service under failure conditions. It {{has been one of}} the <b>critical</b> <b>requirements</b> in network planning and design. It involves design requirements on topology, protocol, bandwidth allocation, etc.. Topology requirement can be maintaining a minimum two-connected network against any failure of a single link or node. Protocol requirements include using dynamic routing protocol to reroute traffic against network dynamics during the transition of network dimensioning or equipment failures. Bandwidth allocation requirements pro-actively allocate extra bandwidth to avoid traffic loss under failure conditions. This topic has been actively studied in conferences, such as the International Workshop on Design of Reliable Communication Networks.|$|E
5000|$|One of the <b>critical</b> <b>requirements</b> in soft {{ballistic}} {{testing is}} measurement of [...] "back side signature" [...] (i.e. energy delivered to tissue by a non-penetrating projectile) in a deformable backing material placed behind the targeted vest. The majority {{of military and}} law enforcement standards have settled on an oil/clay mixture for the backing material, known as Roma Plastilena. [...] Although harder and less deformable than human tissue, Roma represents a “worst case” backing material when plastic deformations in the oil/clay are low (less than 20 mm). (Armor placed over a harder surface is more easily penetrated.) The oil/clay mixture of [...] "Roma" [...] is roughly twice the density of human tissue and therefore does not match its specific gravity, however [...] "Roma" [...] is a plastic material that will not recover its shape elastically, which is important for accurately measuring potential trauma through back side signature.|$|E
50|$|The {{edition of}} the Capitularies made in 1835 by Georg Pertz, in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica (folio edition, vol. I, of the Leges) was not much of an advance on that of Baluze. A fresh {{revision}} was required, and {{the editors of the}} Monumenta decided to reissue it in their quarto series, entrusting the work to Dr. Alfred Boretius. In 1883 Boretius published his first volume, containing all the detached capitularies up to 827, together with various appendices bearing on them, and the collection. of Ansegisus. Boretius, whose health had been ruined by overwork, was unable to finish his work; it was continued by Victor Krause, who collected in vol. II the scattered capitularies of a date posterior to 828. Karl Zeumer and Albrecht Werminghoff drew up a detailed index of both volumes, in which all the essential words are noted. A third volume, prepared by Emil Seckel, was to include the collection of Benedictus Levita. To satisfy modern <b>critical</b> <b>requirements</b> so a new edition has been commissioned by the Monumenta Germaniae Historica to Hubert Mordek and to Klaus Zechiel-Eckes; the {{edition of the}} Collectio Ansegisi is superseded by the one published in the Capitularia Nova Series vol. 1 (ed.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. NRL/MR/ 5542 [...] 95 - 7768 The External COMSEC Adaptor (ECA) is a device {{responsible for providing}} cryptographic protection of information based on rules that (possibly coarsely) define the sensitivity of that information. The ECA is trusted to satisfy a set of <b>critical</b> <b>requirements</b> that support data confidentiality in the network {{in which it is}} embedded. Ensuring that the ECA is worthy of this trust requires defining its <b>critical</b> <b>requirements</b> precisely and constructing a strong argument that its implementation satisfies these requirements. This paper describes a software engineering methodology that uses formal methods for specifying and verifying the most <b>critical</b> <b>requirements</b> of the ECA and uses testing and simulation for verifying the overall functional requirements of the ECA. The methodology integrates the formal specifications and proofs with structured software documentation to clarify the relationship between the refinement of ECA functionality and the argument that the ECA meets its <b>critical</b> <b>requirements.</b> This methodology was used successfully to build the ECA using the KG 84 A to satisfy its cryptographic requirements. - ii...|$|E
