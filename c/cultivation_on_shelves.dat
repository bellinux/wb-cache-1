A alface minimamente processada foi embalada em sacos de polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD), armazenada em refrigerador a 4 ºC e avaliada até o final da vida-de-prateleira, estabelecida por métodos sensoriais. As avaliações foram realizadas durante a estocagem, nas condições pré-estabelecidas. Nos tempos zero a dez dias, uma equipe sensorial treinada avaliou a alface quanto a: cor, brilho, escurecimento enzimático, aroma, odor estranho, textura e sabor (escores de zero a dez). O teste sensorial determinou que o escore seis (6) eliminaria a amostra; a alface orgânica, atingiu o escore mínimo em tempo superior ao da alface convencional, tendo sido sensivelmente superior a esta em todos os atributos testados. Iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa) {{obtained by}} conventional and organic cultivation systems and minimally processed was evaluated {{for the effect}} of different <b>cultivation</b> systems <b>on</b> <b>shelf</b> life. The minimally processed lettuce was packed in low-density polyethylene bags, stored in refrigerator at 4 ºC and evaluated {{until the end of}} shelf life period established by a sensorial team. The evaluation was performed during the storage period under pre-determined conditions. At days zero and ten, a skilled sensorial team evaluated the lettuce for: color, brightness, enzymatic darkening, flavor, off flavor, texture and smell (scores 0 - 10). The sensorial team determined that score six (6) would eliminate the sample; the organic lettuce took longer to reach the minimum score compared to the conventional lettuce and proved substantially superior to the latter regarding all the attributes tested...|$|R

The fertility was defined in vitro as the capacity of pollen for germinating. The average capacity of pollen germination ranged in the studied clones from 10 to 15 %. These clones displayed the highest pollen fertility in an autumn cultivation, comparing to a spring-summer one. Higher rate of pollen fertility was observed during a spring-summer <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> first trusses in most of the clones studied.

30|$|The {{cellobiose}} lipid of Cryptococcus humicola, 16 -(tetra-O-acetyl-β-cellobiosyloxy)- 2 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, is {{a natural}} fungicide. Sensitivity of the cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the fungicide depends on a carbon source. Cellobiose lipid concentrations inducing the leakage of potassium ions and ATP were similar for the cells grown in the medium with glucose and ethanol. However, the cells grown on glucose and ethanol died at 0.05 mg ml- 1 and 0.2 mg ml- 1 cellobiose lipid, respectively. Inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) synthesis was 65 % of the control with 0.05 mg ml- 1 cellobiose lipid during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> ethanol. PolyP synthesis was not observed during the <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> glucose at the same cellobiose lipid concentration. The content of longer-chain polyP was higher during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> ethanol. We speculate the long-chained polyP participate in the viability restoring of ethanol-grown cells after treatment with the cellobiose lipid.|$|R
