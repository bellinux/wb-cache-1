30|$|In this study, the MIT {{definition}} is adopted {{with the only}} difference that geopressured and magmatic systems and also co-produced hot water from hydrocarbon wells are excluded. The reasons for this particular choice are that the MIT report was (and still is) regarded as a milestone report towards the development of EGS; also, from an engineering point of view, it is {{perhaps one of the}} most comprehensive definitions. On the other hand, it does not enter into the details of the different stimulation approaches and associated consequences for different EGS systems.

40|$|Background. Lens crystallines {{are special}} {{proteins}} {{in the eye}} lens. Because the epithelial basement membrane (lens capsule) completely encloses the lens, desquamation of aging cells is impossible, and due to the complete absence of blood vessels or transport of metabolites in this area, there is no subsequent remodelling of these fibers, nor removal of degraded lens fibers. Human tissue ultimately derives its 14 C content from the atmospheric carbon dioxide. The 14 C content of the lens proteins thus reflects the atmospheric content of 14 C when the lens crystallines were formed. Precise radiocarbon dating is made possible by comparing the 14 C content of the lens crystallines to the so-called bomb pulse, i. e. a plot of the atmospheric 14 C content since the Second World War, {{when there was a}} significant increase due to nuclear-bomb testing. Since the change in concentration is significant even on a yearly basis this allows very accurate dating. Methodology/Principal Findings. Our results allow us to conclude that the <b>crystalline</b> <b>formation</b> in the lens nucleus almost entirely takes place around the time of birth, with a very small, and decreasing, continuous formation throughout life.

Such a lifelong permanence of human tissue has hitherto only been described for dental enamel.

The processes of DTA for all samples are characterised by a low-pitched endo-effect, when gradual mullite formation and noticeable densification at temperatures of 1200 – 1400 °C is started. It is testified by shrinkage and density both for traditionally and by SPS-sintered samples. The influence of the Si 3 N 4 additive on the density characteristics is insignificant for both sintering cases. For SPS samples, the density reaches up to 3. 33 g/cm 3, while for traditionally sintered samples, the value is 2. 55 g/cm 3, and the compressive strength for SPS grows with Si 3 N 4 additives, reaching 600 N/mm 2. In the case of traditional sintering, it decreases to approximately 100 N/mm 2. The basic microstructure of ceramic samples sintered in a traditional way and by SPS is created from mullite (or pseudo-mullite) <b>crystalline</b> <b>formations</b> with the incorporation of ZrO 2 grains. The microstructure of ceramic samples sintered by SPS shows that mullite crystals are very densely arranged and do not have the characteristic prismatic shape.
