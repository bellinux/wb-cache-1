5000|$|Much {{changed with}} the {{introduction}} of the Impy line in 1966. Bright new packaging was introduced while the older, larger, Road-Master series was discontinued (though the name [...] "Roadmaster" [...] was still used). The new cars were a smaller three and a half inch size, similar to Mini-Dinkys, and were advertised as the [...] "cars with everything" [...] (Rixon 2005, p. 39). For example, the 1963 Chrysler Imperial was not offered by any other diecast maker and featured opening doors, hood, trunk, working steering and jewelled headlights (Ragan 2000, p. 35). The Impy Jaguar Mark X outshone the spartan Matchbox version with four jewelled headlights and opening 'everything' (Ragan 2000, pp. 48-51). Having so many features on a smaller diecast car could be unsightly, however, as cut door lines broke the smooth sides of the car on the Imperial, and other vehicles. On the FIAT 2300S Ghia coupe the cast line was rough and uneven from fender through door to fender again (Ragan 2000, pp. 25, 48).It is interesting that Lone Star was the first toy producer to respond to Hot Wheels' hit of low-friction wheels (Rixon 2005, p. 10). In 1968, {{less than a year after}} the introduction of Hot Wheels, Impys were refitted with sporty fast wheels which Lone Star now called its [...] "Flyer" [...] series. The first Flyers' wheels were simple shiny silver wheels with black hubs, rather reminiscent of Corgi's first low-friction gold wheels with red hubs. Eventually cars were given a handsome five-spoke wheel (Rixon 2005, p. 54). By contrast, Topper's Johnny Lightning and Aurora's Cigarbox cars did not <b>change</b> <b>wheel</b> styles until about 1969, nearly two years after Mattel's premier. Similar to Majorette and others, Lone Star also offered gift sets of cars with trailers into the early 1980s, like the Range Rover pulling a zodiac-style inflatable boat (Rixon 2005, p. 115).|$|E

Due to its association with polypharmacy, the development of interventions to optimise medication management in patients with multimorbidity is a priority. The Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> is a new approach for applying behavioural theory to intervention development.

The health check (intervention) is a touchscreen questionnaire delivered by trained lay advisors that aims {{to raise awareness of}} cancer symptoms and risk factors, and encourage timely help seeking. Purpose: Apply Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> to intervention refinement by identifying barriers and facilitators to timely symptom presentation among people living in socioeconomically deprived communities. Methods: Primary data (six focus groups with health professionals, community partners and public) and secondary data (systematic review of barriers and facilitators to cancer symptom presentation) were mapped iteratively to the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel.</b> Results: Barriers and facilitators were identified from the systematic review and focus groups comprising 14 members of the public aged over 40, 14 community partners and 14 healthcare professionals. Barriers included poor symptom knowledge and lack of motivation to engage in preventive or proactive behaviours. Facilitators included cues/prompts to action, general practitioner preparedness to listen, and social networks. The following behaviour change techniques were selected to address identified barriers and facilitators: information about health consequences, prompts/cues, credible sources, restricting physical and social environment, social support, goal setting and action planning. Conclusions: The Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> triangulated findings from primary and secondary data sources. An intervention combining education and enablement could encourage timely symptom presentation to primary care among people living in socioeconomically deprived communities. Social encouragement and support is needed to increase symptom knowledge, challenge negative cancer beliefs, and prompt decisions to engage with the healthcare system...|$|E
40|$|Background Children spend a {{large amount}} of their time in {{obligatory}} seated school lessons, with notable effects on health and cognitive outcomes. A common issue reported by teachers is a lack of time to incorporate physical activity into the school day alongside academic pressures. As such, emerging research is attempting to convert educational time from sedentary to active via physically active lessons. However this existing research does not utilise Behaviour Change concepts, making comparability and replicability difficult (Norris, Shelton, Dunsmuir, Duke-Williams, & Stamatakis, 2015 a). The Virtual Traveller programme is the first to test Virtual Field Trips (VFTs) as physically active lessons. These utilise existing classroom interactive whiteboards to integrate globe-based educational content with related physical movements. Aim(s) This research aimed to develop a 6 -week ‘Virtual Traveller’ intervention based around the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> and Behaviour Change Techniques Method / Results Three sources of data were used to inform the intervention development process: the existing research literature on school-based physical activity interventions, teacher interviews (N= 12) and pupil focus groups (N= 18) and an experimental feasibility study (N= 85; Norris, Shelton, Dunsmuir, Duke-Williams, & Stamatakis, 2015 b). The Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> was used as a framework to guide synthesis of evidence into the resulting intervention. Potential appropriate Behaviour Change Techniques were reviewed and embedded within the intervention. Conclusions The resulting 6 -week Virtual Traveller programme with a 3 -month follow-up period is currently in its final stages of evaluation in ten Greater London primary schools.

40|$|Background: Despite best {{evidence}} demonstrating {{the effectiveness of}} increased intensity of exercise after stroke, current levels of therapy continue to be below those required to optimise motor recovery. We developed and tested an implementation intervention that aims to increase arm exercise in stroke rehabilitation. The {{aim of this study}} was to illustrate the use of a behaviour change framework, the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel,</b> to identify the mechanisms of action that explain how the intervention produced change. Methods: We implemented the intervention at three stroke rehabilitation units in the United Kingdom. A purposive sample of therapy team members were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews to explore their perceptions of how the intervention produced change at their work place. Audio recordings were transcribed and imported into NVivo 10 for content analysis. Two coders separately analysed the transcripts and coded emergent mechanisms. Mechanisms were categorised using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) (an extension of the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour model (COM-B) at the hub of the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel).</b> Results: We identified five main mechanisms of action: ‘social/professional role and identity’, ‘intentions’, ‘reinforcement’, ‘behavioural regulation’ and ‘beliefs about consequences’. At the outset, participants viewed the research team as an external influence for whom they endeavoured to complete the study activities. The study design, with a focus on implementation in real world settings, influenced participants’ intentions to implement the intervention components. Monthly meetings between the research and therapy teams were central to the intervention and acted as prompt or reminder to sustain implementation. The phased approach to introducing and implementing intervention components influenced participants’ beliefs about the feasibility of implementation. Conclusions: The Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel,</b> and in particular the Theoretical Domains Framework, were used to investigate mechanisms of action of an implementation intervention. This approach allowed for consideration of a range of possible mechanisms, and allowed us to categorise these mechanisms using an established behaviour change framework. Identification of the mechanisms of action, following testing of the intervention in a number of settings, has resulted in a refined and more robust intervention programme theory for future testing...|$|E

As a result, these patients {{are more vulnerable}} to potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP). PIP in older patients may result in adverse drug events and hospitalisations. However, little {{has been done to}} identify why PIP occurs. The objectives of this study were; (1) to identify hospital doctors' perceptions as to why PIP occurs, (2) to identify the barriers to addressing the issues identified, and (3) to determine which intervention types would be best suited to improving prescribing. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), a tool used to apply behaviour change theories, were conducted with 22 hospital doctors. Content analysis was conducted to identify domains of the TDF that could be targeted to improve prescribing for older people. These domains were then mapped to the behaviour <b>change</b> <b>wheel</b> to identify possible intervention types. RESULTS: Content analysis identified 5 of the 12 domains in the TDF as relevant; (1) environmental context and resources, (2) knowledge, (3) skills, (4) social influences and (5) memory/attention and decision processes. Using the behaviour <b>change</b> <b>wheel,</b> the types of interventions deemed suitable were those based on training and environmental restructuring.

40|$|Interventions {{to improve}} {{implementation}} of evidence-based health care have achieved modest and variable success. Improving implementation depends on chan-ging the behaviour of health professionals, managers, commissioners and others working within {{and with the}} health care system. Achieving and maintaining beha-viour change within the ethical and practical constraints that typically operate remains a formidable challenge. Meeting it requires: 1. a systematic method for analyzing the target beha-viours in their context {{as a starting point for}} designing an intervention, 2. selecting interventions that are most likely to be effective given this analysis, 3. specifying the intervention in sufficient detail in trial protocols and published reports to allow accurate replication and evidence syntheses, and 4. drawing on relevant theory to guide both the inter-vention design and evaluation. This approach can generate evidence about the mechan-isms of action of effective interventions and about why interventions vary across different types of behaviour and in different populations and settings. Such evidence is essential for designing more effective interventions. The most effective interventions for both initiating and main-taining behaviour change are those that act simultaneously at many different ‘levels’. A framework for analyzing target behaviours in context and considering the full range of intervention functions and policy categories that may be relevant to the intervention problem is the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> [1, 2]. This was derived from a systematic review of 19 published frameworks, none of which were found to contain all the intervention functions know to be relevant.

40|$|Background: Delayed {{antibiotic}} prescribing reduces antibiotic use for acute respiratory {{infections in}} trials in general practice, but the uptake in clinical practice is low. The {{aim of the}} study was to identify facilitators and barriers to general practitioners' (GPs') use of delayed prescribing and to gain pharmacists' and the public's views about delayed prescribing in Australia. Methods: This study used the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> to explore facilitators and barriers to delayed prescribing in Australia. Forty-three semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with general practitioners, pharmacists and patients were conducted. Responses were coded into domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework, and specific criteria from the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> were used to identify which domains were relevant to increasing the use of delayed prescribing by GPs. Results: The interviews revealed nine key domains that influence GPs' use of delayed prescribing: knowledge; cognitive and interpersonal skills; memory, attention and decision-making processes; optimism; beliefs about consequences; intentions; goals; emotion; and social influences: GPs knew about delayed prescribing; however, they did not use it consistently, preferring to bring patients back for review and only using it with patients in a highly selective way. Pharmacists would support GPs and the public in delayed prescribing but would fill the prescription if people insisted. The public said they would delay taking their antibiotics if asked by their GP and given the right information on managing symptoms and when to take antibiotics. Conclusions: Using a theory-driven approach, we identified nine key domains that influence GPs' willingness to provide a delayed prescription to patients with an acute respiratory infection presenting to general practice. These data can be used to develop a structured intervention to change this behaviour and thus reduce antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections in general practice...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness (e. g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) die 10 – 25  years {{earlier than the}} general population, {{primarily}} from premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Contributing factors are complex, but include systemic-related factors of poorly integrated primary care and mental health services. Although evidence-based models exist for integrating mental health care into primary care settings, the evidence base for integrating medical care into specialty mental health settings is limited. Such models {{are referred to as}} “reverse” integration. In this paper, we describe the application of an implementation science framework in designing a model to improve CVD outcomes for individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) who receive services in a community mental health setting. Methods Using principles from the theory of planned behavior, focus groups were conducted to understand stakeholder perspectives of barriers to CVD risk factor screening and treatment identify potential target behaviors. We then applied results to the overarching Behavior <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> framework, a systematic and theory-driven approach that incorporates the COM-B model (capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior), to build an intervention to improve CVD risk factor screening and treatment for people with SMI. Results Following a stepped approach from the Behavior <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> framework, a model to deliver primary preventive care for people that use community mental health settings as their de facto health home was developed. The CRANIUM (cardiometabolic risk assessment and treatment through a novel integration model for underserved populations with mental illness) model focuses on engaging community psychiatrists to expand their scope of practice to become responsible for CVD risk, with significant clinical decision support. Conclusion The CRANIUM model was designed by integrating behavioral change theory and implementation theory. CRANIUM is feasible to implement, is highly acceptable to, and targets provider behavior change, and is replicable and efficient for helping to integrate primary preventive care services in community mental health settings. CRANIUM can be scaled up to increase CVD preventive care delivery and ultimately improve health outcomes among people with SMI served within a public mental health care system...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dental caries is {{the most}} common chronic disease of adult and childhood, a largely {{preventable}} yet widespread, costly public health problem. This study identified patient-, organization-, and system-level factors influencing routine delivery of recommended care for prevention and management of caries in primary dental care. Methods: A convergent mixed-methods design assessed six guidance-recommended behaviours to prevent and manage caries (recording risk, risk-based recall intervals, applying fluoride varnish, placing preventive fissure sealants, demonstrating oral health maintenance, taking dental x-rays). A diagnostic questionnaire assessing current practice, beliefs, and practice characteristics was sent to a random sample of 651 dentists in National Health Service (NHS) Scotland. Eight in-depth case studies comprising observation of routine dental visits and dental team member interviews were conducted. Patient feedback was collected from adult patients with recent checkups at case study practices. Key informant interviews were conducted with decision makers in policy, funding, education, and regulation. The Theoretical Domains Framework within the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> was used to identify and describe patient-, organization-, and system-level barriers and facilitators to care. Findings were merged into a matrix describing theoretical domains salient to each behaviour. The matrix and Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> were used to prioritize behaviours for change and plan relevant intervention strategies. Results: Theoretical domains associated with best practice were identified from the questionnaire (N- 196), case studies (N[*]=[*] 8 practices, 29 interviews), and patient feedback (N[*]=[*] 19). Using the study matrix, key stakeholders identified priority behaviours (use of preventive fissure sealants among 6 – 12 -year-olds) and strategies (audit and feedback, patient informational campaign) to improve guidance implementation. Proposed strategies were assessed as appropriate for immediate implementation and suitable for development with remaining behaviours. Conclusions: Specific, theoretically based, testable interventions to improve caries prevention and management were coproduced by patient-, practice-, and policy-level stakeholders. Findings emphasize duality of behavioural determinants as barriers and facilitators, patient influence on preventive care delivery, and benefits of integrating multi-level interests when planning interventions in a dynamic, resource-constrained environment. Interventions identified in this study are actively being used to support ongoing implementation initiatives including guidance, professional development, and oral health promotion...|$|E
40|$|Background Two {{thirds of}} {{survivors}} will achieve independent ambulation after a stroke, {{but less than}} half will recover upper limb function. There is strong evidence to support intensive repetitive task-oriented training for recovery after stroke. The number of repetitions needed is suggested {{to be in the}} order of hundreds, but this is not currently being achieved in clinical practice. In an effort to bridge this evidence-practice gap, we have developed a behaviour change intervention that aims to increase provision of upper limb repetitive task-oriented training in stroke rehabilitation. This paper aims to describe the systematic processes that took place in collaboratively developing the behaviour change intervention. Methods The methods used in this study were not defined a priori but were guided by the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel.</b> The process was collaborative and iterative with four stages of development emerging (i) establishing an intervention development group; (ii) structured discussions to understand the problem, prioritise target behaviours and analyse target behaviours; (iii) collaborative design of theoretically underpinned intervention components and (iv) piloting and refining of intervention components. Results The intervention development group consisted of the research team and stroke therapy team at a local stroke rehabilitation unit. The group prioritised four target behaviours at the therapist level: (i) identifying suitable patients for exercises, (ii) provision of exercises, (iii) communicating exercises to family/visitors and (iv) monitoring and reviewing exercises. It also provides a method for self-monitoring performance in order to measure fidelity. The developed intervention, PRACTISE (Promoting Recovery of the Arm: Clinical Tools for Intensive Stroke Exercise), consists of team meetings and the PRACTISE Toolkit (screening tool and upper limb exercise plan, PRACTISE exercise pack and an audit tool). Conclusions This paper provides an example of how the Behaviour <b>Change</b> <b>Wheel</b> may be applied in the collaborative development of a behaviour change intervention for health professionals. The process involved was resource-intensive, and the iterative process was difficult to capture. The use of a published behaviour change framework and taxonomy will assist replication in future research and clinical use.
