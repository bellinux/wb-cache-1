40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the geometry selection of a redundantly actuated cable-suspended parallel robot intended to manipulate heavy payloads over a wide workspace. Cable-suspended refers here to cable-driven parallel robots in a crane-like setting, where all the <b>cable</b> <b>drawing</b> points are located on top of the base frame, gravity being used to keep the cables taut. Geometry selection consists of determining the relative positions of the <b>cable</b> <b>drawing</b> points on the base frame and of the cable attachment points on the mobile platform together with the cable arrangement between these two sets of points. An original performance index is introduced. It is defined as the maximum acceptable distance between the mobile platform geometric center and the center of mass of the set consisting of the platform and a payload. This performance index is of particular interest in heavy payload handling applications. Used within a two-phase geometry selection strategy, it yields a new cable-suspended robot geometry having a very large workspace to footprint ratio and able to handle heavy payloads. A large-dimension redundantly actuated cable-suspended robot was built in order to demonstrate these capabilities...|$|E

40|$|The project {{addressed}} {{the need of}} {{the oil and gas}} industry for real-time information about the drilling process and the formations being drilled. An ideal system would allow measuring while drilling (MWD) and would transmit data to the surface immediately at a rate high enough to support video or televiewer systems. A proposed solution was to use an optical fiber as a link between the surface and the instrumentation package. We explored the use of a disposable MWD telemetry <b>cable,</b> <b>drawing</b> on the technology developed for missile guidance which deploys miles of fiber from a small spool at missile speeds approaching half the speed of sound. Emphasis In was on the questions of survivability of the unarmored fiber in the drill string environment and deployability. Laboratory and field testing showed the concept worked under realistic conditions; a field demonstration transmitted data at 10 kilobits per second from a depth of 3500 feet...|$|E

40|$|In today’s {{industry}} it {{is starting}} to {{get more and more}} interesting with wireless systems and solutions for applications. To be able {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>cables</b> <b>drawn</b> to various machines which takes both space and an extra fee for every <b>cable</b> <b>drawn.</b> Some systems might require the user to use a handheld device that is directly connected by a cable which in some machines might be inelegant for the user. The goal with this bachelor thesis is to develop wireless monitoring of the machine operators position that is working with heavy industrial machinery. The thesis started out with researching different techniques for positioning a transmitter indoors, this was done in order to get a better understanding on how to go about. The technique that was chosen is positioning a transmitter by checking where the peak in signal strength is at its highest, this is done by rotating a parabolic reflector around the receiver’s antenna. The result is a solution to monitor the position of an operator at a rolling machine. The solutions function is to check at which angle the operator is currently positioned. By comparing this angle to the angles that is considered to be inside a dangerous zone, the system can determine if the operator is inside of that zone or not. ...|$|R

40|$|Four {{types of}} <b>cable</b> <b>drawn</b> farming systems, a single engine system, a double engine system, a {{perimeter}} system, and a double implement system, were analyzed {{to determine which}} was best suited for Arizona. The systems were compared in terms of relative cost, reliability/simplicity and field capacity. Field capacity computation variables were implement width, implement speed, tower travel speed, implement carrier travel speed, and implement rotation time. The analysis showed the single engine system was the least expensive, simplest system with a field capacity identical {{to that of the}} double engine system, eight percent lower than the double implement system, and approximately thirteen percent higher than the perimeter system. Based on these results, the single implement system was judged superior to the others. The parameters affecting single implement system performance were then examined to optimize performance. The evaluation yielded a recommendation that the system be designed to have a tower speed of 48 ft/min, and a rotation time of 7. 5 seconds. A positioning system for the mobile truss of a <b>cable</b> <b>drawn</b> farming system was also developed and tested. The system used a linear move irrigation system's above ground cable guidance system for steering, a wicket positioning system for stopping the machine at the indexing locations, and a wire-alignment system to control inner tower alignment. The system was tested over a length of 280 ft using a five tower, 575 ft long, linear move irrigation system. It was found that the above ground cable guidance system provided ± 0. 5 ft steering accuracy, the wicket positioning system controlled the power unit and end tower position within ± 0. 2 ft of the target destination, and that the wire alignment system controlled inner tower position within ± 0. 3 ft of the target destination. Statistical analysis of the test results showed the probability of position error being controlled to within ± 0. 4 ft and ± 0. 8 ft to be at the 99. 7 % and 99. 99 % confidence levels, respectively...|$|R

50|$|Originally {{constructed}} {{of wood and}} since 1967 {{constructed of}} steel, the barge-like vessel features the controllman's room to one side, with the diesel engine sitting aside the control room. As a powered cable ferry, the vessel is guided by a steel <b>cable</b> <b>drawn</b> across the river, secured on each shore by steel anchors. The cable is lowered into the river when the ferry is not operational and is stretched across the river during hours of operation. There is sufficient clearance for small boats to pass under the cable, but it is lowered when barges pass, though barge traffic on the Cape Fear river in this section ceased in the 1990s. The ferry {{is powered by a}} diesel engine and a propeller. Stopping is controlled by the operator's throttle. As the ferry cannot turn around, each end includes a ramp, and alignment of the ferry at each end is automatic.|$|R

50|$|The Tame Valley {{generating}} station {{consisted of three}} Yates and Thom, 815hp, vertical triple expansion steam engines. Each engine driving a Dick, Kerr & Co. 500kW, 60 pole alternator at 80rpm, giving a three-phase output of 6,000V at 40Hz. The station's six Lancashire boilers were supplied by Tinker, Shenton & Co, of Hyde. Most of the electrical switchgear was supplied by Witting, Eborall & Co. Power from the station was distributed at 6,000V via specially made three core <b>cables</b> <b>drawn</b> through glazed earthenware underground conduits. Each of the four SHMD towns had its own substation consisting of two sychronous motor generators, each rated at 200kW, converting the 6,000V three-phase input into an output of 525V dc to feed the overhead tram wires and 460V (±230V) three-wire dc for lighting circuits. The Tame Valley {{generating station}} remained in use until 1932, after which the building {{was used as a}} workshop and stores.

60|$|It was a {{much larger}} cavern than we had {{supposed}} from our first glimpse of it, and we {{looked up from the}} lowest portion of its sloping floor. It widened out as it receded from us, and its roof came down and hid the remoter portion altogether. And lying in a line along its length, vanishing at last far away in that tremendous perspective, were a number of huge shapes, huge pallid hulls, upon which the Selenites were busy. At first they seemed big white cylinders of vague import. Then I noted the heads upon them lying towards us, eyeless and skinless like the heads of sheep at a butcher's, and perceived they were the carcasses of mooncalves being cut up, much as the crew of a whaler might cut up a moored whale. They were cutting off the flesh in strips, and on some of the farther trunks the white ribs were showing. It was the sound of their hatchets that made that chid, chid, chid. Some way away a thing like a trolley <b>cable,</b> <b>drawn</b> and loaded with chunks of lax meat, was running up the slope of the cavern floor. This enormous long avenue of hulls that were destined to be food gave us a sense of the vast populousness of the moon world second only to the effect of our first glimpse down the shaft.|$|R

50|$|The springs {{used are}} large, stiff springs {{with a high}} modulus of elasticity, and they are highly tensioned. A {{compound}} pulley system is then used so that the large force exerted by the spring can be divided {{by a factor of}} (say) five. The cable exiting the pulley system will have a moderate tension on it, but most importantly, when the <b>cable</b> is <b>drawn</b> in or out, and the extension of the spring changes by only a fifth of that distance, so that the tension force of the spring will not change much. The result is that the spring-pulley system can produce a fairly constant tension in the cable over a large range of movement.|$|R
40|$|Tractors {{provide the}} primary source of power for most farming operations. Their {{mobility}} makes them adaptable to different production practices. However, they have two major disadvantages: soil compaction resulting from multiple passes of heavy power units, and inefficiency in transmitting power through tractive means. Cable farming systems were developed to overcome those disadvantages. Most, however, are used only for tillage operations, and employ a limited number of implements. A <b>cable</b> <b>drawn</b> farming system (CDFS) was developed which utilizes a modified linear move irrigation structure as its main frame. The system consists of a mobile truss, carriage, endless cable and controller. A multipurpose carriage system was designed for the CDFS. Finite element analysis was used to determine carrier frame and attachment structural requirements. An implement carrier of the carriage system was designed to be drawn by an endless cable, and to accommodate most three-point hitch implements, including PTO driven implements. An automatic cable gripping device was developed to connect the carriage to the cable. An electrical system was developed to provide power to the carrier through an electric trolley. A rail was designed to guide the carrier and support the electric lines. Potential harvesting scenarios were examined to identify material handling solutions. Evaluation suggested material handling requirements of vegetables could be best met with a conveyor system, while other crops might utilize trailers. A programmable logical controller (PLC) was selected and a control sequence is provided to accommodate the field operations. This research defined design parameters for a CDFS compatible with linear move irrigation system operations. Analytical results provide support for the concept of multipurpose use of a linear move irrigation system...|$|R

The thud of the propeller slackened, and there was a silence that was almost oppressive when winch and windlass stopped. The gurgle of the gray swell about the steamer's plates and the drip of moisture from the slanted shrouds emphasized it. Then Jimmy signed to one of the men.|$|R
