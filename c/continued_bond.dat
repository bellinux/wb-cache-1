An Australian study of parent and health professional constructions of meanings around post mortem care and communication revealed the practice of health professionals speaking to a child after death. This practice conveyed respect for the personhood of the deceased child, recognised the presence of the deceased child, and assisted in involving parents in their child’s post-mortem care. Such findings illuminate an area of end of life care practice that is not often addressed. Talking to a deceased child appeared as a socially symbolic practice that may promote a <b>continued</b> <b>bond</b> between parent and child...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{childhood}} experience of living with a parent with depression from a retrospective point of view. Five women between 39 and 47 years of age, who grew up with a mother with depression, were interviewed about their current perspectives on their childhood experiences. Interviews were semi-structured and the data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Data analysis led to a narrative organized in two parts. The first part (retrospective understanding of childhood experiences) reports on feelings of desolation contrasted to exceptional support, context-related dwelling on own experiences, and growing into a caring role as a way to keep standing. The second part (towards an integration of childhood experiences in adult realities) evidences ongoing processes of growing understanding of the situation at home, coping with own vulnerabilities, making the difference in their current family life and finding balance in the <b>continued</b> <b>bond</b> with the parents. This retrospective investigation of adults’ perspectives on their childhood experiences gave access to aspects of their experience that remain underexposed in research based on data from children and adolescents...|$|E
40|$|Grave visitation is a {{tradition}} common to many cultures. Yet, this sensitive topic is rarely addressed in cross cultural comparisons. Why do people visit the graves of their parents? What do {{they do in the}} cemetery? Could there be a similar set of intentions behind the diverse customs? By examining the visiting patterns in Frankfurt and Hong Kong, this research is aimed at comparing the concepts of life after death that underlie the practice. Phenomenologically oriented, this is an exploratory study based on qualitative interviews. Integrated with in-depth semi-structure interviewing and thematic analysis, the project covered twelve cases in each city. Research participants were purposefully selected. Data analysis was conducted according to the analytical framework approach. After identifying and clustering of themes, three central and interlocking issues were found: 1. the grave as a new home that connects the living and the dead; 2. death and the interpretation of hope; and 3. intergenerational reciprocity and continuing bonds. Though the images of life after death were ambiguously depicted, grave tending reflected shared expectations of the world beyond. Most significantly, visits to the graves strengthened the ties between the living and the dead, revealing a longing for a <b>continued</b> <b>bond</b> regardless of the forms of burial. At the end, this research illustrated not only the meanings of death but also the notion of religiosity through evaluating the secularisation thesis. Emphasising the dynamics of tradition and personal experience, this contextual reading of current death rituals serves as an original source for religious dialogue and education...|$|E
40|$|Dealing {{with the}} {{relationship}} with deceased family members {{is one of the}} core tasks in the bereavement process. It is common for bereaved persons to experience some forms of ongoing connections with deceased family members. Yet the phenomenon was not very well understood in the field, especially in the Chinese contexts. There was an emerging need to develop a standardized measure on <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> experience, while expanding cultural perspective on understanding <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> experience. This thesis aims to address the above research gaps, to construct and develop a Chinese <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> measure and explores its factor structures and psychometric properties among Chinese bereaved persons in Hong Kong. The research adopted a mixed method approach comprising of two parts. The first part is a qualitative study conducted with eight bereaved persons and two professional staff working in death related industry. Twenty-eight <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> experiences were identified and a Chinese <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> measure was constructed. A three-factor conceptual structure, with <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> experiences categorized into experiencing in five senses, reflecting in mind and attitude and expressing through actions, were proposed for further analyses. The second part is a quantitative study investigating the empirical structure of the Chinese <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> measure and psychometric properties of Chinese <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> measure. The prevalence of various <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> experiences among Chinese bereaved person has ranged from 6. 7 % to 83. 7 %, with an overall prevalence of 96. 6 %. Factor analysis revealed a seven-factor empirical structure of Chinese <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> consists of universal bond, sensory bond, Confucian legacy, bond built on ashes, Taoist rituals, deceased in daily life and collective bond. The psychometric properties of the Chinese <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> measure were explored. This thesis develops a cultural sensitive measure on Chinese <b>continuing</b> <b>bond.</b> It sheds lights on a wider cultural perspective on understanding <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> experiences.

40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I am examining grief, {{mourning and}} bereavement in {{connection to a}} deceased. In the examination of these themes I go through relevant psychological theories, such as S. Freud, R. May, L. Binswanger, E. van Deurzen, G. Madison, M. Buber. I am especially focusing on M. Davidsen-Nielsen og N. Leicks, 2003, book "Den nødvendige smerte" ("The necessary pain") trying to uncover what lies behind these authors theories, practice and ideas of {{how to deal with}} grief. M. Davidsen-Nielsen and N. Leick represent a popular attitude to grief and mourning that I shall describe as a "breaking bond model", an attitude that is very common in modern danish society. In investigating the phenomena I furthermore put my attention to the significance of a kind of continuing bond between the mourner and the deceased. Firstly I investigate and discuss a part of the existential psychological literature trying to elaborate on the depths of the themes. Secondly I turn to new theories of grief and mourning that focuses more explicitly on the significance of a <b>continued</b> <b>bond</b> between the bereaved and the deceased. Especially M. McCabe, D. Klass and P. R. Silverman is representing this new way of looking at grief and mourning. In the second part of my dissertation I investigate historical perspectives, with a focus especially on death and funeral rituals in the period 1800 - 1920. I am looking at history of peasants at the time, and also I examine social movements, romanticism and rationality in order to find out what influence it had - and has had - on bereavement and mourning. The way the rituals were performed gives us an important message of how the society dealt with grief and bereavement in those times. My conclusion is that the behavior of bereavement in the mentioned historic period and new theories of grief and mourning fit well together. It seems as though we are able to learn from history when it comes to give more awareness to relations, partly acknowledging the importance of relations altogether, but also when it comes to an understanding and acknowledging of the need for the mourner to continue some kind of bond with the deceased...|$|E

The effects of traditional grief counseling, with {{its focus on}} the client’s acceptance of separation and inte-gration of loss, are unclear.

This longitudinal study examined causal relationships between <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> and symptoms over time.

40|$|For most of {{the past}} century, the {{positive}} outcome of grief in the West was characterized as the relinquishment of the bond to the deceased. Phrases such as "let go", "move on", and "get over it" were, and continue to be, common to the language of this pursuit. This 'breaking bonds' perspective {{does not take into account}} other means of grief resolution, nor does it consider historical or cultural findings. Consequently, reports of bereaved parents who indicate resolution of grief yet maintain a continued relationship with their deceased child were not given much attention until the 1990 s. This research employed a Durkheimian approach, taking the social bond as the starting point of inquiry and examined <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> of parents to their murdered children. How these bonds were related to the parents' attitudes of re-investing in life and their level of grief was measured. The relationship between the parents' level of grief and their life attitudes was also assessed. The sample consisted of 46 parents living in North Texas whose child had been murdered three or more years ago. A triangulated methodology was utilized and the data were collected by means of participant observation, unstructured interviews, and a mailed questionnaire which obtained information on <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds,</b> level of grief, life attitudes and demographic variables. Multiple regression techniques were utilized to analyze the quantitative data. Parents on the <b>Continuing</b> <b>Bonds</b> Scale reported high levels of bonds with their deceased child. Contrary to expectation, the level of <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> parents maintained with their children was found to be independent of other variables in the study. The relationship between parents' level of grief and their life attitudes was inverse in that higher levels of grief were associated with lower levels of re-investing in life. The finding of the independence of the <b>Continuing</b> <b>Bonds</b> Scale indicates the parent's level of grief and life attitudes are not related to <b>continuing</b> bonds; the <b>bonds</b> exist regardless.

However, results indicated no significant moderation effect of relational collectivism on the relationship between <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> and meaning making. Preliminary analysis revealed no significant relationship between the outcome variables and participant age, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, or time passed since the loss. However, the type of death reported and the reported level of closeness to the deceased had significant relationships with both meaning making and complicated grief symptoms.

40|$|Death {{of a live}} {{organ donor}} {{as a result of}} organ {{transplantation}} is rare. However, such a death can be a devastating experience for the organ recipients, especially so if the donors are close relatives. Donor recipients commonly experienced survival guilt and this guilt may lead to complicated grief. Given the low prevalence of such deaths caused by organ transplantation, little is known about its impact on the survivor recipients. This lack of awareness may lead to disenfranchisement of grief in individuals who lose their close relatives. Based on the conventionally neglected perspective of one Chinese widower whose spouse died after giving him a portion of her liver, this article documents how he managed his survival guilt through <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> with his deceased spouse. Effects of <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> are discussed and the article concludes with recommendations. <b>Continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> highlighted in this article are defined as the integration of the deceased's identity into the life of bereaved individuals.

40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{research}} on the effect of parents maintaining a <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> with their child who died by suicide. Furthermore, there is a gap in the research literature regarding differences among the parental <b>continuing</b> <b>bond,</b> posttraumatic stress, and complicated grief between parents who directly witnessed the suicide or found the body of their child and parents who were notified of the suicide by indirect methods (police, clergy, family, media, etc). This quantitative study included a convenience sample of 219 participants (response rate = 63. 29 %) who self-identified as parents whose child died by suicide 6 or more months prior to the initiation of the study. Participants were predominately White (85. 8 %), married (67. 1 %), female (91. 3 %), and mostly between the ages of 51 and 60 (44. 7 %). Data were collected on the Internet using the REDCap software program. The survey, which was completed anonymously, contained viii demographic information and three questionnaires: The Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), 22 items (0 - 88); Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG), 19 items (0 - 76); and <b>Continuing</b> <b>Bond</b> Scale (CBS), three items (0 - 15). The mean score for the IES- R was 34. 75, mean score for ICG was 33. 03, and mean score for CBS was 6. 28. The results suggest that the higher the parent’s <b>continuing</b> <b>bond</b> was, the higher were the levels of posttraumatic stress disorder and complicated grief.

Ten participants were recruited for the study through the biggest twin registry in the United Kingdom (UK) : TwinsUK. All ten were interviewed, and transcripts of the interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Five key themes, referred to in this study as ‘master themes’, emerged from the analysis: The Twin Relationship, Embodiment, Separation, Preservation of a Connection, and Grief Comparisons. The analysis highlighted two central ideas: embodiment and identity. The study aligns with several existing frameworks for understanding twins and bereavement, including a unit identity and feelings of a loss of part of the self with the bereavement. The study also supports ideas about embodied grief, <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> with the deceased, and co-twin loss being worse than other kinds of losses. Some distinctive contributions to Counselling Psychology and the understanding of bereavement are seen, for example a violent dimension within embodied grief is highlighted. In addition there are aspects of <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> with the deceased in cotwin relationships that differ from <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> in other relationships.

40|$|Bereavement {{scholars}} Silverman, Nickman, and Klass (1996) {{have argued}} that rituals to continue {{a relationship with the}} deceased {{do not have to be}} considered pathological in nature. Since their work, scholars have offered specific strategies for the bereaved to actively construct a bond after death, including telling stories about those who have died, having imagined conversations with the deceased, celebrating their birthdays and anniversaries, and reviewing artifacts that represent or once belonged to them (among other strategies). Hedtke and Winslade (2004) call these “re-membering” processes by which the deceased can regain active membership in their loved ones lives. This dissertation is an answer to Root and Exline’s (2014) call for researchers to produce work that explores the bereaved individual’s everyday subjective experience of continuing a relationship with the deceased.

40|$|As the {{bereavement}} literature increasingly {{indicates that}} bereaved {{people do not}} return to a previous state and often have <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> with the deceased, Western society is becoming aware that the previously understood stages of death proposed by Kubler-Ross (1969) do not fit the bereavement process (Calderwood, 2011). Social media, as a contemporary form of communication about death, is one avenue where bereaved people can express grief in a new, yet not well understood, venue. To increase {{our knowledge of the}} bereavement process and how social media is used to experience that process, a systematic review of academic literature on how social media is used for expressions related to bereavement was conducted. The results of 11 peer-reviewed articles and two doctoral dissertations revealed that social media sites are used as a form of memorializing (Carrol 2 ̆ 6 Landry, 2010) and socializing (Brubaker, Hayes, 2 ̆ 6 Dourish, 2013; Church, 2013; Lingel, 2013; Peck, 2012), even strangers socializing with people who knew the deceased (DeGroot, 2014; Marwick 2 ̆ 6 Ellison, 2012). To further contribute to this literature, and to examine the role of <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> after death, the authors conducted a discourse analysis of seven Facebook group pages dedicated to a deceased person 35 years of age or younger who died over four years ago.

Since then, a number of qualitative studies have been published, describing the mainly beneficial effects of these experiences, especially when they are made sense of in spiritual or religious ways While most of these experiences tend to be reported as comforting to the perceiver, a small percentage of people have reported disturbing experiences, and there is ongoing research, for example by Field and others, to determine when <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> experiences serve adjustment to bereavement and when they may be detrimental.|$|R

This {{study examined the}} relationship between CB and grief outcomes for this population. A customized CB scale for use with bereaved parents was derived from the literature. 354 participants (10 male) recruited from online support groups completed an internet questionnaire. A three factor dimensional structure of CB (internalized, externalized, and transference) was supported. Structural equation modeling showed clear links between internalized bonds and a more positive grief status; externalized bonds showing an opposite relationship. Weaker effects were found for child's age, time since death, and type of death...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} family grief and resilience following a child’s death. Representing 23 families, 35 bereaved parents completed biographical questionnaires, the Family Hardiness Index, and the Family Attachment and Changeability Index 8. Significant positive correlations {{were found between}} family hardiness and family adaptation, and between parents’ age and family hardiness. Using grounded theory, interviews allowed for the formulation of categories including grief, <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds,</b> external support, religion, and family hardiness. The study reveals the need for exploring unique experiences of families bereaved by children’s deaths and identifies family hardiness as a potential resilience factor for this populatio...|$|R
40|$|This article, {{drawing on}} data from a wider study, {{describes}} the impact that U. K. bereaved military parents ascribe to the practical support (help with home and garden maintenance) that they received {{following the death of}} their son. The type of practical support offered to parents has had a wide-ranging and significant impact on them. In addition to helping them find meaning and maintain <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds,</b> this form of support contributed to their capacity to engage in restoration-focused coping. As a symbolic resource, this type of practical support may be a significant moderator of distress in the psychosocial transition of bereavement...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} parents' spiritual {{experience}} {{of the loss of}} a child. Many parents experience <b>continuing</b> <b>bonds</b> with their deceased child as well as forms of posttraumatic growth. Twelve parents of children dying after severe illness were interviewed about their experiences. The interviews contain stories about premonitions, the intensity of the moment of the child's death and the child's presence after death. Thematically the stories reflect the dialectics of continuity and discontinuity in the relationship with the child. This is interpreted in terms of attributing meaning, significance and comprehensibility. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands...|$|R
