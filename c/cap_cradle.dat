2500|$|Severe {{cases of}} <b>cradle</b> <b>cap,</b> {{especially}} with cracked or bleeding skin, {{can provide a}} place for bacteria to grow. If the <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> {{is caused by a}} fungal infection which has worsened significantly over days or weeks to allow bacterial growth (impetigo, most commonly), a combination treatment of antibiotics and antifungals may be necessary. [...] Since it is difficult for a layperson to distinguish the difference between sebaceous gland <b>cradle</b> <b>cap,</b> fungal <b>cradle</b> <b>cap,</b> or either of these combined with a bacterial infection, medical advice should be sought if the condition appears to worsen.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Cradle</b> <b>cap</b> is a yellowish, patchy, greasy, scaly and crusty {{skin rash}} that occurs on the scalp of {{recently}} born babies.

Similar symptoms in older children are more likely to be dandruff than <b>cradle</b> <b>cap.</b> The rash is often prominent around the ear, the eyebrows or the eyelids. [...] It may appear in other locations as well, where it is called seborrhoeic dermatitis rather than <b>cradle</b> <b>cap.</b> Some countries use the term pityriasis capitis for <b>cradle</b> <b>cap.</b> It is extremely common, with about half of all babies affected.

25|$|A {{common cause}} of <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> {{appears to be a}} common manifestation of biotin insufficiency.

40|$|What is {{the best}} {{treatment}} for <b>cradle</b> <b>cap?</b> Evidence-based answer: Gentle washing or emollient use with brushing to remove scale is considered first-line treatment of infantile seborrheic dermatitis, or <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> (SOR: C, expert opinion). Ketoconazole 2 % shampoo and 1 % hydrocortisone cream, while equally effective (SOR: C, case series), may be no better than placebo (SOR: C, consensus opinion).

50|$|Sulfur and {{salicylic}} acid {{can also be}} used to effectively treat acne and <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> in some patients. Resorcinol is another keratolytic that is usually combined with sulfur. Urea acts as a keratolytic due to its hygroscopic property.|$|R
2500|$|To {{help with}} <b>cradle</b> <b>cap,</b> parents can gently massage their baby's scalp with their fingers or a soft brush {{to loosen the}} scales. They may want to shampoo the baby's hair more {{frequently}} (no {{more than once a}} day), and after shampooing gently brush the baby's scalp with a soft brush or a terrycloth towel. Oil remedies can be used by rubbing a small amount of pure, plant-derived oil (coconut oil, pure olive oil, almond oil) on the baby's scalp and leaving it on for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, gently comb out the flakes with a fine tooth comb or brush. Be sure to wash out all of the oil to avoid making the <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> worse.|$|R

5000|$|A {{substantially}} blemished face, {{back and}} limbs {{could point to}} cystic acne. The most severe form of the condition, cystic acne arises from the same hormonal imbalances that cause hair loss, and is associated with dihydrotestosterone production. [...] Seborrheic dermatitis, {{a condition in which}} an excessive amount of sebum is produced and builds up on the scalp (looking like an adult <b>cradle</b> <b>cap)</b> is also a symptom of hormonal imbalances, as is an excessively oily or dry scalp. Both can cause hair thinning.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> is not severe, {{it could}} simply be combed out gently after bathing. The {{softened}} scales {{can then be}} brushed away with a soft brush, comb or cloth, but if not done very gently, this could worsen the condition and bring about temporary hair loss. Applying petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline) liberally overnight is another popular treatment. The softened scales either fall off during the night, or can be brushed off in the morning. Making a paste from sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and leaving it on the affected area for 10 minutes can also help lift the scales. There have been no studies done on these treatments.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{identified}} and remediated child-care skill deficits in parents {{with developmental disabilities}} to reduce their risk of child neglect. Eleven mothers with developmental disabilities who were considered by social service and child welfare agencies to be providing neglectful child care were found in baseline to have several important child-care skill deficits (e. g., bathing, diaper rash treatment, cleaning baby bottles) compared to nonhandicapped mothers. Parent training (consisting of verbal instructions, pictorial manuals, modeling, feedback, and reinforcement) resulted in rapid acquisition and maintenance of child-care skills in all mothers. Mean percentage correct scores increased from 58 % in baseline to 90 % in training and 91 % in follow-up (M = 31 weeks). The latter two scores compare favorably to the mean score (87 %) of 20 nonhandicapped mothers on the same skills. Where observable, parent training was associated with corresponding benefits to the children (e. g., elimination of diaper rash and <b>cradle</b> <b>cap,</b> increased weight gain, successful toilet training). These results indicate that parent training may be a viable option to {{the removal of the}} child from the home when parenting skill deficits place the child's well-being in jeopardy...|$|R
40|$|Most common scalp flaking {{disorders}} show {{a strong}} correlation with sebaceous gland (SG) activity. Early SG activity in the neonate results in microfloral colonization and <b>cradle</b> <b>cap.</b> After maternal hormonal control subsides, there is little SG activity until puberty, when the SG turns on under sex hormone control. When the SG activity increases, the present but low Malassezia population has a new food source and proliferates, resulting in the scalp itching and flaking common to greater than 50 % of adults. Dry scalp flaking, dandruff, and seborrheic dermatitis are chronic scalp manifestations of similar etiology differing only in severity. The common etiology is a convergence of three factors: (1) SG secretions, (2) microfloral metabolism, and (3) individual susceptibility. Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis (D/SD) are more than superficial stratum corneum disorders, including alteration of the epidermis with hyperproliferation, excess lipids, interdigitation of the corneal envelope, and parakeratosis. The pathogenic role of Malassezia in D/SD has recently been elucidated, and is focused on their lipid metabolism. Malassezia restricta and M. globosa require lipids. They degrade sebum, free fatty acids from triglycerides, consume specific saturated fatty acids, and leave behind the unsaturates. Penetration of the modified sebaceous secretions results in inflammation, irritation, and scalp flaking...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nappy rash {{accounts}} for 20 % of dermatology consultations in childhood, but its causes are poorly understood. AIM: To determine {{the incidence of}} nappy rash during the first four weeks {{of life in a}} geographically defined United Kingdom (UK) population, and to study the factors associated with developing the rash. METHOD: The data are derived from self-completed questionnaires of parents in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). The response rate to a questionnaire about the child administered four weeks after delivery among parents of singleton infants was 87 % (12103 / 13902). RESULTS: The incidence of nappy rash was 25 %. Fourteen highly significant possible causal factors emerged, of which 10 were retained in a logistic regression model: dirtying of nappy, contact with doctor about other problems, history of rashes in joints or skin creases, type of nappy worn, being fed cereal, taken to mother's bed when waking at night, history of <b>cradle</b> <b>cap,</b> general state of health, previous stomach upset, and being only breast-fed. However, the relative risks were generally small. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of nappy rash increases with intercurrent illness and early introduction of cereals. Disposable nappies give little protection, and this finding helps to endorse a recently introduced hospital scheme arising from environmental concerns that encourages parents to use cotton nappies instead of disposables. For many babies, however, the causes of nappy rash remain unknown...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The crystal {{structure}} of the prod-uct of the Bacillus subtilis ykuD gene was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method and refined using data to 2. 0 Å resolution. The ykuD protein is a representative of a distinctly prokaryotic and ubiquitous family found among both pathogenic and nonpathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals {{the presence of an}} N-terminal LysM domain, which occurs among enzymes in-volved in cell wall metabolism, and a novel, putative catalytic domain with a highly conserved His/Cys-containing motif of hitherto unknown structure. As the wild-type protein did not crystallize, a double mutant was designed (Lys 117 Ala/Gln 118 Ala) to re-duce excess surface conformational entropy. As ex-pected, the {{structure of the}} LysM domain is similar to the NMR structure reported for an analogous domain from Escherichia coli murein transglycosy-lase MltD. The molecular model also shows that the 112 -residue-long C-terminal domain has a novel ter-tiary fold consisting of a -sandwichwith twomixed sheets, one containing five strands and the other, six strands. The two -sheets form a <b>cradle</b> <b>capped</b> by an -helix. This domain contains a putative cata-lytic site with a tetrad of invariant His 123, Gly 124, Cys 139, and Arg 141. The stereochemistry of this active site shows similarities to peptidotransferases and sortases, and suggests that the enzymes of the ykuD family may {{play an important role in}} cell wall biology.

40|$|Background: The {{spectrum}} of dermatological manifestations during neonatal period varies from transient self-limiting conditions to serious dermatoses; the latter, fortunately few, are disproportionately stressful to the parents, who {{due to lack}} of specialized pediatric dermatology clinics frequently get tossed between a dermatologist and a pediatrician. Objectives: This study was formulated to record cutaneous changes over the first five postnatal days of life and to statistically correlate those changes occurring in ≥ 11 neonates with three (parity, associated illnesses, and mode of delivery) maternal and three (sex, birth weight, and gestational age) neonatal factors. Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study at a tertiary care hospital entailed recording detailed dermatological examination of 300 neonates having some (physiological and/or pathological) cutaneous changes and their statistical evaluation using the Chi-square test and significance (P < 0. 05) as above. Results: Superficial cutaneous desquamation (SCD), Mongolian spots (MS), and erythema toxicum neonatorum (ETN) were the first three common changes among a total of 15 conditions observed overall; these three, as also milia and icterus, revealed statistical significance with both maternal as well as neonatal factors. Lanugo and napkin dermatitis (ND) were statistically significant with respect to two neonatal factors and <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> (CC), a single maternal factor. Gestational age was of statistical significance regarding five cutaneous changes, associated maternal illness during pregnancy regarding four, birth weight as well as parity regarding three each, and sex of the neonate as well as mode of delivery regarding two each. Conclusion: Despite observing a statistically significant correlation of eight cutaneous changes with three maternal and/or three neonatal factors, more extensive studies in neonatal dermatology are required for validation of these unique statistical correlations...|$|R
