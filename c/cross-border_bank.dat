40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of <b>banks</b> in <b>cross-border</b> finance has become an urgent priority. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>banks</b> have {{played a central role}} in the {{dynamics}} of the global crisis of 2007 - 2009. First, European banks had a surprisingly large exposure to the US securitised asset markets, which arose to a significant extent through global banks acting either on the buying or selling side in these markets. Second, the breakdown in credit and asset markets was an international phenomenon, with cross-border linkages suffering disproportionately due to greater information problems vis-à-vis cross-border counterparties and the differences in regulatory regimes. Third, currency mismatches in funding became evident, with European banks suffering a dollar shortage that ultimately required resolution through a major currency swap initiative among the main central banks. Fourth, the provision of fiscal support for distressed banks was especially problematic in relation to cross-border activities. The rescue of multi-country banks, such as Dexia and Fortis, required the governments involved to devise ad hoc, ex-post burden-sharing agreements. In relation to emerging Europe, there were also fears that the policies of home-country governments might encourage parent banks to fail to support the operations of affiliates. This report analyses key aspects of <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking,</b> takes a European focus and derives policy recommendations based on them. Chapter 1 of the report first documents the evolution of <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking</b> in Europe in the two decades prior to the crisis. We then turn to the role <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking</b> played during the crisis of 2007 - 2009, with a key focus on whether crossborder activities have exacerbated the crisis or helped to mitigate it. We also analyse the regulatory response to cross-border problems in the crisis.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} recent {{literature}} on <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking,</b> {{with a focus}} on policy implications. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>banking</b> has increased sharply in recent decades, particularly in the form of entry, and has affected the development of financial systems, access to financial services, and stability. Reviewing the empirical literature, the author finds much, although not uniform, evidence that <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking</b> supports the development of an efficient and stable financial system that offers a wide access to quality financial services at low cost. But as better financial systems have more <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking,</b> the relationship between <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking</b> and competitiveness has to be carefully judged. While developing countries have some special conditions, provided a minimum degree of oversight is in place, they experience effects similar to industrial countries. There are some questions, though, on the effects of <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking</b> on lending based on softer information and on stability. Relevant experiences from capital markets show that the degree of cross-border financial activities can affect local market sustainability and there can be path dependency when opening up to cross-border competition. Reviewing the fast changing landscape of financial services provision, the author argues that <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking</b> highlights the increased importance of competition policy in financial services provision. This competition policy cannot be traditional, institutional based, but will need to resemble that used in other network industries. Furthermore, with globalization accelerating, competition policy will need to be global, supported by greater cross-border institutional collaboration and using the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) process and the disciplines of the World Trade Organization. GATS can be of special value to developing countries as it provides a binding, pro-competition framework that has proven more difficult to establish otherwise.

In particular, we observe that this tendency has never been hampered by any disturbances or crises in international financial markets (such as the East Asian currency crisis in 1997 or the LTCM near-default event in 1998). We see both costs and benefits from these developments in <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> exposures. On the one hand, systemic risk in international financial markets is likely to increase because of the more direct and more widely spreading spillover effects of a crisis in one country once it occurs.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} changes to regulatory policy and to monetary policy on <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> lending since the global financial crisis. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> lending has decreased, and the home bias in the credit portfolio of banks has risen sharply, especially among banks in the euro area. Our results suggest that expansionary monetary policy in the source countries - {{as measured by the}} change in reserves held at central banks - has encouraged cross-border lending, both in euro area and non-euro area countries. Regarding regulatory policy, increases in financial supervisory power or independence of the supervisory authorities have encouraged credit outflows from source countries. The findings thus underline the importance of regulatory arbitrage as a driver of <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> flows since the global financial crisis.

We use the BIS international banking statistics to identify the key drivers of this decline. Our results indicate that the latest contraction in <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> lending was largely linked to the deteriorating health of euro area banks. JEL classification: F 34, G 15, G 21. As the euro area crisis intensified {{in the second half}} of 2011, <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> lending to emerging market economies (EMEs) dropped sharply (Graph 1). The decline marked the end of the continuous nine-quarter recovery that followed the post-Lehman contraction in 2008 – 09. Furthermore, the recovery in the first quarter of 2012 came to an abrupt halt in the second. This raises questions for policymakers: what caused this lending decline? Was it that demand for credit fell in EMEs? Did country risk rise? Or were the key drivers linked to the health of the advanced economy banks that supply EMEs with cross-border credit? And, if yes, which banking systems contributed the most to the decline? We answer these questions by using the BIS international banking statistics (IBS) in a panel regression framework. The analysis covers quarterly <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> lending data for 40 EMEs between the third quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2012. We develop a new methodology which combines information from the two main BIS IBS data sets. This novel approach is the first to simultaneously use actual exchange rate-adjusted cross-border lending flows to EMEs and trace these flows to individual home country banking systems. We use the panel regression results to decompose the quarterly fluctuations in cross-border lending to EMEs into components attributable to EME credit demand, EME country risk and the health of the banking systems that supply the crossborder credit.

As these services are provided predominantly by complex financial institutions and involve operating within a number of African financial systems, effective regulation of such entities can be challenging. The challenges are two-fold: regulating complex financial institutions on a consolidated basis and achieving effective supervisory cooperation between home and host country regulators of these banking entities, which is critical given the cross-border nature of the services they provide. Regulation is particularly significant due to the linkages of all financial systems involved in the operation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking</b> services and also the ease and speed with which a crisis can spread from one jurisdiction to another - as the last global financial crisis revealed.

Although, the Commission proposals submitted within a year of the crisis considered the more radical reform options, such as shifting the regime to the EU level or reorganizing <b>cross-border</b> <b>banks</b> so that they could be resolved on the national level, in the end the Commission supported the traditional reform path of deepening soft law and strengthening pre-crisis governance arrangements.

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> M&As on bank risk {{remains an open}} question. Though {{geographically}} diversifying bank M&As {{have the potential to}} reduce the risk of bank insolvency, they also have the potential to increase that risk due to the increase in risk-taking incentives by bank managers and stockholders following these transactions. This paper empirically investigates whether <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> M&As increase or decrease the risk of acquiring banks as captured by changes in acquirers' yield spreads. This paper also investigates how differences in the institutional environments between bidder and target countries affect changes in yield spreads following M&A announcements. The study finds that bondholders, in general, perceive <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> M&As as risk-increasing activities, unlike domestic bank mergers. Specifically, on average, yield spreads increase by 4. 13 basis points following the announcement of cross-border M&As. This study also finds that these yield spreads are significantly affected by the differences in investor-protection and deposit insurance environments between the transacting countries. However, the study does not find that the regulatory and supervisory environment in the home countries of the transacting parties significantly affects the changes in yield spreads. The overall evidence suggests that regulators should judge the relative environment in both the home and the host countries in evaluating the associated risks of an active multinational financial institution and in setting the sufficiency of the banks' reserve positions.

This result is consistent with strong host regulators limiting the risky activities of their local banks. Foreign-owned competitors could then engage in the risky projects, especially if the foreign banks' supervisors are not strong. An acquirer entering a country with strong supervision appears to shift risk back to its home country.

It shows that the Commission considered substantive reforms that would shift the <b>cross-border</b> <b>bank</b> resolution regime to the EU level to match the operational presence of pan-European banks. However, the political compromises on the European System of Financial Supervisors in the Council, led the Commission to withdraw from more ambitious proposals in favor of gradual improvements of the pre-crisis status quo. The reformed structures are still too complex to be functional in real-time under the pressure of a financial crisis and they leave too many crucial issues such as sharing of information and of fiscal burdens in the domain of non-binding soft law agreements yet to be prepared by supervisory colleges. The new framework does not change the exclusively national accountability of supervisory authorities, thus the new regime is unlikely to prevent non-cooperative resolution strategies.

This paper examines how European global banks channelled finance, raised in US wholesale funding markets, via <b>cross-border</b> <b>banking</b> flows to Irish retail banks during the first decade of the euro.
