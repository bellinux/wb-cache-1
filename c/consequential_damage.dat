50|$|<b>Consequential</b> <b>damages,</b> {{otherwise}} known as special damages, are damages that can be proven to have occurred because {{of the failure of}} one party to meet a contractual obligation. They go beyond the contract itself and into the actions garnished from the failure to fulfill. The type of claim giving rise to the damages can affect the rules or calculations associated with a given type of <b>damages,</b> including <b>consequential</b> <b>damages</b> (e.g., breach of contract versus a tort claim). For example, <b>consequential</b> <b>damages</b> are a potential type of expectation damages which arise in contract law.|$|R

50|$|Lord Dunraven {{entered his}} yacht {{in a race}} with the {{defendant}} owner of The Satanita.

On 5 April 1894, The Satanita collided with Lord Dunraven’s yacht, Valkyrie II, in the Firth of Clyde, killing a crewmember and causing it to sink.|$|E
50|$|This was thought, from {{forensic}} evidence, to {{be linked}} to the development of an unexpected fatigue-related crack in part of the impeller. In August, another gas circulator on the other Torness reactor showed signs of increasing vibration and was promptly shut down by the operators. Its subsequent disassembly revealed a fully developed fatigue related crack in a similar position to the first failure, but the prompt shutdown had prevented <b>consequential</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Consequential</b> <b>damages</b> {{can easily}} amount to {{millions}} of dollars. Commercial parties often disclaim <b>consequential</b> <b>damages</b> in their contracts. This Article posits that such disclaimers between commercial parties under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) should not be found unenforceable based on gross negligence. Article 2 of the UCC promotes the policy of freedom of contract. Consistent with that policy, section 2 - 719 of the UCC provides that contractual <b>consequential</b> <b>damages</b> disclaimers should be enforceable absent a finding of unconscionability. This Article analyzes the interplay among UCC section 2 - 719, “public policy” exceptions to enforcing limitations of liability, and the law of gross negligence. This Article concludes that but for those rare circumstances in which a commercial buyer may invoke unconscionability, courts should uphold <b>consequential</b> <b>damages</b> disclaimers absent a clear showing of willful misconduct. This standard provides a more discernible “bright-line” that comports with the general treatment of economic losses under the UCC...|$|R

50|$|On Croker Island, 30 homes {{sustained}} damage, some {{of which}} lost their roofs, numerous trees were downed, power was cut to most residences, cars were completely destroyed and numerous roads were damaged. Nearly all trees on the island were leveled by 290 km/h wind gusts. Schools were reportedly destroyed in addition to several homes. Much of the infrastructure of the Tiwi Islands was affected, some suffering <b>consequential</b> <b>damage</b> due to trees falling on buildings and vehicles. Damages on the islands amounted to A$5 million ($3.9 million USD). Throughout the Northern Territory, an additional A$10 million ($6.4 million USD) in damages resulted from Ingrid.|$|E
5000|$|Like many early {{producers}} of fiberglass boats, the company's production methods resulted in yachts that were heavier than later builders. Experimenting with fiberglass, {{at that time}} a relatively novel material for boat construction, the founders made test samples that were shot at from 10 ft with various firearms to test the material strength. The test samples repelled [...]45 slugs and became {{the foundation of the}} company's reputation for producing bulletproof yachts. In various cases Cascade Yachts have been dropped off slings, fallen off a trailer at highway speed, and submerged in a mudslide, and suffered little <b>consequential</b> <b>damage.</b> Many Cascade hulls were sold in various stages of completion for owners to finish the interiors.|$|E

50|$|The stop fenders {{need to be}} {{far enough}} apart to allow the ship’s ramp to fit between them, and this must also allow for the {{variation}} of beam of the vessels using the berth {{as well as an}} eccentricity of the ramp. If they are too far apart then they are only effective protection for the widest ships with square sterns. This limitation means that ship’s with rounded or tapered sterns and those berthing bow in are likely to hit the end of the linkspan with <b>consequential</b> <b>damage.</b> Later developments allow for the berthing energy to be absorbed through the linkspan at the hinge but this will not protect from overriding of the ship or uplift from the bulbous bow. Impact loads delivered this way can apply greater forces on the support mechanism than traffic loads with sometimes disastrous consequences.|$|E
5000|$|The rocker-bogie {{design has}} no springs or stub axles for each wheel, {{allowing}} the rover {{to climb over}} obstacles, such as rocks, that are up to twice the wheel's diameter in size while keeping all six wheels on the ground. As with any suspension system, the tilt stability {{is limited by the}} height of the center of gravity. Systems using springs tend to tip more easily as the loaded side yields. Based on the center of mass, the Curiosity rover of the Mars Science Laboratory mission can withstand a tilt of at least 45 degrees in any direction without overturning, but automatic sensors limit the rover from exceeding 30-degree tilts. The system is designed to be used at slow speed of around [...] so as to minimize dynamic shocks and <b>consequential</b> <b>damage</b> to the vehicle when surmounting sizable obstacles.|$|E
50|$|A {{continuous}} product lift or reciprocating elevator can {{be chosen}} for the upright transporting of products. Such lifts are found in two forms: an L-shaped conveyor or mat lift and a fork-lift. An L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is a goods lift in which the products lie on a support which is suspended between a number of chains. This {{means that there is}} a considerable risk of contamination (with oil or grease) where use is made of traditional chains. A possible disadvantage of such a lift is that it requires more control, but the area required is again appreciably less than with a spiral conveyor. The difference in height which is able to be bridged with only one drive motor is almost unlimited. When bridging a greater height, it is necessary with spiral conveyors to place several systems one above the other. Another disadvantage of an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift {{is the fact that it}} is difficult to control the transfer of products on intake to the system, with the incorrect receiving of a product being able to cause considerable <b>consequential</b> <b>damage</b> and with considerable additional costs to be expected as a result of lost production just as in the case of a spiral conveyor.|$|E

5000|$|The Four Pillars or the 'Char Khambe', as {{they are}} called in Konkani, are painted white, and are located in the Khazan lands on the old Santa Cruz - Panjim roads in the marshy area of the Rio de Ourem (Portuguese for 'River of Gold'). This road is now named as Vasantrao Dempo Marg. During Portuguese rule, freedom fighters {{gathered}} here and held meetings and discussions, making it a very important landmark in Goa. The [...] "Khazan land" [...] means low land situated near creeks or river side which is normally below high tide level; is situated on the St Cruz stretch. The area is surrounded by rice paddy fields on both the sides (north and south). It is one of the busiest roads in Panjim. With the hustle bustle all day long, the four pillars about 15' tall each, two {{on each side of the}} road may appear to be just another structure. Physically, the site act as a buffer between the hectic urban environment of city of Panjim and the serene village environs of Santa Cruz. The place, is part of the unique Goan landscape, is very fragile and irreplaceable in nature and any thoughtless human intervention can cause drastic and irreparable <b>consequential</b> <b>damage</b> in the long run. The site is a low-lying tidal flood plain and is part of the natural drainage pattern during the rainy season on account of the surrounding topography. The marshy wetland is a host to mangrove vegetation which plays a definite role in the maintenance of vital ecological balance. The place is also a popular habitat to a wide variety of local and migratory birds and is a bird-watcher's delight. It is quite common to find researchers and bird lovers from distant countries here, with their trained cameras. This place finds mention on the Internet along with the Karmali lake, Chorao, Mayem lake and others in Goa. But for the locals here, they aren't just structures. There are sluice gates at this structure, which controlled the flow of marine water for the salt pans which are on the south. The north area is an estuary with plenty of flora and fauna. This area is reportedly haunted with the haunting at its peak on full moon nights. According to the commuters who have travelled via the stretch, there is an eerie feeling that prevails at the spot. They have also reported of sighting some apparitions in the nights. Locals say that the area is jinxed and cursed and is one reason for the numerous accidents taking place here. Others sightings include a lady dressed in a white saree and supposedly asking for a lift. People also claim of hearing cries and have even had a sudden breaking down of bikes as soon as they reach the Char Khambe.|$|E

25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} <b>consequential.</b> General <b>damages</b> are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. <b>Consequential</b> <b>damages</b> are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. <b>Consequential</b> <b>damages</b> would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|R
