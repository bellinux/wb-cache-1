40|$|Photodetectors {{with large}} {{internal}} gain and low intrinsic device noise are desired in various applications, such as weak signal detection and high-speed imaging. Commonly used photodetectors with internal gain are avalanche photodiodes (APDs). Because of the random {{nature of the}} avalanche multiplication process, the excess noise generated in these devices is the limiting factor on the detectivity. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the gain and noise for APDs. The gain of APDs is generally limited {{at a level of}} 10 for InGaAs/InP long wavelength APDs. In addition to APDs, phototransistors are also capable of satisfying many of the detector requirements. One of the drawbacks of phototransistors is that the gain is usually small and the response speed is slow at low incident optical power. The conventional way to solve these problems is to provide a quiescent bias through a base terminal. However, the base bias current provides another noise source, which will be amplified and contributes to the most important noise component to the total collector noise. The punchthrough phototransistors studied in this experiment, with a completely depleted base under normal operating conditions, can intrinsically offer very high gain and extremely low noise. The <b>collector</b> <b>bias</b> current can be provided by emitter-collector voltage through static induction effect. Such bias scheme can improve both current gain and frequency response without degradation in the output noise figure.

40|$|The {{base width}} of a Bipolar Junction Transistor in an {{integrated}} circuit is very small and recombination within the base can safely be neglected. In most of the works on Base Transit Time with reverse <b>biased</b> <b>collector</b> junction the expressions for transit time have been derived separately for high injection and low injection condition of operations. But in this work we have obtained a new analytical expression for Base Transit Time with reverse <b>biased</b> <b>collector</b> junction {{that can be applied}} for all levels of injections.

In the second part of this work, the Base Transit Time with <b>collector</b> junction forward <b>biased</b> is studied. When the collector junction is forward biased, the base is extended into the collector. Under this situation total transit time is the time taken by electron to traverse base and also the injection region of the collector. Recent works have shown that the collector minority carrier lifetime is finite. Therefore, recombination current in the collector minority carrier lifetime is finite. Therefore recombination current in the collector cannot be neglected. Considering drift and diffusion current and recombination, expressions for collector transit time with forward <b>biased</b> <b>collector</b> junction are obtained for quasi- and hard-saturation regions of operation. The results are compared with those obtained without recombination. The two results are deviated significantly from each other.

In response to the strong need to record ongoing shifts in pollinator diversity and abundance, global and regional pollinator initiatives must adopt standardized sampling protocols when developing large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes. We systematically evaluated the performance of six sampling methods (observation plots, pan traps, standardized and variable transect walks, trap nests with reed internodes or paper tubes) that are commonly used across {{a wide range of}} geographical regions in Europe and in two habitat types (agricultural and seminatural). We focused on bees since they represent the most important pollinator group worldwide. Several characteristics of the methods were considered in order to evaluate their performance in assessing bee diversity: sample coverage, observed species richness, species richness estimators, collector biases (identified by subunit-based rarefaction curves), species composition of the samples, and the indication of overall bee species richness (estimated from combined total samples). The most efficient method in all geographical regions, in both the agricultural and seminatural habitats, was the pan trap method. It had the highest sample coverage, collected the highest number of species, showed negligible <b>collector</b> <b>bias,</b> detected similar species as the transect methods, and was the best indicator of overall bee species richness. The transect methods were also relatively efficient, but they had a significant <b>collector</b> <b>bias.</b> The observation plots showed poor performance.

However, both trap nest types detected additional species that were not recorded by any of the other methods.

40|$|Background: The Plasmodium falciparum entomological {{inoculation}} rate (PfEIR) is {{a measure}} of exposure to infectious mosquitoes. It is usually interpreted as the number of P. falciparum infective bites received by an individual during a season or annually (aPfEIR). In an area of perennial transmission, the accuracy, precision and seasonal distribution (i. e., month by month) of aPfEIR were investigated. Data were drawn from three sites in Uganda with differing levels of transmission where falciparum malaria is transmitted mainly by Anopheles gambiae s. l. Estimates of aPfEIR derived from human-landing catches – the classic method for estimating biting rates – were compared with data from CDC light traps, and with catches of knock down and exit traps separately and combined. Methods: Entomological surveillance was carried out over one year in 2011 / 12 in three settings: Jinja, a peri-urban area with low transmission; Kanungu, a rural area with moderate transmission; and Nagongera, Tororo District, a rural area with exceptionally high malaria transmission. Three sampling approaches were used from randomly selected houses with collections occurring once a month: human-landing collections (eight houses), CDC light traps (100 houses) and paired knock-down and exit traps each month (ten houses) for each setting. Up to 50 mosquitoes per month from each household were tested for sporozoites with P. falciparum by ELISA. Human biting rate (HBR) data were estimated month by month. P. falciparum Sporozoite rate (PfSR) for yearly and monthly data and confidence intervals were estimated using the binomial exact test. Monthly and yearly estimates of the HBR, the PfSR, and the PfEIR were estimated and compared. Results: The estimated aPfEIR values using human-landing catch data were 3. 8 (95 % Confidence Intervals, CI 0 - 11. 4) for Jinja, 26. 6 (95 % CI 7. 6 - 49. 4) for Kanungu, and 125 (95 % CI 72. 2 - 183. 0) for Tororo. In general, the monthly PfEIR values showed strong seasonal signals with two peaks from May-June and October-December, although the precise timing of the peaks differed between sites. Estimated HBRs using human-landing catches were strongly correlated with those made using CDC light traps (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 67, p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and with either knock-down catches (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 56, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and exit traps (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 82, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) or the combined catches (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 73, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Using CDC light trap catch data, the PfSR in Tororo was strongly negatively correlated with monthly HBR (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 44, p[*]=[*] 0. 01). In other sites, no patterns in the PfSR were discernible because either the number P. falciparum of sporozoite positive mosquitoes or the total number of mosquitoes caught was too low.

HLC yielded 3392 (44. 6 %), CB-LTC 2150 (28. 3 %), and LTC 2064 (27. 1 %) Anopheles females. The RSEs of LTC and HLC for An. arabiensis were significantly correlated (p < 0. 001) and density independent (p = 0. 65). However, for outdoor collection of the same species, RSEs of LTC and CB-LTC were density dependent (p < 0. 001). It was estimated that on average, indoor LTC and CB-LTC each caught 0. 35 and 0. 44 times that of indoor HLC for An. arabiensis respectively. Conclusions: Results showed that HLC was the most efficient method for sampling An. arabiensis.

The first was a vacuum arc ion source which was modified allowing us to collect ions from arc plasma streaming through an anode mesh. The second discharge system essentially consisted of a cathode placed {{near the center of}} a spherically shaped mesh anode. In both systems, the ion current streaming through the mesh was measured by a <b>biased</b> <b>collector.</b> The mesh anodes had geometric transmittances of 60 percent and 72 percent, respectively, which were taken into account as correction factors. The ion current from different cathode materials was measured for 50 - 500 A of arc current. The ion current normalized by the arc current was found to depend on the cathode material, with values in the range from 5 percent to 19 percent. The normalized ion current is generally greater for elements of low cohesive energy. The ion erosion rates were determined from values of ion current and ion charge states, which were previously measured in the same ion source. The absolute ion erosion rates range from 16 - 173 mu g/C...|$|R
40|$|After an {{introduction}} to amplifiers in communications and an exposition of the literature specifically relevant to high linearity power amplifiers, this study investigates more thoroughly various aspects of envelope feedback as applied to Bipolar Tuned Power Amplifiers at HF and VHP. It is discovered that under the correct conditions a new mode of linear operation exists where gain compression, AM-PM conversion and input impedance are simultaneously linearised, and in this region DC-RF power efficiency is also improved. Spectral measurements are presented from an envelope feedback amplifier constructed to operate over this region. A computerised system is described for measuring accurately the gain and phase shift of the test amplifier against variation of <b>collector</b> supply, quiescent <b>bias</b> current and RF drive power. The results from these measurements are presented as 3 -dimensional projections and as contour plots. Subsequently the stored data is used to re-construct two-tone spectra, which is then analysed to show contributions to the spectrum from the gain compression and AM-PM conversion mechanisms separately. Conclusions are drawn with respect to effects of bias on these two mechanisms. A mechanism has been discovered which gives a symetric spectra without requiring AM-PM conversion at the fundamental frequencies. An attempt is made to model the amplifier with a non-linear circuit transient analysis program (SPICE). Good correlation is obtained for some parameters and these results are also plotted in 3 -D and in contour...|$|R
