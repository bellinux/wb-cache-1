In particular, fractional <b>cascading</b> speeds up binary {{searches for the}} same value in multiple arrays, efficiently solving a series of search problems in computational geometry and numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.|$|E
5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic <b>cascading</b> effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E

In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E

40|$|Presently, the gas {{centrifuge}} arranged in <b>cascades</b> {{is the most}} common method for enriching uranium in its fissionable isotope, 235 U. The enriching process can be modeled in two overarching steps. First, one examines the individual centrifuge machines, estimating enriching performance based on operating conditions such as the centrifuge feed flow rate and cut. Second, this information is built into a <b>cascade</b> analysis which considers the <b>cascade</b> structure (how the machines are linked together) as well as the total <b>cascade</b> feed, product, and waste flow rates. This paper, which focuses on {{the second half of the}} modeling process, outlines a method for analyzing one centrifuge <b>cascade</b> structure recently developed and implemented by Iran. The novel configuration consists of two conventional <b>cascades</b> interconnected in a tandem fashion. In this arrangement, the waste flow from the first <b>cascade</b> enters the second <b>cascade</b> as feed flow. The waste leaving this (the second) <b>cascade</b> becomes the overall waste flow and the associated product is reintroduced into the first <b>cascade.</b> Because the two <b>cascades</b> are linked – the flow leaving the first <b>cascade</b> affects the operation of the second <b>cascade,</b> and vice versa – the traditional method for analyzing single <b>cascades</b> is inadequate. This paper presents an extension of the conventional analysis procedure that is appropriate for tandem <b>cascades.</b> The new method is used to assess Iran’s tandem <b>cascades,</b> including their utility for producing highly-enriched uranium for nuclear weapons...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a MIX <b>cascade</b> protocol and a reputation system that together increase {{the reliability of}} a network of MIX <b>cascades.</b> In our protocol, MIX nodes periodically generate a communally random seed that, along with their reputations, determines <b>cascade</b> configuration. Nodes send test messages to monitor their <b>cascades.</b> Senders can also demonstrate message decryptions to convince honest <b>cascade</b> members that a <b>cascade</b> is misbehaving. By allowing any node to declare the failure of its own <b>cascade,</b> we eliminate the need for global trusted witnesses...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{learning}} classifier <b>cascades</b> is considered. A new <b>cascade</b> boosting algorithm, fast <b>cascade</b> boosting (FCBoost), is proposed. FCBoost {{is shown to}} {{have a number of}} interesting properties, namely that it 1) minimizes a Lagrangian risk that jointly accounts for classification accuracy and speed, 2) generalizes adaboost, 3) can be made cost-sensitive to support the design of high detection rate <b>cascades,</b> and 4) is compatible with many predictor structures suitable for sequential decision making. It is shown that a rich family of such structures can be derived recursively from <b>cascade</b> predictors of two stages, denoted <b>cascade</b> generators. Generators are then proposed for two new <b>cascade</b> families, last-stage and multiplicative <b>cascades,</b> that generalize the two most popular <b>cascade</b> architectures in the literature. The concept of neutral predictors is finally introduced, enabling FCBoost to automatically determine the <b>cascade</b> conffguration, i. e., number of stages and number of weak learners per stage, for the learned <b>cascades.</b> Experiments on face and pedestrian detection show that the resulting <b>cascades</b> outperform current state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and speed. © 2014 Mohammad Saberian and Nuno Vasconcelos...|$|R

5|$|The {{proposed}} site in Hong Kong's Central District {{was less}} than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World WarII, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in Katonah, New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a <b>cascading</b> sequence.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, John Mauchly {{made the}} first mention of binary search {{as part of the}} Moore School Lectures, the first ever set of lectures {{regarding}} any computer-related topic. Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when Derrick Henry Lehmer published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an ALGOL 60 implementation of binary search that placed the comparison for equality at the end, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The uniform binary search was presented to Donald Knuth in 1971 by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University and published in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. In 1986, Bernard Chazelle and Leonidas J. Guibas introduced fractional <b>cascading</b> as a method to solve numerous search problems in computational geometry.|$|E

The countercurrent <b>cascade</b> system showed the traditional trade-off between yield and purity. Both the adapted <b>cascade</b> system and the non-constrained ideal <b>cascade</b> gave better performance in terms of recovery and purity and show potential for application, albeit for different purposes...|$|R

5|$|Such a <b>cascading</b> {{regulatory}} {{network has}} been studied in detail {{in the development of}} the fruit fly embryo. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a rugby ball. A small number of genes produce messenger RNAs that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the early embryo, the bicoid and hunchback genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the caudal and nanos genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of caudals messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.|$|E
5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers. The coupling problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid on-the-fly coupling of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed one extra train slot on the heavily used rail sections causing <b>cascading</b> timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them, caused by moisture in the couplers. Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains on-the-fly at the two intersection stations; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E
5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have <b>cascading</b> negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E
