2500|$|In 1667, Johann Joachim Becher {{published}} his book Physica subterranea, which contained {{the first instance}} of {{what would become the}} phlogiston theory. In his book, Becher eliminated fire, water, and air from the classical element model and replaced them with three forms of earth: terra lapidea, terra fluida, and terra pinguis. [...] Terra pinguis was the element that imparted oily, sulphurous, or combustible properties. [...] Becher believed that terra pinguis was a key feature of combustion and was released when <b>combustible</b> <b>substances</b> were burned. Becher did not {{have much to do with}} phlogiston theory as we know it now, but he had a large influence on his student Stahl. Becher's main contribution was the start of the theory itself, however much it was changed after him. Becher's idea was that <b>combustible</b> <b>substances</b> contain an ignitable matter, the terra pinguis.|$|R
50|$|Incendiary and flaming {{weapons were}} used in warfare for centuries prior to the {{invention}} of Greek fire. They included a number of sulfur-, petroleum-, and bitumen-based mixtures.

6000|$|... 613. Dr. Fusinieri {{has also}} written on this subject, and given a theory which he {{considers}} as sufficient {{to account for the}} phenomena[A]. He expresses the immediate cause thus: [...] "The platina determines upon its surface a continual renovation of concrete laminæ of the <b>combustible</b> <b>substance</b> of the gases or vapours, which flowing over it are burnt, pass away, and are renewed: this combustion at the surface raises and sustains the temperature of the metal." [...] The <b>combustible</b> <b>substance,</b> thus reduced into imperceptible laminæ, of which the concrete parts are in contact with the oxygen, is presumed to be in a state combinable with the oxygen at a much lower temperature than when it is in the gaseous state, and more in analogy with what is called the nascent condition. That combustible gases should lose their elastic state, and become concrete, assuming the form of exceedingly attenuated but solid strata, is considered as proved by facts, some of which are quoted in the Giornale di Fisica for 1824[B]; and though the theory requires that they should assume this state at high temperatures, and though the similar films of aqueous and other matter are dissipated by the action of heat, still the facts are considered as justifying the conclusion against all opposition of reasoning.|$|E
60|$|Two {{or three}} times during the first evening after the heap was lit, {{he went to the}} back door to take a survey. Before bolting and barring up for the night, he made a final and more careful examination. The slowly-smoking pile showed not the {{slightest}} signs of activity. Springrove's perfectly sound conclusion was, {{that as long as the}} heap was not stirred, and the wind continued in the quarter it blew from then, the couch would not flame, and that there could be no shadow of danger to anything, even a <b>combustible</b> <b>substance,</b> though it were no more than a yard off.|$|E
60|$|At {{another part}} the besiegers {{constructed}} great engines, such as {{were used in}} those days, {{in the absence of}} cannon, for throwing rocks and heavy beams of wood, to batter the walls. These machines also threw a certain extraordinary <b>combustible</b> <b>substance</b> called Greek fire. It was this Greek fire that, in the end, turned the scale of victory, for it caught in the lower court of the castle, where it burned so furiously that it baffled all the efforts of the besieged to extinguish it, and at length they were compelled to surrender. Edward made the principal commanders prisoners, but he let the others go free. The castle itself he utterly destroyed.|$|E
50|$|Type 10 {{enclosures}} {{are designed}} to meet the safety specifications of Mines and Health Administration as stated under part 18 of CFR 30.

50|$|In an {{improper}} installation, the overcurrent from a short circuit may cause ohmic heating of the circuit parts with poor conductivity (faulty joints in wiring, faulty contacts in power sockets, {{or even the}} site of the short circuit itself). Such overheating is a common cause of fires. An electric arc, if it forms during the short circuit, produces high amount of heat and can cause ignition of <b>combustible</b> <b>substances</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|Combustibility is {{a measure}} of how easily a {{substance}} will set on fire, through fire or combustion. This is an important property to consider when a substance is used for construction or is being stored. It is also important in processes that produce <b>combustible</b> <b>substances</b> as a by-product. Special precautions are usually required for substances that are easily combustible. These measures may include installation of fire sprinklers or storage remote from possible sources of ignition.|$|R
60|$|Suppose I {{take another}} glass jar, empty {{of all but}} air: if I examine it with a taper, I shall find that it {{contains}} nothing but air. I will now take this jar full of the gas that I am speaking of, {{and deal with it}} {{as though it were a}} light body. I will hold both upside-down, and turn the one up under the other; and that which did contain the gas procured from the steam, what does it contain now? You will find it now only contains air. But look! Here is the <b>combustible</b> <b>substance</b> [taking the other jar] which I have poured out of the one jar into the other. It still preserves its quality, and condition, and independence, and therefore is the more worthy of our consideration, as belonging to the products of a candle.|$|E
60|$|At {{the request}} of Usher, I {{personally}} aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which {{had been so long}} unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly <b>combustible</b> <b>substance,</b> as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.|$|E
60|$|For a {{time they}} were quite {{successful}} in their resistance, chiefly by means of what was called Greek fire. This Greek fire was a celebrated means of warfare in those days, and was very terrible in its nature and effects. It is not known precisely what it was, or how it was made. It was an exceedingly <b>combustible</b> <b>substance,</b> and was to be thrown, on fire, at the enemy; and such was its nature, that when once in flames nothing could extinguish it; and, besides the heat and burning that it produced, it threw out great volumes of poisonous and stifling vapors, which suffocated all that came near. The men threw it sometimes in balls, sometimes {{on the ends of}} darts and arrows, where it was enveloped in flax or tow to keep it in its place. It burned fiercely and furiously wherever it fell. Even water did not extinguish it, and it was said that in this combat the sea all around the Saracens' ship seemed on fire, and the decks of the galleys that attacked them were blazing with it in every direction. Great numbers of Richard's men were killed by it.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{should be}} stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area and away from any flammable or <b>combustible</b> <b>substances.</b> It should {{be stored in}} a container composed of non-reactive materials such as stainless steel or glass (other materials including some plastics and aluminium alloys may also be suitable). Because it breaks down quickly when exposed to light, it should be stored in an opaque container, and pharmaceutical formulations typically come in brown bottles that block light.|$|R
2500|$|The {{theory of}} phlogiston {{arose in the}} 17th century, late {{in the period of}} alchemy. Its {{replacement}} by caloric theory in the 18th century is one of the historical markers of the transition from alchemy to chemistry. [...] Phlogiston was a hypothetical substance that was presumed to be liberated from <b>combustible</b> <b>substances</b> during burning, and from metals during the process of rusting. [...] Caloric, like phlogiston, was also presumed to be the [...] "substance" [...] of heat that would flow from a hotter body to a cooler body, thus warming it.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{and future}} explorations of Mars and lunar {{surfaces}} through rovers and landers have spawned {{great interest in}} developing an instrument that can perform in-situ analysis of minerals on planetary surfaces. Several research groups have anticipated that for such analysis, Raman spectroscopy is the best suited technique because it can unambiguously provide the composition and structure of a material. A remote pulsed Raman spectroscopy system for analyzing minerals was demonstrated at NASA Langley Research Center {{in collaboration with the}} University of Hawaii. This system utilizes a 532 nm pulsed laser as an excitation wavelength, and a telescope with a 4 -inch aperture for collecting backscattered radiation. A spectrograph equipped with a super notch filter for attenuating Rayleigh scattering is used to analyze the scattered signal. To form the Raman spectrum, the spectrograph utilizes a holographic transmission grating that simultaneously disperses two spectral tracks on the detector for increased spectral range. The spectrum is recorded on an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera system, which provides high gain to allow detection of inherently weak Stokes lines. To evaluate the performance of the system, Raman standards such as calcite and naphthalene are analyzed. Several sets of rock and gemstone samples obtained from Ward s Natural Science are tested using the Raman spectroscopy system. In addition, Raman spectra of <b>combustible</b> <b>substances</b> such acetone and isopropanol are also obtained. Results obtained from those samples and <b>combustible</b> <b>substances</b> are presented...|$|R
60|$|Now, this {{substance}} {{which we}} have just prepared {{by the action of}} iron on the steam or water, we can also get by means of those other things which you have already seen act so well upon the water. If I take a piece of potassium, and make the necessary arrangements, it will produce this gas; and if, instead, a piece of zinc, I find, when I come to examine it very carefully, that the main reason why this zinc cannot act upon the water continuously as the other metal does, is because the result of the action of the water envelopes the zinc in a kind of protecting coat. We have learned in consequence, that if we put into our vessel only the zinc and water, they by themselves do not give rise to much action, and we get no result. But suppose I proceed to dissolve off this varnish--this encumbering substance--which I can do by a little acid; the moment I do this, I find the zinc acting upon the water exactly as the iron did, but at the common temperature. The acid in no way is altered, except in its combination with the oxide of zinc, which is produced. I have now poured the acid into the glass, and the effect is as though I were applying heat to cause this boiling up. There is something coming off from the zinc very abundantly, which is not steam. There is a jar full of it; and you will find that I have exactly the same <b>combustible</b> <b>substance</b> remaining in the vessel, when I hold it upside-down, that I produced during the experiment with the iron barrel. This is what we get from water--the same substance which is contained in the candle.|$|E
