[...] Recorded at Radio Recorders in Hollywood in September 1963, the girl group-styled [...] "The Home of the Boy I Love", backed with [...] "Mine 'Til Monday" [...] (Del Fi 4201), was mistakenly released with songwriting <b>credits</b> <b>given</b> to the successful team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil when {{in fact it was}} produced by Barry Mann and written by lesser known hit-man Sylvester Bradford. [...] Bradford's claim to fame was his composition of [...] "Tears On My Pillow", which was a #4 hit in 1958 for Little Anthony & The Imperials. Although Lori Martin's only record went nowhere fast, it has now become quite collectable and sought after among girl group record collectors.|$|E

2500|$|A {{short while}} after Criss' death, the band held a tribute {{show for the}} late guitarist, with the same line-up as the Streets tour but without Criss. Lead guitarist Alex Skolnick {{temporarily}} joined Savatage in 1994 {{for the release of}} their ninth album Handful of Rain, written by Jon Oliva and Paul O'Neill. Although the album is technically a Jon Oliva solo album, with Jon handling all instrumental duties except for vocals by Zachary Stevens and lead guitars by Alex Skolnick, the record was released under the Savatage moniker with bass and drum <b>credits</b> <b>given</b> to Middleton and Wacholz respectively, as drummer Andy James had left the band following the death of Criss Oliva to pursue other projects. The song [...] "Chance" [...] was the first Savatage song to contain the usage of counterpoint vocals, a style which they continued to use on following albums. The album's final track, [...] "Alone You Breathe", was a tribute to Criss Oliva.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Barry was Postmaster-General at {{the times}} of making the {{contracts}} and the attempted transfer of them; Mr. Kendall succeeded Mr. Barry, and finding Reeside apparently in debt to the department, and these contracts still standing {{in the names of}} Reeside and Avery, refused to pay for the services under them, otherwise than by credits to Reeside; afterward, however, he divided the compensation, still crediting one half to Reeside, and directing the other to be paid to the order of Avery, who disclaimed all right to it. After discontinuing the service, these petitioners, supposing they might have legal redress against Avery, brought suit against him in New Orleans; in which suit they failed, on the ground that Avery had complied with his contract, having done so much toward the transfer as they had accepted and been satisfied with. Still later the department sued Reeside on his supposed indebtedness, and by a verdict of the jury it was determined that the department was indebted to him in a sum much beyond all the <b>credits</b> <b>given</b> him on the account above stated. Under these circumstances, the committee consider the petitioners clearly entitled to relief, and they report a bill accordingly; lest, however, there should be some mistake as to the amount which they have already received, we so frame it as that, by adjustment at the department, they may be paid so much as remains unpaid for services actually performed by them not charging them with the <b>credits</b> <b>given</b> to Reeside. The committee think it not improbable that the petitioners purchased the right of Avery to be paid for the service from the 1st of January, till their purchase on May 11, 1835; but, the evidence on this point being very vague, they forbear to report in favor of allowing it.|$|E
