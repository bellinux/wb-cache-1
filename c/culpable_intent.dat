For his revolutionary and progressive ideal, Ascher saw it realized first in the Prussian State, then in the political system of Napoleon. The Empire had a certain nationalism and intolerance, without the groundwork for a more harmonious world order.|$|E
50|$|In the 1946 case, Commonwealth v. Malone, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{affirmed the}} {{conviction}} of a teenager on the charge of second degree murder using the depraved-heart doctrine. The teenager in question {{had set up a}} game of Russian roulette which ended in the death of another teenager, a friend of the defendant. When tried for the crime of murder, his defense argued that since he had no intent to kill, the defendant could not be convicted of murder. The prosecution successfully argued using the depraved-heart doctrine that his recklessness and carelessness amounted to a level of negligence sufficient to serve as evidence of criminally <b>culpable</b> <b>intent.</b>|$|E
50|$|Larceny is a {{crime against}} possession. Furthermore, it has two {{elements}} which must be met, the actual taking of the property, even if momentarily (actus reus) and the <b>culpable</b> <b>intent</b> to deprive another of their property (mens rea). Larceny involves the trespassory taking of property from possession of another, {{with the intent to}} permanently deprive the owner of that property. To understand larceny, one must understand the distinction between custody and possession. A person has possession of property when he has actual physical control over the property (actual possession) or he has the right to exercise considerable control over the disposition or use of the property (constructive possession). A person has custody if he has actual physical control of the property but the person who has constructive possession has substantially restricted the custodian's right to use the property. Examples of custody would be a store customer examining the goods of a merchant, or an employee who has been given the property of his employer to be used in his employment. This is to be contested to, for example, a person who has obtained actual possession of the property by fraud.|$|E

50|$|Whereas the condictio furtiva and the actio ad exhibendum {{each has}} its own {{particular}} application (theft and bad-faith disposal respectively), the actio legis Aquiliae is a general delictual action to claim compensation in all cases where property has been destroyed or damaged by the defendant in a wrongful and culpable manner. The usual requirements for delictual liability pertain: There must be (i) an action or omission (ii) performed with a <b>culpable</b> disposition (<b>intent</b> or negligence) which (iii) results in damage or injury to the owner.|$|R
40|$|Constitutional rights pivot on {{problems}} of proof. But traditional academic distinctions between “procedural” {{rules of evidence}} and “substantive” questions of constitutional law impede {{our understanding of how}} law works. In particular, how law works to identify, constrain, and remedy police abuse of constitutional rights. Treating rights and remedies as abstract concepts ignores the fact that the exclusionary rule functions as a rule of evidence. In theory, remedies are the life force of rights. In practice, constitutional violations are currently remediable only if a defendant can prove that he suffered intentional police abuse or prove that a police officer knew but ignored constitutional constraints. The problem of proving that police officers act with demonstrably <b>culpable</b> <b>intent</b> is also {{at the core of the}} Black Lives Matter cases. The growing number of acquittals and grand jury non-indictments following the police-custody and police-seizure deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, and other victims of police violence reveals that judges and juries refuse to believe that police officers are culpable lawbreakers. Preventing and resolving these cases may be further complicated by a “Ferguson Effect,” causing public distrust of police and police fear and disinterest especially in minority urban communities. The long-term implications of these new developments on national and local strategies for policing the police are manifold and uncertain. The short-term lessons are clear and should be obvious. Over the past decade, the Roberts Court has expanded police authority and reduced Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable police abuse by repeatedly refusing to recognize police aggression as remediable. In each new case, most recently in Utah v. Strieff, the defendant seeking to suppress even obviously illegally-seized evidence faces the insurmountable burden of proving the police officers acted intentionally, recklessly, or with gross negligence under the Roberts Court’s increasingly stringent “flagrant police abuse standard. ” The flagrant police abuse suppression standard hypothesizes the possibility that the average criminal defendant could gather proof sufficient to convince a judge that a police officer acted: (1) illegally and (2) with the necessary mentally culpability. But each new Fourth Amendment decision from the Court ignores the reality repeatedly uncovered in the Black Lives Matter cases. If, as the Black Lives Matter cases prove, prosecutors’ offices with their resources, access, and institutional police connections cannot prove that officers break the law, what hope is there for the average criminal defendant? The exclusionary rule celebrated its centenary just three years ago. But Strieff is the latest example of the Court’s dangerous new Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that incentivizes aggressive policing (including suspicion-less police seizures), ignores obvious obstacles to defense proof of police wrongdoing, and invites prosecutors to feast on the illegal fruit of police abuse of fundamental rights...|$|E
