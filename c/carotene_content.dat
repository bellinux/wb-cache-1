40|$|Abstract: Deficiency {{of vitamin}} A in the diets {{represents}} one of the key challenges affecting the developing world. However, beta-carotene is the most available/important source of pro-vitamin A in the diets of most people living in developing countries. It reportedly provides about 66 % of vitamin A in their diets. In West Africa, much carotenoid is obtained from red palm oil, which is widely used in cooking. However, {{it has been reported that}} these available sources of pro-vitamin A are very often neglected by children and pregnant women who are more vulnerable or at risk of vitamin A deficiency. Also amount of dietary intakes of beta-carotene of Nigerians is not known. This study therefore aimed at determining the beta-carotene contents of some selected commonly consumed foods and soups in Nigeria. These foods and the soups were selected to reflect consumption across the three agro-ecological zones in Nigeria. Food samples were purchased from food vendors and were also obtained from people from these zones. The extraction of beta carotene in the matrices of the food samples was done using a modified method; while the determination of the beta <b>carotene</b> <b>contents</b> of the extracts was done using the ultra violet visible spectrophotometer. The beta <b>carotene</b> <b>contents</b> of the foods varied in each food group and the values obtained were similar to the values previously reported in the literature. Soups and stews had the highest concentrations of beta carotene. Also foods such as “moinmoin”, “akara”, bean porridge and yam pottage prepared with red pal...|$|R
50|$|As with {{traditional}} QTL mapping strategies, the general goal in Nested Association Mapping is to correlate a phenotype of interest with specific genotypes.

40|$|Nine yellow {{root and}} one white root cassava genotypes were {{evaluated}} in ten environments in Ghana for {{the variability of}} their beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> in root. The aim was to identify cassava genotypes that have high beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> in storage root to combat the widespread vitamin A deficiency for {{children under the age}} of five years and for pregnant and lactating women. This study was conducted in a Randomized Complete Bloc Design with nine yellow root genotypes namely 01 / 1224; 01 / 1235; 01 / 1368; 01 / 1371; 01 / 1412; 01 / 1417; 01 / 1442; 01 / 1610; 01 / 1663 and one white root cassava namely Wenchi 009 as check. In 2005 - 2006 two experiments were conducted at Wenchi in the Forest-Savannah Transition zone and at Bunso in the Deciduous Forest zone and in 2006 - 2007, one additional location namely Pokuase in the costal savannah zone was added to Wenchi and Bunso to conduct the same field experiment. Each experiment was harvested two times (9 and 12 or 14 months after planting). At each harvest, beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> analyses were carried out on yellow root cassava at the Nutrition Lab of Noguchi Medical Research Centre using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a mobile phase made of acetonitrile: dichloromethane: methanol in the ratio 70 : 20 : 10 at a flow rate of 2. 5 ml/min. Data collected were analyzed using the computer software GenStat Discovery Edition Release 4. 2 DE; MATMODEL 3. 0; GGE biplot. Analyses of results showed statistically significant differences between genotypes for beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> per root, beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> in storage root per plant and but no difference for beta carotene concentration. The best genotype for beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> was 01 / 1417 follow by 01 / 1371 and 01 / 1368. The differences between environments were highly significant for all beta carotene traits. The highest value of beta carotene concentration in fresh root was recorded in environments E, E, E and E. 9 1 7 5 These environments were all characterized by harvest at 9 months after planting. For beta carotene concentration, beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> per storage root and beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> in storage roots per plant the best environments were E (9 9 MAP at Pokuase) and E (9 MAP at Wenchi in 1 2005). The IMMI analysis has shown 01 / 1412 the most stable for beta carotene concentration. The highest average value of beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> per storage root was registered for genotype 01 / 1253 followed by 01 / 1417 and 01 / 1412.

Berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum), lucerne (Medicago sativa), oats (Avena sativa), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), bajra (Pennisetum ryphoidium), mazenta (Maize x Teopak), sadabahar (Sorghum x Sudan grass) and cowpeas (Vigna sinensis) were analyzed for proximate composition, cell wall constituents, macro and micro minerals and <b>carotene</b> <b>contents.</b> In berseem fodder initial cuttings were more creditable with regard to crude protein and <b>carotene</b> <b>contents,</b> while these were low in fibre contents. The second and third cuttings. could be preferred but the varieties did not exhibit any remarkable variability. Variations in minerals were inconsistent. In lucerne fodder the variations due to varieties as well as cuttings with regard to chemical composition were not marked. Initial three cuttings of oats, fodder had better nutritive merits than fourth one which had comparatively less nutrients. Minerals were equally at moderate level but sodium and copper were much less. Carotene was also lesser at 4 th growth stage. No prominent variations were found among varieties regarding nutritive values. In sorghum fodder various nutritive components among different varieties were not of high magnitude. Sodium, phosphorus, copper and zinc were much lower in all varieties and at all growth stages. Multicut bajra did not show marked variations in nutritive components due to cuttings. The varietal differences were also not so wide. All four cuttings of different varieties may be equally accepted for animals feeding. Marginal zinc. contents were observed at 3 rd and 4 th cuts of this fodder. The effect of growth stages on mazenta fodder was not marked, but for sodium and zinc contents, this fodder may fulfil the animal needs. Fourth growth stage had lower CP, the initial three growth stages could therefore be preferred. The growth stages were not much variable with regard to nutrients composition in sadabahar fodder. All the four stages of cutting could be equally preferred for feeding provided these are equally palatable. Cowpeas fodder did not show wide compositional variation among different growth stages. The nutritive value remained fairly constant during all the stages of cutting. It may be {{concluded that there was}} no prominant discrimination for varietal selection in any fodder.

The objective of this work was to study the range of variability for <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> in a sub-set of the global cassava germplasm collection, and to determine the inheritance of carotenes, {{as well as their}} stability in response to different processing methodologies. Genotypes with more than 2 mg carotenes/ 100 g of fresh roots have been selected as parental material for population development. Although root colour is highly correlated with <b>carotene</b> <b>content,</b> a quantitative evaluation of genotypes selected by colour is required in order to increase the efficiency of selection. Relatively few major genes are involved in the determination of carotene accumulation in cassava roots. Stability of carotenes in response to different processing methods is genotypically dependant, representing a trait to be evaluated after selecting for high carotene concentration in fresh roots. The results from this work have provided the basis for defining future strategies for the improvement of the nutritional quality of cassava. Peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|General and {{specific}} environmental adaptation of genotypes {{is the main}} goal of breeders. However, genotype-by-environment (G × E) interaction complicates the identification of genotypes for release. This study aimed at analyzing the effects of G × E interaction on the expression of important cassava traits using two multivariate analyses: additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype stability index (GSI). Total <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> (TCC), postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD), and reaction to viral diseases were significantly affected by G × E interaction effects. The low percent (%) variation due to genotype for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) explained the influence of environment on CBSD expression. The % variation due to genotype for TCC was higher (96 %) than variation due to environment (1. 7 %) and G × E interaction (2. 4 %) indicating a low interaction effect of environment on TCC accumulation. The % variation due to genotype was higher than % variation due to environment for all traits but CBSD root necrosis and CBSD on stems, indicating the influence of environment on {{the severity of the}} viral diseases. These findings indicate that screening for disease resistance requires multi-environment trials, whereas a single-environment trial suffices to screen for total <b>carotene</b> <b>content...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of particle size on the chemical properties of yam flour in five cultivars, yellow/YY, orange/OY, light purple/LPY, purple/PY, and dark purple/DPY. With a mesh sieve, three flour fractions were separated according to particle size: small (128. 6 - 139. 7 µm), medium (228. 7 - 257. 9 µm), and large (475. 4 - 596. 3 µm). The content of moisture (6. 81 - 11. 26 %db) and lipids (4. 48 - 9. 85 %db) decreased with the increase of particle size, while proteins (4. 48 - 9. 85 %db) and carbohydrates (78. 12 - 83. 76 %db) were not influenced by particle size. Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and chlorogenic acid were used as standard to investigate the total phenolic compounds in the yam flour, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to investigate the anthocyanin and <b>carotene</b> <b>contents.</b> It was found that there was no size influence on the content of phenolics (0. 27 - 2. 82 %db), anthocyanin (2. 25 - 15. 27 mg/ 100 g db) in LPY, PY, DPY or carotene (23. 75 - 132. 12 mg/ 100 g db) in YY, OY. The differences in chemical composition were due to differences in particle size and heat treatment, but may also have been caused by the different composition of the milling process...|$|R
40|$|Deacidification {{is one of}} {{the steps}} in palm oil {{refining}} process which aims to separate free fatty acids formed during post-harvest handling. It is carried out using alkali solution such as NaOH (sodium hydroxide). Carotenoids in palm oil are affected by this step. Therefore, deacidification has to be controlled to minimize the destruction of carotenoids during processing. The objective of this research was to improve deacidification process in pilot plant scale so that the process can produce lower level of free fatty acids (FFA) and higher recovery of carotene in high yield neutralized red palm oil (NRPO). Characterization of physical and chemical properties of crude palm oil (CPO) such as moisture <b>content,</b> FFA and <b>carotene</b> <b>contents,</b> saponification number, iodine value, peroxide value, and color were determined before processing. Degumming was performed before deacidification process. The 17. 5 % excess of NaOH was obtained from the pilot plant scale deacidification trial. The optimization of deacidification time and temperature was carried out by using central composite design (CCD). Response surface method (RSM) was used to observe the influence of treatments on the FFA level reduction, carotene recovery, and NRPO yield. The result showed that the optimum deacidification condition was at 61 ± 2 °C in 26 minutes, and at the 16 °Be NaOH strength with 17. 5 % excess of NaOH. In this optimum condition, the process achieved 96. 35 % of FFA reduction, 87. 30 % of carotene recovery, and 90. 16 % of NRPO yield...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to isolate groups of {{bioactive}} compounds of biological interest from some varieties of pepper (Capsicum) grown and consumed in Côte d'Ivoire, to assess the ability of organic solvent to extract these compounds and to determine ascorbic acid and beta-carotene content. Polar, non polar and acid compounds of intermediate polarity obtained by thin layer chromatography (TLC) were used to isolate from the acetone extracts, from 33 to 34 compounds for C. annuum and from 27 to 33 for C. frutescens. The number of lipid compounds isolated from C. annuum varies from 32 to 33 and 24 to 29 in C. frutescens. The total non-lipid compounds obtained by the dichloromethane, acetone and methanol extract ranges from 88 to 103 for C. annuum, and from 84 to 96 for C. frutescens. The number of lipid compounds was higher for C. annuum than for C. frutescens. The lipid compounds and non-lipid compounds were highly variable depending on the variety of Capsicum. The ascorbic acid and beta <b>carotene</b> <b>contents</b> were obtained by High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Beta-carotene content in pepper studied ranged from 68 to 535 µg 100 g- 1 FW and ascorbic acid from 86 to 96 mg 100 g- 1 FW. The current study {{may contribute to the}} knowledge of the nutritional and the bioactive compounds of the fruit and may offer knowledge of the potential health benefits for bell pepper consumers in Côte d’Ivoire. ...|$|R
40|$|Extracting {{high quality}} Crude Palm Oil (CPO) from {{optimised}} sterilisation process might provide solution for insufficient supply's {{issue of the}} oil. The study was performed by using different degree of Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) ripeness and loose fruits. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) approach was applied, based on the interrelation between process temperature (X₁; 100 to 120 °C), time (X₂; 20 to 80 min), and CPO quality parameters (Y₁, Free Fatty Acid (FFA); Y₂, Peroxide Value (PV); Y₃, Deterioration of Bleachability Index (DOBI); and Y₄, <b>carotene</b> <b>content).</b> FFA was recorded increases as theFFB ripen. Though there was no apparent PV difference noticed at underripe, ripe and overripe FFB, substantial increment was recorded on loose fruits. No specific patterns observed for both DOBl and <b>carotene</b> <b>content.</b> Sixteen polynomial models were developed with models' significance at p< 0. 05 and R² approximating 1. There was a strong effect of temperature on FFA, as X₁, were found highly significant at all degree of ripeness. Process time was found more pronounced influencing the PV from underripe and ripe FFB and the role was dominated by temperature as the maturity increases. Stronger effect of time recorded on DOBI, with p< 0. 0001 (underripe, ripe and overripe FFB) and p= 0. 0077 (loose fruits). For <b>carotene</b> <b>content,</b> both temperature and time were mutually responsible on carotene destruction at any degree of ripeness. Optimum sterilisation conditions were determined and verified. Both underripe and ripe FFB show potential for extracting Premium Quality CPO at 100 °c and 20 min while overripe FFB is suitable for extraction of Special Quality CPO at 111. 3 °C and 36. 52 min. Palm oil producers should consider for segregating the FFB according to ripeness, instead of simply mixing up the received crop for processing. The extraction of high quality CPO from different degree of FFB ripeness is feasible {{as long as the}} right combination of sterilisation process heating parameters employed...|$|E
40|$|For {{practical}} reasons Spinacia oleracea {{was chosen for}} these pot experiments in a greenhouse. For the quantitative estimation of carotene, a short method was developed. The vitamin C content of leaves decreased rapidly at room temperature and even at ice-box temperature, so analysis had to be rapid (titration with 2, 6 - dichlorophenolindophenol in acid medium). The pots contained pure washed quartz sand or an exactly analysed sandy soil, and were supplied with Krnger's nutrient solution. Increasing the N supply increased the carotene and vitamin C content. Increasing K supply decreased <b>carotene</b> <b>content,</b> but increased vitamin C content. But decrease in <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> was only obvious in plants grown with little N. The increase of vitamin C content was usually most distinct in plants grown with much N, although it was fairly clear in the whole combined experiment. The influence of P, Ca and Mg salts was small. A final section attempts to interpret the data to demonstrate a relation between chlorophyll and carotene. Ascorbic acid {{was considered to be}} a product of photo- synthesis. This could explain the peculiar course of carotene and vitamin C contents with K fertilizers. K deficiency acted as a N excess, while K excess acted as N deficiency. <p/...|$|E
30|$|Beta <b>carotene</b> <b>content</b> was low (12.60 – 17.70  μg/g dry weight) {{but within}} the range of other {{reported}} ß-carotene values in wild mushrooms (2.52 – 75.48  µg/g dry weight, Barros et al. 2008). Chye et al. (2008) reported higher concentration of ß-carotenes in Malaysia’s wild mushrooms ranging from 0.37 to 2, 711  μg/g fresh weight suggesting a loss of this vitamin during drying. However, cultivated mushrooms are reported to have lower concentrations (7.24  μg/g) than the mushrooms in this study. β-carotene is an important antioxidant required for stimulating the growth of new skin cells (Shukkit-Hale et al. 2006; Elmastas et al. 2007).|$|E
30|$|Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) drying {{is a novel}} non-thermal {{technique}} that has been developed (Basiry and Esehaghbeygi 2010; Esehaghbeygi and Basiry 2011; Bai et al. 2012). Isobe et al. (1999) indicated that the drying rate of agar gel under the EHD system was about 3 {{times faster than the}} control. Hashinaga et al. (1999) found that application of EHD accelerated the initial drying rate of apple slices by 4.5 times over the ambient air drying. In a separate study, some authors conducted a set of EHD experiments on okara cake (Li et al. 2006), sea cucumber (Bai et al. 2013), Japanese radish (Bajgai and Hashinaga 2001 b), wheat (Cao et al. 2004 a), mushroom slices (Dinani and Havet 2015), carrot slices (Alemrajabi et al. 2012), etc., and found that the drying rate under EHD system is greater than the control. Bajgai and Hashinaga (2001 a) found that ascorbic acid contents in spinach were substantially higher after EHD drying than after oven drying. Ding et al. (2015) demonstrated that the application of EHD contributed toward an increase by 11.53  % in the <b>carotene</b> <b>contents</b> of dried carrots, compared to oven drying. Bai et al. (2013) found that sea cucumbers dried by EHD displayed much higher protein values, which is more than that of those dried oven. Compared to hot air drying, some studies found that EHD drying offers superior quality in terms of such physiochemical properties as color, shrinkage, and nutrient content (Dinani et al. 2015). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have reported on the drying of Chinese wolfberry using EHD.|$|R
40|$|Palm olein (PO) and {{red palm}} olein (RPO) {{are rich in}} {{tocopherols}} and tocotrienols. In addition, RPO also contains a high <b>content</b> of <b>carotene.</b> This {{study was to determine}} the effect of chronic intake of diets containing palm oils, varying in their vitamin E and <b>carotene</b> <b>contents,</b> on lipid profile in rats. Weaning male Wistar rats were fed either 18 % RPO, 18 % PO or 18 % vitamin E-stripped palm olein (SPO) for 12 weeks. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) were measured at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Feeding the different types of palm oil did not affect TC and HDL from week 4 through week 12, but there were reductions in TG in all dietary groups at week 12 compared to week 4 but differences between groups were not observed. The RPO group had lower LDL at week 12 (vs weeks 4 and 8) but LDL was not reduced in the PO and SPO groups. TC/HDL was reduced in the RPO group at week 12 compared to both weeks 4 and 8, but the PO group only reduced this ratio at week 12 compared to week 4. This finding suggests that chronic feeding of diets high in palm oils did not cause any detrimental effects on blood lipid profile. In addition, red palm olein which is rich in antioxidants in the forms of vitamin E and carotene, showed better effect in terms of reduction in LDL and TC/HDL...|$|R
40|$|Market {{price of}} red emperor snapper Lutjanus sebae is often {{determined}} by its color performance. Adding beta-carotene on a fish diet would possibly escalate red pigmentation.

The dosage of 10, 5, and 0 ml were added to every kg of pellet as the treatment. Three hundred seeds with initial average length of 8. 43 ± 0. 9 cm and body weight of 13. 22 ± 3. 9 g were stocked in each of three unit fiberglass tank of 4 m 3 seawater (salinity of 33 - 34). Experiment was conducted during three-month periods. Feeding frequency was twice a day with dosage of 3 % of biomass. Monthly monitoring was done to measure the growth rate. Color performance was taken by digital photography at the end of observation and analyzed by conversion methods of color gradation using “Microsoft Adobe Photoshop- 8 ”program. <b>Carotene</b> <b>contents</b> in the diets and fish body was examined.
