When axial symmetry is {{broken by the}} small misalignments of optical elements, additional third-order aberration patterns arise: one each for coma, astigmatism and <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> and two for distortion. Each of these misalignment patterns is characterized by an associated two-dimensional vector, each of {{which in turn is}} a linear combination of the tilt and decenter vectors of the individual optical elements. For an N-mirror telescope, 2 (N- 1) patterns must be measured to keep the telescope aligned. Alignment of the focal plane may require two additional patterns. For N = 3, as in a three mirror anastigmat, there is a two-dimensional "subspace of benign misalignment" over which the misalignment patterns for third-order coma, astigmatism and <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> are identically zero.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{accurate}} depth measurement in depth from focus is presented. With depth from focus the 3 D shape of objects can be measured. To do so, an image series with different distances between camera and object is evaluated to extract focused parts. Combining {{the results of}} an edge detection filter with the distance information at which the images have been acquired provides a depth image of the object. The focus information is influenced by optical aberrations. Especially the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> leads to a significant error in the depth image. This error can be seen by measuring the depth information of a planar object with depth from focus. The error in the depth image is approximated by fitting a second order surface to the depth image. To overcome the influence of outliers in the depth image a robust least-squares fitting with suppression of outliers is used. The second order surface is then used to correct depth images, which reduces the influence of the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> on the depth data and leads to more accurate 3 D measurements. * Corresponding author. 1...|$|E
40|$|Observations of {{the thermal}} X-ray {{emission}} from radio pulsars implicate {{that the size}} of hot spots is much smaller then the size of the polar cap that follows from the purely dipolar geometry of pulsar magnetic field. Most plausible explanation of this phenomena is an assumption that the magnetic field at the stellar surface differs essentially from the purely dipolar field. We can determine magnetic field at the surface by the conservation of the magnetic flux through the area bounded by open magnetic field lines. Then the value of the surface magnetic field can be estimated as of the order of $ 10 ^{ 14 }$ G. On the other hand observations show that the temperature of the hot spot is about a few million Kelvins. Based on these observations the Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model was proposed which assumes that the temperature of the actual polar cap (hot spot) equals to the so called critical temperature. We discuss correlation between the temperature and corresponding area of the thermal X-ray emission for a number of pulsars. The results of our analysis show that the PSG model is suitable to explain both cases: when the hot spot is smaller and larger then conventional polar cap. We argue that in the second case structure and <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> lines allow pair creation in the closed field lines region thus the secondary particles can heat the stellar surface outside the actual polar cap. We have found that the Curvature Radiation (CR) plays dominant role in avalanche pair production in the PSG.

To receive such a beamed emission, the line-of-sight must align with the tangent within the beaming angle 1 /γ, where γ is the particle Lorentz factor.

We find the outer conal components are emitted at higher altitudes compared to the inner components including the core. At any pulse phase, low frequency emission comes from the higher altitudes than the high frequency emission.

First, they achieve high accuracy (&asymp; 1. 2 voxels, equivalent to 0. 4 m) by using landmarks, rather than intensity correlations, and by using a high-dimensional affine and quadratic transformation model that accounts for 3 D translation, rotation, non-isotropic scaling, modest <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>field,</b> distortions and mechanical inconsistencies introduced by the imaging system.

40|$|The Dirac {{equation}} {{describes the}} motion of electrons in electromagnetic field, but it considers spin as intrinsic property without any real motion. We postulate spin as the intrinsic feature of vacuum, in which the incident electromagnetic radiation can create vortices with well defined spinning frequency and completely undefined axis of rotation. The vortices have finite surface determined by the spinning frequency that makes the peripheral speed equal to the velocity of light. According to the Lorentz equations of special relativity, the product of radius and mass of rotating objects is independent of the frequency of rotation and it is equal to 3 / 4 h/ 2 pic for all fermions. This invariance explains how the light with infinite spatial dimension and zero mass can produce finite mass and size for the particles in the pair-creation processes. The vortex model interprets the rest energy as the kinetic energy of spinning motion. The isotropic character of spinning can be represented by helical motion with right or left-handed chirality corresponding to the duality of matter and anti-matter. Conservation rule is proposed for the chirality explaining the electron-positron annihilation and the pair-creation processes.

40|$|We {{have tested}} {{the ability of}} driven {{turbulence}} to generate magnetic field structure from a weak uniform field using three dimensional numerical simulations of incompressible turbulence. We used a pseudo-spectral code with a numerical resolution of up to $ 144 ^ 3 $ collocation points. We find that the magnetic fields are amplified through field line stretching at a rate proportional {{to the difference between}} the velocity and the magnetic field strength times a constant. Equipartition between the kinetic and magnetic energy densities occurs at a scale somewhat smaller than the kinetic energy peak. Above the equipartition scale the velocity structure is, as expected, nearly isotropic. The magnetic field structure at these scales is uncertain, but the field correlation function is very weak. At the equipartition scale the magnetic fields show only a moderate degree of anisotropy, so that the typical radius of <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> lines is comparable to the typical perpendicular scale for field reversal. In other words, there are few field reversals within eddies at the equipartition scale, and no fine-grained series of reversals at smaller scales. At scales below the equipartition scale, both velocity and magnetic structures are anisotropic; the eddies are stretched along the local magnetic field lines, and the magnetic energy dominates the kinetic energy on the same scale by a factor which increases at higher wavenumbers. We do not show a scale-free inertial range, but the power spectra are a function of resolution and/or the imposed viscosity and resistivity. Our results are consistent with the emergence of a scale-free inertial range at higher Reynolds numbers. Comment: 14 pages (8 NEW figures), ApJ, in press (July 20, 2000 ?...|$|E

The source is suddenly switched on at a definite moment and works as e−iω 0 t during the finite time interval. The influence of factors which lead to the difference of toroidal and poloidal eigenfrequencies (like <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> lines and finite plasma pressure) is taken into account. Due to these factors, a radial component of the group velocity of Alfvén wave appears. An important value is the time moment, t 0, when a wave front moving with radial component of wave group velocity from the poloidal surface (a magnetic surface where the source frequency ω 0 coincides with the poloidal frequency) passes the given magnetic shell with the radial coordinate x. The temporal evolution at all the points, where the front has not come yet, {{is determined by the}} phase mixing of the initial disturbance. At the points through which the wave front has already passed, the wave field structure almost coincides with the structure of monochromatic wave. The region where the front propagates is bounded by the interval between the poloidal surface and the toroidal one (that is, the Alfvén resonance surface). For this reason, outside this region the evolution is always determined by the phase mixing, which leads to much smaller amplitudes than between poloidal and toroidal surfaces. After the source turned off, a back wave front is formed, which comes through the given point in direction from the poloidal surface to the toroidal one. After the back front has come, the monochromatic wave structure disappears and there is only a weak disturbance, which steadily disappears because of the phase mixing and the final conductivity of ionosphere.|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} technology of large (~ 10, 000 pixel) submillimeter-wave bolometer arrays presents a novel optical design problem [...] -how can such arrays be fed by diffraction-limited telescope optics where {{the primary mirror}} is less than 100, 000 wavelengths in diameter? Standard Cassegrain designs for radiotelescope optics exhibit focal surface curvature so large that detectors cannot be placed more than 25 beam diameters from the central ray. The problem is worse for Ritchey-Cretien designs, because these minimize coma while increasing field curvature. Classical aberrations, including coma, are usually dominated by diffraction in submillimeter-wave single dish telescopes. The telescope designer must consider (1) diffraction, (2) aberration, (3) <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> <b>field,</b> (4) cross-polarization, (5) internal reflections, (6) the effect of blockages, (7) means of beam chopping on- and off-source, (8) gravitational and thermal deformations of the primary mirror, (9) the physical mounting of large detector packages, and (10) the effect of gravity and (11) vibration on those detectors. Simultaneous optimization of these considerations {{in the case of}} large detector arrays leads to telescopes that differ considerably from standard radiotelescope designs. Offset optics provide flexibility for mounting detectors, while eliminating blockage and internal reflections. Aberrations and cross-polarization can be the same as on-axis designs having the same diameter and focal length. Trade-offs include the complication of primary mirror homology and an increase in overall cost. A dramatic increase in usable field of view can be achieved using shaped optics. Solutions having one to six mirrors will be discussed, including a possible six-mirror design for the proposed South Pole 10 m telescope.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{structure}} <b>of</b> magnetic <b>field</b> lines {{in and around}} filaments in simulations of molecular clouds undergoing global, multi-scale gravitational collapse. In these simulations, filaments {{are not in a}} static equilibrium, but are long-lived flow structures that accrete gas from their environment and direct it toward clumps embedded in the filament or at the nodes at the conjunction with other filaments. In this context, the magnetic field is dragged by the collapsing gas, so its structure must reflect the flow that generates the filament. Around the filament, the gas is accreted onto it, and the magnetic lines must then be perpendicular to the filament. As the gas density increases, the gas flow changes direction, becoming almost parallel to the filament, and magnetic lines also tend to align with it. At the spine of the filament, however, magnetic lines become perpendicular again since they must connect to lines {{on the opposite side of}} the filament, resulting in "U"-shaped magnetic structures, which tend to be stretched by the longitudinal flow along the filament. Magnetic diffusive processes, however, allow the gas to continue to flow. Assuming a stationary state in which the ram pressure of the flow balances the magnetic tension, the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> lines is determined by the diffusion rate.

We show that the projective structure of the β-surfaces of a selfdual manifold is flat. 1...|$|R
