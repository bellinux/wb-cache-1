5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international <b>consensus</b> <b>on</b> risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E
5|$|Halley was {{the first}} comet to be {{recognized}} as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical <b>consensus</b> <b>on</b> the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In Han government, {{the emperor}} was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority <b>consensus</b> <b>on</b> an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.|$|E

5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no <b>consensus</b> <b>on</b> whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports bone health.|$|E
5|$|King Stephen II died {{in early}} 1131. A late sourcethe Ottoman Turkish chronicle known as Tarih-i Üngürüs or The History of the Hungariansnarrates that Béla ascended the throne after his predecessor's nephew, Saul whom Stephen II had {{nominated}} as his heir had died. Béla II was crowned in Székesfehérvár on 28 April, substantiating {{the reliability of}} this report. However, no scholarly <b>consensus</b> <b>on</b> the exact circumstances of Béla's ascension exists. According to Gyula Kristó, Béla was crowned by Archbishop Felician after a civil war between his and Saul's partisans, but Pál Engel does not mention any conflict related to Béla's succession.|$|E
5|$|Main {{supporters}} of the bill were the LDP and the Komeito (CGP), while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (CPJ), who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era. The CPJ was further opposed for not allowing the issue {{to be decided by}} the public. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could not develop party <b>consensus</b> <b>on</b> it. President of the DPJ, Naoto Kan stated that the DPJ must support the bill because the party already recognized both symbols as the symbols of Japan. Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister Yukio Hatoyama thought that this bill would cause further divisions among society and the public schools.|$|E
