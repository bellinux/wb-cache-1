One could almost fancy the actual {{generation}} held their breath, and stole by on tiptoe, in presence of so memorable a past. But during the Carnival all mankind, womankind and childkind think it unbecoming {{not to play}} the fool. The modern donkey pokes its {{head out of the}} lion's skin of old Rome, and brays out the absurdest of asinine roundelays. Conceive twenty thousand grown people in a long street, at the windows, on the footways, and in carriages, amused day after day for several hours in pelting and being pelted with handfuls of mock or real sugar-plums; and this no name or presence, but real downright showers of plaster comfits, from which people guard their eyes with meshes of wire.

50|$|In {{its basic}} and {{standard}} configuration, {{each of the}} belt-mounted components is secured to the belt {{by a pair of}} double hooks (one double hook only {{in the case of the}} compass pouch) at the rear, hooked over the belt above and below, with the ends of the hooks further retained in <b>canvas</b> <b>pockets</b> on the inside face of the belt. However, variations are to be found - including water bottle pouches and ammunition pouches for non-standard personal weapons fitted with a canvas loop into which the belt is threaded, rather than the metal hooks. This method of attachment allows the pouch to be moved around the belt for the comfort of the user, for example when sitting for long periods.|$|R
