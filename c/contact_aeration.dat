40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} using the Johkasou system {{installed at the}} Gunma National College of Technology, which uses a <b>contact</b> <b>aeration</b> process to effect water treatment. This system does not have denitrification capabilities. Several intermittent aeration modes were surveyed to investigate their effects on the total nitrogen (T–N) removal performance and energy efficiency. The water temperature was significantly correlated with the decreased velocity of dissolved oxygen (DO); the decreases at 25 and 23 °C were 1. 4 and 1. 2 mg・(L∙hr) − 1, respectively. The aeration time required to achieve DO 0 mg・L− 1 was more than 6 h. The time required upon restarting to reacquire the DO value observed during aeration was 30 min. It was thought that an aeration period exceeding 3 h was necessary for denitrification. Intermittent aeration times of 3 and 6 h exhibited good biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values at more than 25 °C. However, at water temperatures lower than 20 °C, the effluent BOD was approximately 3 times higher, denitrification did not proceed, and the NH 4 -N concentration became high. The denitrification effect {{was not able to}} expect the big effect in comparison with consecutive aeration mode. As a result of this study, we concluded that the most suitable operating conditions for intermittent aeration would employ a 3 h application from December to April, and a 6 h application from May to November. The energy costs were calculated to be 1, 120, 000 yen∙year− 1 based on the most suitable operating conditions. In comparison to the consecutive aeration mode, the energy, environmental, and cost savings with intermittent aeration were calculated to be 38, 500 kWh, 15. 6 t-CO 2, and 730, 000 yen per year...|$|E
40|$|AbstractImmobilized {{polyaniline}} {{on glass}} plates (PANI/glass) and its powder form were compared for the adsorption of methyl orange (MO) dye from aqueous solutions. The effects of operational parameters such as pH, sorbent dosage, initial concentration, <b>contact</b> time, <b>aeration</b> {{rate and the}} thermodynamics of the uptake of MO had been exhaustively evaluated. The maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) for PANI/glass and PANI powder was 93 and 147 mgg− 1, respectively. In addition, pseudo-second order model was the best fitted kinetic model for both systems, suggesting that the rate-limiting step may be chemisorptions. The obtained negative values of free energy and enthalpy indicated the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. In contrast to PANI powder, PANI/glass yielded negative entropy. Photocatalytic regeneration of used PANI/glass {{was found to be}} highly effective where the desorbed MO was completely mineralized. This study showed that immobilized PANI offered the unique advantage of convenient use and reuse {{over an extended period of}} applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{research}} in the area of mass transfer of air as a bubble in hydraulic fluid or lubricant is very limited. There are only a few studies on the interaction of oils with air, especially knowledge of air solubility of the oil and diffusivity of dissolved air in oil, namely aeration. This paper will study the effect of aeration on a direct acting hydraulic valve lifter system in an internal combustion engine. Aeration is, primarily, influenced by hydrodynamic factors such as, design features of the oil system and the physicochemical characteristics of the oil. The direct acting hydraulic valve lifter (DAHVL) was introduced to the automotive industry because of some definite advantages, such as acoustic improvement and friction reduction. Although, the aforementioned, advantages of DAHVL are significant, the aeration effect due to hydraulics creates a challenge. Aeration stems from compressibility of air in oil. It is a fact that the incompressibility of the oil hydraulically maintains all components of the valve train in <b>contact.</b> Therefore, <b>aeration</b> tends to create separation between the valve train components. This separation creates certain effects on the dynamic performance. This paper has concentrated on 3 major specifics: how oil aeration affects engine operation (via a linear math model compared to experimental data), a brief discussion on what variables inherent in the design could significantly improve the system 2 ̆ 7 s robustness to aeration effects (experimental only) and on what causes aeration (theory) ...|$|R
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{increase}} of population and industries in Indonesia especially in DKI Jakarta, the river 2 ̆ 7 s water quality for raw water supply for drinking water treatment is decreasing. And society 2 ̆ 7 s growing concern towards sanitation prompted an increase in the USAge of detergents as a cleaning item. In effect, waste excerted by these items contributes to that decrease. This decrease in river 2 ̆ 7 s water quality has increase the expense needed to process drinking water out of it. At this time, PAM (Drinking Water Enterprise) use Active Carbon Powder to remove the detergents from raw water by the adsorption method. The Active Carbon Powder is the main reason behind the increase expense as the powder is quite expensive. To counter the problem, an alternative method is a biological process such as an <b>Aeration</b> <b>Contact</b> using a charcoal as a medium. The process utilizes microbe activities within the river 2 ̆ 7 s water itself. Previous experiments resulted in this : A process with a hydraulic retention time of six hours result in a 90, 95...|$|R
40|$|The most cornmon {{method of}} {{disinfecting}} waste water effluent is by chlorination which destroys pathogenic microorganisms in the waste water stream. A field study {{conducted at the}} Wahiawa Wastewater Treatment Plant {{on the island of}} Oahu, Hawaii was established to determine the effect of aeration on disinfection efficiency in the chlorine contact chamber. A range of chlorine dosages was applied to the waste water entering the <b>contact</b> chamber for <b>aeration</b> rates of 0, 2. 36 x 10 ^(- 3), and 4. 72 x 10 ^(- 3) std. m^ 3 /s (0, 5, and 10 std. cfm) of air. The chlorine demand and chlorine requirement of the waste water was then determined by measuring the chlorine residual and fecal coliform concentration in the effluent leaving the chlorine contact chamber. The addition of aeration into the chlorine contact chamber enhanced the disinfection efficiency of chlorine, while its effect on chlorine residual loss in the contact chamber was not readily apparent; however, a greater drop in the chlorine residual was observed for higher chlorine dosages during periods of aeration, in comparison to nonaerated conditions.
