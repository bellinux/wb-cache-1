5|$|At both {{crossings}} {{of the state}} line it continues as Pennsylvania Route426 (PA426). It is the only other state highway besides NY440 that <b>can</b> <b>claim</b> {{the distinction of being}} a middle segment of another state's similarly-numbered highway. The New York alignment has remained virtually unchanged since it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, while the designations of the roads it connects to in Pennsylvania have varied over the years. The two segments of PA426 were established at different times in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{law is the}} law {{governing}} a person's family matters. In Shafeeg bin Salim Talib v. Fatimah binte Abud bin Talib (2009), the High Court {{identified a}} number of personal laws, including the Intestate Succession Act which does not apply to Muslims; and regulations 103(2) and (3) of the Prisons Regulations, which respectively state that Jewish prisoners <b>can</b> <b>claim</b> an exemption against working on Saturdays and may observe certain festival days as may be allowed by the Government, and that Muslim prisoners may fast during Ramadan and have their work reduced during this period.|$|E

5|$|Threefold {{repetition}} of position: This most commonly occurs when neither side {{is able to}} avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player <b>can</b> <b>claim</b> a draw; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check; this is merely {{a specific type of}} draw by threefold repetition.|$|E
5|$|Flagg first {{appeared}} in The Stand as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population. He makes his second appearance in The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos. Flagg was a primary antagonist in King's epic series, The Dark Tower, who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower—the linchpin of existence—so he <b>can</b> <b>claim</b> it for himself and become a god. The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg's background and motivation, linking his previous appearances. Aside from King's novels, Flagg was featured in a television miniseries adaptation of The Stand {{in which he was}} portrayed by Jamey Sheridan and The Dark Tower film adaptation in which he was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey. He has also appeared in Marvel Comics' adaptations of The Dark Tower and The Stand.|$|E
5|$|Like {{elsewhere}} in Madagascar, Antankarana society was traditionally {{divided into three}} classes: nobles, commoners and slaves. Slavery was abolished under the French colonial administration but families often retain their historic affiliations. In traditional communities, descendants of nobles live on the northern side of the village and non-nobles live in the southern part. The areas may be divided by a central clearing where the town hall is often situated; if the village also has a zomba (house reserved for royalty), it would traditionally be located here. Intermarriage across classes is common among the Antankarana, and most <b>can</b> <b>claim</b> a family relation {{to a member of}} the noble class. Historically, commoners were further sub-divided into caste-like groups called karazana ("types of people") based on their form of livelihood.|$|E

5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the doctrine of privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents <b>can</b> <b>claim</b> money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{law also}} makes special {{exemptions}} for charitable trusts. They are {{free from the}} income tax paid by individuals and companies, and also the corporation tax paid by incorporated and unincorporated associations. There is no requirement for charitable trusts to pay capital gains tax or council tax, although they are obliged to pay VAT. This freedom from tax liability applies not just to charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on that amount, while companies who give gifts to charity <b>can</b> <b>claim</b> tax on the amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley <b>can</b> <b>claim</b> that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E

5|$|Wales <b>can</b> <b>claim</b> one of {{the oldest}} {{unbroken}} literary traditions in Europe. The literary tradition of Wales stretches back to the sixth century and includes Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales, regarded by historian John Davies as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin, survive not in their original form, but in medieval versions and have undergone significant linguistic changes. Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 – 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 – 1650). The Poets of the Princes were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to the Welsh princes while the Poets of the Gentry were a school of poets that favoured the cywydd metre. The period is notable for producing one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym. After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined.|$|E
