5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical <b>cardioversion</b> may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{main risk}} of <b>cardioversion</b> is {{systemic}} embolization of a thrombus (blood clot) from the previously fibrillating left atrium. <b>Cardioversion</b> {{should not be}} performed without adequate anticoagulation in patients with more than 48 hours or unknown duration of AF. Anticoagulation is adequate if warfarin is given with target INR between 2 and 3 {{for three to four}} weeks prior to <b>cardioversion,</b> and continued for at least four weeks after <b>cardioversion.</b> <b>Cardioversion</b> may be performed in instances of AF lasting more than 48hours if a transesophogeal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrates no evidence of clot within the heart.|$|E
25|$|The {{anti-arrhythmic}} medications {{often used}} in either pharmacological <b>cardioversion</b> or {{in the prevention of}} relapse to AF alter the flux of ions in heart tissue, making them less excitable, setting the stage for spontaneous and durable <b>cardioversion.</b> The agents work by prolonging the Effective Refractory Period (ERP) either by blocking sodium ions (Class I drugs) or by blocking potassium ions (Class III drugs) or a mixture of both.

40|$|Objective: Evaluate {{the effects}} of {{optimized}} atrial stimulation- OAS (dual-site atrial pacing, heart rate above the intrinsic rate, and specific functional algorithm), {{and the use of}} atenolol in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF). Primary endpoint: to quantify the rate of AF episodes. Secondary endpoints: assessment of quality of life, specific cardiovascular symptoms, rate of hospital admissions, rate of electrical and pharmacological <b>cardioversions,</b> and adverse cardiac events. Methods: Twenty-five patients with recurrent episodes of paroxysmal AF and sinus node disease had dual-site atrial and ventricular pacemakers implanted, and were started on atenolol, 100 mg/day. Next, they were randomized to two groups: GROUP I: first three months with OAS and the specific pacing algorithm (DAO) turned on, and three more months with the algorithm off. GROUP II: the inverse sequence to GROUP I. The pacing mode chosen was DDDR, and after three months patients underwent clinical and electronic evaluations of the stimulation system by: automatic mode switch (AMS), 24 -hour Holter monitoring, Doppler echocardiogram, and SF- 36 questionnaire. Following, a crossover comparison took place, and a new assessment was performed six months later. Results: When compared to the group with the algorithm turned off, OAS patients had lower rates of: AF/week (p < 0. 001); AMS activations (p < 0. 01); hospitalizations (p < 0. 001); <b>cardioversions</b> (p < 0. 001), and higher scores on the physical and mental components of quality of life.

40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{described}} that hospitalizations for atrial fibrillation (AF) {{are continuing to}} increase. Given that hospitalizations are {{responsible for most of}} the economic burden associated with AF, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the impact of age and how changing procedural practices may be contributing to the increasing rates of AF hospitalizations. The annual age- and gender-specific incidence of hospitalizations for AF, electrical <b>cardioversions,</b> electrophysiologic studies, and radiofrequency ablation procedures in Australia were determined from 1993 to 2007 inclusive. Over this 15 -year follow-up period spanning almost 300 million person-years, a total of 473, 501 hospitalizations for AF were identified. There was a relative increase in AF hospitalizations of 203 % over the study period, in contrast to an increase for all hospitalizations of only 71 %. Whereas the gender-specific incidence of hospitalizations remained stable, the age-specific incidence increased significantly over the study period, particularly in older age groups. AF hospitalizations associated with electrical <b>cardioversions</b> decreased from 27 % to 14 % over the study period. Electrophysiologic studies and radiofrequency ablation procedures contributed minimally to the overall increase in AF hospitalizations observed. In conclusion, in addition to the growing prevalence of AF because of the aging population, there is an increasing age-specific incidence of hospitalizations for AF, particularly in older age groups. In contrast, changing procedural trends have contributed minimally to the increasing number of AF-associated hospitalizations. Greater attention to older patients with AF is required to develop strategies to prevent hospitalizations and contain the growing burden on health care systems. Christopher X. Wong, Anthony G.

40|$|Aim. To {{study the}} {{effectiveness}} of antiarrhythmic drugs: propafenone, sotalol and verapamil {{for the prevention of}} recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and other atrial tachyarrhythmias in the early postoperative period after pulmonary vein ostia catheter isolation in patients with paroxysmal AF. Material and methods. Patients (n= 243) were included into a prospective, comparative, open-label, randomized study with a control. They were divided into 4 groups: Patients of Group 1 (n= 61) received verapamil retard 240 mg/day., Group 2 (n= 62) – propafenone 450 mg/day, group 3 (n= 60) – sotalol 160 mg/day. Patients of control Group 4 (n= 60) did not receive antiarrhythmic drugs. Patient's diary, ECG, 24 -hour Holter ECG monitoring, and percutaneous heart monitor were used to detect arrhythmias in the early postoperative period. Results. During the first 3 months of postoperative period we registered 8. 62 ± 9. 37 pharmacological <b>cardioversions</b> in Group 2, 13. 24 ± 10. 77 in Group 1 (p= 0. 013), and 11. 93 ± 12. 02 in Group 3 (p= 0. 123).

40|$|AIMS: The {{primary safety}} and {{efficacy}} endpoints of the randomized FIRE AND ICE trial have recently demonstrated non-inferiority of cryoballoon vs. radiofrequency current (RFC) catheter ablation in patients with drug-refractory symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim {{of the current study}} was to assess outcome parameters that are important for the daily clinical management of patients using key secondary analyses. Specifically, reinterventions, rehospitalizations, and quality-of-life were examined in this randomized trial of cryoballoon vs. RFC catheter ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (374 subjects in the cryoballoon group and 376 subjects in the RFC group) were evaluated in the modified intention-to-treat cohort. After the index ablation, log-rank testing over 1000 days of follow-up demonstrated that there were statistically significant differences in favour of cryoballoon ablation with respect to repeat ablations (11. 8 % cryoballoon vs. 17. 6 % RFC; P = 0. 03), direct-current <b>cardioversions</b> (3. 2 % cryoballoon vs. 6. 4 % RFC; P = 0. 04), all-cause rehospitalizations (32. 6 % cryoballoon vs. 41. 5 % RFC; P = 0. 01), and cardiovascular rehospitalizations (23. 8 % cryoballoon vs. 35. 9 % RFC; P < 0. 01). There were no statistical differences between groups in the quality-of-life surveys (both mental and physical) as measured by the Short Form- 12 health survey and the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire. There was an improvement in both mental and physical quality-of-life in all patients that began at 6 months after the index ablation and was maintained throughout the 30 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with cryoballoon as opposed to RFC ablation had significantly fewer repeat ablations, direct-current <b>cardioversions,</b> all-cause rehospitalizations, and cardiovascular rehospitalizations during follow-up.

40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{experimental}} study was undertaken {{to determine whether}} pretreatment with statins would enhance myocardial protection and minimize ischemic injury during revascularization of acutely ischemic myocardium. Methods: In 20 pigs {{the second and third}} diagonal arteries were occluded for 90 minutes, followed by 45 minutes of blood cardioplegic arrest and 180 minutes of reperfusion. Ten pigs received atorvastatin (40 mg orally every day) for 21 days before surgical intervention; 10 others received no statins. Ischemic damage was assessed {{on the basis of the}} need for <b>cardioversions</b> for ventricular arrhythmias, regional wall-motion scores (4 = normal to − 1 = dyskinesia) were determined by means of 2 -dimensional echocardiography, endothelial function was assessed on the basis of bradykinin-induced coronary artery relaxation, and infarct size was calculated by determining the area of necrosis to the area of risk by means of histochemical staining. Results are given as means ± SE. Results: Statin-treated animals required fewer <b>cardioversions</b> (0. 11 ± 0. 01 vs 2. 87 ± 0. 20, P =. 0001), had improved wall-motion scores (2. 81 ± 0. 10 vs 1. 52 ± 0. 08, P =. 01), had lower infarct size (21 % ± 2 % vs 41 % ± 2 %, P =. 0001), and had more complete coronary artery relaxation (34 % ± 5 % vs 8 % ± 4 %, P =. 01). Total serum cholesterol levels were similar between the groups (62 ± 5 mg/dL for statin-treated animals vs 68 ± 5 mg/dL for non-statin-treated animals, P =. 30). Conclusions: Pretreatment with statins enhances myocardial protection during revascularization by means of mechanisms that are independent of their cholesterol-lowering properties.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{outcome of}} 52 consecutive patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who developed paroxysmal (< 1 week) or established (≥l week) atrial fibrillation between 1960 and 1985 was examined retrospectively and {{compared with that}} of a matched group of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sinus rhythm. Follow-up study until death or the present ranged from 6 months to 24 years (median 11 years) from diagnosis and from 6 months to 22 years (median 7 years) from the onset of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation was present in 6 patients at the time of diagnosis, whereas it developed subsequently in 46. The acute onset of arrhythmia was associated with a change in symptoms in 41 (89 %) of the 46. After initial treatment of acute atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm was restored in 29 (63 %) of the 46 patients; 43 (93 %) of the 46 returned to their original symptom class. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that shorter duration of arrhythmia and amiodarone therapy were the most powerful predictors of return to sinus rhythm. Sinus rhythm was maintained during a median follow-up period of 5. 5 years in 22 of the 29 patients in whom it was restored after initial therapy. During follow-up study, 25 of the 52 patients were treated with conventional therapy alone and 7 with amiodarone alone. Amiodarone therapy was associated with maintenance of sinus rhythm, fewer alterations in drug therapy, fewer embolic episodes and fewer attempted direct current <b>cardioversions</b> (during a shorter follow-up period). The remaining 20 patients initially received conventional therapy but were not well controlled and were switched to amiodarone (median 200 mg/day), after which there were fewer alterations in drug therapy and fewer direct current <b>cardioversions</b> during a similar follow-up period.

40|$|Pacing {{prevention}} algorithms {{have been}} introduced {{in order to maximize}} the benefits of atrial pacing in atrial fibrillation prevention. It has been demonstrated that algorithms actually keep overdrive atrial pacing, reduce atrial premature contractions, and prevent short-long atrial cycle phenomenon, with good patient tolerance. However, clinical studies showed inconsistent benefits on clinical endpoints such as atrial fibrillation burden. Factors which may be responsible for neutral results include an already high atrial pacing percentage in conventional DDDR, non-optimal atrial pacing site and deleterious effects of high percentages of apical ventricular pacing. Atrial antitachycardia pacing (ATP) therapies are effective in treating spontaneous atrial tachyarrhythmias, mainly when delivered early after arrhythmia onset and/or on slower tachycardias. Effective ATP therapies may reduce atrial fibrillation burden, but conflicting evidence does exist as regards this issue, probably because current clinical studies may be underpowered to detect such an efficacy.
