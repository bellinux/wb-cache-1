According to the 2014 ACS, the average commute time for adults in the United States was 26.8 minutes. The occupations with the longest commutes were Construction and Mining (33.4 minutes), Computer Science and Math (31.8), and Business Operations Specialists (30.2), while those in the military had the shortest commute (21). In general, urban and suburban workers in the US have similar commute times (about 30 minutes), while rural workers have significantly shorter commutes (22.6 minutes).

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} role of social value orientations (i. e., preferences for distribution of outcomes for the self and others) in decisions as how to commute. It was proposed that the commuting situation could be viewed either as an environ-mental issue, reflecting the decision structure of an N-person Prisoner’s Dilemma, or as an accessibility problem, reflecting the decision structure of an N-person Chicken Dilemma. On the basis of interdependence theory (Kelley & Thibaut, 1978) {{it was predicted that}} people who are primarily concerned with the collective welfare-prosocial individuals-would prefer <b>commuting</b> <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> when other commuters were expected to go <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation.</b> On the other hand, it was hypothesized that people who are primarily concerned with their own well-being-proself individuals-would prefer <b>commuting</b> <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> when others were expected to go by car. The obtained findings were consistent with these ex-pectations. Practical and theoretical implications regarding the link between social value orientations and environmentally relevant behavior will be discussed.

Consumers (or workers) are located around the circumference of a circle with a single producer (or employer) at the center. Consumers may buy directly from the center (workers may drive directly to the center), or they may buy from shops on the circumference which have bought in bulk from the center (workers may drive to stations on the circumference and <b>commute</b> <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation).</b> The article examines the socially optimal pattern of outlets, the pricing policy which supports this {{and the effects of}} alternative pricing policies, and the patterns of outlets resulting from various forms of competition. Among the results derived, it is shown that the socially optimal pattern cannot be sustained by nondiscriminatory pricing that covers average costs, and that attempts to cover average costs may lead to large distortions. In addition, without price discrimination, competition usually leads to an excessive number of outlets if the market is large and to an insufficient number if the market is small. ...|$|E
30|$|Worldwide, 55 % of {{the global}} {{population}} lives in urban areas and the present urban population is projected to increase from today’s 4 billion people to 6 billion by 2050 [48]. Mainly {{as a result of}} migration from rural areas, cities are growing in terms of inhabitants and urban area and form new residential areas outside or further away from the city core. However, the speed of urbanization presents challenges such as meeting the growing demand for transport infrastructure and affordable housing. Urban zones take different forms and characterizations and urban growth patterns differ amongst regions as a result of socio- economic, cultural, historical and environmental differences. As an example, in the US, people tend to live in low-density, single-family houses and commute by car to work. In Japan by contrast, high-rise residential buildings dominate and workers <b>commute</b> <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> (mostly rail-based) [2]. In order to identify the most promising city development policy, it is of primary interest to assess the relations between network infrastructure, socio-economic indicators and the transport system performance based on experiences from existing cities; the understanding how cities are shaped by setting the appropriate transport priorities can help to achieve terms of sustainable mobility objectives [36].|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} advances a social dilemma analysis of commuting, examining {{the roles of}} preexisting personality differences in social value orientation (i. e., prosocial vs. proself orientation) and trust (i. e., a general belief in the honesty and cooperative inten-tions of others) in determining preferences for collectively desirable commuting op-tions: preferences for <b>commuting</b> <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> (Study 1) and carpooling (Study 2). Consistent with predictions, both studies revealed that, relative to prefer-ences of prosocials, preferences of proselfs were more strongly associated with beliefs about the relative efficiency of cars (i. e., an outcome affecting personal well-being). Also, greater preferences for collectively desirable actions were observed among proso-cials with high trust-relative to prosocials with low trust and proselfs with high or low trust-providing support for the claim that 2 conditions (i. e., prosocial goals and trust in others) must be met to obtain collectively desirable commuting preferences.

40|$|Abstract: In {{each of the}} {{following}} chapters, macro models are developed to explore the impact of technological progress on the household. Chapter 1 focuses on the impact of technological progress in transportation on suburbanization. In this chapter, a model of a city is developed in which agents choose both whether or not to own a car, and where to live. Focusing on the period 1910 to 1970, the model is calibrated to match the fall in automobile prices, the rise in real incomes, and the rise in the cost of <b>commuting</b> <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> relative to <b>commuting</b> <b>by</b> car. Under the baseline calibration the model predicts both a rise in car-ownership and decentralization. In Chapter 2, a model with leisure production and endogenous retirement is used to explain the declining labor-force participation rates of elderly males. Using the Health and Retirement Study, the model is calibrated to cross-sectional data on the labor-force participation rates of elderly US males by age and their average drop in market consumption in the year 2000. Running the calibrated model for the period 1850 to 2000, a prediction of the evolution of the cross-section is obtained and compared with data. The model is able to predict both the increase in retirement since 1850 and the observed drop in market consumption at the moment of retirement. The increase in retirement is driven by rising real wages and a falling price of leisure goods over time. Finally, in Chapter 3, the welfare gain from technological progress in personal computer production is measured by constructing a simple model of computer demand. The innovation of the model is in the agent's utility function. Preferences are defined such that the marginal utility of zero computer consumption is finite. Thus the model can predict the zero demand for computers observed in the data and generate a finite welfare gain from their introduction into the market. The model is calibrated using data on computer expenditures. The model suggests that the welfare gain from technological progress in personal computers is approximately 4 percent of total consumption expenditure. technological progress, suburbanization, population density gradient, retirement leisure goods, computers, welfare gain...|$|R

40|$|Commuting {{to work is}} one of {{the most}} {{important}} and regular routines of transportation in towns and cities. From a geographic perspective, the length of people’s commute is influenced, to some degree, by the spatial separation of their home and workplace and the transport infrastructure. The rise of car ownership in Australia from the 1950 s to the present was accompanied by a considerable decrease of public transport use. Currently there is an average of 1. 4 persons per car in Australia, and private cars are involved in approximately 90 % of the trips, and <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> in only 10 %. Increased personal mobility has fuelled the trend of decentralised housing development, mostly without a clear planning for local employment, or alternative means of transportation. Transport sector accounts for 14 % of Australia’s net greenhouse gas emissions. Without further policy action, Australia’s emissions are projected to continue to increase. The Australian Federal Government and the new Department of Climate Change have recently published a set of maps showing that rising seas would submerge large parts of Victoria coastal region. Such event would lead to major disruption in planned urban growth areas in the next 50 years with broad scale inundation of dwellings, facilities and road networks. The Greater Geelong Region has well established infrastructure as a major urban centre and tourist destination and hence attracted the attention of federal and state governments in their quest for further development and population growth. As a result of its natural beauty and ecological sensitivity, scenarios for growth in the region are currently under scrutiny from local government as well as development agencies, scientists, and planners. This paper is part of a broad research in the relationship between transportation system, urban form, trip demand, and emissions, as a paramount in addressing the challenges presented by urban growth. Progressing from previous work focused on private cars, this present paper investigates the use of public transport as a mode for commuting in the Greater Geelong Region. Using a GIS based interaction model, it characterises the current use of the existing <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> system, and also builds a scenario of increased use of the existing <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> system, estimating potencial reductions in CO 2 emissions. This study provides an improved understanding of the extent to which choices of transport mode and travel activity patterns, affect emissions in the context of regional networks. The results indicate that emissions from <b>commuting</b> <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> are significantly lower than those from <b>commuting</b> <b>by</b> private car, and emphasise that there are opportunities for large abatment in the greenhouse emissions from the transportation sector related to efforts in increasing the use of existing <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> system...|$|R
40|$|With {{its point}} of {{departure}} of increasing numbers of people being engaged in commuting, {{the aim of this}} thesis is to reveal prerequisites for and consequences of long-distance commuting in Sweden for the individual and his or her partner. Special attention has been given to prerequisites for long-distance commuting in sparsely populated areas, and to social consequences related to long-distance commuting in terms of gender differences in commuting patterns, earnings and separation. The thesis is based on four empirical studies, presented in different papers. Two studies draw on individual longitudinal register data on all Swedish long-distance commuters living with a partner. The other two focus on commuting behaviour in sparsely populated areas, one based on individual register data and the other on a survey. Long-distance commuting (> 30 kilometres) has become an increasingly common mobility strategy among Swedish workers and their households. Results from the thesis show that 11 percent of Swedish workers are long-distance commuters and about half of them live in a relationship. Among these couples many are families with children, indicating the importance of social ties in households’ decisions on where to work and live. Most long-distance commuters are men, and it is also likely that long-distance commuters have a high education level and are employed in the private sector. For the majority, long-distance commuting gives higher earnings; however, men benefit economically more than women do. As long-distance commuting reduces available family time, the non-commuting spouse often takes on a larger share of household commitments. The thesis shows that men’s long-distance commuting may therefore serve to reproduce and reinforce traditional gender roles on the labour market and within households. On the other hand, women’s long-distance commuting can lead to more equalitarian relationships on the labour market and within households. For the majority of couples it seems as if long-distance commuting becomes more than a temporary mobility strategy, while for some couples it does not work out very well. Separation rates are found to be higher among long-distance commuters compared to other couples; especially the first years of commuting seem to be the most challenging. It is suggested that coping strategies are important to make the consequences of long-distance commuting easier to handle and adjust to in the daily life puzzle. For those unable to handle these consequences, long-distance commuting is not a sustainable mobility strategy and can even end a relationship. The extent of long-distance commuting is low in sparsely populated areas, and those who do long-distance commute are mainly men. Most people work and live within the same locality and do not accept longer commuting times than do those in densely populated areas. In this thesis it is argued that facilitating car commuting in the more sparsely populated areas of Sweden can be more economically and socially sustainable, for the individual commuters as well as for society, than encouraging <b>commuting</b> <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{methods for}} {{the measurement of}} activity and travel well-being and models for linking well-being and behavior. The hypotheses underlying this research are that (1) activities are planned to maintain or enhance subjective well-being, and (2) given the activity choices, travel choices {{are likely to be}} motivated by a desire to maintain or enhance travel well-being. The aim is to enhance travel demand models, which overemphasize the generalized cost of travel, to better capture travel benefits, and to contribute more broadly to measurement and modeling efforts in the subjective wellbeing field. The thesis develops and tests a modeling framework that incorporates happiness measures as additional indicators of utility in discrete choice models based on random utility theory. The framework is applied to modeling both activity and travel choices and, in doing so, new well-being measurement methods are developed. Even though the applications focus on activities and travel, the framework is general and can be applied to modeling behavior in other domains. Activity well-being is investigated both empirically and theoretically. The empirical analysis consists of the development of models of activity participation and well-being using data from a web-based cross-sectional survey of a sample of commuters. The models reveal significant correlations between well-being and behavior: higher propensity of activity participation is associated with greater activity happiness and greater satisfaction with travel to the activity. (cont.) The theoretical analysis consists of the development of a framework and measures for the incorporation of well-being within activity-based models of travel demand. The analysis of travel well-being is done {{in the context of the}} commute to work. First, using the web-based cross-sectional survey, we develop a structural equations model to model the causes and correlates of commute satisfaction. Second, we study travel wellbeing in a dynamic context. We postulate that due to the routine nature of commuting, people are unlikely to fully think about their travel happiness unless they need to reconsider their decisions. We conduct experiments in Switzerland and at MIT requiring habitual car drivers to <b>commute</b> temporarily <b>by</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> and measure their travel happiness and mode choice pre- and post-treatment. We find that the routine (pretreatment) and non-routine (post-treatment) measures of travel happiness are significantly different, as postulated. We then use the data from these experiments to estimate the proposed modeling framework, whereby the car and <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> happiness measures are used as indicators of utility. We find that the combined choice-happiness model results in more efficient parameter estimates than a choice model alone, thus demonstrating the benefits of the extended framework that includes happiness. by Maya Abou Zeid.
