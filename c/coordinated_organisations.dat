30|$|The 2011 {{eruption}} of Shinmoedake, Japan, deposited tephra across Miyazaki prefecture impacting both {{urban and rural}} environments. We {{provide an overview of}} the impacts, management and recovery of a modern city, infrastructure networks and a diverse agricultural region following this moderate sized explosive eruption, focusing on four key sectors. Cleanup of tephra was time consuming, physically demanding and costly for residents, businesses and municipal authorities. The agricultural sector sustained large initial impacts with smothering, loading and abrasion of crops, soils and greenhouses. However, extreme concerns {{at the time of the}} eruption were not realised, with farming operations experiencing limited long-term effects. There were few disruptions to electrical networks due to resilient insulator design, a successful cleaning program, relatively coarse tephra and dry conditions. Cancellations and delays occurred on three rail lines resulting primarily from mechanical failure of track switches and loss of electrical contact between train wheels and tracks. Both residents and organisations exhibited high levels of adaptive capacity in response to the event and utilised regional and national networks to obtain information on past events and recovery strategies. The combination of relatively short eruption duration, well resourced and <b>coordinated</b> <b>organisations</b> and resilient infrastructure networks contributed to a strong recovery.|$|E

50|$|Belgium has a {{coastline}} with {{a length}} of 68 km. The coast is urbanised over practically its entire length and is visited by thousands of tourists each year. In 1982 a lifeguard service has been built up to minimize the death by drowning at the Belgian coast. Because the North Sea only borders Flanders, more particularly the province of West Flanders, the training of the lifeguards is organised by that province. Beach lifeguards in Belgium are trained by the WOBRA and are mostly students who are employed for a month during the summer holidays (July and August). Some municipalities also employ lifeguards in June and September. To obtain uniformity, all municipalities from the Belgian coast joined the IKWV This is the <b>coordinating</b> <b>organisation</b> for all the municipalities for lifeguard service.

Others had been no less territorially defined Protestant minority church bodies within Catholic monarchies, where before 1918 the Roman Catholic Church played the role of state church.

In the mid-1930s L'Herbier supported the view that the national film industry needed stronger and more <b>coordinated</b> <b>organisation</b> if it was to defend itself against foreign competition, and he was instrumental in setting up a union for various categories of film employees, the Syndicat général des artisans de film, soon renamed as the Syndicat des techniciens de la production cinématographique, of which he became the secretary in 1937, and subsequently president in 1939. The union achieved improvements in rates of pay, hours of work, and insurance arrangements for accidents at work, as well as press accreditation for film journalists. The union could also speak with one voice for all aspects of the industry. After the war L'Herbier continued his lobbying for French cinema by chairing the Comité de défense du cinéma français.|$|R

40|$|Just before Hungary’s EU {{accession}} (2004), {{the dairy}} sector {{was one of}} the most critical industries of the Hungarian agriculture, which is why we chose this for our empirical analysis. Results of our price transmission analysis as well as our previous study on contractual relations in the Hungarian dairy sector obviously show that only the increase of input prices will increase the prices in the production-processing stage. Independent privately owned farm organisations can not countervail the market power of their business partners; hence farmers cannot enforce their interest separately and act against the concentrated processing industry. Thus, the main aim of our paper is to show possible theoretical and practical ways of establishing private (market) <b>coordinating</b> <b>organisations</b> in the (Hungarian) dairy sector. We use New Institutional Economics as a theoretical background in carrying out a literature review on coordinating matters as well as on bargaining power issues. As a main body of our study we summarize the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the different coordination structures in the frame of a SWOT analysis, assuming two theoretical situations: one is when the coordination is initiated by the processor or when it is initiated by the farmers. ...|$|R

40|$|Genomic {{mapping of}} DNA {{replication}} origins (ORIs) in mammals provides a powerful means {{for understanding the}} regulatory complexity of our genome. Here we combine a genome-wide approach to identify preferential sites of DNA replication initiation at 0. 4 % of the mouse genome with detailed molecular analysis at distinct classes of ORIs according to their location relative to the genes. Our study reveals that 85 % of the replication initiation sites in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are associated with transcriptional units. Nearly half of the identified ORIs map at promoter regions and, interestingly, ORI density strongly correlates with promoter density, reflecting the <b>coordinated</b> <b>organisation</b> of replication and transcription in the mouse genome. Detailed analysis of ORI activity showed that CpG island promoter-ORIs are the most efficient ORIs in ES cells and both ORI specification and firing efficiency are maintained across cell types. Remarkably, the distribution of replication initiation sites at promoter-ORIs exactly parallels that of transcription start sites (TSS), suggesting a co-evolution of the regulatory regions driving replication and transcription. Moreover, we found that promoter-ORIs are significantly enriched in CAGE tags derived from early embryos relative to all promoters. This association implies that transcription initiation early in development sets the probability of ORI activation, unveiling a new hallmark i...|$|R
40|$|In {{the near}} future, {{we will need}} an internationally based system for {{worldwide}} planning of future energy resources and their effect on the world environment. Logically, {{this should be a}} responsibility of the United Nations, which already possesses much of the infrastructure needed and is already active in this area. Because different nations have different resources, different problems and different needs, it is reasoned that a flexible and diplomatic approach is also called for. We will need to try to secure support from all nations, and the economies and cultures of many nations differ considerably. This calls for special skills in negotiation. This is complicated by the varied, uncertain and changing technologi-cal facilities, which we have at our disposal. After a brief and comparative review of these facilities, an outline {{of the structure of the}} internationally <b>coordinating</b> <b>organisation</b> is suggested, followed by examples of the different types of issues which are likely to be encountered.
