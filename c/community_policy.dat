The string section, composed by Jonny Greenwood and written for 16 instruments, was inspired by modern classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima. Greenwood said, [...] "I got very excited {{at the prospect of}} doing string parts that didn't sound like 'Eleanor Rigby', which is what all string parts have sounded like for the past 30 years." [...] Select described Yorke's distraught vocals and the atonal strings as [...] "Thom's voice dissolving into a fearful, blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo." [...] For the lyrics, Yorke drew from his time as an orderly in a mental hospital during the Care in the <b>Community</b> <b>policy</b> of deinstitutionalizing mental health patients, and a New York Times article about serial killers.|$|E

John Heron, once an RC leader and teacher, who left the organization in 1974 to set up his own co-counseling organization, Co-Counselling International, said he parted company with RC because it [...] "systematically conditioned its members to associate {{a certain kind of}} beneficial human development with centralized authoritarian control of theory and <b>community</b> <b>policy.</b> It was clear to me that this was pseudo-liberation." [...] He considered that the authoritarianism of RC derived partly from the Leninist doctrines of central control that Jackins had learned in the Communist Party of America and partly from the autocratic example of his former associate L.

40|$|The {{political}} framework In {{a recent}} years the concept of Sustainable Development has rapidly diffused throughout the legislation of the European Union and has meanwhile been formally established as a basic component in all <b>Community</b> <b>policies.</b> In the Treaty of Rome, the founding document of the European Economic Community (1957), the goals of development were defined mainly in economic terms. In the Single European Act of 1986, the aim of environmental protection was introduced (article 130 r). Five years later, the Maastricht Treaty (1991), in defining {{the objectives of the}} European Union (article B), called for promoting “economic and social progress which is balanced and sustainable”. The Treaty of Amsterdam (1997) required not only the promotion of a high level of protection but also improvements in the quality of the environment (Article 2). It requests that “Environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the <b>community</b> <b>policies</b> and activities [...] . in particular with a view to promoting sustainable development ” (Article 6). After many years of different and often isolated efforts in direction of a stronger respect for the environment in <b>community</b> <b>policies,</b> this general requirement constitutes an important step.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Community</b> sport <b>policy</b> is characterised as complex and multi-faceted {{partly due to the}} number of agencies involved. This thesis explores the <b>community</b> sport <b>policy</b> process in England, specifically the significance of the relationship between CSPs and NGBs in the <b>community</b> sport <b>policy</b> process. The four key objectives of this study are (i) to analyse the significance of the relationship between CSPs and NGBs with regard to the national <b>community</b> sport <b>policy</b> process; (ii) to analyse the significance of the relationship between CSPs and NGBs in local-level policy making and policy implementation; (iii) to identify CSP and NGB attitudes and perceptions toward the <b>community</b> sport <b>policy</b> process; and as the study focuses on the meso-level of analysis, (iv) to evaluate the explanatory value of selected meso-level theories of the policy process in developing {{a better understanding of the}} <b>community</b> sport <b>policy</b> process. This study uses a mixed method comprising a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Initially, a quantitative questionnaire was used to gather information regarding CSPs and NGBs and support the selection of CSP cases. From this CSP-based case studies were developed involving semi-structured interviews with CSP, NGB and local authority representatives. The study draws attention to the hierarchical nature of the <b>community</b> sport <b>policy</b> process, the implications for collaboration, the mediating role of CSPs in national and local policy settings, and the associated challenges that agents face in implementing <b>community</b> sport <b>policy.</b> The study emphasises the value of theoretical pluralism in analysing the community sport field, particularly the combined used of meso-level frameworks such as the Advocacy Coalition Framework and the Policy Networks Approach with micro-level considerations from implementation theory and the partnership literature. It concludes that empirically, it is only by giving policy agents a voice that we can develop a more accurate understanding of the policy process and that practically only by harnessing the commitment and energy of the grassroots can we step toward a more effective <b>policy</b> <b>community...</b>|$|R
