40|$|A {{sensitive}} method using HPLC with {{fluorescence detection}} {{has been established}} for the measurement of porphyrins in biological materials. The assay recoveries were 88. 0 +/- 1. 8 % for protoporphyrin IX in the blood, and ranged from 98. 3 +/- 2. 7 % to 111. 1 +/- 7. 4 % for various porphyrins in the urine. This method was employed to investigate the altered porphyrin profiles in rats after a single dose of various arsenicals including soluble sodium arsenate and sodium arsenite, and the relatively insoluble <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenite,</b> calcium arsenate and arsenic-contaminated soils at dose rates of 5 mg/kg or 0. 5 mg/kg body weight. Porphyrin concentrations increased within 24 - 48 hr after the arsenic treatment in blood and urine. Protoporphyrin IX is the predominant porphyrin in the blood. In rats administered 5 mg As(III) /kg body weight, protoporphyrin IX concentration elevated to 123 % of them control values in rats, 24 hr after the treatment. Higher increases were recorded in the urinary protoporphyrin IX (253 % at 24 hr; 397 % on day 2), uroporphyrin (121 % at 24 hr; 208 % on day 2) and coproporphyrin 111 (391 % at 24 hr; 304 % on day 2), while {{there was no significant}} increase (109 % on day 3) observed in the urinary coproporphyrin I excretion. In rats administered 5 mg As(V) /kg, urinary excretion of protoporphyrin IX, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin Ill and coproporphyrin I elevated to the maximum levels by 48 hr with the corresponding percentage values compared to the control being 177 %, 158 %, 224 % and 143 %, respectively. In rats dosed with 5 mg As(III) /kg, the increases (expressed as % of the control values) of protoporphyrin IX in the blood were in the order: sodium arsenite (144 %) > sodium arsenate (125 %) {{greater than or equal to}} <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenite</b> (123 %) > calcium arsenate. In contrast, there was no significant increase of protoporphyrin K when the six arsenic-contaminated cattlei dip soils and nine copper chrome arsenate (CCA-contaminated) soils were administered to the rats.

40|$|A hydride cold-trapping {{technique}} {{was developed and}} optimised for the measurement of urinary arsenic metabolites. The analytical precision of the method {{was found to be}} 6. 1, 4. 0 and 4. 8 % (n = 5) for inorganic arsenic (As-i), monomethylarsonate (MMA) and dimethylarsinate (DMA), respectively, with recoveries close to 100 %, The detection limits were 1. 0, 1. 3 and 3 ng for As-i, MMA and DMA, respectively. The method was then used to analyse urine samples obtained from three groups of workers for occupational exposure in three companies where copper chrome arsenate was used for timber treatment. The results were compared with those for a normal control group of laboratory workers. Arsenic and its metabolites were also measured in experimental rats given 5 mg As kg(- 1) body mass by oral gavage in the form of sodium arsenite, <b>calcium</b> <b>arsenite</b> or sodium arsenate. Occupational workers showed a significantly higher excretion of As-i, Up to two fold increases of urinary As-i excretion in rats compared with control rats were also observed in animals dosed with various forms of arsenicals. The method is suitable for the measurement of arsenic metabolites in urine of both humans and experimental animals...|$|E

40|$|In rat heart mitochondria, auranofin, arsenite, diamide, and BCNU {{increase}} H 2 O 2 formation, further {{stimulated by}} antimycin. However, in submitochondrial particles, H 2 O 2 formation and oxygen uptake are not affected, indicating that these substances do not alter respiration. Mitochondria are {{also able to}} rapidly metabolize added H 2 O 2, in a process partially prevented by BCNU or auranofin. Calcium does not modify the production or H 2 O 2 and the mitochondrial thioredoxin system is not affected by <b>calcium</b> ions. Auranofin, <b>arsenite,</b> and diamide determine a large mitochondrial permeability transition. while BCNU and acetoacetate are ineffective. Thiols and glutathione are modified only by BCNU and diamide. However, all the compounds tested cause the release of cytochrome c that occurs also {{in the absence of}} mitochondrial swelling. In conclusion, the compounds utilized share the common feature of shifting the mitoclondrial thiol-linked redox balance towards a more oxidized condition that is responsible of the observed effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This {{study was}} carried out to analyze the effect of arsenic types on growth and arsenic {{accumulation}} ability of Pteris multifida. Among arsenic pollution sources, Sodium arsenate, <b>Calcium</b> arsenate, Sodium <b>arsenite</b> and Potassium arsenite were treated in horticultural compost contaminated with 500 ㎎·kg- 1. P. multifida was cultivated for 12 weeks. The results of study, Calcium arsenate treatment showed slightly decreased growth of P. multifida. But, growth of P. multifida cultivated in the remaining arsenic treatment was similar to untreated control plot. With only short-term cultivation of 4 weeks, aerial part of P. multifida in Sodium arsenate treatment showed high arsenic accumulation of 2, 289. 5 ㎎·kg- 1 DW. The arsenic accumulation (2, 956. 0 ㎎·kg- 1 DW) was the highest at 12 week. On the other hand, underground part showed the highest arsenic accumulation in Potassium arsenite treatment (2, 470. 2 ㎎·kg- 1 DW) and Calcium arsenate treatment accumulated 1, 060. 7 ㎎·kg- 1 DW of arsenic. Regardless of arsenic types, aerial part of P. multifida was absorbed more than 1000 ㎎·kg- 1 DW of arsenic. And removal of arsenic in soil was also higher. Therefore, Pteris multida {{is considered to be}} suitable phytoremediation meterial of various arsenic contaminated areas...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{dealt with}} the leaching of arsenic containing waste rocks from a proposed gold mine site at Reefton, New Zealand. Then it established the acidity and concentrations of Fe, sulfate, As(V) and As(III) released {{as a result of}} leaching experiments which simulated the weathering process. It also determined the arsenic concentrations that were released from old mine workings into the Devils Creek sediments catchment and concentrated into sediments. The Devils Creek catchment is located downstream from the proposed mine. Acid mine drainage (AMD) results from oxidation of sulfide bearing rocks and deposits (e. g. FeS and FeS 2). It is characterised by elevated concentrations of sulphate and iron and low pH. As(V) and As(III) may also be a component in AMD from the oxidation of FeAsS. Biologically As(III) is considered the more toxic form. Methods were developed for the measurement of arsenic species (As(V) and As(III)) in leachates derived from mine waste rocks. These were applied to freshwater samples and sediment extracts. These included: • A field method for the on-site fractionation of arsenic in fresh waters using XAD- 4 and Chelex-Fe(III) resins. In this two-step process the XAD- 4 resin was used to isolate and pre-concentrate natural organic matter (NOM) and therefore the arsenic fraction associated with it through iron bound to the NOM. In the second step Fe(III) modified Chelex 100 resin was used to selectively preconcentrate As(V) from water samples. Thus the combined method achieved discrimination between free and bound fractions of As(V) and the separation of As(V) from As(IU). • A flow injection analysis protocol based on spectrophotometric detection was modified to increase its sensitivity for measurement of arsenic species in leachates derived from waste rocks. The method was effective for the determination of arsenate. Arsenite was measured by prior oxidation with iodate. Study on the Devils Creek catchment established the existing baseline levels of arsenic in the fresh water and sediments. The water contains high levels of arsenic. Most of the arsenic in Devils Creek water is soluble. As(V) is the predominant species of which a minor fraction (13 - 28 %) is bound to NOM. It was also established that arsenic was associated with Fe and A 1 rich phases in the Devils Creek sediments. Due to the high accumulated arsenic load in the sediments, further uptake of arsenic from the water column is no longer viable because potential binding sites in the sediments have been saturated. Leaching simulation on mine basic waste rocks (GB 13) and an acidic sandstone were conducted using a variety of leach ants applicable to the field, then quantifying the Fe, As(III), As(V), heavy metals and acidity in the leachates. It was established that the sandstone rock had the greater potential to produce acid mine drainage (AMD). Its leachates give a high acidity (pH 2. 9 - 3. 4) compared to leachates of the GB 13 waste rock which have a weakly basic pH of 7. 2. The dominant arsenic species in leachates of both rock types is As(V). The concentrations of arsenic, soluble Fe and heavy metals leached from the sandstone were greater than those leached from GB 13. The interactions of arsenate with other components of AMD and natural organic matter were examined. It was established that ferrihydrite semi-quantitatively and rapidly removes arsenate from solution. The arsenate adsorption is inhibited by competing ions in the following order: sulfate> FA ≡ HA. Complexes of HA-Fe(III) and FA-Fe(III) bind arsenate as 1 : 1 complexes through the Fe(III). Investigations were made on the use of limestone for the control of arsenic in mine waste rock leachates. It was established that where acidic leachate contacts limestone the pH rises as a result of neutralisation reactions. Subsequently there is a precipitation of Fe(III) and retention of As(V) on the Fe(OH) 3. As (III) is oxidised by Fe 3 +(aq) and Fe(OH) 3. On contact with the limestone surface, As (III) is also retained and oxidised. Fe(III) impurities in the limestone are responsible for the uptake of both As(V) and As(III).
