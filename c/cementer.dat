40|$|SummaryAnimal {{bodies are}} shaped by skeletons, which are built inside the body by biomineralization of {{condensed}} mesenchymal cells in vertebrates [1, 2] and echinoderms [3, 4], or outside the body by apical secretion of extracellular matrices by epidermal cell layers in arthropods [5]. In each case, the skeletons’ shapes are a direct reflection of the pattern of skeleton-producing cells [6]. Here we report a newly discovered mode of skeleton formation: assembly of sponges’ mineralized skeletal elements (spicules) in locations distant from where they were produced. Although it was known that internal skeletons of sponges consist of spicules assembled into large pole-and-beam structures {{with a variety of}} morphologies [7 – 10], the spicule assembly process (i. e., how spicules become held up and connected basically in staggered tandem) and what types of cells act in this process remained unexplored. Here we found that mature spicules are dynamically transported from where they were produced and then pierce through outer epithelia, and their basal ends become fixed to substrate or connected with such fixed spicules. Newly discovered “transport cells” mediate spicule movement and the “pierce” step, and collagen-secreting basal-epithelial cells fix spicules to the substratum, suggesting that the processes of spiculous skeleton construction are mediated separately by specialized cells. Division of labor by manufacturer, transporter, and <b>cementer</b> cells, and iteration of the sequential mechanical reactions of “transport,” “pierce,” “raise up,” and “cementation,” allows construction of the spiculous skeleton spicule by spicule as a self-organized biological structure, with the great plasticity in size and shape required for indeterminate growth, and generating the great morphological diversity of individual sponges...|$|E

25|$|Changes in the rosters {{were allowed}} {{only during the}} first half of the season, meeting a {{deadline}} before the beginning of the second half. While the number of games has historically varied from 40 to 80 games per season. The All-Star game was scheduled to coincide with the traditional Three Kings Day, an idea suggested by Angel Colon so that the proceeds could be used to buy toys. This date was used for decades, until the emergence of television forced the league to comply to the dates requested by the networks. One of the main figures of the league in its early stage was veteran Negro leagues' veteran, Emilio Navarro. The Cangrejeros de Santurce and Tiburones de Aguadilla joined the original teams in the 1939–40 season. On January 8, 1939, Humacao and San Juan played an 18-inning game that lasted four hours, establishing a record. Between 1938 and 1941, the LBSPR was part of the National Semi-Professional Baseball Congress, with titleholder Guayama facing the champions of the Congress' United States branch in best-of-seven series in 1939, where they defeated the Duncan <b>Cementers,</b> and again in 1940, with a roster that included the league's Most Valuable Player, Satchel Paige. In 1939–40, Perucho Cepeda, the defending batting champion, won the league's batting title over Josh Gibson, who managed to win it the following season. The Criollos de Caguas won their firs championship in 1940–41, defeating the Cangrejeros in the final series. Santurce's Luis Cabrera was the last player to win the LBSPR' Most Valuable Player award. On September 14, 1941, Rafael Delgado Márquez proposed that the league was renamed to Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico (LBPPR), effectively moving the league towards professionalism. A format of vueltas (halves) was adopted since the league's creation, where the winners of each vuelta facing each other for the championship. However, Ponce managed to win three consecutive championships (1941–1945) without having to participate in a final by winning both vueltas. Consequently, the fans of teams that were mathematically eliminated by this format lost interest in the tournament. Some players also concluded their participation in the season after the teams were eliminated. To deal with this issue, the league established a new playoff format, where the top four teams where included.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, one {{can often}} hear the saying: “the easy oil is gone, {{the future will}} bring more complex and {{challenging}} wells to be drilled”. In fact, this is something the industry already is facing. Oilfields are depleting and ageing, which forces the operators to search {{for oil and gas}} in harsher and more challenging areas. This thesis presents a detailed description of a full scale drilling simulator developed by Statoil and cooperating partners; SINTEF, eDrilling and Oiltec Solutions. The simulator was developed as a consequence of several serious incidents during the period 2007 – 2008. Statoil`s intention is to ensure optimal competence level for its Drilling & Well personnel by offering realistic personnel training on operational procedures and well control incidents in a non-threatening environment. This gives each license a unique opportunity to train of field specific challenges. The simulator contains a great flexibility due to its modularity which enables training on a variety of different drilling operations. As of today, is conventional drilling fully implemented with capability of performing training in HPHT mode. Generally will MPD operations require more equipment and a higher competence requirement compared to conventional drilling, and will thus require more time for training. The newly developed MPD module will be implemented during the month of July. Since this is the next extension of drilling simulator application, have this thesis assessed the potential of performing training of drilling & well personnel in MPD mode. Related drilling problems have also been presented due to its relevance for simulator training in both conventional drilling and MPD mode. Successful training and improvement of personnel`s action in different scenarios requires realistic cases with a rig setup close to what the personnel is used to. Hence, the simulator is configured to replicate the actual drilling rig and well data for applicable wells. A comparison between Statoil`s in-house planning tool, Drillbench, and SINTEF`s, Intellectus, have been presented in a comparison of simulated results. The result shows that both planning tools are to be consistent and aligned and shows that simulated data from simulator training is in accordance with the planning each licensee have performed in advance. An comparison of real-time ECD and simulated ECD values shows that Drillbench conducts simulations that are both reliable and realistic when the drilling parameters are the same. Through the period from January 2012 – June 2012, there have been 40 classes of training comprised on 287 participants. Each participant have filled out an evaluation scheme which has formed the basis of my evaluation of simulator training. The performed simulator training shows to increase the general downhole understanding of participants and it is an important risk reducing action for Statoil. Feedback from participants shows that mud engineers, drilling engineers and <b>cementers</b> easily become passive observer’s during training. It is proposed to define specific tasks for each participant which will contribute to more engagement throughout the team. With 95, 2 % of all participants expressing a desire to come back for further simulator training, is this initiative proving to be attractive among the participants...|$|R
40|$|This Corrective Action Decision Document (CADD) /Closure Report (CR) {{has been}} {{prepared}} for Corrective Action Unit 556, Dry Wells and Surface Release Points, located at the Nevada Test Site, Nevada, {{in accordance with the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO, 1996; as amended February 2008). Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 556 is comprised of four corrective action sites (CASs) : • 06 - 20 - 04, National <b>Cementers</b> Dry Well • 06 - 99 - 09, Birdwell Test Hole • 25 - 60 - 03, E-MAD Stormwater Discharge and Piping • 25 - 64 - 01, Vehicle Washdown and Drainage Pit The purpose of this CADD/CR is to provide justification and documentation supporting the recommendation for closure of CAU 556 with no further corrective action. To achieve this, corrective action investigation (CAI) activities began on February 7 and were completed on June 19, 2008, as set forth in the Corrective Action Investigation Plan for Corrective Action Unit 556 : Dry Wells and Surface Release Points, Nevada Test Site, Nevada (NNSA/NSO, 2007). The purpose of the CAI was to fulfill the following data needs as defined during the data quality objective (DQO) process: • Determine whether contaminants of concern (COCs) are present. • If COCs are present, determine their nature and extent. • Provide sufficient information and data to complete appropriate corrective actions. The CAU 556 data were evaluated based on the data quality assessment process, which demonstrated the quality and acceptability of the data for use in fulfilling the DQO data needs. Analytes detected during the CAI were evaluated against appropriate final action levels (FALs) to identify the COCs for each CAS. The results of the CAI identified COCs at one of the four CASs in CAU 556 that required the completion of a corrective action. Assessment of the data generated from investigation activities conducted at CAU 556 revealed the following: • Corrective Action Sites 06 - 20 - 04, 06 - 99 - 09, and 25 - 64 - 01 do not contain contamination at concentrations exceeding the FALs. • Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination above the FAL was identified in the surface and/or shallow subsurface soils at the outfall and around Catch Basin 2, and in soils contained within the catch basins and the manhole at CAS 25 - 60 - 03. A corrective action of close in place with a soil removal action and use restriction (UR) was completed at CAS 25 - 60 - 03. The PCB-contaminated soils were removed from the outfall area and around Catch Basin 2, and disposed of at a Nevada Test Site landfill as part of a removal action. The catch basins and the manhole were sealed shut by filling them with grout. The end of the outfall pipe was plugged using grout, covered with soil, and the area was regraded. A UR was applied to the entire stormwater system at CAS 25 - 60 - 03, which includes the three catch basins, manhole, and associated piping. No further action is the corrective action for CASs 06 - 20 - 04, 06 - 99 - 09, and 25 - 64 - 01. The liquids in the test holes at CAS 06 - 99 - 09 were removed for disposal and the features were filled with grout as a best management practice. The drainage pipe between the vehicle washdown pad and the drainage pit at CAS 25 - 64 - 01 was sealed at each end as a best management practice. The corrective actions were evaluated on technical merit focusing on performance, reliability, feasibility, safety, and cost. They were judged to meet all requirements for the technical components evaluated. The corrective actions meet all applicable federal and state regulations for closure of the site and will reduce potential exposure pathways to the contaminated media to an acceptable level at CAU 556. Therefore, the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office provides the following recommendations: • Maintain a UR for the entire stormwater drainage system (i. e., three catch basins, one manhole, and associated piping) at CAS 25 - 60 - 03. • No further corrective action for CAU 556. • A Notice of Completion to the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office is requested from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for closure of CAU 556. • Corrective Action Unit 556 should be moved from Appendix III to Appendix IV of the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order...|$|R
