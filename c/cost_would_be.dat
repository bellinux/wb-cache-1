5|$|The {{portable}} electric {{fire engine}} would be efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose. An argument against {{the high cost of}} such an electrical installation was that the <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways. The same current supply could be used for the electric fire engine system.|$|E
5|$|The total costs, {{including}} all alterations, were £513,242 for Glatton and £777,197 for Gorgon, {{although there was}} no obvious reason for the disparity unless some of Glatton's costs had been charged against Gorgon as the lead ship of the class. A truer <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> about £645,000 for each. This was almost double the original cost and made them more expensive {{than any of the other}} monitors.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{original}} bridge {{was designed for}} 38-ton vehicles, when it was inspected around 1995 it was found unable {{to comply with a}} European Union directive for supporting vehicles up to 40 tons, and would only be able to support 17-ton vehicles. A feasibility study was carried out for a new Tamar Crossing in 1991, but was rejected as the estimated <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> around £300 million. The existing bridge could not be closed as it was being used by over 40,000 vehicles a day.|$|E
50|$|There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no {{compensation}} - <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> borne {{where they}} fell.|$|R
50|$|The {{electrification}} of {{this line}} would greatly assist in recommissioning passenger trains, as <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reduced.|$|R
50|$|Compliance <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{increased}} {{by the need}} to calculate each component of the formula in each jurisdiction.|$|R
5|$|Both {{the commons}} and King Richard II were {{enthusiastic}} about the launch of a crusade to Flanders, {{for political and economic}} reasons: revenues from the English wool staple (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the king or his uncles to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt's unpopular plans for a royal crusade to Castille to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that its <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the Peasants' Revolt, the government was fearful of the consequences of imposing a tax to pay for a new war against the French.|$|E
5|$|The tribe {{resolved}} {{to place the}} site on the National Historic Registry. In 1976, the National Park Service designated the site as a National Historic Site. By 1993, the tribe had adopted a master plan to try to preserve the buildings and commissioned a study to determine what the <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to restore the property. The U.S. government acknowledged {{that some of the}} thirty-five buildings were in poor shape, but maintained that the rest were properly maintained. In 1998, the site was designated by the World Monuments Fund as one of the 100 most endangered sites.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{divergent}} {{costs for}} the project were discussed. The original estimate was £140,000 if the railway was built, and £200,000 if the tunnel was built. Opponents suggested the <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> nearer £700,000, and John Rennie estimated the tunnel line would cost £440,790 in 1809. Opponents argued that the real intent was to improve the water supply for the Basingstoke Canal or to line the pockets of George Hollis, {{the owner of the}} Itchen Navigation. There was considerable interest in the scheme, as 1,244 shares of £100 had been subscribed by early 1809, but with opposition from land and mill owners, and Rennie's report indicating much higher costs, the project was dropped.|$|E
50|$|Mayor Abe Beame spoke {{during the}} {{blackout}} about what citizens were up against during the blackout {{and what the}} <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b>|$|R
50|$|An initial concern <b>was</b> that {{electricity}} <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> excessive, since several computers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> operating continuously. Mason {{figured that}} a central computer could control the energy consumption {{of all the}} other computers in the house.|$|R
50|$|In an {{arrangement}} that endures to this day, the Trust agreed a deal that its administrative <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> largely met by a grant in aid funding from the Ministry of Defence.|$|R
5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, but it soon became apparent that the <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training launches from Vandenberg. This was known as Integrated Weapons System Training (IWST). The first of these launches was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile had exploded on the launch pad just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the Director of Public Relations at the Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British Joint Staff Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST launches, the last of which, codenamed Red Caboose, was on 21 January 1960.|$|E
25|$|After being {{considered}} for upgrading in December1956, the Omak City Council thought that the boundary lighting of what would become known as Omak Airport required improvements, and estimated that the <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> around $16,000.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary work {{estimated}} a $10 {{million annual}} cost of running the various CTfastrak routes and new feeder services. In September 2015, CT Transit released that the yearly <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> substantially higher at $17.5 million.|$|E
30|$|The {{reason for}} {{including}} these <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{that if they}} are not reflected in the average precautionary costs (if they are unexpected due to extreme events), the estimated VTTV is too low.|$|R
40|$|From {{everyday}} experience we {{know that}} an object that differs from its surrounding objects appears to “pop-­out” from the background. Research has shown that response times are slower when the target feature or dimension switches on the next trial than when the target feature or dimension repeats. Currently, it is still unclear whether these switch costs arise early or late in processing. The aim {{of the current study}} was to determine whether switch costs arise early or late in processing by investigating eye-­movements in a visual search task. This experiment improved on the current literature by comparing feature and dimension switch costs using the same task. Participants completed a discrimination task that manipulated the feature of the items (colour) or the dimension of the items (colour or shape) and were instructed to respond to the orientation of the bars inside the odd-­man-out target. It was predicted that one of the following hypotheses <b>would</b> <b>be</b> supported: an early view of switch <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> supported in both feature and dimension conditions; a late view of switch <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> supported in both feature and dimension conditions; or an early view of feature switch <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> supported, and a late view of dimension switch <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> supported. The results showed partial support for all hypotheses. An attentional explanation for feature switch costs, and a post-­selectional explanation for dimension switch costs was put forward. However, the results did not fully support this view, so more research <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed to fully support this claim...|$|R
30|$|When all {{emission}} quota is allocated among demand side, the emission reduction incentive of power generation would disappear. Monitor and control <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> high since the emissions {{of so many}} stakeholders should be covered.|$|R
25|$|Peru, however, {{claimed the}} {{difference}} in <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no more than $300 million. Bolivian proponents of the Peruvian option say it would also benefit {{the economy of the}} northern region of Bolivia through which the pipeline would pass.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{replacement}} cost {{of those who}} leave {{as a result of}} being bullied or witnessing bullying, Rayner and Keashly (2004) estimated that for an organization of 1,000 people, the <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> $1.2 million US. This estimate did not include the cost of litigation should victims bring suit against the organization.|$|E
25|$|Parochial state {{interests}} thwarted {{the plan}} from being adopted. New South Wales refused {{to ratify the}} agreement as only a relatively small proportion of the project <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> spent in NSW, where almost all track was already standard gauge. South Australia objected to the Darwin link being built from Queensland rather than extending the existing Central Australia Railway link from Adelaide to Alice Springs.|$|E
50|$|The Brazilian Poultry Association (UBABEF) {{argued that}} the duties {{were put in place}} to protect the inefficient South African poultry industry, and that higher <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> passed onto consumers, {{approximately}} US $70 million per year.|$|R
5000|$|Welfare substitution: Basic income would {{substitute}} to a {{wide range}} of existing social welfare programmes, tax rebates, state subsidies and work activation spendings. All those budgets (including administrative <b>costs)</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reallocated to finance basic income.|$|R
30|$|In Switzerland, overage costs (especially net {{training}} <b>costs)</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{much higher}} for non-training firms {{as opposed to}} training firms.

25|$|While in the Falkland Islands, FitzRoy {{bought a}} {{schooner}} {{out of his}} own funds to assist with the surveying tasks he had been asked to complete. He had it refitted and renamed Adventure, hoping that the <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reimbursed by the Admiralty. They returned to the mission post but found only Jemmy Button. He had returned to native ways and refused the offer to go with them back to England.|$|E
25|$|It was {{proposed}} that a Deputy Director be paid 65–75% of the salary received by a bureau chief, or between HK$193,774 and $223,586 (US$ 25,000–28,700) a month; an assistant would receive 35–50% {{of the bureau}} chief's salary, or between HK$104,340 and $149,057 a month. Their contracts would expire no later than 30 June 2012. In addition to HK$11.9 million for personal secretaries and drivers, the total annual <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> about HK$60 million.|$|E
25|$|When {{the series}} was {{announced}} in June 2000, Variety reported that A had been licensed to own Nero Wolfe in the U.S. and Canada for an undisclosed fee. Jaffe/Braunstein Films, which retained ownership of the series {{in the rest of}} the world, licensed distribution outside the U.S. to Pearson International Television (now FremantleMedia, Ltd.). Producer Michael Jaffe told Variety that the Nero Wolfe episodes would cost $1 million each; sources said the full production <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> covered by A's and Pearson's licensing fees.|$|E
50|$|Channel 4 {{has raised}} {{concerns}} over {{how it might}} finance its public service obligations after digital switch-over.

50|$|In 1999, {{shortly after}} the company was founded, the Sea Launch {{consortium}} claimed that their launch-related operating <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lower than a land-based equivalent {{due in part to}} reduced staff requirements. The platform and command ship have 310 crew members.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the end of}} 2008, a plan {{to raise}} the ship was put to the Irish cabinet. It was hoped that the €3.8 million <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{paid for by the}} insurers, with the vessel being raised in spring 2009, given {{favourable}} conditions.|$|R
25|$|For the Austrians, {{cost was}} a result of demand, as this would {{determine}} the level of production, depending on the willingness of buyers to pay that cost. Since demand is dependent upon the action of buyers, utility would determine a thing's cost rather than technology. In this context, the Austrian concept of opportunity cost claimed to ruin the British parametric concept of cost. The opportunity <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> that which the purchaser would willingly forgo in agreeing to pay the cost of the option chosen.|$|E
25|$|This {{valuation}} mode {{is typically}} used to value regulated storage, for instance storage operated by interstate pipeline companies. These companies are regulated by FERC. This pricing method allows the developers to recover their cost and an agreed upon return on investment. The regulatory body {{requires that the}} rates and tariffs are maintained and publicly published. The services provided by these companies include firm and interruptible storage as well as no-notice storage services. Usually, cost of service pricing is used for depleted reservoir facilities. If {{it is used to}} price, say salt cavern formations, the <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very high, due to the high cost of development of such facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{embankment}} {{was expanded}} in 1957, increasing {{the capacity to}} 33,000. Two new stands were opened in 1965 further increasing the capacity to 38,500. In 1995 the Hadlee Stand opened in tribute to the successful cricketing family which came from Canterbury. The Hadlee stand was the first stand to be demolished due to earthquake damage. In 2000 saw the demolition of the embankment and No. 4 stand {{and the opening of}} the DB Draught stand (renamed the Tui stand in 2006) and the Paul Kelly Motor Company Stand (West Stand). Both stands sustained severe slump damage during the earthquake in 2011. Although deemed repairable it is unlikely they will be as the <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too expensive.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{immediately}} it {{was discovered}} that Freeman's plans were faulty. Freeman's errors were compounded by the presence of groundwater, and a recalculation of the budget revealed that the actual <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> many times the original figure that the government had allowed for.|$|R
30|$|The current {{analysis}} was conducted using a medium-term perspective and thus did not include estimates of fixed costs (administration, lighting, depreciation of buildings and equipment etc.) or capital costs associated with setting up the day surgery facilities. Inclusion of fixed <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unlikely to alter the conclusion that day surgery can be conducted more cheaply than can inpatient surgery but would likely increase the cost savings of day surgery. The effects of adding capital <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> depend on the structure and organisation of the facilities provided. As the operations resulted in similar medium-term patient outcomes and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unlikely to produce significant differences in long-term patient resource use, the effect of discounting the <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> negligible.|$|R
50|$|Ramsey County {{said the}} Vikings would commit $407 {{million to the}} project, which <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> about 44% of the stadium cost and 39% of the overall cost.
