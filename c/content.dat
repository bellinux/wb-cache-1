It must also prevent illegal draining of digital <b>contents.</b> To design a <b>contents</b> distribution framework satisfying the above requirements, we first present four digital <b>contents</b> distribution models. On the basis of the suggested distribution models, we designed a contract system for distribution of royalties among participants in the <b>contents</b> distribution channel, a license mechanism for enforcement of <b>contents</b> usage to purchasers, and both a packaging mechanism and a secure client system for prevention of illegal draining of digital <b>contents...</b>|$|R

Rather than having raters review each product, publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address <b>content</b> across relevant categories, including violence, sexual <b>content,</b> language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and <b>content</b> descriptors.

Unripe plantain flour {{can be used as}} a composite flour in baking industry and can be better stored because of its low moisture <b>contents</b> (38. 5 %) compared to that rip[e plantain flour which had high moisture <b>contents</b> (61. 3 %) thereby limiting its usage in food industry.
