50|$|The {{final stage}} of amplification, after preamplifiers, is the output stage, where the highest demands are placed on the {{transistors}} or tubes. For this reason, the design choices made around the output device (for single-ended output stages, such as in single-ended triode amplifiers) or devices (for push-pull output stages), such as the Class of operation of the output devices is often taken as {{the description of the}} whole power amplifier. For example, a <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> <b>amplifier</b> will probably have just the high power output devices operating cut off for half of each cycle, while the other devices (such as differential amplifier, voltage amplifier and possibly even driver transistors) operate in Class A. In a transformerless output stage, the devices are essentially in series with the power supply and output load (such as a loudspeaker), possibly via some large capacitor and/or small resistances.|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiver}} system, {{built by}} A.C. Cossor to a TRE design, was a multiple-stage superheterodyne. The {{signal from the}} selected antennas on the receiver towers were fed through the radiogoniometer and then into a three-stage amplifier, with each stage housed in a metal screen box to avoid interference between the stages. Each stage used a <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> <b>amplifier</b> arrangement of EF8s, special low noise, [...] "aligned-grid" [...] pentodes. The output of the initial amplifier was then sent to the intermediate frequency mixer, which extracted a user-selectable amount of the signal, 500, 200 or 50 kHz as selected by a switch on the console. The first setting allowed most of the signal through, and was used under most circumstances. The other settings were available to block out interference, but did so by also blocking some of the signal which reduced the overall sensitivity of the system.|$|E
50|$|It {{would be}} much more {{desirable}} to have an amplifier that would give Class A performance up to the transition level, with Class B after that, rather than AB. This would abolish the AB gain changes that cause extra distortion. This is the basic Class XD principle, and it’s a very simple one, develop a topology that displaces the crossover point to one side of zero crossing - it can be either positive or negative. This is achieved by the injection of an extra current, into the output point of a conventional <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The added ‘displacement’ current does not directly alter the voltage at the output - the output stage inherently has low output impedance, and this is further lowered by the use of global negative feedback. What it does do is alter the pattern of current flowing in the output devices. The displacement current can be sunk to V- from the output, or sourced from V+, so the crossover region is either displaced downward or is pulled upwards. This is arbitrary as the direction of displacement makes no difference, either could be used.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{high-voltage}} analog {{power amplifier}} {{derived from a}} well-known complementary <b>class</b> <b>B</b> <b>amplifier</b> is presented in this paper. The amplifier offers improved efficiency when driving capacitive loads such as piezoelectric multilayer actuators, while maintaining {{a high level of}} signal quality, peak power and low electromagnetic radiation. The main drawback of a <b>class</b> <b>B</b> <b>amplifier</b> in comparison to other power amplifiers is low efficiency, resulting in extensive power-loss in the two complementary transistors of the amplifier stage. Power-loss can be reduced by minimizing the voltage drop across the collector-emitter path of the transistors when a high collector current occurs. The proposed circuit uses an additional capacitor to recover up to one half of the charge stored in the actuator whenever the actuator is being discharged. The capacitor offers an additional power supply rail next to the positive and negative supply voltage of the amplifier stage. Switching the power supply net of the power transistors between the different supply rails, {{in order to reduce the}} voltage drop across the transistors, minimizes power-loss. The development of the amplifier was triggered by the introduction of a new piezoelectric motor and the requirements concerning signal quality and electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, in this paper, the circuit is analyzed using application-specific sinusoidal control signals which are used to drive the motor. Following the analytical investigation of the circuit, the amplifier is tested in an experiment measuring power consumption with a pure reactive load, and the level of distortion caused by the amplifier. In the experiment, a power-loss reduction of 47 % was achieved in comparison with a class B stage. The amplifier processed a peak power of 160 W.

40|$|Currently the Doherty Power Amplifier (DPA) is {{replacing}} the traditional <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> <b>amplifier</b> in base-station and broadcast applications, as such becoming the preferred choice of industry {{due to its}} simplicity and high efficiency performance. In spite of its success, so far practical DPA implementations can provide only a very limited RF bandwidth, which tends to narrow down even more at higher power levels. This narrowband behavior of the DPA is mostly caused {{by the use of}} traditional operating classes for the active devices and bandwidth restrictions related to use of a conventional impedance inverter. In this work, the bandwidth of different DPA topologies has been analyzed, followed by a discussion of recent techniques that can help to improve the DPA bandwidth. To overcome the remaining bandwidth limitations in a DPA design, a novel differential configuration was proposed. In this approach, transmission line based baluns are used to implement the desired wideband 2 nd harmonic terminations of the active devices. By combining this technique with a novel wideband impedance inverter, excellent DPA wideband performance can be achieved. Unfortunately, when going to practical balun implementations, various imperfections come to light, which trouble the achievable DPA bandwidth performance. For this reason, three practical balun structures are investigated in detail, namely, the coaxial cable based balun, the vertically installed planar balun and suspended planar stripline balun. To explore the proposed DPA concept when using practical baluns, two DPAs featuring mixed-signal driven inputs are presented. A dedicated design procedure for these DPAs is also given. The first prototype is implemented using NXP GaN devices and coaxial cable based baluns. Simulation results show a maximum output power of 52 dBm, but in 6 dB power back-off we only reach 40 % efficiency from 530 MHz to 700 MHz, which is significantly less than the intend bandwidth (450 MHz- 810 MHz). Using the lessons learned of this first amplifier, a second design with NXP LDMOS devices and suspended planar stripline balun has been developed. According to simulation this later design provides a maximum output power of 59 dBm with the efficiency above 55 % at both full power and 6 dB power back-off. According the simulations this second design can even achieve 50 % efficiency at 8 dB back-off. The related center frequency is 650 MHz with a high-efficiency bandwidth at 6 dB power back-off (efficiency within 10 % of its maximum) from 460 MHz to 790 MHz.
