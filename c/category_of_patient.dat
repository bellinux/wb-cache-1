40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to rank the risk of {{nosocomial}} infection (NI) according to patient type by analysing the results of annual prevalence studies carried out in Franche-Comté from 2001 to 2004. Patients (N= 14, 905) were divided into four categories according to the number of endogenous risk factors (age, immunodepression, MacCabe score). The overall prevalence of infection was 6. 1 % and varied according to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> from 1. 93 % (no risk factors) to 15. 2 % (three risk factors). The frequencies of NI related to an invasive procedure and to cross-contamination with multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were 30. 9 % and 12. 3 %, respectively; these percentages did not depend on the type of patient. The prevalence of NI decreased over time for patients with two or three risk factors, but was stable for patients with no risk factors. More than 40 % of NIs were potentially avoidable (related to invasive procedures or involving cross-transmission of an MDR bacterium) regardless of the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient.</b> This study suggests that at least 30 % of NIs could be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} was to estimate the proportion of inhabitants with a diagnosis-registered encounter with a general practitioner, and to elucidate annual variations <b>of</b> clinical <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> in terms <b>of</b> their individual comorbidity. Methods A three-year retrospective study of encounter data from electronic patient records, with an annual-based application of the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) system. Data were retrieved from every patient with a diagnosis-registered encounter with a GP during the period 2001 – 2003 at 13 publicly managed primary health care centres in Blekinge county, southeastern Sweden, with about 150000 inhabitants. Main outcome measures: Proportions of inhabitants with a diagnosis-registered encounter, and ranges of the annual proportions <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> according to ACGs. Results The proportion of inhabitants with a diagnosis-registered encounter ranged from about 64. 0 % to 90. 6 % for the primary health care centres, and averaged about 76. 5 % for all inhabitants. In a three-year perspective the average range <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> was about 0. 4 % on the county level, and about 0. 9 % on the primary health care centre level. About one third <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> each year had a constellation {{of two or more}} types of morbidity. Conclusion About three fourths of all inhabitants had one or more diagnosis-registered encounters with a general practitioner during the three-year period. The annual variation <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> according to ACGs was small on both the county and the primary health care centre level.

Survival results <b>of</b> the four <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> stage IVA <b>patients</b> were compared. Results: Among stage IVA patients, survival was significantly worse in those with tumors involving a major branch of the portal or hepatic veins than in those with tumors invading adjacent organs, bilobar multiple tumors, or perforated visceral peritoneum. There {{were no significant differences}} in survival among the latter three groups. By Cox regression analysis, invasion of the portal or hepatic veins and presence of cirrhosis were independent adverse prognostic factors of overall survival among stage IVA <b>patients,</b> and invasion <b>of</b> the portal or hepatic veins was the only significant adverse prognostic factor of disease-free survival.

40|$|In {{recent years}} chronic courses of {{hepatitis}} E virus (HEV) infection {{have been described}} in immunosuppressed individuals. This may implicate a potential role for HEV {{in the development of}} autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Here we investigated the prevalence of HEV-antibodies in AIH patients in an endemic Central European country. HEV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and HEV RNA were determined in 354 and 377 AIH patients, respectively. Clinical characteristics and disease outcome parameters were retrospectively collected. No HEV viraemic patients were identified in this cohort. A total of 106 AIH patients (29. 9 %) tested positive for anti-HEV IgG, and this figure was slightly higher compared to the prevalence in a reference cohort including 5, 329 healthy Dutch blood donors (26. 7 %; P> 0. 05). This is the largest study on the association between HEV infection and AIH. Apparently silent HEV infection is present in a significant proportion of AIH patients, yet appears not to have significant clinical repercussions in this immune compromised group of patients.

40|$|Reference {{symptoms}} of individual diseases, {{which are usually}} gleaned from hospital-based observations, may not be pertinent to primary health care. Observed relationships between symptoms and diseases can be biased by consultation, disease verification, and referral patterns. These biases are shown to affect sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, the likelihood ratio, and the odds ratio. On the assumption that consultation and disease veri-fication rates are positively influenced by symptoms, but not directly by the yet unknown disease status of the patient, the general practitioner will observe a higher sensitivity and a lower specificity than in an unselected population. A positive correlation between symptom and disease will decrease the likelihood ratio, while the predictive values and the odds ratio are not changed after consultation. Referral is influenced by both symptom status and disease verification status. In general, the disease verification and referral patterns of general prac-titioners have not been quantified. While the influence of referral cannot easily be corrected for, the likely magnitude and direction of selection bias can be evaluated using simple formulas.

40|$|AIM: To {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the surgical and perioperative complications in a series of seventy-five right hepatectomies for living-donation (RHLD) performed in our center. METHODS: From January 2002 to September 2007, we performed 75 RHLD, defined as removal of a portion of the liver corresponding to Couinaud segments 5 - 8, in order to obtain a graft for adult to adult living-related liver transplantation (ALRLT). Surgical complications were stratified {{according to the most recent}} version of the Clavien classification of postoperative surgical complications. The perioperative period was defined as within 90 d of surgery. RESULTS: No living donor mortality was present in this series, no donor operation was aborted and no donors received any blood transfusion. Twenty-three (30. 6 %) living donors presented one or more episodes of complication in the perioperative period. Seven patients (9. 33 %) out of 75 developed biliary complications, which were the most common complications in our series.

40|$|Background: The {{palliative care}} {{literature}} continually supports {{the view that}} home remains the preferred place of death of most patients with terminal illness. However, it also reports that in many countries, palliative care patients sometimes change their minds with regard to this preference. A variety of factors appears to intervene preventing patients from dying at home. The socio-demographics of patients presenting to St. Luke's Hospice, and how this relates to place of death, has never been evaluated. It is believed that in this setting, there is ironically more likelihood of many patients from poorer socio-economic circumstances dying at home. This could be {{as a result of}} living with larger families, more difficulty in obtaining access to institutional beds and cultural beliefs. Aim: To determine factors which influence the place of death of patients referred to St. Luke's Hospice over a one-year period. Method: This is a prospective, descriptive, quantitative study of the place of death of new patients referred to St Luke's Hospice, a palliative care service with an inpatient unit and home care programme, between 1 May 2001 and 30 April 2002. Only those patients who died within this time frame were analysed. A "teleform" was designed {{with the assistance of the}} Alberta Cancer Board Palliative Care Research Initiative. This form allowed the information to be entered directly into a database for analysis. The variables to be analysed with regard to place of death include: - • Age • Gender • Race • Social Structure • <b>Category</b> <b>of</b> <b>Patient</b> i. e. State or Private • Formal Educational Level • Duration of Illness • Palliative Performance Scale Result This study suggests that. almost two-thirds of patients with a terminal illness can be supported in their homes by a home care programme, without referral to an institution. These statistics correlate well with death statistics of other palliative home care services in industrialised countries. Variables such as age, gender, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient,</b> palliative performance scale and duration of illness bore no significant relationship to place of death. However, place of death was strongly associated with race, social structure and socio-economic status. Interestingly, black patients were more likely to die in an institution. Conclusion: Studying socio-demographic factors related to place of death is only one aspect of evaluating and determining the needs of the terminally ill and their families in South Africa. Should or can more people die at home? Are home deaths feasible, and if so how? The task that lies ahead of us in South Africa is to decide what kind of palliative care or other service is optimal. cost effective and appropriate to meet the needs of our multi-cultural society...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to new demands for infant walking orthoses consideration {{was given to}} the development of a device for this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient.</b> A specially developed hip joint with the required structural properties (Woollam et al., 2001) provided an opportunity for this development. Earlier structural assessment, and limited cyclic load testing of key elements of the orthosis (primarily the body brace), confirmed that a safe device for evaluation with patients could, theoretically, be produced. A provisional prototype was therefore designed and manufactured for initial structural testing of the complete infant orthosis (Stallard et al., 2001). Efficiency of walking is strongly influenced by the lateral rigidity of the orthosis. Monitoring the structural performance of the provisional infant design indicated it would equal or improve on the stiffness of that achieved in the adult specification. Additionally, relative strength was comparable with the adult version, which has proven to be safe and reliable in many years of routine prescription. This, together with the limited cyclic testing of the complete orthosis (Stallard et al., 2001), gave confidence that it was safe to proceed with controlled field evaluation of the infant design when supplied as a rehabilitation engineering device within the provisions of an ISO 9001 and EN 46001 QA System.
