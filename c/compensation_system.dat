5|$|The second {{aspect of}} the <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> {{involves}} the start gate position. If the gate is changed at any point during a round after at least one athlete has jumped, then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions the gate was moved up, or awarded additional points for the gate being lowered. In variable wind conditions requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated, {{it is not uncommon}} for many gate changes to be made as a round wears on. In the era prior to gate compensation, athletes who had jumped before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way back up the hill to jump again, which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints.|$|E

In the hearing Berry stated he supported any effective employee <b>compensation</b> <b>system,</b> but that the federal government had the obligation to give employees with comparable job performances similar pay and treatment. He pledged to preserve veterans preference and supplement it with training programs to prepare veterans for federal jobs, and promised reviews of proposals to improve the security clearance and hiring processes. Berry emphasized the importance for agencies to use all recruitment tools, citing relocation benefits that could keep agencies competitive with the private sector, and stated he would create a strategic plan and set performance goals for the Office of Personnel Management. Berry had stated support for benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act.|$|E

[...] In the rural areas, most people obtained food and manufactured goods from neighbors and other people they knew personally. [...] As industry and commerce grew, goods such as food, materials, and medicines were no longer made by neighbors, but by large companies. [...] In response, citizens called on their government for consumer protection, inspection of goods, and regulation of public utilities. [...] The growth of the automobile spurred calls to develop roads and to enforce traffic laws. [...] The state officially started its trunk highway system in 1920, {{with the passage of}} the Babcock Amendment that established 70 Constitutional Routes around the state.

The safety of industrial workers and miners became an increasing concern, and brought about the workers' <b>compensation</b> <b>system.</b> [...] Since government was getting more complex, citizens demanded more of a role in their government, and became more politically active.|$|E

We focus on compensation packages for R&D employees who {{play a critical role}} in successful implementations of innovation strategy. Using compensation data for middle-level managers and professional employees from 237 firms in the high-technology industry, we found that a firm’s strategic intention to pursue innovation has a significant influence on the relative pay level, compensation time horizon, and stock option vesting period lengths of this strategic employee group.

If the S. latifolia did not practice dosage compensation, the expected level of X-linked gene expression in males would be 50% that of females, thus the plant practices some degree of dosage compensation but, because male expression is not 100% that of females, {{it has been suggested that}} S. latiforia and its dosage <b>compensation</b> <b>system</b> is still evolving. Additionally, in plant species that lack dimorphic sex chromosomes, dosage compensation can occur when aberrant meiotic events or mutations result in either aneuploidy or polyploidy.

This paper aims to address this research gap by drawing on interviews with 61 animal keepers and 21 veterinarians, as well as a series of nine animal keeper focus groups across five different livestock sectors in England. The perceived influence of current <b>compensation</b> <b>systems</b> on disease control behaviour was explored and alternative <b>compensation</b> <b>systems</b> that respectively reward positive practices and penalise poor practices were presented in the form of scenarios, alongside a third system that considered the option of a cost sharing levy system between industry and government. The results indicate that animal keepers consider themselves to be influenced by a range of non-financial factors e. g. feelings of responsibility, reputation, and animal welfare concerns, in the context of their exotic disease management practices. The majority of animal keepers were unaware of the current <b>compensation</b> <b>systems</b> in place for exotic diseases, and were therefore not consciously influenced by financial recompense. Concerns were raised about linking compensation to disease management behaviour due to auditing difficulties. A cost sharing levy system would likely raise awareness of exotic disease and compensation among animal keepers, but differentiation of payments based upon individual farm-level risk assessments was called for by participants as a strategy to promote positive disease management practices...|$|R
