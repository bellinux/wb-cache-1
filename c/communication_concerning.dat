5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. The first part of qualifying (Q1) was disrupted towards the end, when Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso came to a halt at the hairpin, preventing a number of drivers from improving on their lap times. Marcus Ericsson, whose first timed lap had been hampered by a spin, was one of the affected drivers and was eliminated in 17th place. Jenson Button also did not make it into Q2. While his second run was also affected by Verstappen, he lost time in his first due to a failure of <b>communication</b> <b>concerning</b> his engine mode.

Work on the fan translation took place over the following two years, during which time Square Enix was noncommittal concerning an official Western release. The patch was initially announced for an August 2014 release, but was instead was released on June 9, 2014. According to the translation team leader, the patch was downloaded 100,000 times {{in the first four}} days. It was taken down in July of the same year after Square Enix allegedly threatened unspecified legal action, originally thought to be a cease-and-desist order.

Before the release, Square Enix and the translation team had been in friendly <b>communication</b> <b>concerning</b> the translation. The formal requests to take the patch down were made in the weeks following its release, shortly before the announcement of Type-0 HD.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study explored {{the components of}} the assimilation stage of graduate teaching assistant (GTA) socialization. Subjects, 64 GTAs attending a large midwestern university, completed 4 survey instruments concerning their attitudes on mentoring and communication support, information seeking strategies, teacher <b>communication</b> <b>concerns,</b> and organizational socialization tactics. Results indicated that supportive communication relationships correlated with information-seeking practices, teacher <b>communication</b> <b>concern,</b> and organizational socialization tactics; and information-seeking practices correlated with teacher <b>communication</b> <b>concern</b> and organizational socialization tactics. Partial correlation analysis revealed three significant findings: supportive communication relationships and organizational socialization tactics; information-seeking practices and teacher communication concern; and supportive communication relationships and information-seeking practices. Findings suggest that communication is a central component of GTA socialization. Future research should explore mentor-protege relationships, peer relationships, and information seeking.

NNS identified their concerns in communicating with Americans, the perceived causes of their concerns, and the strategies they would employ to address these concerns. Americans noted their perceptions of NNS’ (heavy and mild) accents and identified factors that influence their perceptions of NNS and decisions to communicate with NNS. Results revealed that the more NNS attribute their <b>communication</b> <b>concerns</b> to Americans’ bias, the more likely they would avoid interacting with Americans. Results also suggested that Americans show a more favorable attitude toward mild accent NNS. We discuss the implications these findings have for international education and future research...|$|R

They use classical themes and traditional folk music to base their music on. Bardo State started producing in 2004 and their debut album Mariposa was released in 2008. Their album Mariposa has been reviewed in national as well as in international magazines. Bardo State has among others remixed Radiohead and covered David Bowie and Kate Bush. One of their tracks, [...] "Kosovo", was the soundtrack of the Hollywood film Jekyll and Hyde.
