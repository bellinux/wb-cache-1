40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} potential therapeutic uses of calcitonin in {{the prevention}} and treatment of osteoporosis. OPTIONS: Parenterally and intranasally administered <b>calcitonin</b> (<b>eel,</b> salmon or human). OUTCOMES: Fracture, fracture pain and loss of bone mineral density in osteoporosis; increased bone mass, prevention of fractures, reduction of pain and improved quality of life associated with calcitonin treatment. EVIDENCE: Relevant clinical studies and reports were examined, {{with an emphasis on}} recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials. In vitro and in vivo studies of osteoclast activity were also considered. VALUES: Reducing fractures and fracture pain, increasing bone mineral density and minimizing side effects of treatment were given a high value. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Calcitonin reduces acute pain associated with osteoporotic fractures and has been found useful in treating chronic back pain following vertebral fractures in spinal osteoporosis. It can prevent bone loss and may be effective in preventing fractures. Side effects are dose related and generally mild; they include gastrointestinal, vascular and dermatologic conditions that can be treated symptomatically or by varying the dosage. Side effects are much rarer with nasal administration than with injection. True allergic reactions are rare. RECOMMENDATIONS: Calcitonin in both intramuscular and intranasal forms can reduce the pain of acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures and may be effective in treating that associated with chronic vertebral osteoporotic fractures. Calcitonin may also prevent postmenopausal bone loss and increase bone density in those with established osteoporosis. Current evidence for long-term prevention of fractures is limited and does not support the use of calcitonin as a first-line treatment for established osteoporosis. Most side effects can be avoided with nasal administration. Further trials are needed to assess fracture prevention and effective dose ranges for treating pain and increasing bone mineral density and to determine the long-term efficacy of calcitonin in secondary osteoporosis, in premenopausal women, in men and in elderly people...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the metabolic effects of unmodified <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin,</b> nine normal subjects and eleven patients with Paget's {{disease of the}} bone entered the study. <b>Eel</b> <b>calcitonin</b> was administered via rectal mucosa at the dosage of 100 and 200 MRCU. Plasma calcium, plasma phosphate and plasma cAMP were measured at a baseline and after 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 min. Rectal administration of 100 MRCU of <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin</b> decreased plasma calcium and phosphate levels in normal subjects; the hypocalcaemic and hypophosphatemic effects were more marked and statistically significant in Paget's disease patients. Using 200 MRCU of <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin,</b> statistically significant reductions in plasma calcium levels were observed in controls and in Paget's disease patients. Plasma phosphate decreased after rectal administration of the hormone, but not significantly. A slight but not significant increase in plasma cAMP was observed in normal subjects after the administration of 200 MRCU. These data demonstrate that <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin</b> administered via rectal mucosa can exert some of the known biologic effects of the peptide...|$|R
50|$|Elcatonin is a Calcitonin {{derivative}} {{which is}} transformed from <b>eel's</b> <b>calcitonin</b> {{by changing the}} S-S bond into the stable C-N bond. It inhibits the absorption and autolysis of bones, thus leads to blood calcium descending. In addition, it inhibits the bone salts dissolving and transferring and promotes the excretion of calcium and phosphorus in urine. Meanwhile, it inhibits renal tubules reabsorbing calcium, phosphorus and sodium and keeps blood calcium at normal level. It is mainly used for remitting or eliminating the pain caused by Osteoporosis.|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{examines}} {{the effect of}} different calcitonins and analogs on the in vitro phosphorylation of brain synaptic membrane proteins. The findings demonstrate that calcitonin is a potent inhibitor of several brain synaptic proteins and that salmon and <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonins</b> are considerably more potent than thyrocalcitonin in eliciting this effect. Deletion of leucine from position 16 in salmon calcitonin sequence resulted in a drastic loss of inhibitory activity, indicating the importance for a hydrophobic residue at position 16 in the intact calcitonin molecule. The mechanism of calcitonin inhibition of protein phosphorylation was likely due to the blockade of stimulation of protein kinases by calmodulin...|$|R
40|$|Intersternocostoclavicular {{ossification}} is {{a benign}} arthro-osteitis {{of the upper}} anterior chest of unknown cause. Two patients with acute exacerbation of this disorder were successfully treated with intramuscular injections of an <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin</b> analogue (40 units three times a week). Besides symptomatic relief of local pain and swelling, serial scintigrams showed quantitative improvement in radiophosphonate uptake. The rapid alleviation of pain implies that the hormone has a central analgesic effect, {{in addition to its}} direct influence on bone cells and antiinflammatory action. In one patient the disease was associated with palmoplantar pustulosis, which was cured with oral colchicine, whereas the other patient did not have such skin lesions. Despite a hypothetical link between palmoplantar pustulosis and intersternocostoclavicular ossification, colchicine had no beneficial impact on the bone pain. Salmon calcitonin delivered by nasal spray was tried for the second patient but failed, probably because of insufficient drug delivery. The initial favourable results described here warrant future use of calcitonin injection on a larger number of patients with intersternocostoclavicular ossification...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{different}} calcitonins interact with planar lipid membranes to form ion channels. in this study, glycosylation of <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin</b> (eCt) at different positions (Ct 3 -GIcNAc, Ct 14 -GIcNAc, Ct 2 O-GIcNAc, Ct 26 -GIcNAc) is shown to preserve molecular structure and slightly change the energy of incorporation and channel formation in planar lipid bilayers made up of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine:dioleoyl phosphatidyl-glycerol (85 : 15, w:w). The voltage needed to form channels decreased as the attached carbohydrate moved toward the C-terminal (eCt = Ct 3 -GIcNAc > Ct 14 -GIcNAc = Ct 20 GIcNAc: > Ct 26 -GlcNAc). Interestingly, all the Cts tested maintain the characteristic voltage-conductance dependence found for other Cts, the only channel properties modified concern ion selectivity, that shift toward anion selectivity (eCt = 0. 97, Ct 3 -GIcNAc = 0. 49, Ct 14 -GIcNAc = 0. 41, Ct 20 -GIcNAc = 0. 36, Ct 26 -GIcNAc = 0. 47). These aspects would be useful in managing peptide properties for biotechnological and therapeutic applications considering the physiological nature of this peptide. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In {{order to}} examine whether {{calcitonin}} {{plays an important role}} in Ca homeostasis of teleosts, such as suppressing hypercalcemia at food intake, we compared the plasma Ca levels and <b>calcitonin</b> levels in <b>eels</b> fed normally with eels starved for one week (Experiment I), and in goldfish administered with a high Ca-consomme solution into the digestive tract with goldfish given physiological saline solution (Experiment II). In Experiment I, the plasma Ca levels and calcitonin levels in the fed eels were significantly higher than those in the starved eels after one week. In Experiment II, the plasma Ca levels in the high Ca-treated goldfish were significantly higher than those in the saline-treated goldfish after 1 hr and 3 hr. The number of goldfish showing over 500 pg/ml of plasma calcitonin was significantly higher in the high Ca-treated group than in the saline-treated group. From the results of both experiments, we conclude that in these two species, Ca and/or nutriment absorbed via the digestive tract may affect plasma calcitonin levels. However, more experiments are needed to directly demonstrate that calcitonin suppresses hypercalcemia at food intake...|$|R
40|$|Calcitonin {{has been}} {{isolated}} and its structure defined from several species, including man. Synthetic preparations of several calcitonins {{are available for}} clinical use. Of these, porcine (pCT), human (hCT), and salmon (sCT) have been synthetized according to their natural sequences, while <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin</b> (cCT) is available as amino-suberic acid derivative (ASU-eCT). The different molecular configuration results in different biological potency and tolerability. Currently, the potency of calcitonin in man is evaluated by its capacity of lowering serum calcium and stimulating cAMP plasma levels after acute infusion. In normal subjects, cAMP stimulation {{seems to be a}} more sensitive test, since plasma calcium in normal subjects is poorly affected by an acute treatment with calcitonin. On the other hand, the side effects are usually assessed by clinical observation, on the basis of duration and intensity of the symptoms. Our experience, emerging from several studies devoted to comparing the biological activity and tolerability of different calcitonin preparations in humans, indicates that the hypocalcemic effect and the increase of plasma cAMP are produced by all peptides, according to the potency order sCT greater than hCT greater than ASU-eCT. For all peptides, the most constant side effect is flushing, and the frequency order of side effects is hCT greater than sCT = ASU-eC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: <b>Eel</b> <b>calcitonin</b> (elcatonin) {{injection}} {{is widely}} used for elderly patients suffering from somatic pain in Japan. However, {{there have been few}} reports on the analgesic effects of elcatonin injection. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the analgesic effects of elcatonin injection in postmenopausal women with lower back pain. Methods: This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Thirty-six women aged � 50 years with acute lower back pain participated in this study. They were randomly divided into two treatment groups according to whether they received a placebo or a weekly trigger point injection of elcatonin (20 units). They were observed for 5 weeks and the extent of pain at motion and at rest according to the visual analog scale (VAS) was evaluated. The mean VAS scores for the elcatonin group were then compared with those of the placebo group. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the mean VAS scores for pain at rest between the two groups during the 5 -week treatment course. However, the mean VAS scores for motion pain in the elcatonin group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group at the third, fifth and sixth weeks. Conclusions: Elcatonin injection (20 units) significantly relieved motion pain in the lower back in postmenopausal women after three weeks of treatment. This analgesic effect continued for the subsequent 3 weeks...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{evaluated}} the clinical usefulness {{of a commercial}} two-site immunoassay for calcitonin, {{which is based on}} two monoclonal antibodies against distinct epitopes of calcitonin. The potential lower detection limit of the assay was 2 ng/ 1. Inter-assay and intra-assay variation were both < 11 %. No cross reaction with calcitonins from different species (salmon and <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin)</b> was found. Of the various fragments of human calcitonin, only the 11 — 32 fragment could be detected. Basal calcitonin concentrations in normals (n = 69) ranged from < 2 ng/ 1 to 50 ng/ 1. Basal calcitonin concentrations in 30 % of the men (< 2 — 48 ng/ 1) and 51 % of the women (< 2 — 10 ng/ 1) were undetectable. Stimulation of calcitonin with pentagastrin (0. 5 g/kg body weight) in normal subjects was followed by an increase in calcitonin in all men (n = 17) and in 60 % of the women (n = 12). The upper reference value for pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin concentrations for all 29 normals was 78 ng/ 1 (defined as the 95 th percentile) : 79 ng/ 1 for men, and 50 ng/ 1 for women. Using a different immunoradiometric two-site assay, a similar percentage of "positive " responses to pentagastrin in normals was obtained (20 out of 29). Four previously thyroidectomized patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma had normal basal, but patho-logical stimulated calcitonin values at follow-up. At reoperation, cervical lymph nodes with tumour tissue were removed. Postoperatively, the patients had basal and stimulated calcitonin concentrations within th...|$|R
40|$|Recently, Furuya et al. (Furuya et al., 2000) {{described}} {{the isolation of}} two diuretic hormones (DHs) from the corpora cardiaca of the Pacific beetle cockroach Diploptera punctata. The shorter peptide (31 amino acid residues) was named D. punctata DH 31 (Dippu-DH 31 following the species abbreviation used by NCBI/Swiss-Prot), while the longer peptide (46 residues) was named D. punctata DH 46 (Dippu-DH 46). Both were identified {{on the basis of}} their ability to increase cyclic AMP production by Malpighian tubules of either the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta (Dippu-DH 46) or the grasshopper Schistocerca americana (Dippu-DH 31), assays used previously for the identification of insect corticotropin (CRF) -related diuretic peptides (Kay et al., 1991 a). The diuretic activity of each peptide was subsequently confirmed in a fluid secretion assay using Malpighian tubules from Diploptera punctata and the migratory locust Locusta migratoria. Dippu-DH 46 belongs to the insect CRF-related peptide family (Schooley, 1993) and has 78 % sequence identity to a previously described peptide from Periplaneta americana (Peram-DP; Kay et al., 1992), whereas Dippu-DH 31 is a novel peptide with some similarity to vertebrate calcitonin. The sequence similarity between Dippu-DH 31 and calcitonin is small (seven residues are identical to <b>calcitonins</b> from chicken, <b>eel</b> and goldfish), but chicken calcitonin does stimulate fluid secretion by Diploptera punctata tubules (Furuya et al., 2000). Although isolated using the same bioassay, Dippu-DH 31 and Dippu-DH 46 differ in their mode of action. The maximal diuretic activity of Dippu-DH 31 is approximately 40 % that of Dippu-DH 46, and when tested together at sub-maxima...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{polypeptide}} hormone calcitonin is clinically {{well known for}} its ability to relieve neuropathic pain such as spinal canal stenosis, diabetic neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome. Mechanisms for its analgesic effect, however, remain unclear. Here we investigated the mechanism of anti-hyperalgesic action of calcitonin in a neuropathic pain model in rats. Results Subcutaneous injection of elcatonin, a synthetic derivative of <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin,</b> relieved hyperalgesia induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI). Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the CCI provoked the upregulation of tetrodotoxin (TTX) -sensitive Nav. 1. 3 mRNA and downregulation of TTX-resistant Nav 1. 8 and Nav 1. 9 mRNA on the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which would consequently increase the excitability of peripheral nerves. These changes were reversed by elcatonin. In addition, the gene expression of the calcitonin receptor and binding site of 125 I-calcitonin was increased at the constricted peripheral nerve tissue but not at the DRG. The anti-hyperalgesic effect and normalization of sodium channel mRNA by elcatonin was parallel to the change of the calcitonin receptor expression. Elcatonin, however, did not affect the sensitivity of nociception or gene expression of sodium channel, while it suppressed calcitonin receptor mRNA under normal conditions. Conclusions These results suggest that the anti-hyperalgesic action of calcitonin on CCI rats could be attributable to the normalization of the sodium channel expression, which might be exerted by an unknown signal produced at the peripheral nerve tissue but not by DRG neurons through the activation of the calcitonin receptor. Calcitonin signals were silent in the normal condition and nerve injury may be one of triggers for conversion of a silent to an active signal. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Elcatonin (eCT), an <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin</b> derivative, {{is shown}} to {{considerably}} improve the clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory data, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The therapeutic efficacy of eCT, however, is reduced by preceding and/or concomitant use of corticosteroid. Thus the effects of eCT on the production of immunoglobulins, IgMRF and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) by mononuclear cells (MNCs) /monocytes were studied, and compared among patients with RA that received three kinds of treatment and also normal volunteers (NV). METHODS [...] Ten patients with RA had been treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug only (NSAID group), 11 with oral prednisolone (PSL group), and eight with intramuscular eCT (eCT group). MNCs/monocytes from these patients, and also 10 from the NV group, were collected and cultured. IgG, IgA, IgM, IgMRF, IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta in the supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the NSAID, PSL and NV groups, eCT {{was added to the}} culture medium, and the effects of eCT on production of these substances were studied. RESULTS [...] Baseline production of IgM, IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta by MNCs/monocytes in the eCT and NV groups was significantly lower than that in the NSAID group. Furthermore, addition of eCT to the culture medium significantly inhibited the productions of IgG, IgMRF, IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta by MNCs/monocytes in the NSAID group, whereas production of neither IgG, IgA, IgM, IgMRF nor IL- 1 by MNCs/monocytes in the PSL and NV groups was affected by eCT. CONCLUSION [...] eCT may regulate immune responses through MNC/monocyte function in patients with RA. The present results support our proposal that eCT is an effective agent for the treatment of RA...|$|R
40|$|Bone mineral density (BMD) {{measured}} by densitometry is the elective parameter for {{the diagnosis of}} osteopenia and osteoporosis. Biochemical markers have been proposed as sensitive indicators of high bone turnover and for monitoring response to antiresorptive treatment. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the values of biochemical markers of bone metabolism {{with a view to}} early diagnosis of osteoporosis and monitoring of hormone replacement and calcitonin therapy. The subjects were 415 women, mean age 51 +/- 8 years (43 - 62 years) in peri- and postmenopause, recruited at the Menopause Center of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Siena University and divided in five groups. Bone densitometry was performed in all subjects and blood samples were taken for assayed biochemical markers, that is, [osteocalcin (OC), parathyroid hormone (PTH), type 1 procollagen (PICP), and calcitonin (CT) ]. Three groups of women were divided into two subgroups: those with normal and those with low BMD (< 1 SD). Basal concentrations of PCP 1, OC, PTH, and CT were compared in the various groups. Two groups of postmenopausal women with BMD below the normal were treated with estrogen replacement therapy and unmodified <b>eel</b> <b>calcitonin.</b> We evaluated whether some of these biochemical markers of bone turnover could help identify women with low BMD and whether they could be useful for monitoring the results of antiresorptive therapies. Markers of bone formation (PICP and OC) make it possible to distinguish women with high turnover who are at risk for osteoporosis from women with low turnover in menopause. A good correlation was also found between changes in levels of these markers and changes in BMD during treatments, which suggests that the PICP and OC would be useful for monitoring response to antiresorptive therapy...|$|R
