This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was begun by Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval Venetian wealth and power. The church is also {{a monument to the}} great Byzantine influence on Venetian art and culture throughout its history, but particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee {{the beginning}} or completion of St Mark's Basilica, his rule <b>covered</b> <b>a</b> longer period of its construction than the other two Doges who oversaw the project.|$|E

Finding <b>a</b> prime <b>cover,</b> <b>an</b> irredundant prime <b>cover,</b> or <b>a</b> minimal prime <b>cover</b> of <b>a</b> function f is a problem that arises in several fields of computer science, for instance in logic synthesis, automated reasoning, realiability analysis, and some optimization problems.

In logic synthesis, <b>an</b> irredundant prime <b>cover,</b> or better, <b>a</b> minimal prime <b>cover,</b> provides the user with an efficient 2 -level logic implementation of a single or multi output Boolean function [2, 24, 14].

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Leipzig {{was assigned to the}} blocking force that was intended to prevent the escape of the Polish Navy from the Baltic; they were unsuccessful. Leipzig thereafter went to the North Sea, where she and the other light cruisers laid a series of defensive minefields. This task lasted {{through the end of the}} month, after which she returned to the Baltic for training maneuvers. On 1719 November, Leipzig <b>covered</b> <b>a</b> minelaying operation in the North Sea. She joined Deutschland, Köln, and three torpedo boats for a sweep in the Skagerrak for Allied shipping on 2122 November. Leipzig was tasked with escorting the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau through the Skagerrak, and with covering their return on the 27th.|$|E

He studied with the anatomist Guillaume Dupuytren during 1801–1804. Villermé then spent 10 years serving in the army room during 1804–1814 under the reign of Napoleon. In the year 1819 Villermé married. After his military service, he began work as Secretary-General of the Société Médicale d'Emulation in 1818. Villermé was elected to the Académie royale de médecine in 1823.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the fatwa <b>covered</b> <b>a</b> wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.|$|E
