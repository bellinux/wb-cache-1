50|$|The IFA G5 is a three-axle <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> {{developed}} and produced by IFA in East Germany from 1952 until 1964.|$|E
50|$|All 26 rockets can {{be fired}} in under 60 seconds and re-loaded in under {{five minutes from}} a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> with a 15 t/m crane.|$|E
50|$|Trailer buses {{are usually}} pulled by a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> from various truck manufacturers, {{while others have}} larger space cabs. Trailer bus bodies are built by various local builders.|$|E
50|$|Popular <b>conventional</b> {{skateboard}} <b>trucks</b> include Independent and Tracker. Popular reverse kingpin trucks include Randal and Paris. Reverse kingpin {{trucks were}} created with longboarding in mind. While {{they are usually}} considered to have more grip and stability (two important things in the downhill discipline), <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks</b> {{have a very different}} feel that is often preferred by many longboarders.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, Ford {{introduced}} the L-Series [...] "Louisville" [...] line of <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks,</b> moving all heavy truck development {{away from the}} F-Series. The L-Series/Aeromax would remain in production through 1998, as Ford exited the heavy-truck segment.|$|R
50|$|American Truck Simulator {{takes place}} in North America, and will feature over 100 {{different}} cities. The game features American-style <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks,</b> instead of the European cab over trucks found in the previous two games, and was released on 2 February 2016.|$|R
5000|$|A gauge {{adjustable}} truck {{complete with}} wheelsets weighs {{a total of}} about one ton/tonne more than a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> and normally must use disc brakes, which cool more slowly.|$|E
50|$|The EPA {{calculated}} for this test vehicle, the hybrid technology added {{a cost of}} about US$7,000 over a comparable <b>conventional</b> <b>truck,</b> while the lifetime fuel savings over 20 years were estimated above $50,000.|$|E
50|$|The 500 was {{characterized}} by having an aerodynamic shape, which was improved over the years during production. The 500 model was the last <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> produced by Alfa Romeo, after which the company concentrated on producing cabover trucks.|$|E
50|$|In Australia both American (cab over axle) and European/Japanese/Chinese (cab {{forward of}} axle) types, {{as well as}} the {{conventional}} type are common. Cab over engine types dominate urban and light duty use, with <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks</b> predominating in remote and off road areas. Both types are common for highway use.|$|R
50|$|For 1980, General Motors {{introduced}} the Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick as Class 5-7 <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks.</b> Slotted above the medium-duty C/K trucks and slightly below the Chevrolet Bruin/GMC Brigadier, the Kodiak/TopKick combined the updated cab of the C/K with a heavier-duty GVWR {{and a larger}} hood, allowing for mid-range diesel engines, up to the Caterpillar 3208 V8. Two-door and four-door cab configurations were available.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} the availability of its truck lineup, Ford offered rebadged trucks in its Mercury dealerships starting in 1946. While initially applied to the Ford F-Series light trucks (becoming the M-Series), Mercury offered many counterparts of the Ford truck line. Other products included medium-duty <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks,</b> MB-Series school bus chassis, and its own versions of the Econoline van/pickup and the C-Series COE truck.|$|R
50|$|FedEx {{claimed that}} the hybrid truck in the 2003 test {{decreases}} soot by 96 percent and emissions by 65 percent. It also {{claimed that the}} truck gets more than 50% better gas mileage while still having the same cargo capacity as a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first-generation F-Series pickup (known as the Ford Bonus-Built) was {{introduced}} in 1948 {{as a replacement for}} the previous car-based pickup line introduced in 1942. The F-Series was sold in eight different weight ratings, with pickup, panel truck, cab-over engine (COE), <b>conventional</b> <b>truck,</b> and school bus chassis body styles.|$|E
50|$|The {{medium sized}} truck series also {{included}} Volvo’s first forward control truck, LV75. The cab was moved forward {{so that the}} driver sat beside the engine instead of the gear box like a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck.</b> This gives a better weight distribution between {{the front and rear}} axle, resulting in reduced rear axle load.|$|E
2500|$|Good Humor {{replaced}} {{some of its}} older <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks</b> {{with large}} vans designed to compete with Mister Softee. Many of these [...] "inside sales cars" [...] are still operating. However, {{the size of the}} fleet gradually declined, and by the early 1970s the number of trucks was down to 1,200. Good Humor also worked with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to equip vending trucks with school bus “stop” swing arms to reduce pedestrian accidents.|$|R
50|$|Very early {{types of}} bus {{could still be}} found but no longer in service, with a front engine mounted in an {{extended}} bonneted nose, {{in the style of}} some <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks.</b> The majority of classic Malta buses had elaborate grilles and headlight arrangements, curved windscreens and sloping roofs. Later makes of bus were usually of conventional bus and coach designs that were in use elsewhere in the world, such as Plaxton Supreme and Duple Dominant bodywork.|$|R
50|$|Wincanton {{currently}} directly employs in {{the region}} of 17,500 people across the United Kingdom and Ireland through a network of over 200 sites. As of 2016, the Wincanton fleet comprises over 3,400 vehicles including <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks</b> and trailers, as well as a range of specialist equipment including skeletal trailers, tankers and construction vehicles. Until the sale of its final continental European operations on 3 January 2012 it also operated barges and trains, thus providing multi-modal transport.|$|R
50|$|The core {{design of}} Horn Massive {{is that it}} is the largest horn which can be transported by a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck.</b> The design process took six months, most of that time spent calculating the steel cutting {{specifications}} needed for fabrication. Horn Massive was designed using the software tools AutoCAD, Bass Box Pro, Rhino 3D, 3D studio Max and Horn Calc.|$|E
50|$|For {{most of its}} production, the F-Series {{was sold}} in a {{medium-duty}} <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> configuration alongside the traditional pickup trucks. Beginning in 1948 with the 1½ ton F-5 (later F-500), the medium-duty trucks ranged up to the F-8 (F-800). Prior to the 1957 introduction of the Ford C-Series tilt-cab, the medium-duty range was offered as both a conventional and in a COE (cabover) configuration.|$|E
5000|$|Cab-over, {{also known}} as Cab Over Engine (COE), cab forward (U.S.), or forward control (UK), is a body style of truck, bus, or van that has a {{vertical}} front, [...] "flat face" [...] or a semi-hood, with the cab of the truck sitting above (or forward of) the front axle. This contrasts with a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> where the engine is mounted {{in front of the}} driver.|$|E
5000|$|Similar in {{layout to}} the Ford LTL-9000, International Harvester Transtar 4300, and Mack Super-Liner, the Chevrolet Bison and GMC General are Class 8 <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks.</b> Produced with an all-aluminum cab built by Budd, the trucks were {{available}} in many different combinations. [...] Two hood lengths were available, with a 108-inch or 116-inch BBC length. [...] A 34-inch long sleeper cab was available {{in addition to the}} standard cab, with a walk-in sleeper cab added in 1985.|$|R
50|$|As {{with its}} K-Series and H-Series predecessors, the {{division}} marketed the EL-Series using only the Lincoln division name; the Lincoln Cosmopolitan {{was only the}} third Lincoln (beyond the Zephyr and Continental) to have a separate model name. In a major departure from division precedent, the EL-Series was the first Lincoln produced without a V12 engine. As a V12 developed for the EL-Series was stillborn, Lincoln utilized {{a version of the}} Ford Flathead V8 shared with the Ford F-7 and F-8 <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During BTAC {{performance}} testing the Eco-Link {{was given an}} [...] "excellent" [...] rating for its performance in maneuverability, productivity, safety and emissions tests, superseding ordinary semi-trailer trucks in many respects. Private trials had also reportedly shown the Denby vehicle had a 20% shorter stopping distance than <b>conventional</b> semi-trailer <b>trucks</b> of the same weight, due to having extra axles. The active steer system meant that the Eco-Link had a turning circle of 41 ft, {{the same as a}} <b>conventional</b> semi-trailer <b>truck.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The F-Series {{was sold}} in four basic models. Along with the pickup truck (F-1 through F3), the F-Series was sold as a panel truck (based on the pickup), COE/cab-over engine chassis (F-5 and F-6, branded C-Series) and school bus chassis (F-5 and F-6, branded B-Series). Above the F-5, the F-Series was a {{medium-duty}} and heavy-duty <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> sharing the bodywork of the smaller F-Series.|$|E
5000|$|A {{straddle}} carrier or straddle truck is a freight carrying vehicle that carries its load underneath by [...] "straddling" [...] it, rather than carrying {{it on top}} like a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck.</b> The advantage of the {{straddle carrier}} {{is its ability to}} load and unload without the assistance of cranes or forklifts. The lifting apparatus under the carrier is operated by the driver without any outside assistance and without leaving the driver's seat.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, {{improved}} {{versions of}} these trucks were introduced, including the Integral Sleeper (1982) long-distance truck, the Conventional (1983) upgraded <b>conventional</b> <b>truck,</b> the Autocar DS (1984) {{successor to the}} Road Constructor 2, the Integral Tall Sleeper (1985) truck which was the 'Globetrotter' of America, the aerodynamic 'Aero' (1987) truck, the Autocar (1987) construction truck with the option of using an integrated driveline (engine+gearbox+rear axle) designed and produced by Volvo and the short conventional WG (1988) truck.|$|E
50|$|Secondarily, MFTA {{competes with}} makers of <b>conventional</b> {{medium-duty}} <b>trucks.</b> Those are: Ford, Freightliner Medium Duty, International Medium Duty, Kenworth Medium Duty and Peterbilt Medium Duty.|$|R
5000|$|The Ross Carrier Company (now Northwest Caster & Equipment) {{was founded}} in Seattle to {{manufacture}} and market the carrier, and similar designs were later manufactured by Gerlinger, Hyster, Yale, Caterpillar, and other companies. These [...] "straddles" [...] or [...] "timber jinkers" [...] were a common sight in seaports around the world until the 1970s, but were phased out as larger and faster <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks</b> came into use. An example of these road-going straddle carriers {{can be seen in}} the 1950 comedy film Watch the Birdie.|$|R
5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania took {{delivery}} of two rail cars that operated in car-and-trailer configuration. Largely {{similar to the}} car ordered by the Reading, these rail cars were also beset by problems with their rubber-tired wheels, which were later replaced with <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks.</b> After being retrofitted, these cars {{went on to become}} the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin rail cars. They remained with the Pennsylvania until 1943, when they were sold to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, a Virginia short line that operated them for only a few months; they were ultimately scrapped in 1948.|$|R
50|$|Mining {{started in}} 1997 and is again a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> and shovel {{operation}} followed by crushing, pre treatment and stacking before acid leaching. Copper is extracted by SX/EW. Leached ore is removed by {{bucket wheel excavator}} followed by secondary leaching. It {{is likely that the}} 'refractory' sulphide ore will be mined and used to keep the Chuquicamata mill full during the changeover to underground mining. The last published production by Radomiro Tomic, from Cochilco, was 379,600 tonnes in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The first all-new {{medium-duty}} <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> range {{introduced in}} North America since 1980, {{the design of}} the Freightliner Business Class was derived heavily upon an existing product range. Using the cab of the FLC112 Class 8 conventional introduced in 1985, Freightliner began development on its first medium-duty truck, essentially serving as a replacement for the Brazilian-built Mercedes-Benz L-Series trucks sold in the United States. Having been owned by Daimler-Benz since 1981, Freightliner adapted the cab of the Mercedes-Benz LK cabover {{in the development of the}} FLC112.|$|E
50|$|The small {{weight and}} {{dimensions}} of the submarine (4.8 x 1.9 x 3 m) allow the Ictineu 3 to be carried with a <b>conventional</b> <b>truck</b> without requiring special transportation. The main body is made of inox steel and, at the front, {{there is a large}} semi-spheric acrylic glass viewport of 1,200 mm diameter that provides a wide field of view. There are four brushless DC motors for propulsion and four more for manoeuvring, powered by li-ion batteries located outside the submersible for increased safety.|$|E
50|$|Since 1992, {{weight and}} axles limits for goods {{carrying}} lorries in the United Kingdom had increased in stages from 38 t and 5 axles. , vehicles {{are limited to}} a maximum of 6 axles, and limited to an overall maximum weight of 44 t and 16.5 m in length for articulated lorries, and 44 t and 18.75 m for drawbar lorries. The restriction on overall length is why the majority of UK lorries are hauled by 'cab over' tractor units, although for the minority of UK uses where the weight limit is reached before the length limit, <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks</b> are legal.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} re-organised in 1939 and {{changed its name}} to Ford-Werke. With the {{outbreak}} of the War, car production continued at first with the Taunus being made until 1942 but increasingly military production took over. Ford-Werke built both <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks</b> and Maultier half-tracks for the German armed forces. Most notably, Ford-Werke manufactured the turbines used in the V-2 rockets. In spite of the heavy bombing of Cologne, the factory got off relatively lightly and after the war production was able to restart in May 1945 with truck manufacture, the US government having paid $1.1 million in consideration of bombing damage.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1958, Scania-Vabis {{introduced}} the L75 model. It was the first vehicle in {{a new generation of}} trucks, with newly designed six-cylinder engines, stronger chassis components and a new, more spacious and comfortable cab. The cab would be used for all <b>conventional</b> <b>trucks</b> until 1980. In the summer of 1959 Scania-Vabis presented the smaller L55, with a seven litre engine. The truck was also offered with a trailing axle. This version was called the LS55, with an “S” for [...] "support axle". All L55 series trucks came with air brakes, but power steering was still an option.|$|R
