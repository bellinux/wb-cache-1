40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} transient {{mathematical model}} describing thermal and flow phenomena during coal coking in an oven chamber was {{studied in the}} paper. It also accounts for heat conduction in the ceramic oven wall when assuming a constant temperature at the heating channel side. The model was solved numerically using partly implicit methods for gas flow and heat transfer problems. The histories of temperature, gas evolution and internal pressure were presented and analysed. The theoretical predictions of temperature change in the centre plane of the coke oven were compared with industrialscale measurements. Both, the experimental data and obtained numerical results show that moisture content determines the coking process dynamics, lagging the temperature increase above the water steam evaporation temperature and in consequence the total <b>coking</b> <b>time.</b> The phenomenon of internal pressure generation {{in the context of}} overlapping effects of simultaneously occurring coal transitions - devolatilisation and coal permeability decrease under plastic stage - was also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{pilot scale}} {{carbonization}} of the normally charged bituminous Polish Bellview coal blends wasconducted in a 250 kg capacity coke oven with a bulk density of 800 kg/m 3, flue temperature of 1250 °Cand <b>coking</b> <b>time</b> of 18 to 20 hours. The micum drum test conducted on Bellview A and B cokes gaveM 10 abrasion resistance of 11. 40 % and 15. 40 % and M 40 resistance to fragmentation of 77. 80 % and 70. 80 % for Bellview coke A and B, respectively. The {{results of this}} study showed that Bellview A coalblend is of a higher bituminous grade than Bellview blend B, though its micum indices do not meet thespecification of 9 % (maximum) M 10 and 78 % (minimum) M 40 for blast furnace ironmaking at theNigerian Ajaokuta steel plant. It is however expected that the small deviations of + 2. 4 % and - 0. 2 %,in the M 10 and M 40 of Bellview B coke may be eliminated during industrial scale cokemaking under ahigher static load and the application of coking improvement techniques such as pre-heating andstamp charging...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIncreasing the {{coking process}} {{flexibility}} permits to face coke and steel market requirement. But changing process parameters such as <b>coking</b> temperature, <b>time</b> and blend composition can have consequences on the masonryies lifetime. Coke oven masonries are large structures composed {{of thousands of}} bricks and mortar joints. To avoid a high computational cost, a model combining homogenisation and submodelling is proposed. Bricks and mortar are replaced by a Homogeneous Equivalent Material (HEM) for which the behaviour depends on the joint state. The HEM properties are determined thanks to brick-mortar interface behaviour, experimentally characterised at high temperature. To refine the evaluation of local stress, which causes the joint failure, a submodelling technique is used...|$|R
40|$|The coke making {{process of}} the steel {{industry}} was modelled and a computer-based control system was developed to help improve the process operation. Due {{to the complexity of}} the nature of the coal, which is the raw material used to make coke, the operations of the coke making process are presently based on the judgment of experienced operators and the use of the results of regression analyses. Consequently, there is high variation in the required production time of the coke, including an over-long cooking time, to guarantee a well-coked product. The latter results in excessive energy costs. ^ In this study, a coking thermal model and a flue combustion model were integrated into an overall, multi-oven, computer simulation package. The <b>coking</b> <b>times,</b> energy costs, and flue temperature patterns generated from the package have been validated by comparison with data available from industrial measurements. A new heating pattern strategy that would reduce the required energy costs of the operation is proposed and demonstrated. ^ This simulation package was also used as the real-plant example in a computer simulation used to design the adaptive, self-tuning controller proposed here. The pole placement, self-tuning, adaptive control method was utilized to develop the controller which would be implemented by a computer in the plant. The simulation results obtained have demonstrated the effectiveness of this controller method in compensating for any uncertainties in the characteristics of the coal which was charged into the oven. Further applications of the simulation package to the industrial computer control of the coke plant were also investigated. ^ Conclusions of the study and a list of recommendations for future research are included. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to observe de {{differences}} of behaviour between six softwoods species during the kraft cooking sequence, knowing that morphological, physicochemical and hygroscopic characters are different. Six wood species (Scots pine, maritime pine, Aleppo pine, black pine, Douglas fir and Spruce) were analysed separately. Different parameters were evaluated (Lignin content, Polysaccharides content (cellulose and hemicelluloses), Yield, Hexenuronic acids) and for each wood species three temperatures (150 ºC, 160 ºC and 170 ºC) and different cooking times, allowing to study the behaviour of the wood species. Common cooking conditions were applied and temperature program included cold impregnation, a plateau at 110 °C during 2. 5 hours to perform initial delignification separately followed by a second plateau at cooking temperature. Non-uniform cooking behaviour was observed; chestnut and oak trees consumed much more caustic soda and had a lower yield in the initial phase of the cook. It was possible conclude that in a genera way, the behaviour of the six softwoods is highly homogeneous, for the three temperatures studied. Data analysis was made with Principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA. The results of PCA show that all parameters: Yield (Y), Klason lignin (L), cellulose content (C), and effective residual alkali (EA) are well correlated. The cellulose content was negatively correlated with the other factors. The hexenuronic acids (HA) and hemicelluloses content was well correlated witch other. The <b>coking</b> <b>time</b> in the 2 nd plateau influence all factors. Moreover, the three different temperatures are very similar they present statically differences with Tukey’s test (P< 0. 05). For the highest cooking time all parameter present lower values. The time on the 2 nd plateau do not influence the yield and the delignification...|$|E

40|$|National audienceTo face coke {{and steel}} market requirement, the coking process {{has to be}} more flexible. But {{changing}} process parameters such as <b>coking</b> temperature and <b>time,</b> blend composition [...] . can have consequences of the coke oven battery lifetime and on its masonries. The main objective of this work is to determine the admissible stress for the coke oven heating walls in order to prevent cracks formation. Thus a numerical tool of the coke oven battery based on the Finite Element Method was developed. It is a two-step model using homogenization and submodelling techniques in order to decrease the computational cost. Coke oven masonries are large structures composed of thousands of bricks and mortar joints. In the model, bricks and mortar are replaced by a Homogeneous Equivalent Material (HEM) whose behaviour depends on the joints state. The HEM properties are determined thanks to brick-mortar interface behaviour, experimentally characterised at high temperature. In order to control joint opening, a criterion changing the HEM is used. The use of the HEM gives the global stresses instead of local stresses, that's why, a submodelling step has been developed to obtain local stresses used in the criterion and thus to have accurate information about joint opening...|$|R
