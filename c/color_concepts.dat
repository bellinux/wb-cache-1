500|$|The game's artwork {{took more}} than a year to complete. Background artwork for the game went through initial rough <b>color</b> <b>concepts</b> created by Mike Corriero (creative {{illustrator}} and concept artist) and ultimately the final artwork was created by David Hellman, artist of the critically acclaimed webcomic A Lesson Is Learned but the Damage Is Irreversible. Blow gave Hellman rough images of the level's layout and told him to draw over it. Hellman and Blow iterated through several styles before settling on final versions. Through these changes, the two worked to identify and remove elements of the art that could confuse the player, while retaining aesthetic elements that would be generalized by the player as non-functional parts of the level. Once the game's overall artwork was created, Blow and Hellman broke out functional pieces {{that could be used in}} Braids level editor. As each world was built up using these pieces, Blow suggested more changes that reflected the tone of each world and avoided art that distracted from the gameplay. [...] "Time and Forgiveness", the first world the player encounters, was drawn to create a feel of exploration and forgiveness, while artwork for [...] "Time and Decision" [...] used a mix of [...] "luxurious domestic objects (nice furniture and fabrics) with rugged outdoor objects (swampy water, rotting piers and nautical rope)" [...] to create an intentionally [...] "incongruous" [...] look to convey aspects of alternate realities. Several variations on the game's backgrounds were done until they arrived at the concept of blurring the background elements to make them appear out of focus, while keeping the foreground elements sharply in focus and clear to the player. Particle effects were applied to both background and foreground elements to add apparent motion to them, such as the waving of grass blades or the movement of clouds. The character visuals were originally created by Edmund McMillen, but were later redrawn by Hellman [...] "to better match the now-predominant style of the backgrounds".|$|E

We then propose a concept-based retrieval engine based on the generative grammar of elemental concepts methodology. In the latter, the language by which <b>color</b> artistry <b>concepts</b> are communicated in artworks is used to operate semantic searches. The color artistry language is explicated into elemental concepts and the associated generative grammar. The elemental concepts are used to index the artworks, while the generative grammar is used to facilitate post-coordinate expression of <b>color</b> artistry <b>concept</b> queries by using the elemental concepts.

40|$|In the {{proposed}} paper, {{we present a}} three-dimensional interactive visualization method {{for the analysis of}} the referential aspects of color term semantics. Using rgl and geometry R packages, the method is designed to represent the distribution of color term referents as point clouds or convex hulls in a three dimensional color space such as RGB, Lab, Luv etc. (see Fig. 1) Theoretical background – the technique has been developed for the usage-based analysis of linguistic categorization and is aimed to complement the distributional methods applied in the traditional corpus studies. Corpus-based analyses of color term meanings have provided important insights into the structure of <b>color</b> <b>concepts,</b> however, they can give only indirect access to the referential aspects of color term meaning (Kerttula 2002, Steinvall 2002). Considering the essentially perceptual nature of <b>color</b> <b>concepts</b> {{and the role of the}} extralinguistic reality in their construal, the lack of referential information considerably limits the possibility of modeling the very core of the color term semantics. Furthermore, this limitation remains a major methodological obstacle for developing cognitive linguistic models of color conceptualization which would be compatible with the experimental findings of color categorization studies in psychology, anthropology, color vision, artificial intelligence, and other cognitive sciences, where the referential/perceptual aspects of color categories play a central role...|$|E
