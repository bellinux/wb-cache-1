This dissertation focuses on green chemistry methods to replace existing techniques of metal treatment as well as treated or untreated metal surface analysis and low-temperature sol-gel preparation of a fluorescent frequency converter. Conventional metal surface pretreatments frequently use some form of chromium (VI), a carcinogen. Several <b>chrome-free</b> metal pretreatments were formulated using the sol-gel process. These sol-gel pretreatments were thin, showed extensive crosslinking (6 H+ hardness on cold-rolled steel), and performed comparably to the chromated pretreatment in corrosion tests as well as outperforming the chromated pretreatment in electrochemical impedance testing (10 7 ohm cm 2 greater at 10 mHz). Galvanized steel is frequently treated with a chromate conversion coating, another source of chromium (VI). An antifingerprint primer (AFP) was developed using aqueous emulsions of organic resins, water, organic HAPs (hazardous air pollutants) -free cosolvents, and corrosion inhibitors. AFP test panels passed alkali resistance testing (no coating removed in 2 wt% sodium phosphate solution at 65 °C for 2 min) followed by salt spray testing (< 5 % surface corrosion after 120 h in 35 °C, 98 % humidity, 5 wt% salt spray). Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was investigated as a possible tool for qualitative determination of metal alloys and their pretreatments. It was shown that this method could be used to distinguish between three aluminum alloys (2024 -T 3 /bare, 2024 -T 3 /clad, and 7075 -T 6) as well as to distinguish between an untreated aluminum surface, a chromated surface, and a <b>chrome-free</b> AFP coating. A sol-gel nanocoating for the iron powder used to make transformer cores was developed. The coating increased the temperature at which significant oxidation of the iron particles occurred by about 20 [...] 30 °C while not affecting the interior structure of the iron particles. Fluorescent glass can be formed by doping the glass with a fluorescent material at high (∼ 1500 °C) temperatures. A sol-gel-derived frequency converter was produced that was capable of converting ultraviolet light to 544 nm green light by use of terbium (III) -doped xerogels at room temperature.

The current metal coating process is a multi-step process. The surface is cleaned, primered, dried and then painted. The process is labor intensive and time consuming. The wash primer is a conversion coating, which prepares metal surface for better paint adhesion. The wash primers currently used often contain hexavalent chromium (Cr 6 +), which seals the pores in the conversion coating. The presence of hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) make waste disposal expensive and pose dangers to workers. The novel technique of in-situ phosphatizing coating (ISPC) is a single-step, <b>chrome-free</b> alternative to the present coating practice. Formulation of an ISPC involves predispersal of an in-situ phosphatizing reagent (ISPR) into the paint system to form a stable formulation. The ISPR reacts with the metal surface and bonds with the paint film simultaneously, which eliminates the need for a conversion coating. In acid catalyzed paint systems, such as polyester-melamine paints, the ISPR also catalyzes cross-linking reactions between the melamine and the polyester polyols. ISPCs are formulated using commercially available coating systems including: polyester-melamine, two-component epoxy, polyurethane and high-hydroxy content polyester-melamine coil coating. The ISPCs are applied to metal substrates and their performances are evaluated using electrochemical, thermal and standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing methods. In addition, ISPCs were designed and formulated based on: (1) phosphate chemistry, (2) polymer chemistry, (3) sol-gel chemistry, and (4) the ion-exchange principle. Organo-functionalized silanes, which serve as excellent coupling and dispersion agents, are incorporated into the optimized ISPC formula and evaluated using standard ASTM testing methods and electrochemical spectroscopy. Also, an ion-exchange pigment, which leads to better adhesion by forming a mixed metal silicate surface, is dispersed into an ISPC and the performance of the final coating formulation is evaluated. Successful ISPCs formulated for multiple coating systems exhibited excellent adhesion, hardness and gloss, which supports their suitability as a <b>chrome-free,</b> single-step alternative for aerospace, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and coil coating applications...|$|E

The tanning process is optimized as 15 wt% tannic acid (TA) combination with 4 wt% Laponite nanoclay, giving the leather with shrinkage temperature (Ts) above 86 °C. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurements indicate that Laponite can be evenly and tightly bound within the leather matrix, which is further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) spectroscopy analysis. The resultant wet-white leathers have reasonable good physical properties that can meet the standard requirements for furniture leather without containing hazardous Cr(VI) and formaldehyde.

It encompasses a wide palette of applications, from footwear and clothing to upholsteries and different types of furniture [1], [2], [3]. The main constituent of animal skins is collagen, a supramolecular fibrillar protein in the form of a triple helix. This form endows leather with elasticity, good mechanical properties and softness. A major disadvantage resides in the inapplicability of raw animal hides, due to their microbiological instability and decay through rotting. Microbiological stability is obtained through the tanning process, characterized by protein crosslinking and drying afterwards.

40|$|Abstract:- This {{review paper}} realizes {{the hazards of}} {{chromium}} contamination and pollution caused {{by the use of}} Chrome Composite Leather-Clad (CCLC) rollers commonly used in cotton roller ginning industries and attempts to eliminate the chromium contamination and pollution during the cotton ginning process. The cotton roller ginning process is the mechanical separation of cotton fibres from their seeds by means of one or more rollers to which fibres adhere while the seeds are impeded and struck off or pulled loose. When the seed-cotton is ginned, due to persistent rubbing of CCLC rollers over the fixed knives, the ginned lint cotton adsorbs about 143 to 1990 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms and the cotton products carry with it of about 17 to 250 mg/kg (ppm) of chromium which according to Indian Standards (MOEF- 157, 1996) for yarn and fabrics, should not be more than 0. 1 mg/kg (ppm). Toxic effects are produced by prolonged contact with airborne or solid or liquid chromium compounds even in small quantities because of their properties viz. carcinogenecity, mutagenecity and corrosiveness. Traces of Cr (VI) are found even in analar grade trivalent compounds and complications do arise due to reduction in nature of these traces that affect the organic tissues of the body.

40|$|In today's move to "sustainable production" {{the leather}} industry, {{as well as}} many other {{industries}} is recognized as a polluting one. Traditional chemical operations are polluting because of the levels of inorganic chemical waste. Process chemicals which are not consumed within the reactions necessary to convert collagen to leather are currently discharged to waste. These are usually applied during bulk production, such as inorganic agents from beam house and tanning processes, e. g. lime, sulphide, ammonium salts, sulphuric acid and sodium chloride, mineral tanning agents – mainly Cr(III) and the less common Al(III), Zr(III), Ti(III), Fe(III) salts -, whereas depending on the tanning process and the leather article produced organic chemical waste discharged comprises aldehydic and polyphenolic tanning products, bating enzymes, organic carboxylic acids and excess electrolyte stable synthetic fat liquors. It is rare for chemicals and water to be recovered for re-use from several of these process steps. Moreover, tanners worldwide are required to operate within strict legislative boundaries.

40|$|The term of {{eco-friendly}} leather can {{be interpreted}} as <b>chrome-free</b> tanned leather. Recently, almost 80 % of leather is tanned using chrome tanning agent because of the ease in processing and excellence of the physical properties. Nevertheless, people nowadays want an eco-friendly leather product. Vegetable tanning materials can be said as eco-friendly tanning material because their waste degrades easily. One of the weaknesses in the use of vegetable tanning is a high water absorption capability. In this research used a water repellent material that has the properties to suppress the ability of water absorption. The purpose of the research was to determine the effect of water repellent on physical properties and morphology of leather tanned by vegetable tanning materials. Because one of the weaknesses in the vegetable tanning is its high water absorption capability, in this research, water repellent was used and varied by 5; 7. 5; 10; 12. 5; and 15 %. Physical properties obtained were compared with analysis of variance with the significance level of 95 %. The water repellent increased from 5 % to 15 %.

40|$|Aluminium alloys are {{frequently}} pre-treated by a conversion coating before application of an organic coating {{in order to}} improve the corrosion resistance and adhesive properties of the surface and the corrosion resistance provided by the system. Chromate-containing conversion coatings are commonly used for this purpose. However, legislation limits future use of hexavalent chromium compounds due to their toxic and carcinogenic nature. Therefore, alternative, so-called chromium-free conversion coatings are being developed that are more environmentally-compliant. The purpose of the present work has therefore been to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} how the aluminium substrate affects the formation and properties of conversion coatings for adhesive bonding. In particular, a <b>chrome-free</b> zirconium-based conversion treatment process has been investigated as a possible replacement for conventional chromate conversion treatment. The influence of the conversion time on the thickness of the formed layer on pure aluminium was investigated using complementary surface analytical techniques. The conversion time was varied between 30 and 600 seconds. In this study, the structure and composition of zirconium-based chromium-free conversion coatings on magnetron sputtered superpure aluminium and a range of aluminium-copper alloys were characterised as a function of immersion time in the aqueous conversion bath to understand the mechanism of coating formation and protection. However, the presence of copper significantly influences the coating development and ultimately the performance of the conversion coatings formed on binary copper-containing aluminium alloys. The morphology and composition of the coatings have been probed using transmission electron microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, with loss of substrate through growth of the conversion coating also quantified. A comparison of the RBS spectra obtained for the superpure aluminium specimens after different immersion times revealed that zirconium (Zr) and oxygen (O) peaks were wider for longer immersion times, indicating thickening of the coating with increased immersion times. Thus, increasing the immersion time resulted in an increase in coating thickness but little change in coating composition occurred as determined by the RBS RUMP simulations. Alloying decreases the coating thickness, as well as metal consumption. Here, aspects of the corrosion behaviour of superpure aluminium and aluminium-copper alloys were also considered using electronoptical, electrochemical and surface analytical probing. The influence that short and prolonged treatment times exert on the performances of such conversion coating is discussed. The conversion coating formed after 60 s and 180 s of immersion in the zirconium-based conversion coating bath provide good corrosion resistance which can be attributed to the high stability of the compounds that constitute the surface oxide layer, and good adhesion properties.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia QuímicaAs preocupações ambientais associadas à indústria dos curtumes centram-se no curtume com crómio, uma das etapas mais poluentes de todo o processo. Actualmente, 80 a 90 % das peles, em todo o mundo, são curtidas com crómio (wet blue), é do interesse de todos a busca por um processo isento de crómio, de forma a obter um couro mais ecológico, o wet white. A pele é formada por uma rede complexa de fibras de colagénio que são estabilizadas através da formação de cross-links inter e intramoleculares, que lhe confere as propriedades físicas. Quando aquecidas em água essas fibras encolhem, devido ao processo de desnaturação, a temperatura à qual ocorre é designada por temperatura de encolhimento (Ts). O curtume vai criar ligações que conferem maior estabilidade às fibras elevando a sua Ts. Uma das vantagens do crómio como agente de curtume é a elevada estabilidade hidrotérmica que confere ao couro, obtendo Ts {{superior}} a 100 ºC. Foram desenvolvidos processos com diferentes agentes de curtume, de forma a encontrar alternativas ao crómio. Efectuaram-se ensaios de curtume mineral, com crómio, zircónio e silicatos; curtume vegetal, com extracto de mimosa, quebracho e genipina; curtume sintético, com tanino sintético, resina acrílica e gluteraldeído; e finalmente curtumes mistos, combinando processos dos curtumes anteriores. Foi avaliada a estabilidade hidrotérmica das peles processadas pelos métodos desenvolvidos pela determinação das Ts (norma ISO 3380 e banho termostatizado). Usou-se a calorimetria diferencial de varrimento (DSC), de forma a determinar a variação de entalpia associada à desnaturação do colagénio. Para um estudo mais detalhado foi realizada a análise dos espectros FTIR-ATR permitindo identificar alterações na estrutura da pele, quer na sequência do processo de curtume, quer após o encolhimento da pele. Os resultados obtidos que permitem propor processos alternativos ao crómio, com elevadas Ts e menos poluentes, um dos quais já com implementação na indústria. The {{environmental concerns}} {{generated by the}} tanning industry focuses on chrome tanning, {{one of the most}} polluting parts of the process. Currently, 80 to 90 % of the hides worldwide are tanned using chrome (wet-blue). The effort to produce <b>chrome-free</b> leather, a wet white, in order to obtain a more ecological leather is increasing. The fibrous structure of hide is formed by a complex matrix of collagen fibers that stabilizes through inter- and intra-molecular cross-links, which gives them physical properties. Shrinkage temperature (Ts), or denaturation, is one aspect of hydrothermal stability that is the response of leather to heat in the presence of water. Tanning process gives fiber higher stability which results on an increasing of the leather Ts. One of the advantages of chrome tanned leather is the high shrinkage temperature, typically above 100 ºC. Other tanning agents were used to develop new ways of finding alternative chromiumfree leather processes. Mineral tanning agents, as chromium, zirconium and silicates; vegetal tanning agents, as genipin, mimosa and quebracho; syntans, acrylic resin, gluteraldehyde and also different combinations of the previous agents were used. The hydrothermal stability of the leather samples was evaluated by measuring the Ts (through ISO 3380 and water bath) and by differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements, allowing the study of enthalpy changes, which are associated with the denaturation of collagen. For a more detailed study a FTIR-ATR spectra analysis were performed to verify changes in the hide structure, resulting from tanning processes as well as of denaturation process. The results of this work showed that other tanning agents, with lower environmental impact, can be effective at increasing the thermal stability of leather.
