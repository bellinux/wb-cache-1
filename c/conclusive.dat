5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith. Similarly, {{the existence of}} bad faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be <b>conclusive</b> evidence of certain facts. In the absence of bad faith, the courts will enforce <b>conclusive</b> evidence clauses.|$|E
5|$|Some {{believe the}} first American {{administrator}} of Alaska was Polish immigrant Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski. However, the Anchorage Daily News {{was unable to}} find any <b>conclusive</b> information to support this claim.|$|E
5|$|According to the USDA, {{pesticides}} may {{be contributing}} to CCD. A 2013 peer-reviewed literature review concluded neonicotinoids in the amounts typically used harm bees and safer alternatives are urgently needed. At the same time, other sources suggest the evidence is not <b>conclusive,</b> and that clarity regarding the facts is hampered by {{the role played by}} various issue advocates and lobby groups.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>conclusive</b> {{evidence}} {{might be}} wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings could, perhaps, equally easily be seen as a form of hanging upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
5|$|Bhattacharya {{links the}} archaeological discoveries of Indus valley civilization to present-day Shaktism of later Hindu religion. Other {{scholars}} like David Kinsley and Lynn Foulston acknowledge some {{similarities between the}} cult of goddess in Indus valley civilization and Shaktism, but {{think that there is}} no <b>conclusive</b> evidence that proves a link between them.|$|E
5|$|Locally, the Gurdon Bill Store {{was rumored}} {{to have been a}} tavern or an inn, {{although}} no evidence or record indicates such a use, and it was apparently a waystation for stagecoaches. A historical marker in the immediate vicinity ties the Gurdon Bill store to the birthplace of Samuel Seabury, America's first Episcopal bishop. No <b>conclusive</b> evidence for this claim exists.|$|E
5|$|More taxonomic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more <b>conclusive,</b> often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 2015, Little, Brown and Company {{released}} the , {{which includes a}} nearly-400 page reimagining of the novel with Edward and Bella gender-swapped as Edythe and Beau. The reimagined novel has a more <b>conclusive</b> ending, seemingly precluding its continuation through the remaining three Twilight novels.|$|E
5|$|South American giant {{cockroaches}} of {{the genus}} Lucihormetica {{were believed to be}} the first known example of defensive mimicry, emitting light in imitation of bioluminescent, poisonous click beetles. However, doubt has been cast on this assertion, and there is no <b>conclusive</b> evidence that the cockroaches are bioluminescent.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not <b>conclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no <b>conclusive</b> evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|As her {{research}} progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and {{environmental effects of}} pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps {{when it came to}} pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring <b>conclusive</b> proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give <b>conclusive</b> results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine {{the outer edge of the}} galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither <b>conclusive</b> nor complete.|$|E
5|$|Ferking {{apparently}} {{could not}} tolerate Augvald's overlordship of Karmøy, {{and he went}} north with his army, meeting Augvald and his army at Skeie, near Avaldsnes. In the resulting battle there many fatalities, but no clear victor. The <b>conclusive</b> battle {{took place at the}} Field of Stava (Stavasletta), near Ferkingstad. Ferking and his men hid between two gorges, waiting for Augvald to appear. In the fierce battle that followed Augvald and his cow were among the many who lost their lives. When his two daughters saw that Augvald was dead, they jumped into a river and drowned.|$|E
5|$|Hindu natal astrology {{originated}} with Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE, though incorporating the Hindu lunar mansions. The {{names of the}} signs (e.g. Greek 'Krios' for Aries, Hindi 'Kriya'), the planets (e.g. Greek 'Helios' for Sun, astrological Hindi 'Heli'), and astrological terms (e.g. Greek 'apoklima' and 'sunaphe' for declination and planetary conjunction, Hindi 'apoklima' and 'sunapha' respectively) in Varaha Mihira's texts are considered <b>conclusive</b> evidence of a Greek origin for Hindu astrology. The Indian techniques {{may also have been}} augmented with some of the Babylonian techniques.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{confluence}} of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers may have been a zone of hybridization between these two species, although no <b>conclusive</b> results have indicated current interbreeding. In general, the Antainambalana River appears to isolate the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, V. v. subcincta. The subspecies V. v. variegata can be found further south, and V. v. editorum is the southernmost subspecies. The ranges of these two southern subspecies overlap and intermediate forms are reported to exist, although this has not been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} <b>conclusive</b> {{evidence}} that the Balts were uniting {{is considered to be}} the treaty with Galicia–Volhynia signed in 1219. The treaty's signatories include 21 Lithuanian dukes; it specifies that five of those were elder and thus took precedence over the remaining sixteen. Presumably, the eldest Duke was Živinbudas, since his name was mentioned first. Mindaugas, despite his youth, and his brother Dausprungas, are listed among the elder dukes. That would imply that they inherited their titles. The remaining two elder dukes were Daujotas (mentioned second) and his brother Vilikaila (mentioned last of the five).|$|E
5|$|In 1273, Isa led raids against Ilkhanid-held Anbar {{in western}} Iraq on orders from Baybars, {{possibly}} to divert Ilkhanid forces from an expedition against Syria. The Mongols at Anbar retreated without resistance as Isa advanced. Months later, in March 1274, Isa's forces confronted {{a group of}} Khafaja Bedouin in Anbar, {{though there was no}} <b>conclusive</b> victory after a daylong battle. Isa commanded a contingent of Baybars' army in the 1277 campaign against the Mongols at the Battle of Elbistan. He visited Egypt later that year with Ahmad ibn Hajji, and the two were well received by Baybars.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, W. Essex Wynter began {{treating}} {{tubercular meningitis}} by tapping the subarachnoid space, and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate {{description of the}} chemical composition of the CSF. In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published <b>conclusive</b> evidence that the CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} following Hitler's death, {{a variety}} of claims have been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that he was gay, bisexual, or asexual. <b>Conclusive</b> evidence is lacking, but most historians believe he was heterosexual. There {{is at least one}} claim that Hitler had an illegitimate child (named Jean-Marie Loret) with one of his lovers. Mainstream historians, such as Ian Kershaw, dismiss this as unlikely or impossible.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that fundamental constants such asc {{have the same}} value throughout spacetime, meaning {{that they do not}} depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that the speed of light may have changed over time. No <b>conclusive</b> evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on December 13, 2010 that Voyager 1 {{had passed the}} reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind, as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing <b>conclusive</b> evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Pantulf {{regained his}} lands after he cleared {{himself of the}} charge, through the {{mechanism}} of a trial by ordeal. It is not clear why the ordeal was required, with the historian David Bates speculating that either the evidence of Pantulf's involvement was not <b>conclusive</b> or that murder victim's family demanded the ordeal because they suspected any evidence pointing to Pantulf's innocence. Pantulf gave Saint-Evroul four altar frontals for the abbey's help after he was cleared of the charges.|$|E
5|$|Since this Life first {{appeared}} in McClure's Magazine not one important statement as of fact in it has been disproved or even seriously questioned. It {{is a product of}} much and highly intelligent labor, and were Christian Scientists open to argument or amenable to reason the wretched cult would not have survived its publication for a single month. It is unanswerable and <b>conclusive,</b> and nobody who has not read it can be considered well-informed as to the history or nature of Eddyism.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference between the President and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, <b>conclusive,</b> and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major intelligence failure.|$|E
5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on its knees. Although all three have been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their background as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate, and a <b>conclusive</b> move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor.|$|E
5|$|The black morph is {{less common}} than the spotted form but, at about {{six percent of}} the population, it is several orders of {{magnitude}} above the mutation rate. Hence, it is being supported by selection. Some evidence indicates the melanism allele is dominant. The black form may {{be an example of}} heterozygote advantage; breeding in captivity is not yet <b>conclusive</b> on this. Melanistic jaguars (or “black” jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; they have never been documented north of Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>conclusive</b> aqueous {{chemistry}} {{studies of}} rutherfordium {{have been performed}} by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the isotope 261mRf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, zirconium, {{as well as the}} pseudo-group 4 element thorium have proved a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, {{in a manner similar to}} hafnium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the full Senate {{considered}} Black's nomination. Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no <b>conclusive</b> evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E
5|$|The red ruffed lemur and the {{black-and-white}} ruffed lemur were formerly recognized as subspecies, Varecia variegata rubra and Varecia variegata variegata respectively. In 2001 both were elevated to species status, {{a decision that}} was later supported by genetic research. Three subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, which had been published decades earlier, were also recognized as variegata, editorum, and subcincta, although studies have not been entirely <b>conclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is no <b>conclusive</b> {{evidence}} {{explaining why}} the Dibbles chose to place Gothic {{windows on the}} upper level. The windows {{are believed to have}} been purchased through the Sears catalog. There are two commonly accepted theories: the Dibbles may have wanted the windows to beautify their home at a time when rural life in Iowa was a struggle, or they could have been following a trend in which extravagant details were desirable in residences in the late nineteenth century, and the Dibbles chose windows whose costs would have been relatively reasonable at the time.|$|E
5|$|This holding {{was based}} upon the well-understood {{governmental}} policy of encouraging the Indian to forgo his wandering habits and adopt those of civilized life; and {{it was said that}} to hold that by so doing he acquired no possessory rights to the lands occupied, to which the government would accord protection, would be contrary to the whole spirit of the traditional American policy toward these dependent wards of the nation. The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not <b>conclusive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though {{alarmed by}} the {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln in the election of 1860, Hawes was an opponent of secession, supporting instead the idea of armed neutrality. In May 1861, Hawes, Breckinridge, and Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin represented the Southern Rights viewpoint at a convention to decide Kentucky's course in the Civil War. He attended another such convention in September 1861. Neither convention produced a <b>conclusive</b> decision.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Byrne v. Alas (1888), {{the court}} {{distinguished}} its holding by reversing a quiet title judgment against {{a group of}} Mission Indians. Byrne, in distinguishing Doaksum, held that the fact of a third party validating title to certain lands was <b>conclusive</b> {{of the fact that}} those lands were not in the public domain, and thus, that the aboriginal title was not extinguished.|$|E
