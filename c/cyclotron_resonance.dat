40|$|Gyro-traveling-wave {{amplifiers}} (gyro-TWAs) are {{types of}} gyrodevices, which {{take advantage of}} the cyclotron maser instability to produce coherent electromagnetic (EM) radiation from electrons gyrating in an external magnetic field and interacting with fast traveling waves. For high power applications, gyrodevices often require relativistic electron beams and operate at high cyclotron harmonics. In such conditions, if the EM wave is large enough, the electron cyclotron frequency can vary significantly in the process of interaction with the wave. This can lead to the overlapping of <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> at different harmonics, which can cause electrons to exhibit stochastic trajectories. In devices operating at cyclotron harmonics, it is possible for the electron beam to excite a wave at a given harmonic. This wave, in turn, can excite other waves at frequencies different from the operating frequency. The interaction between such waves is a nonlinear effect. In relativistic gyrodevices, this wave interaction may be affected by the overlapping of <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances.</b> This thesis presents theoretical analysis of (a) the effect of overlapping of <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> on electro...|$|R

25|$|Orbitrap {{instruments}} {{are similar to}} Fourier transform ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> mass spectrometers (see text below). Ions are electrostatically trapped in an orbit around a central, spindle shaped electrode. The electrode confines the ions so that they both orbit around the central electrode and oscillate back and forth along the central electrode's long axis. This oscillation generates an image current in the detector plates which is recorded by the instrument. The frequencies of these image currents depend on the mass-to-charge ratios of the ions. Mass spectra are obtained by Fourier transformation of the recorded image currents.|$|E

The DESI can be composed of six linear moving stages and one rotating stage. This can include a 3-D linear stage for samples and another with the rotating stage for the spray mount. Coupling of an FTICR to DESI can increase mass accuracy to below 3 parts per million. This can be done on both liquid and solid samples.|$|E
25|$|As an {{electron}} enters a magnetic field, it feels a Lorentz force and corkscrews. The radius of this motion is the gyroradius. As it moves it loses some energy as x-rays, {{every time it}} changes speed. The electron spins faster and tighter in denser fields, as it enters the MaGrid. Inside the MaGrid, single electrons travel straight through the null point, due to their infinite gyroradius in regions of no magnetic field. Next, they head towards {{the edges of the}} MaGrid field and corkscrew tighter along the denser magnetic field lines. This is typical electron <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> motion. Their gyroradius shrinks and when they hit a dense magnetic field they can be reflected using the magnetic mirror effect. Electron trapping has been measured in polywells with Langmuir probes.|$|E
25|$|FTICR-MS differs {{significantly}} from other mass spectrometry techniques {{in that the}} ions are not detected by hitting a detector such as an electron multiplier but only by passing near detection plates. Additionally the masses are not resolved in space or time as with other techniques but only by the ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> (rotational) frequency that each ion produces as it rotates in a magnetic field. Thus, the different ions are not detected in different places as with sector instruments or at different times as with time-of-flight instruments, but all ions are detected simultaneously during the detection interval. This provides {{an increase in the}} observed signal-to-noise ratio owing to the principles of Fellgett's advantage. In FTICR-MS, resolution can be improved either by increasing the strength of the magnet (in teslas) or by increasing the detection duration.|$|E
30|$|As an {{important}} plasma wave mode in the geospace, magnetosonic waves can interact with both radiation belt electrons and protons, thereby impacting {{the dynamics of}} magnetospheric particles. Based on the Doppler-shifted resonance condition and the cold plasma dispersion relation, we investigate the profiles of resonance zone and resonant frequency of the Landau resonance between radiation belt electrons and magnetosonic waves and the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> with protons. The results demonstrate that resonant interactions between magnetosonic waves and magnetospheric charged particles largely rely on L-shell, wave normal angle, and kinetic energy and equatorial pitch angle of particles. Resonance zones for the Landau resonance between magnetosonic waves and radiation belt electrons are confined to a very narrow (mostly less than 1 °) extent of magnetic latitude, which tends to shift to lower latitudes with increasing equatorial pitch angle and decreasing electron energy. Landau resonance frequencies also increase with magnetosonic wave normal angle. In contrast, higher order <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> of magnetosonic waves with protons are much easier to occur in {{a broad range of}} magnetic latitude. As the resonance order increases, the coverage of the resonance zone shrinks overall and occupies the geomagnetic equatorial region. In addition, resonant frequencies increase with resonance order. Corresponding to higher order <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances,</b> protons are more likely to interact with magnetosonic waves at intermediate to high frequencies. Our study can be useful to elaborate the resonant interaction processes between magnetosonic waves and radiation belt electrons and protons and improve the current understanding of the multi-aspect impact of magnetosonic waves on the magnetospheric particle dynamics.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{studies the}} {{nonlinear}} mechanisms {{at work in}} magnetized plasmas when wave packets interact resonantly with particle distributions presenting loss-cone-like structures. Lower hybrid waves are considered {{in view of the}} great importance, in space and laboratory plasmas, of waves with frequencies below the electron cyclotron frequency. Owing to a three-dimensional Hamiltonian model and a numerical symplectic code, the authors study the nonlinear stage of the loss-cone instability for various particle distributions and wave spectra involving symmetric and asymmetric features. In particular, the wave-particle interaction process of dynamical resonance merging, which results from an instability of the trapped particles' motion and leads to complex stochastic phenomena, is discussed. Whereas interactions at normal <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> are mostly considered, the role of the Landau and the anomalous <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonances</b> is also studied to explain thoroughly the nonlinear wave-particle dynamics as well as the competition between loss-cone, fan, and beam instabilities. The relaxed particle distributions and the saturated wave spectra are analyzed. The time necessary for filling the loss-cone structures is determined {{as a function of the}} characteristics of the particle distributions. Whereas most of the previous works analyzed the asymptotic stage of the system's evolution in the frame of the well-known quasilinear theory, the paper considers the case when the energy carried by the wave packet is sufficiently large so that the description of the physical processes at work cannot be limited to the frame of weak turbulence theories...|$|R
2500|$|Fourier {{transform}} {{mass spectrometry}} (FTMS), {{or more precisely}} Fourier transform ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> MS, measures mass by detecting the image current produced by ions cyclotroning {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an electron multiplier, the ions are injected into a Penning trap (a static electric/magnetic ion trap) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion's cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be deconvoluted by performing a Fourier transform on the signal. FTMS has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is [...] "counted" [...] more than once) and much higher resolution and thus precision.|$|E

In other detection systems, such as FTICR, the number of charges on the ion are more important to signal intensity. In Fourier transform ion <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> and Orbitrap type mass spectrometers the signal intensity (Y-axis) is related to the amplitude of the free induction decay signal. This is fundamentally a power relationship (amplitude squared) but often computed as an [...] For decaying signals the rms is not equal to the average amplitude.

After the excitation field is removed, the ions are rotating at their cyclotron frequency in phase (as a [...] "packet" [...] of ions). These ions induce a charge (detected as an image current) on a pair of electrodes as the packets of ions pass close to them. The resulting signal is called a free induction decay (FID), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of sine waves.
