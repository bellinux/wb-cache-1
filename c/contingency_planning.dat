5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E
5|$|Operation Rösselsprung was a coup de main operation, {{involving}} {{direct action}} {{by a combined}} parachute and glider-borne assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion and a planned subsequent link-up with ground forces of the XV Mountain Corps converging on Drvar. The airborne assault was preceded by heavy bombing of the town by the Luftwaffe. The ground forces included Home Guard forces of the Independent State of Croatia.

40|$|The {{definition}} of the <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> during the preparedness phase holds {{a crucial role in}} emergency management. A proper emergency response, indeed, requires the implementation of a <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> that can be accurate only if different people with different skills are involved. The goal {{of this paper is to}} introduce SocialEMIS, a first prototype of a tool that supports the collaborative {{definition of}} <b>contingency</b> <b>plans.</b> Although the current implementation is now focused on the role of the emergency operators, the accuracy of the plan will also take advantage of information coming from the citizens in future releases. Moreover, the <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> defined with SocialEMIS represent a knowledge base for defining other <b>contingency</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

The department is charged with the formulation and implementation of policies, the monitoring of activities and the efficient deployment of personnel and resources. Operations Wing coordinates counter-terrorism, internal security, anti-illegal-immigration measures, bomb disposal commitments and <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for natural disasters—they are also responsible for the Police Dog Unit.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} raised significant {{public and}} political issues related to energy security, adequacy of existing infrastructure, <b>contingency</b> <b>planning,</b> {{and the role of}} regulatory agencies. The plant took three months to repair, although partial supplies were restored within six weeks of the explosion. A major investigation was launched by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA), with separate investigations conducted by the plant operator and several other government agencies. NOPSA's report was published on 10 October 2008, and confirmed early suggestions that the explosion was caused by structural failure of the export pipeline due to significant corrosion. A Senate Committee inquiry was established to investigate the economic impacts and the state government's response to the crisis. The committee's report was handed down on 3 December 2008.|$|E

25|$|Importantly, Colonel William P. Biddle {{replaced}} General Elliott as the Commandant of the Marine Corps, {{who in turn}} approved {{three important}} reforms that strengthened the Corps' {{ability to respond to}} advanced base missions; one of which was the establishment of an assistant to the Commandant. The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps was responsible for the military training and preparedness of the Marines. Lieutenant Colonel Eli K. Cole was the first to hold this office. Secondly, the creation of permanent expeditionary companies at each Marine Barracks. And thirdly, the institution of mandatory three months' recruit training for all Marine recruits. In addition, Biddle continued Elliott's policy of assigning a few Marine officers to Navy and Army advanced officer schools for further training in large unit maneuvers, artillery, communications, and <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1970, <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> began for {{evacuation}} of noncombat personnel from Long Tieng and Sam Thong, as Vang Pao again mulled moving his Hmong community toward the Thai border. Renewed PAVN attacks on 15 March on several Royalist positions in MR 2 began before the evacuation could start. A company of PAVN troops hit {{the perimeter of}} the refugee relief center at Sam Thong. On 17 March, emergency {{evacuation of}} Royalist wounded, Laotian civilians, and Americans from Sam Thong began despite continuing wretched flying weather. The next day, the last Hmong irregulars abandoned Sam Thong to the communists, who promptly torched half of it. As the retreating Hmong gathered at Long Tieng, PAVN infantry roved the ridgeline above it five kilometers to the northeast. By now, three-fourths of Long Tieng's populace—the noncombatant portion—was being evacuated via air. The CIA case agents on site destroyed their classified material. Vang Pao's reserves were reduced to two companies of recruits pulled from basic training, his military band, and 28 aviation technicians. However the 20A airfield remained open as Vang Pao personally defended it with a mortar.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{planning}} began for Operation Dauntless, a drive [...] {{into the}} Iron Triangle—a key communist concentration area and communications junction {{in the central}} sector between Chorwon and Kumwha {{in the south and}} Pyonggang in the north. <b>Contingency</b> <b>planning</b> also included precautions against a further Chinese offensive, in which the US Eighth Army would conduct a delaying defence on successive positions. Further indications of an imminent communist offensive—including the visible strengthening of Chinese and North Korean artillery and logistic systems—led Ridgway to order Van Fleet not to exploit any opportunities beyond the Wyoming Line. Confident nonetheless, Ridgway widened the scope of the offensive, designating a secondary objective line in the eastern sector known as the Alabama Line. Fate would intervene however, and Van Fleet launched his offensive on 21 April only to be met by a much stronger Chinese and North Korean offensive the following night.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{exhaustive}} {{efforts by}} Finnish historians, {{it is so}} far proven impossible to pinpoint the exact date on which Finland was taken into confidence about Operation Barbarossa. The [...] "paper trail" [...] is tantalizing but leads only to dead ends and side paths, not to any benchmark conference or dates. Probably no formal agreements were necessary. The Finnish Generals who were privy to joint planning were mostly German trained and intimately familiar with the German way of waging war. There was also {{a certain amount of}} coyness on both sides. Joint operations were discussed, all during the spring of 1941, in purely hypothetical terms, and neither the Finns nor the Germans were entirely candid with one another as to their national aims and methods. In any case, the step from <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> to actual operations, when it came, {{was little more than a}} formality. Three days after the start of Barbarossa, Stalin handed the Finns a perfect excuse by launching some air raids. War was declared on June 25, 1941 ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the past}} two decades, Georgia's {{leadership}} has failed to produce significant agreements with Alabama and Florida. Many people blame {{the leaders of the}} state for this failure. The old course of [...] "Conflict, Conceal, and Capture" [...] has not resulted in any progress. In December 2009 Governor Sonny Perdue's Water <b>Contingency</b> <b>Planning</b> Task Force recommended greater water conservation in the Atlanta region and further negotiation regarding the reallocation of portions of Lake Lanier to supply the needs of metro Atlanta.

While some commentators and experts argued that the coverage of the problem largely amounted to scaremongering, it was only the safe passing of the main [...] "event horizon" [...] itself, 1 January 2000, that fully quelled public fears. Some experts who argued that scaremongering was occurring, such as Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, have since claimed that despite sending out hundreds of press releases about research results suggesting that the problem was not likely to be as big a problem as some had suggested, they were largely ignored by the media.|$|E
2500|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} openly supported India {{during the}} 1962 Sino-Indian war {{and considered the}} Chinese action as [...] "blatant Chinese Communist aggression against India". The United States Air Force flew in arms, ammunition and clothing supplies to the Indian troops and the United States Navy even sent the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier from the Pacific Ocean to protect India, only to recall it back before it reached the Bay of Bengal. In a May 1963 National Security Council meeting, the United States discussed <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> that could be implemented {{in the event of}} another Chinese attack on India. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and General Maxwell Taylor advised the president to use nuclear weapons should the Americans intervene in such a situation. Kennedy insisted that Washington defend India as it would any ally, saying, [...] "We should defend India, and therefore we will defend India." [...] Kennedy's ambassador to India was the noted liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who was considered close to India. While in India, Galbraith helped establish one of the first Indian computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. As an economist, he also presided over the (at the time) largest US foreign aid program to any country.|$|E
