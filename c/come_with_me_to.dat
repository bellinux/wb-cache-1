500|$|Adem Ali of Forté Magazine {{identified}} the song, along with Raja's subsequent releases, as exemplifying the singer's [...] "blend of club-kid neo-pop" [...] combining elements of pop, techno, and electro music. Raja {{said that his}} music was inspired by electro house and disco. [...] "Diamond Crowned Queen" [...] was called a [...] "grungy dance mix" [...] by WEHOVille's Whitney Friedlander. The instrumental is provided by [...] "deep, throbbing beats" [...] and electronics. Rolling Stone's Lyndsey Parker described Raja's vocal performance as a [...] "whole lot of groaning", and Bustle's Anneliese Cooper classified it {{as an example of}} [...] "crazy shit shouted to a beat". In the chorus, Raja sings [...] "Follow me, follow me, I’m a diamond crowned queen. <b>Come</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> my pretty, pretty palace, Gonna lick on your trigger, every inch will make you quiver." [...] Other lyrics include other sexual references, such as: [...] "S-E-X, sex for dinner / I'm a thunder-breathing dragon cat." ...|$|E
500|$|AM2 {{developed}} what Sega {{hoped would}} be the Dreamcast's killer app, Shenmue, a [...] "revenge epic {{in the tradition of}} Chinese cinema." [...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only one sequel was ever released.s development |publisher=Polygon |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |quote=Yu Suzuki: The biggest challenge we encountered was project management. By the end, we had 300 people [...] and no experience on such a large project. At the time there were no project management tools... so instead we made a job order sheet that was a list of action items in Excel. Because we kept testing, the items did not decrease. At one point we had 10,000 of them. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628071042/http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/19/5527120/yu-suzuki-shenmue-gdc-2014-classic-game-postmortem |archivedate=June 28, 2015 }} While Shenmue was lauded for its innovation, visuals and music, its critical reception was mixed; points of criticism included [...] "invisible walls" [...] which limited the player's sense of freedom, boredom caused by the inability to progress without waiting for events scheduled to occur at specific times, excessive in-game cutscenes and a lack of challenge.s stupendously large canvas, its superlative evocation of a time and place that to date remains alien territory to videogames and its unfading beauty all ensure it classic status... the sweetest memory came just this year, when on a trip to Japan with my girlfriend I convinced her to <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Yokosuka, the port town that stars in the original game and is only an hour's ride from central Tokyo. It's the ultimate Dreamcast fanboy's pilgrimage, and as I took my first steps down Dobuita Street and recognized locations I'd walked past countless times before—Kurita's Military Store, Mary's Embroidery Store and the parking lot where Ryo honed his fighting skills—I couldn't help but go a little dewy eyed." [...] According to Moore, Shenmue sold [...] "extremely well", but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast's limited installed base. Shenmue II [...] "was completed for a much more reasonable sum", while Sato defended Shenmue as an [...] "investment [...] will someday be recouped" [...] because [...] "the development advances we learned... can be applied to other games". In addition to the mixed reception for Shenmue, IGN's Travis Fahs stated that [...] "the [...] era wasn't as kind to [...] as earlier years"—citing (among others) F355 Challenge as an [...] "acclaimed" [...] arcade title that [...] "didn't do much at home", and Genki's port of Virtua Fighter 3 as inferior to the arcade version, [...] "which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors."s view, buyers of modern coin-op conversions have the right to expect more from their investments than unenhanced facsimiles. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102942/http://www.edge-online.com/review/virtua-fighter-3tb-review/ |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }} The Virtua Fighter series would experience a [...] "tremendous comeback" [...] with the universally acclaimed Virtua Fighter 4—which saw a console release exclusively on PS2.|$|E
