2500|$|Controversy {{about the}} 2R {{hypothesis}} hinged {{on the nature}} of paralogy regions. It is not disputed that human chromosomes bear sets of genes related to sets of genes on other chromosomes; the controversy centres on whether they were generated by large-scale duplications that doubled all the genes at the same time, or whether a series of individual gene duplications occurred followed by chromosomal rearrangement to shuffle sets of genes together. Hughes and colleagues found that phylogenetic trees built from different gene families within paralogy regions had different shapes, suggesting that the gene families had different evolutionary histories. This was suggested to be inconsistent with the 2R hypothesis. However, other researchers have argued that such 'topology tests' do not test 2R rigorously, because recombination could have occurred between the closely related chromosomes generated by polyploidy, because inappropriate genes had been compared and because different predictions are made if genome duplication occurred through hybridisation between species. In addition, several researchers were able to date duplications of gene families within paralogy regions consistently to the early evolution of vertebrates, after divergence from amphioxus, consistent with the 2R hypothesis. When complete genome sequences became available for vertebrates, <b>Ciona</b> intestinalis and amphioxus, it was found that much of the human genome was arranged in paralogy regions that could be traced to large-scale duplications, and that these duplications occurred after vertebrates had diverged from tunicates [...] and amphioxus.|$|E

50|$|C. intestinalis {{was one of}} {{the first}} animals to have its full genome sequenced, in 2002. It has a {{relatively}} small genome (about 160 Mbp) consisting of 14 pairs of chromosomes with about 16,000 genes.The draft genome analysis identified nine Hox genes, which are Ci-Hox1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, and 13. <b>Ciona</b> savignyi, the closest relative of <b>Ciona</b> intestinalis, also have the same set of Hox genes. The organization of Hox genes is only known for C. intestinalis among ascidians. The nine Hox genes are located on two chromosomes; Ci-Hox1 to 10 on one chromosome and Ci-Hox12 and 13 on another. The intergenic distances within the <b>Ciona</b> Hox genes are extraordinarily long. Seven Hox genes, Ci-Hox1 to 10, are distributed along approximately half the length of the chromosome. Comparisons to Hox gene expression and location in other species suggests that the Hox genes in ascidian genomes are under a dispersing condition.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ciona</b> savignyi is a solitary, bottle or vase-shaped {{tunicate}} {{growing to}} {{a length of}} about 15 cm. It is usually broader near the base and this part is permanently attached to a hard surface. The outer covering or tunic is soft and gelatinous, translucent, whitish or cream-coloured. The muscle bands and internal organs can often be seen through the tunic. At the narrower, free end, there is a buccal siphon through which water is drawn into the animal. This opening is rimmed by eight yellow-edged lobes each with an orange-red spot. At the side, {{not far from the}} buccal siphon, there is an atrial siphon out of which water is pumped. This has six similar yellow lobes with red spots. Five to seven muscle bands run longitudinally along the tunic and the siphons can be retracted when danger threatens. This species can be mistaken for the very similar <b>Ciona</b> intestinalis but <b>Ciona</b> savignyi has white flecks in the tunic wall which C. intestinalis lacks. Nor does C. intestinalis have any reddish colour associated with its buccal siphon.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ciona</b> intestinalis is a {{hermaphroditic}} broadcast spawner but cannot self-fertilize. [...] Eggs and sperm, when released, {{can stay}} in the water column for 1 to 2 days while the larvae are free-swimming for 2 to 10 days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ciona</b> intestinalis is {{a solitary}} {{tunicate}} with a cylindrical, soft, gelatinous body, up to 20 cm long. The body colour and colour at the distal end of siphons are major external characters distinguishing sister species within the species complex.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ciona</b> intestinalis (sometimes {{known by}} the common name of vase {{tunicate}}) is an ascidian (sea squirt), a tunicate with very soft tunic. Its Latin name means, literally, [...] "pillar of intestines", referring {{to the fact that}} its body is a soft, translucent column-like structure, resembling a mass of intestines sprouting from a rock. [...] It is a globally distributed cosmopolitan species. Since Linnaeus described the species, <b>Ciona</b> intestinalis {{has been used as a}} model invertebrate chordate in developmental biology and genomics. Recent studies have shown that there are at least two, possibly four, sister species. [...] By anthropogenic means, the species has invaded various parts of the world and is known as an invasive species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ciona</b> savignyi is {{a filter}} feeder. The water drawn {{in through the}} buccal siphon passes through a mucus net where planktonic {{particles}} are caught. Periodically, this is rolled up and swallowed and a new net is secreted. The water is expelled through the atrial siphon.|$|E
50|$|Sea squirts {{are also}} {{valuable}} {{because of their}} unique evolutionary position: as an approximation of ancestral chordates, they can {{provide insight into the}} link between chordates and ancestral non-chordate deuterostomes, as well as the evolution of vertebrates from simple chordates. The sequenced genomes of the related sea squirts <b>Ciona</b> intestinalis and <b>Ciona</b> savignyi are small and easily manipulated; comparisons with the genomes of other organisms such as flies, nematodes, pufferfish and mammals provides valuable information regarding chordate evolution. A collection of over 480,000 cDNAs have been sequenced and are available to support further analysis of gene expression, which is expected to provide information about complex developmental processes and regulation of genes in vertebrates. Gene expression in embryos of sea squirts can be conveniently inhibited using Morpholino oligos.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ciona</b> savignyi {{is highly}} self-fertile. [...] However, {{non-self}} sperm out-compete self-sperm in fertilization competition assays. Gamete recognition is not absolute allowing some self-fertilization. It was speculated that self-incompatibility evolved to avoid inbreeding depression, but that selfing ability was retained to allow reproduction at low population density.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ciona</b> savignyi is {{a marine}} {{invertebrate}} animal sometimes {{known as the}} Pacific transparent sea squirt or solitary sea squirt. It is a species of tunicate in the family Cionidae. It is found in shallow waters around Japan and has spread {{to the west coast}} of North America where it is regarded as an invasive species.|$|E

50|$|Like other tunicates, <b>Ciona</b> savignyi is a hermaphrodite. The {{male and}} female gonads do not ripen {{simultaneously}} so it does not normally self-fertilise. Gametes are released into the sea and after fertilisation, the eggs hatch into tadpole-like larvae. After {{a few days of}} development these attach themselves to a firm surface and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile tunicates.|$|E
5000|$|Hands-on {{annotation}} activities {{occurred during}} the first 2 days of the 3-day workshop. In total, 39 researchers contributed 184 TFBS and 317 Regulatory Regions from 96 papers. Many of these researchers were also trained on the ORegAnno system, significantly increasing its experienced-user community. The contribution of these annotations to individual species was 339 annotations in Homo sapiens, 42 annotations in Mus musculus, 72 annotations in Drosophila melanogaster, 24 annotations in <b>Ciona</b> intestinalis, 14 annotations in Rattus norvegicus, 6 annotations in Halocynthia roretzi, 2 annotations in <b>Ciona</b> savignyi and 2 annotations in HIV. Within these annotations, one new dataset was added to ORegAnno; 274 human enhancers were programmatically annotated by Maximillian Haessler, Institute Alfred Fessard, from Visel et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2006. In total, 130 scientific studies were examined in depth.
