40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a Double-Space Time Transmit Diversity (D-STTD) <b>communication</b> system <b>with</b> Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) scheme and analyze its {{performance}} using simulation experiments. The simulation {{results show that}} the probability of selecting a high Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) level increased as the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) improved. Furthermore, the D-STTD <b>communication</b> system <b>with</b> AMC scheme provided a more uniform throughput distribution throughout the entire SNR range compared to its counterpart which did not apply AMC scheme. Also, the maximum throughput of the D-STTD <b>communication</b> system <b>with</b> AMC scheme was twice that of a conventional AMC communication system or a Space Time Transmit Diversity (STTD) <b>communication</b> system <b>with</b> AMC scheme...|$|R
30|$|The earlier works [20 – 25] mainly {{considered}} {{energy harvesting}} <b>communication</b> systems <b>with</b> only one transmitter. However, nowadays many communication systems {{are equipped with}} more than one transmitter. Therefore, it is necessary to study energy harvesting <b>communication</b> systems <b>with</b> multiple transmitters. In [26], optimal packet scheduling in a multiple access <b>communication</b> system <b>with</b> two energy harvesting transmitters was investigated. In [27], a <b>communication</b> system <b>with</b> an energy harvesting transmitter over parallel and fading Gaussian broadcast channels was studied. In [28], an optimal power allocation policy for a <b>communication</b> system <b>with</b> two energy harvesting transmitters over an interference channel was proposed. These works shed light on energy harvesting <b>communication</b> systems <b>with</b> multiple transmitters, but did not consider transmitter switching. In our opinion, transmitter switching can provide flexibility and robustness to an energy harvesting communication system, especially when a transmitter is unable to send data or the energy harvested from the environment is insufficient for data transmission. If this happens, other neighboring transmitters can turn to work and help the transmitter to proceed data transmission. To make the transmitter switching effective and decrease the switching overhead, a well-designed policy is essential to choosing the suitable transmitter to work.|$|R
