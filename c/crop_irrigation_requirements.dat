The ISAREG simulations were focused in as et of the most locally representative crops to assess the evolution of net and total water requirements, considering a monthly time step for two 30 -year future periods, (2011 – 2040) and (2041 – 2070). Reference evapotranspiration was estimated using the temperature-based Hargreaves–Samani equation, and the simulations were performed using, as inputs, a combination of five climate change scenarios built using the Ensemble-Delta technique from CMIP 3 climate projections datasets to set different alternative climate change bracketing conditions for rainfall and air temperature. Water balance outputs for different climate scenarios were combined with four agricultural scenarios allowing for the estimation of total irrigation requirements. A general increase in <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirements</b> was estimated, mainly for those crops as maize, pasture, and orchards that are already big irrigation water consumers. Crops as olive groves and vineyards, well adapted to the Mediterranean conditions, show less sensitivity to climate change.

40|$|Abstract. Agriculture is {{the largest}} user {{of water on the}} planet with a 70 % of all {{freshwater}} withdrawals. Today the growing scarcity and competition for water among agricultural, industrial, commercial and residential sectors are pushing the water managers to allocate water more efficiently. In this scenario the use of methodologies and tools for better monitor and schedule the irrigation water for the agricultural sector are becoming relevant in the decision making process. In this paper two tools for calculating the <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirements</b> are proposed. The tools determinates, based on the complex relationships of the system soil-plant-atmosphere, the quantities and timing of water to be granted to meet the crops needs. The tools, developed by the Italian Institute for Agricultural Economics, are called Bilancio and MARSALa. Bilancio was realized for estimating the irrigation needs at parcel level for the Reclamation and Irrigation Consortia located in Southern Italy.

In Mediterranean regions, it is traditionally grown as a spring-sown rainfed crop, very dependent on rainfall. In this situation, supplemental irrigation can improve significantly the crop yield. The objective of this study was to evaluate the improvement on chickpea crop yield and water productivity (WP) of five chickpea varieties with supplemental irrigation, in the Mediterranean conditions, with both dry and wet years.

The results show that all chickpea varieties responded to supplemental irrigation with the increase in grain and biomass yield. However, the magnitude of individual chickpea response depends on the year and the genotype. In 2009, a dry year, the highest WP values were attained at the 50 % IR treatment, whereas in 2010, a wet year, it was the rainfed treatment that showed the highest WP values.

Parameters analyzed were annual rainfall and its seasonal distribution, temperature and evapotranspiration, collected from available regional meteorological data from a 46 -year period (1963 - 2009). The impacts of climate change in Guadiana basin’s irrigated crops was studied running long-term soil water balance simulations to evaluate the trend of irrigation water requirements considering maximum potential yield. The simulations were focused {{on a set of}} locally representative crops including wheat, maize, olive trees, vineyards and citrus. Climate data analysis showed an increase in average annual air temperature, and declining annual rainfall, with an increasing irregularity in monthly rainfall distribution. As a consequence of climate change, estimated <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirements</b> simulated in the considered period illustrate a rising tendency pattern, although different statistical significance was found amongst crops. Out of the studied crops, those with a typical high water demand, such as maize, and crops depending more directly on soil water content accumulated from rainfall during the winter season, such as wheat, both show a more significant tendency to increase their irrigation demands, while crops well adapted to the Mediterranean climate, such as olive trees, remained more conservative in their future irrigation water demands...|$|E

Five different irrigation levels calculated as percentage of <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirement</b> using FAO procedures (Allen et al. in Crop evapotranspiration. Guidelines for computing <b>crop</b> water <b>requirements.</b> <b>Irrigation</b> and drainage paper 56. FAO, Rome, 1998) were imposed during the growing season. Periodically during the growing season, daytime stem water potential (ΨSTEM), inflorescences per branch, fruits per inflorescence and shoot absolute growth rate were measured. Crop yield, fruit average fresh weight and oil polyphenol content were measured after harvest. The midday ΨSTEM ranged from − 7 to − 1. 5 MPa and correlated well enough with yield efficiency, crop density and fruit fresh weight to demonstrate its utility as a precise method for determining water status in SHD olive orchards. The relationships between midday ΨSTEM and the horticultural parameters suggest maintaining ΨSTEM values between − 3. 5 and − 2. 5 MPa is optimal for moderate annual yields of good quality oil. Values below − 3. 5 MPa reduced current season productivity, while values over − 2. 5 MPa were less effective in increasing productivity, reduced oil quality and produced excessive crop set that strongly affected vegetative growth and fruit production the following season.

Studying the {{effects of climate change}} on <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirement</b> (CIR) would help to tackle climate change, from both food security and sustainable water resource use perspectives. This paper applied SDSM (Statistical DownScaling Model) to simulate future meteorological parameters in the Hetao irrigation district (HID) in the time periods 2041 – 2070 and 2071 – 2099, and used the Penman–Monteith equation to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration (ET 0), which was further used to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop water requirement (CWR). CWR and predicted future precipitation were used to calculate CIR. The results show that the climate in the HID will become warmer and wetter; ET 0 would would increase by 4 % to 7 %; ETc and CWR have the same trend as ET 0, but different crops have different increase rates. CIR would increase because of the coefficient of the increase of CWR and the decrease of effective precipitation. Based on the current growing area, the CIR would increase by 198 × 106 to 242 × 106 m 3 by the year 2041 – 2070, and by 342 × 106 to 456 × 106 m 3 by the years 2071 – 2099 respectively.

40|$|Introduction]: Machine {{vision is}} {{commonly}} reported {{for use in}} automated plant-based applications such as growth monitoring, stress detection, species identification and fruit harvesting. Geometric measurement of living plants using machine vision commonly requires depth perception, which typically entails establishing correspondence between multiple images. The complexity of such a task in an unstructured environment, such as foliage, often restricts automation of the process. Automated measurement of the geometry of young plants has been reported using laser range finding and image processing (Kaminuma et al. 2004) or multiple camera views (Lin et al. 2001). Noordam et al. (2005) compared automated methods of locating the main stem of a rose plant using methods including stereo imaging, structured lighting and X-ray imaging, while Ivanov et al. (1995) reported using stereovision and a manually-operated 2 D digitiser to model a maize canopy. However an automated vision system for measuring geometry of complex plants {{in the field is}} yet to be reported. Plant geometry is a significant factor for irrigation purposes in cotton because the distance between main stem nodes indicates water stress in a growing cotton plant. However, manual measurement of internode length is a tedious task for even a small number of plants. An automated method for large scale measurement of plant geometry in the field would provide information about <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirement</b> as well as spatial and temporal variability in crop stress and growth.

In estimating <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirements</b> and surface evaporation in Utah, United States of America, methodology and software were developed using the ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith Reference Evapotranspiration equation with input climate drivers from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) gridded weather forcing dataset and a digital elevation model. A simple procedure was devised to correct bias in NLDAS relative humidity and air temperature data based on comparison to weather data from ground stations. Potential evapotranspiration {{was calculated for}} 18 crops (including turfgrass), wetlands (large and narrow), and open water evaporation (deep and shallow) by multiplying crop coefficient curves to reference evapotranspiration with annual curve dates set by summation of Hargreaves evapotranspiration, cumulative growing degree days, or number of days.

Methods and results : We evaluated root water conductivity of the cultivars ‘Black Magic’, ‘Matilde’ and ‘Victoria’ grafted onto 1103 Paulsen rootstock or self-rooted. Measurements were performed on two-year-old table grapes grown in pots filled with pumice. Root water conductivity was determined by placing the pots in a pressure chamber and increasing pressures from 0. 05 to 0. 30 MPa, at intervals of 0. 05 MPa. Plant growth in terms of shoot and root dry matter was also evaluated, as well as leaf and root area. Conclusion : Root water conductivity differed according to cultivar and grafting. The ‘Victoria’ cultivar had higher root water conductivity than the other two, which differed little between them. The grafted plants showed higher root water conductivity than the self-rooted plants, except the plants of the cultivar ‘Matilde’, whose root water conductivity for the grafted and self-rooted plants was almost the same. It was also observed that the higher root water conductivity in relation to cultivar and grafting changed with increasing water flux and was constant for high water flux. Significance and impact of the study : Estimation of root {{hydraulic conductivity}} helps to determine the water consumption of the cultivars investigated, whether self-rooted or grafted, as well as the amount of irrigation water to apply to vineyard...|$|E
40|$|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pulse crops in the world, cultivated on a wide range of environments. In Mediterranean regions, it is traditionally grown as a spring sown rainfed crop, thus very dependent on rainfall. Supplemental irrigation can sometimes be a strategy to overcome the deficiency in rainfall, especially in very dry years. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects on crop yield and water productivity (WP) with the use of supplemental irrigation in both dry and wet years. Field tests were carried out over two cropping seasons, in Southern Portugal, using three kabuli type and two desi type chickpea varieties, and four irrigation treatments, corresponding to full (100 %) <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirements</b> (IR), 50 % of IR, 25 % of IR and rainfed. Crop physiological parameters were measured during the cropping season in order to evaluate crop development. Results showed that all chickpea varieties had a positive response to supplemental irrigation, with a significant increase in the number of pods, seeds and the weight of the seeds, leading to higher grain and above ground biomass yields. The Elixir variety showed the best results in grain and biomass yield as well as harvest index and water productivity. In 2009, a dry year, the highest WP values were achieved at the 50 % IR treatment. In 2010, due to heavy rain, crop sowing had to be delayed. This shortened the crop growth cycle, affecting crop growth and yield, leading to lower yield values and higher WP values in the rainfed treatment. Field data was used in the SALTMED model to evaluate the capabilities of the model to simulate chickpea yield in these conditions. It was possible to verify that the calibration of the model using a single chickpea variety was enough to simulate the other varieties. The results of the calibration and validation of the model, recently published in Silva et al. (2012), showed that, providing enough and reliable data, the model can simulate very accurately grain yield and total dry mass of different chickpea varieties with supplemental irrigation, in both wet and dry year conditions...|$|E

We used the well-validated APSIM model to examine potential agronomic benefits and long-term risks of this strategy under the current and warmer climates of the new region. Yield of the two <b>crops,</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirement,</b> total soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) losses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were simulated. Sixteen climate stressors were used; these were generated by using global climate models ECHAM 5, GFDL 2. 1, GFDL 2. 0 and MRIGCM 232 with a median sensitivity under two Special Report of Emissions Scenarios over the 2030 and 2050 timeframes plus current climate (baseline) for Katherine. Effects were compared at three levels of irrigation and three levels of N fertiliser applied to maize grown in rotations of wet-season peanut and dry-season maize (WPDM), and wet-season maize and dry-season peanut (WMDP). The climate stressors projected average temperature increases of 1 °C to 2. 8 °C in the dry (baseline 24. 4 °C) and wet (baseline 29. 5 °C) seasons for the 2030 and 2050 timeframes, respectively. Increased temperature caused a reduction in yield of both crops in both rotations. However, the overall yield advantage of WPDM increased from 41 % to up to 53 % compared with the industry-preferred sequence of WMDP under the worst climate projection. Increased temperature increased the <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirement</b> by up to 11 % in WPDM, but caused a smaller reduction in total SOC accumulation and smaller increases in N losses and GHG emission compared with WMDP. We conclude that although increased temperature will reduce productivity and total SOC accumulation, and increase N losses and GHG emissions in Katherine or similar northern Australian environments, the WPDM sequence should be preferable over the industry-preferred sequence because of its overall yield and sustainability advantages in warmer climates. Any limitations of irrigation resulting from climate change could, however, limit these advantages...|$|R

The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the level of current adequacy of irrigation performance in relation to the predicted performance during the design period. Three different adequacy performances (delivery, infiltration and storage) were determined from the measurements of the two important basic sprinkler performance parameters: discharge and uniformity. The study result indicates excess irrigation water application more than the <b>crop</b> net <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirement</b> and soil moisture deficit, especially for the 2. 4 * 4. 8 mm nozzles sprinkler at all pressure ranges considered. Inline to this, tremendous losses in terms of deep percolation ( 40 %) have been observed, the consequence of which is leaching of soluble nutrients, loss of valuable water resources, reduced crop yield and rise of groundwater table. The later one might lead to drainage problems, which requires construction of expensive drainage [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Australia has an {{incredibly}} variable and unpredictable hydroclimate, and while irrigation {{is designed to}} reduce risk, significant uncertainty remains in both seasonal water availability (&# 039;allocations&# 039;) and <b>irrigation</b> <b>crop</b> water <b>requirements.</b> This paper explores the nature and impacts of seasonal hydroclimatic uncertainty on irrigator decision making and temporary water markets in the Goulburn system in northern Victoria. Irrigation and water trading plans are modelled for the three seasons of the irrigation year (spring, summer and autumn) via discrete stochastic programming, and contrasted against a perfect information base case. In water-scarce environments, hydroclimatic uncertainty {{is found to be}} costly, in terms of both the efficiency of irrigation decisions and the allocation of water via the water market...|$|R
40|$|The {{economical}} {{benefits of}} different irrigation strategies were assessed by long term simulation (20 years) for dry beans in Paraná, Brazil. The model BEANGRO {{was used to}} simulate <b>crop</b> yield and <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirements</b> assuming eight levels of irrigation threshold (20 to 90 % of the remaining soil available water in steps of 10 %), {{in addition to a}} level considering no irrigation. Net return was the objective function to select the optimum irrigation management strategy, assuming fixed and stochastic distributions of historical product price. The results showed that yield was significantly increased by irrigation despite a high variability for all the simulation strategies, due to variations on growth conditions over the years. Although the net return was highly variable, it was positive in 75 % of the years for all strategies with threshold values higher than 30 %. The strategy of irrigating the crop before the soil reaches 60 % AW provided the maximum economical benefits. The high profit using this improved strategy justifies the practice of irrigation for beans in Paraná...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{performed at the}} HsuehChia Experimental Station from 1993 to 2001 to calculate the reference and actual crop evapotranspiration, derived the crop coefficient, and collected requirements input data for the CROPWAT irrigation management model to estimate the <b>irrigation</b> water <b>requirements</b> of paddy and upland crops at the ChiaNan Irrigation Association, Taiwan. For corn, the estimated crop coefficients were 0. 40, 0. 78, 0. 89 and 0. 71 in the initial, crop development, mid-season and late-season stages, respectively. Meanwhile, the estimated crop coefficients for sorghum were 0. 44, 0. 71, 0. 87 and 0. 62 in the four stages, respectively. Finally, for soybean, the estimated crop coefficients were 0. 45, 0. 89, 0. 92 and 0. 58 in the four stages, respectively. With implementation of REF-ET model and FAO 56 Penman–Monteith method, the annual reference evapotranspiration was 1268 mm for ChiaNan Irrigation Association. In the paddy fields, the <b>irrigation</b> water <b>requirements</b> and deep percolation are 962 and 295 mm, respectively, for the first rice crop, and 1114 and 296 mm for the second rice crop.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A set of {{existing}} hydrologic {{models of the}} headwater and agricultural ar-eas of the Walker River basin are used to estimate the effects of cloud seeding activities by the Desert Research Institute {{on the amount of}} water delivered to the agricultural areas in {{the lower part of the}} basin over the water years 2004 through 2013. A monthly water bal-ance model is used to simulate the accumulation and melt of the snowpack and the associ-ated runoff in the headwater areas. A river basin management model is used to simulate the spatial and temporal complexity of the movement and use of surface and groundwa-ter below the mountain front in the streams, reservoirs, <b>irrigation</b> ditches, and <b>crop</b> areas which are completely driven by water right priorities and water supply. Two case studies are presented, and the effects of cloud seeding on two different target areas are identified and compared in terms of: (1) changes to the amount of surface water delivered to the <b>crop</b> areas for <b>irrigation</b> purposes; (2) changes in the amount of supplemental groundwater pumping; and (3) changes in crop shortage for each year over the study period. Estimates of <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> water <b>requirements</b> and <b>crop</b> value per acre were used to assess the finan-cial benefits of the cloud seeding activities under a range of seeding efficiency estimates for each case. The results indicate that, over the study period, the benefits to seeding the target areas in the first case, characterized by relatively large long-term annual precipita-tion, are significantly greater than seeding the target area in the second case, characterized by less annual precipitation. The results from both studies provide useful information for planning and operational decisions related to cloud seeding in the Walker River basin...|$|R
40|$|Controlled and {{efficient}} agricultural irrigation management {{is required to}} avoid negative effects of the increasing world water scarcity and therefore to assure a sustainable production. Within this context, the project 'Participatory multi-Level EO-assisted tools for Irrigation water management and Agricultural Decision-Support' (PLEIADeS: [URL] addressed the efficient and sustainable use of water for food production in water-scarce environments. The project aimed at improving the performance of irrigation schemes {{by means of a}} range of measures, made possible through wide space-time coverage of Earth Observation (E.

40|$|International audienceISAREG is a {{conceptual}} non-distributed water balance model for simulating <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> schedules {{at field level}} and to compute <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirements</b> under optimal and/or water stressed conditions. To support the users of ISAREG in creating appropriate crop data inputs, the auxiliary program KCISA is linked with the simulation model. GISAREG is a Geographical Information System (GIS) based application integrating both ISAREG and KCISA, which was developed for application in the Aral Sea basin to support implementation of improved farm irrigation management. The integration concerns the creation of spatial and weather data bases, the models operation for different water management scenarios, {{and the production of}} <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> maps and time dependent irrigation depths at selected aggregation modes. The resulting information on alternative irrigation schedules is therefore spatially distributed and shall be used to identify practices that lead to water saving and provide for salinity control.

40|$|Irrigation {{water demand}} {{accounts}} for more than 95 % of the total water use in the Kaidu-kongqi River Basin. Determination of the spatial and temporal trends in irrigation water demand is important for making sustainable and wise water management strategies in this highly water deficit region. In this study, the spatial and temporal trends in irrigation water demand as well as net <b>crop</b> <b>irrigation</b> water <b>requirements</b> for nine major crops during 1985 – 2009 were analyzed by combining the Penman-Monteith equation recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and GIS technology. The regional water stress was also evaluated based on the total irrigation water demand and river discharge at the annual and monthly scales. The results indicated that the annual irrigation water demand in this arid region showed a significant increasing trend during the past 25 years. Total irrigation water demand increased from 14. 68 × 108 m 3 in 1985 to 34. 15 × 108 m 3 in 2009. The spatial pattern of total irrigation water demand was significantly affected by the changes in cotton growing area. Due to differences in crop planting structure, the monthly average irrigation water demands in Korla City and Yuli County amounted to the peak in July, while those in other regions reached the maximum in June. Although the annual river runoff was much larger than the irrigation water demand, there was serious water deficit during the critical water use period in May and June in some dry years. The presented study provides important information for managers and planners on sustainable use of water resources in this arid region...|$|R
