40|$|This paper {{dynamically}} models {{an incumbent}} Local Exchange Carrier's (LECs) {{ability to control}} market entry with a profit squeeze. The model {{is consistent with the}} post-Telecommunications Act of 1996 local exchange market. The model shows that an unconstrained incumbent could choose output prices and input costs to discourage an entrant's output-market production. The impact of a regulatory constraint on incumbent behavior is examined. It is concluded that cost-based input prices may lead to little growth in the entrant's self-provision of inputs and that <b>continuing</b> <b>oversight</b> of output and input prices may be necessary.

The Commission and its staff have developed a remarkable record of supporting key research into these areas. We are also greatly indebted to the Employment Development Department for their assistance in preparing the data for this study. The Disability Insurance Unit supplied a 20 % sample from the Single Client File and the Labor Market Information Division supplied the data on employment by industry. Without this assistance, this important research would not be possible. DRAFT – DO NOT CITE Across the United States, occupational injuries receive near universal coverage under stateregulated workers ’ compensation programs. However, California is one of only six jurisdictions that provides workers with a near universal non-occupational disability program, called State Disability Insurance (SDI). While workers ’ compensation is entirely financed by employers, SDI is solely supported by workers through automatic payroll deductions. The workers ’ compensation system is increasingly dominated by disputes over whether cumulative injuries and illnesses should be considered occupational or non-occupational. Becaus...|$|E
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Unlike other depository institutions, credit unions are exempt from federal corporate income taxes. Recent legislative and regulatory changes to credit union membership restrictions and allowable products and services have blurred some of the historical distinctions between credit unions and other depository institutions. As a result, some observers have raised questions about whether tax exemption provides credit unions with an advantage over other depository institutions and whether the original basis for tax exemption is still valid. As part of its <b>continuing</b> <b>oversight</b> of the tax-exempt sector, the House Committee on Ways and Means asked GAO to address (1) the historical basis for the tax-exempt status of credit unions; (2) the arguments for and against taxation, including estimates of potential revenue from eliminating the exemption; (3) {{the extent to which}} credit unions offer services distinct from those offered by banks of comparable size, and serve low-and moderate-income individuals; and (4) the extent to which credit unions are required to report information on executive compensation and assessments of their internal controls. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of electronically stored information (ESI) in litigation has increased significantly {{over the past}} decade, and responding to e-discovery requests made by all litigating parties has become a critical management function and cost center for larger organizations. Today over 92 % of all business records and data are created and stored electronically and most are never reduced to hard copy [2]. “Discovery ” is court-enforced demands by litigation adversaries to produce potentially relevant information, and takes place after litigation is filed. Civil litigation is often settled or discontinued before reaching the trial stage, and ESI produced and evaluated by both sides during the discovery phase can be critical in determining litigation outcomes. Managing on-going e-discovery requires close coordination between managers with very different technical and legal expertise and operational authority, in order to conduct on-going discovery activities efficiently. Multi-disciplinary ESI Discovery Teams can be a useful mechanism to achieve the necessary coordination and to maintain <b>continuing</b> <b>oversight</b> over e-discovery responsibilities of larger organizations. A 2007 survey of litigation activities by 253 major U. S. corporations revealed that 83 % had new lawsuits filed against them in 2006 [1]. The most common subject matter wa...|$|E

40|$|Summary {{report of}} the mid-term meeting of the CGIAR held in New Delhi, India, May 23 - 27, 1994, chaired by Ismail Serageldin. The meeting was opened by representatives of the Indian Government, {{including}} Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. The meeting was held {{against the background of}} a significant CGIAR financial crisis. The Group approved proposals made by the Chairman in his opening address for an 18 month plan of action, including a high level international conference in January 1995. Emphasis was placed on changes in governance that would result in predictability, transparency, and accountability. The Chairman announced a special additional World Bank grant of $ 20 million to match (on a 1 for 2 ratio) additional funds from other donors for CGIAR core programs in 1994 / 1995. After reviewing several forward looking documents, the Group decided to approve a vision statement at ICW 94 as a basic document for the high level conference. Discussion of Oversight Committee reports on governance and organization resulted {{in the creation of a}} 15 member Steering Committee, composed of the <b>continuing</b> <b>Oversight</b> and Finance Committees. The Group decided to move over two years to a matrix framework for CGIAR programs. Contributions from other donors for activities within the matrix would draw 15 % matching funds from the World Bank. There were several decisions on genetic resources policy, and their management, based on a stripe review. An Oversight Committee study of policy towards Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union was approved. The {{report of the}} Task Force to follow up on Agenda 21 was considered and acted upon. The Rockefeller Foundation reported that final proposals for the new livestock center (ILRI) would be ready at ICW 94.
