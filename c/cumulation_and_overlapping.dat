40|$|AbstractAbstractAbstractAbstract The {{presented}} work {{is focused}} on the Prague school of typology, an approach formulated by Vladimír Skalička and pursued later by Petr Sgall or Jaroslav Popela. In the centre of the approach stands the formulation of 5 idealised language types or clusters of linguistic features. The combinatorial possibilities of these types are to be observed in the languages of the world. Prague school of typology has been a target of critique mainly as a holistic approach and due to its problematic work with typological data. The work is concerned with the possibilities of testing the validity of some of the proposals of the approach in question by means of the methods of modern typology. The possible correlation of morphological exponence and NP agreement was tested on a representative sample of 47 languages. The index of exponence and agreement was obtained for each language in the sample. No significant correlation between the indices was found. Both the symmetrical "favourability" of <b>cumulation</b> <b>and</b> agreement and "dis-favourability" of separation and agreement was ruled out. There was not sufficient data to prove or rule out the asymmetrical relationship between <b>cumulation</b> <b>and</b> agreement.

40|$|What do {{we mean by}} {{progress}} <b>and</b> <b>cumulation</b> in {{the social}} and human sciences? Recent thinking in the philosophy and history of science has led to an abandonment of some versions of logical positivism and of verificationism that had a strong deductive and theory testing orientation. What is to replace them is less clear. This paper argues that progress <b>and</b> <b>cumulation</b> {{can be seen as a}} process of evaluation and retention within an epistemic community. Scholarly disciplines differ in their social structure and in their epistemic and normative commitments. Since sociology is a fragmented discipline, progress <b>and</b> <b>cumulation</b> differ within its multiple subdisciplines, which to varying extents represent epistemic communities. Brief sketches of progress (advance) <b>and</b> <b>cumulation</b> in several subdisciplines are offered...|$|R

The existing algorithms for discovering such patterns do involve usual sigma counts of fuzzy sets as measure of support. Unfortunately, a well-known side effect is then an undesirable cumulation of small membership values. We like to propose an improved approach based on generalized sigma counts, which in particular leads to a consequently lower <b>cumulation,</b> <b>and</b> considerably to better results. We test the modified algorithm using different generalized sigma counts based on different cardinality pattern functions...|$|R

For a particular utilitarian social welfare function, the problem faced by a central planner {{can be broken}} down into two subproblems: a standard problem o f optimally allocating aggregate consumption over time and a problem of distributing aggregate consumption optimally at each moment among those alive. If it can use a sufficiently rich set of lump-sum taxes and transfers, the government can replicate the command optimum as a market equilibrium outcome. No issue of government debt is needed to achieve this decentralization. Copyright 1988 by The Econometric Society. ...|$|R

40|$|Interruption <b>and</b> <b>Overlap</b> often {{occurs in}} a conversation. This study is about Interruptions <b>and</b> <b>Overlaps</b> {{produced}} by the Host and Hostess of Ceriwis in Trans TV. The writer wants {{to find out what}} interruption <b>and</b> <b>overlap</b> utterances occur in the program, who interrupts <b>and</b> <b>overlaps</b> more in conversation among the host and hostess, and why they interrupt <b>and</b> <b>overlap</b> each other. The writer follows Wardaugh?s theory for reason of interruption and Yule?s theory for reason of overlap. The writer uses qualitative descriptive approach to her study by recording an episode of Ceriwis on Wednesday, February 28, 2007. Then, she makes a transcription, which becomes her source of data. In this study, the writer finds that the total number of utterances containing overlaps is greater than utterances containing interruptions. She also finds that the host interrupts more than hostess does. Then, most of overlaps is done by the host and hostess together. In this study, the writer also finds some reasons of interruptions and most of utterances containing interruptions is completing. Whereas, the writer also finds some other reasons of interruptions beyond Wardaugh?s theory, that is repeating, make a clarification, answering, and informing. Moreover, in this study the writer finds three reasons of <b>overlaps</b> <b>and</b> most <b>overlaps</b> is showing closeness or solidarity. In addition, in this study the writer concludes that interruptions <b>and</b> <b>overlaps</b> in this program cannot be categorized as violation of talk.
