40|$|The {{biodegradation}} of N-alkyl polypropylene polyamines (NAPPs) was studied using {{pure and}} mixed cultures to enable read-across of ready biodegradability test results. Two Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from activated sludge with N-oleyl alkyl propylene diamine and N-coco alkyl dipropylene triamine, respectively. Both strains utilized all NAPPs tested {{as the sole}} source of carbon, nitrogen and energy for growth. Mineralization of NAPPs was independent of the alkyl chain length {{and the size of}} the polyamine moiety. NAPPs degraded in <b>closed</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>tests</b> (CBTs) using both river water and activated sludge. However, ready biodegradability of NAPPs with alkyl chain lengths of 16 – 18 carbon atoms and polyamine moieties with three and four nitrogen atoms could not be demonstrated. Biodegradation in the CBT was hampered by their limited bioavailability, making assessment of the true ready biodegradability of these highly adsorptive surfactants impossible. All NAPPs are therefore classified as readily biodegradable through read-across. Read-across is justified by the broad substrate specificity of NAPP-degrading microorganisms, their omnipresence and the mineralization of NAPPs...|$|R

However, using oil based drilling fluids will create pollution and therefore, environmental regulations on discharge of such drilling fluids have become more stringent because it will give tremendous impacts on the marine life and ecosystem. This research is conducted to formulate a new environmental friendly drilling fluids using vegetable oils derived biodiesel to replace the oil based drilling fluids without reducing their performances. This study focuses on physical properties and biodegradation rate of biodiesel based drilling fluids with respect to its toxicity and compare with the conventional oil based drilling fluids.

40|$|Enantiomeric {{fraction}} (EF) {{analysis of}} chiral pharmaceuticals {{has been proposed}} as a potential indicator of biological transformations of environmental pollutants. Ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen, which are chiral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), were selected for assessment of their potential {{to be used as}} such indicators. A highly sensitive and reliable method for the enantioselective analysis of these NSAIDs in wastewater and environmental water samples was developed. An indirect method for enantioseparation was achieved by the derivatization of the (R) - and (S) -enantiomers to amide diastereomers using (R) - 1 -phenylethylamine. Separation and detection of the individual diastereomers was undertaken by gas chromatography&# 150;tandem mass spectrometry (GC&# 150;MS/MS). The method is sufficiently sensitive for the detection of targeted drugs in a real tertiary treated wastewater sample, revealing measurable concentrations of both (R) - and (S) -enantiomers of the drugs. Isotope dilution using racemic D 3 -ibuprofen, racemic D 3 -ketoprofen and racemic D 3 -naproxen was shown to be an essential aspect of this method for accurate quantification and EF determination. The microbial degradation of both enantiomers of the NSAIDs was observed over 10 days in a <b>Closed</b> <b>Bottle</b> <b>Test</b> (CBT) under controlled laboratory conditions. (S) -ibuprofen was shown to be degraded faster than (R) -ibuprofen while non-enantioselective degradation was observed for ketoprofen. A very minor change was observed in naproxen EF, with a slight increase in (R) -naproxen concentration indicating the formation of this enantiomer during the experimental process. It is proposed that this formation occurred as the result of chiral inversion of (S) -naproxen. The enantiospecific fate of the NSAIDs was then monitored before and after treatment by a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating synthetic wastewater and a full-scale MBR treating real municipal wastewater. Evidence of enantioselective biodegradation for ibuprofen and naproxen were again observed. Clear evidence for the formation of (R) -naproxen in the laboratory-scale reactor is presented and measurable concentrations of (R) -naproxen were consistently observed in full-scale MBR effluent. This work has expanded our knowledge of the fate of these compounds during wastewater treatment {{to an understanding of the}} specific behaviours of the individual enantiomers. The variability of EF observed in the final effluent therefore may provide a useful indicator of the overall biodegradation performance of the wastewater treatment plant. The observation of chiral inversion during wastewater treatment has not previously been reported and adds a new dimension to the important topic of transformation products during wastewater treatment processes...|$|E

Study of the macrostructures and the chemical composition of asphaltene film at the toluene-water interface after demulsifier addition demonstrated gradual penetration of the demulsifier into the asphaltene film.
