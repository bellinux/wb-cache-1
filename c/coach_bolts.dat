50|$|Lag screws (US) or {{coach screws}} (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also {{referred}} to as lag bolts or <b>coach</b> <b>bolts,</b> although this is a misnomer) are large wood screws. Square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1 standards, and the head is typically an external hex. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 1/4 in to 1+1/4 in, and lengths from 1/4 to 6 in or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, he had {{an array}} of dipoles {{set up on the}} sheep grazing {{property}} of Dennistoun, about 7.5 km northeast of the town of Bothwell, Tasmania, where he lived in a house of his own design and construction he decided to build after he purchased a job lot of <b>coach</b> <b>bolts</b> at a local auction. He imported 4x8 douglas fir beams directly from a sawmill in Oregon, and then high technology double glazed window panes, also from the US. The bolts held the house together. The window panes formed a north facing passive solar wall, heating mat black painted, dimpled copper sheets, from which the warmed air rose by convection. The interior walls were lined with reflective rippled aluminium foil. The house was so well thermally insulated that the oven in the kitchen was nearly unusable because the heat from it, unable to escape, would raise the temperature of the room to over 50 °C (120 °F).|$|E

Bolt won his first annual high school championships medal in 2001, taking the silver medal in the 200 metres with a time of 22.04 seconds. McNeil soon became his primary coach, and the two enjoyed a positive partnership, although McNeil was occasionally frustrated by Bolt's lack of dedication to his training and his penchant for practical jokes.|$|R
50|$|Restoration of {{the garden}} was begun by the 9th Duke, and has {{continued}} under the 10th Duke. It included returning the River Ise to its eighteenth-century width, which required two miles of green oak boarding, fixed by <b>coach</b> <b>bolts.</b> In 2009 landscape designer Kim Wilkie was commissioned {{to create a new}} work to complement an existing pyramidal grassed mount. The result, called Orpheus, is named after the famed musician of Greek mythology who, when his wife Eurydice died, went down into the underworld to try to reclaim her. His music was so beautiful that Hades relented and allowed Eurydice to return {{to the world of the}} living. This striking landform seamlessly continues the garden's intellectual dialogue via an immense inverted pyramid and spiral rill, both set within a golden ratio. In 2015 The Grand Etang, or ‘large lake’ in French, a long-vanished lake of almost one-acre with a 75 ft tall water jet was recreated, to once again reflect the main frontage of Boughton. Located immediately to the north-west of the House, it is one of the earliest surviving features from the original gardens and designed landscape. It was created in the early 18th century as a reflecting pool for the house and was also used for ice-skating in the winter.|$|E

50|$|A gripe is {{a simple}} form of clamp used in {{building}} a clinker boat, for temporarily holding the strake which is being fitted onto the one {{to which it is}} to be attached. The strake is relatively thin and wide so that it is necessary for the tool to have a long reach while only a small movement is required. This is achieved by taking two pieces of dense timber, typically oak, each of a length a little more than twice the widest width of the strake. A <b>coach</b> <b>bolt</b> (see carriage bolt) is fitted through the middle and adjusted so that the gripe will fit onto the land (the joint between the adjacent strakes) while admitting the point of a wedge between the free ends of the two parts of the gripe. The wedge is then tapped in so that the gripe grips the land, using the bolt as a fulcrum.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{and maintenance of}} cowls was generally {{the job of a}} wheelwright. To remove a cowl, a cowl pole would be bolted to one of the main beams of the kiln, and the top would protrude {{from the top of the}} kiln. A rope would be passed over the pulley at the top of the cowl pole and tied around the cowl. The finger would be removed, and the <b>coach</b> <b>bolt</b> securing the centre post to the backboard undone. The cowl could then be lifted off the tenon at the top of the centre post and lowered down the kiln. Ropes were also tied at each end of the tie beam if present. The cowl could either be lowered inverted, or alternatively, a ladder would be placed against the kiln roof and the cowl be carried down by the wheelwright, the weight being mainly taken by those in the kiln working on the rope. It was important to avoid damaging the kiln roof. Replacement was a reversal of the above process. A series of illustrations showing the process can be found here. The modern method involves using a mobile crane.|$|R

40|$|Since {{that very}} memorable {{day at the}} Beijing 2008 Olympics, a big {{question}} on every sports commentator’s mind has been “What would the 100 meter dash world record have been, had Usain Bolt not celebrated {{at the end of}} his race? ” Glen Mills, <b>Bolt’s</b> <b>coach</b> suggested at a recent press conference that the time could have been 9. 52 seconds or better. We revisit this question by measuring Bolt’s position as a function of time using footage of the run, and then extrapolate into the last two seconds based on two different assumptions. First, we conservatively assume that Bolt could have maintained Richard Thompson’s, the runner-up, acceleration during the end of the race. Second, based on the race development prior to the celebration, we assume that he could also have kept an acceleration of 0. 5 m/s 2 higher than Thompson. In these two cases, we find that the new world record would have been 9. 56 ± 0. 02 and 9. 52 ± 0. 02 seconds, respectively, where the uncertainties denote statistical (measuring) errors only.

500|$|Bolt's record-setting runs caused {{commentators}} {{not only}} to praise his achievements but also to speculate about his potential {{to become one of}} the most successful sprinters ever. Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals. The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals. All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems. Bolt's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators, including Victor Conte, and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns. The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills (<b>Bolt's</b> <b>coach)</b> and Herb Elliott (the Jamaican athletics team doctor). Elliott, a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, urged those concerned about the issue to [...] "come down and see our programme, come down and see our testing, we have nothing to hide". Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete, declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "We will test any time, any day, any part of the body... doesn't even like to take vitamins". Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics, and all had tested negative for banned substances. He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean, stating, [...] "We work hard and we perform well and we know we're clean".|$|R

40|$|Connecting timber {{panels to}} steel girders using {{mechanical}} fasteners (e. g. screws and bolts) {{is an attractive}} and novel method for developing a fully prefabricated and sustainable hybrid steel-timber composite (STC) floor that can also facilitate future dismantling and recycling of the structural components. This study concerns the short-term behaviour of innovative STC floors comprising of cross-laminated timber (CLT) and/or laminated veneer lumber (LVL) panels connected to steel girders by various mechanical fasteners and/or glue. The mechanical characteristics of STC connections play {{an essential role in}} the safe and economical design of hybrid STC structures and floor systems. Accordingly, at the first stage of this research project, short-term behaviour of STC connections has been investigated. Push-out tests on different types of STC lap joints with coach screws (with and without a reinforcing nail plate), high-strength bolts and a combination of glued and screwed connectors are reported, and the load-slip behaviour, stiffness, strength and failure modes of the STC connections are characterised. At the second stage, short term behaviour of STC system was investigated through four-point bending tests. The results of four-point bending tests performed on full-scale STC beams are reported and the structural behaviour (i. e. the load-deflection response, short-term stiffness, and peak load capacity and failure modes) of the proposed STC system are studied. At the last stage of the project, extensive non-linear 1 D and 2 D finite element (FE) analyses of STC beams are carried out and the numerical results are verified against the test results. It is shown that 1 D and 2 D FE models can adequately capture the structural response of the STC beams. Using the FE and experimental results, the composite efficiency of STC beams that can significantly influence their structural behaviour beams is determined. In addition, the mechanical behaviour of lap STC connections was investigated through using a nonlinear 3 D continuum-based FE model. In the FE models developed, the non-linear behaviour and failure of the timber is captured by a stress-based failure criterion formulated in the framework of continuum-damage mechanics. Yielding of the steel plates and fasteners (i. e. <b>coach</b> screws and <b>bolts)</b> is captured by an elastic-hardening plastic constitutive law. These FE models are validated against experimental (push-out) tests conducted on LVL and Steel-CLT composite lap connections. It is shown that the FE models developed can adequately predict the load-slip response and failure mode of the hybrid steel-timber composite connections tested. The validated FE model is used to undertake a parametric study that elucidates the influence of the yield strength and the length of the fasteners and the post-tensioning force in the bolts on the stiffness, load carrying capacity and load-slip behaviour of hybrid steel-timber composite connections...|$|R
