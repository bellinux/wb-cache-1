5|$|Alarmed at {{the popular}} appeal of Paine's Rights of Man, the king issued a {{proclamation}} against seditious writings in May 1792. Booksellers and printers bore {{the brunt of}} this law, the effects of which <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> in the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson testified, publicly distancing himself from Paine and Barlow, {{despite the fact that}} the defendants were received sympathetically by the juries.|$|E

At World War 3 on November 24, 1996, the frustration <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> as Bagwell attacked Riggs following both men's elimination from the three-ring battle royal {{that served as the}} main event.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL's {{problems}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> in 2006 when {{almost half}} the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions. The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security. The F-FDTL is currently being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long-term force development plan.|$|E

5|$|Despite Gillard's {{defeating}} Kevin Rudd {{comfortably in}} the 2012 leadership spill, tensions {{remained in the}} Labor Party regarding Gillard's leadership. After Labor's polling position worsened {{in the wake of}} Gillard announcing the date of the 2013 election, these tensions <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> when former Labor Leader and Regional Minister Simon Crean called for a leadership spill and backed Rudd on 21 March 2013. In response, Gillard sacked Crean from his position, and called a leadership spill for 4.30pm that same day.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the British, 265,000 Jewish immigrants, {{mainly from}} Europe, came {{to settle in}} Palestine between 1919 and 1939. Arab {{resistance}} and violence to this influx of immigrants <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> in 1937, and the Peel Commission recommended that two states should be formed, one Arab and one Jewish, which would divide the country between them. Then in May1939, the British restricted the number of Jewish immigrants to 75,000 in the White Paper of 1939.|$|E

5|$|He died {{without a}} {{legitimate}} male heir and was succeeded to the Polish throne by his half-brother, John II Casimir Vasa (Jan Kazimierz Waza). Władysław's death {{marked the end}} of relative stability in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as conflicts and tensions that had been growing over several decades <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> with devastating consequences, notably the largest of the Cossack uprisings – the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648) – and the Swedish invasion ("the Deluge", 1655–60).|$|E
5|$|In October 97 these {{tensions}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> {{when the}} Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He {{was forced to}} submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius, Domitian's former chamberlain, were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Tension <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Ryan.

5|$|The citadel was {{not used}} during the rule of Gia Long and the only {{military}} action occurred after his son had ascended the throne as Minh Mạng. Years of tension between the monarch and General Lê Văn Duyệt, the governor of southern Vietnam, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> {{after the death of}} the latter in 1831. Tension between the pair surfaced when Gia Long made Minh Mang the heir to the throne. Duyet had opposed the succession, favouring the enthronement of a young son of the late Prince Cảnh, the eldest of Gia Long's sons.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{within the}} ministry <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> on 8 February 1708, when Godolphin and the Marlboroughs {{insisted that the}} Queen had to either dismiss Harley or do without their services.

5|$|As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony {{maintained}} {{a distance from}} politics throughout {{the reign of the}} new monarch, RadamaII, instead preferring to focus on his military responsibilities. Meanwhile, disputes between Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony and King Radama grew frequent as the young sovereign pursued radical reforms that had begun to foment displeasure among the traditional masses. The situation <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> on 7 May 1863, when Radama insisted on legalizing duels, despite widespread concern among the king's advisers that the innovation would lead to anarchy. The Prime Minister initiated the arrest of the menamaso, the prince's influential advisers, while Rainilaiarivony enacted his brother's instructions to keep the peace in the capital city. However, the situation deteriorated in dramatic fashion and, by the morning of 12 May, King RadamaII was declared dead, having been strangled on the Prime Minister's orders.|$|E

The show was recorded and released the following May as the band's first live album, Live! @ The Granada Theater.|$|E
5|$|By 1895 Venezuela had had {{a dispute}} with the United Kingdom about the {{territory}} of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, for over half a century. The territorial claims were originally those of the Spanish Empire (inherited by Venezuela after its independence in 1830) and of the Dutch Empire (inherited by the United Kingdom with the acquisition of the Dutch territories of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice in 1814), having remained unsettled over previous centuries. Over {{the course of the}} nineteenth century the British and Venezuelans had proved no more able to reach an agreement, until matters <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> in 1895, after seven years of severed diplomatic relations.|$|E
5|$|Emperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties overall debased the currency, {{particularly}} the denarius, under {{the pressures of}} meeting military payrolls. Sudden inflation {{during the reign of}} Commodus damaged the credit market. In the mid-200s, the supply of specie contracted sharply. Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Century—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300. Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency, general economic anxieties <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> under Aurelian, and bankers lost confidence in coins legitimately issued by the central government. Despite Diocletian's introduction of the gold solidus and monetary reforms, the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.|$|E

5|$|For a time, no overt {{action was}} taken, and the plans {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's {{abrasive}} personality {{made him}} many political enemies, but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many friends. This conflict of opinions <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics {{at a time}} when Kentucky Republicans were finally gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Henry III {{decided that}} Bedford Castle should be {{returned}} to its original owner, William de Beauchamp, and became increasingly frustrated with Falkes' refusal to do so; matters <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> when Falkes' castellans imprisoned Henry of Braybrooke, a royal judge who was hearing law cases against Falkes. When Falkes refused to release the judge, Henry mobilised an army, supported by the Church in the form of Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and advanced to Bedford. Falkes had left the castle, along with around eighty men, in charge of his brother, William de Breauté, who refused to surrender it to the king. Falkes was probably hoping that if the castle held on long enough, his efforts to convince Pope Honorius III to intervene against Henry would succeed. The Archbishop excommunicated William and the siege began.|$|E
