5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> could enjoy.|$|E

25|$|Most {{forms of}} {{psychotherapy}} use spoken conversation. Some also use various {{other forms of}} communication such as the written word, artwork, drama, narrative story or music. Psychotherapy with <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> often involves play, dramatization (i.e. role-play), and drawing, with a co-constructed narrative from these non-verbal and displaced modes of interacting.|$|E

2500|$|Failure {{to comply}} was {{considered}} [...] "insubordination" [...] {{and dealt with}} by expulsion. Readmission was denied by statute until the student complied. This expulsion, in turn, automatically exposed the <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> to criminal prosecution; the expelled child was considered [...] "unlawfully absent" [...] and could be proceeded against as a delinquent, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> or guardians could be fined as much as $50 and jailed up to thirty days.|$|R
25|$|Other {{terrorist}} attacks targeting children included the Itamar attack in which six <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> were murdered in their beds, including a three-month-old infant, and the 2011 Shaar HaNegev school bus attack in which Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip fired a Kornet laser-guided anti-tank missile {{over the border}} at an Israeli school bus, killing one child.|$|E
25|$|In the children's houses, trained {{nurses and}} {{teachers}} were the care givers. It was felt that relationships of the <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> {{would be better}} because parents {{would not have to}} be the sole disciplinarians. Children grew up in the community environment and grew up with children who were born in the same year as them. The financial responsibility of the children was shared by the community.|$|E
25|$|Eva Frommer {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} practitioners to establish an out-patient therapeutic milieu for very young <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> especially, but not only, those from deprived backgrounds. She not only afforded them exposure to the arts, but she invited students and members of the art establishment to contribute to that milieu. The arts in health settings have become commonplace. A successful businessman in antiquities has paid express tribute to her.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} month, {{the first}} of these seven measures became law, and the remaining six measures had been signed by the end of June. Altogether, the economic stimulus program provided an estimated 420,000 construction jobs under a new Housing Act, $175million in higher wages for those below the new minimum, over $400million in aid to over 1,000 distressed counties, over $200million in extra welfare payments to 750,000 <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> and nearly $800million in extended unemployment benefits for nearly three million unemployed Americans.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{relational}} bond {{between parents and}} children, a child coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender can be positive or negative. Strong, loving relationships between <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> may be strengthened but if a relationship is already strained, those relationships may be further damaged or destroyed by the child coming out. If people coming out are accepted by their parents, this allows open discussions of dating and relationships and allows parents to help their children with coping with discrimination and to make healthier decisions regarding HIV/AIDS.|$|E
25|$|During {{most of the}} 20th century, {{mental illness}} was {{believed}} to be caused by problematic relationships between <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> This view was held well into the late 1990s, in which people still believed this child-parent relationship was a large determinant of severe mental illness, such as depression and schizophrenia. Today, the belief is held that the child-parent relationship is of small importance in terms of causing mental illness compared to biological and genetic factors. So, the perceived causes of mental illness have changed over time and will most likely continue to alter while more research is done in this area.|$|E

50|$|Love {{has many}} {{different}} definitions {{ranging from a}} set of purely biological and chemical processes to a religious concept. As a character strength, love is a mutual feeling between two people characterized by attachment, comfort, and generally positive feelings. It {{can be broken down}} into 3 categories: love between a <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> love for your friends, and romantic love. Having love as a strength is not about the capacity to love, as such, it is about being involved in a loving relationship.|$|R
25|$|Another film version, titled Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), {{directed}} by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket, Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompas, Philip Wiegratz as Augustus Gloop, and Geoffrey Holder as the Narrator, was a hit, grossing about $470million worldwide {{with an estimated}} budget of $150million. The 1971 and 2005 films {{are consistent with the}} written work to varying degrees. The Burton film greatly expanded Willy Wonka's personal back-story borrowing many themes and elements from the book's sequel. Both films heavily expanded the personalities of the four bad <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> from the limited descriptions in the book.|$|E
25|$|A {{major goal}} of the series was to improve skills such as creativity, reading, math, {{critical}} thinking & problem solving, and foreign language abilities for children in preschool to about grade three or four. The growth {{in the development of}} educational computer software in general was thought to reflect the desire among parents to start teaching their children at younger ages. To this end, developers consulted with children, parents, and teachers during the design and development of each installment. Madeline Classroom Companion: Preschool and Kindergarten was playtested by <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> at Redwood City Kid's Club and Sequoia Children's Center. Many reviewers indicated that the developers achieved many of these goals well.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{launched a}} voluntary evacuation program in December 1943 which encouraged old people, {{children and their}} mothers {{to move from the}} main cities and stay in the homes of friends and relatives in rural areas. The government provided civilians with little assistance to evacuate, however. Few people evacuated until the first raid by American heavy bombers on Japan, an attack on Yawata, in June 1944 after which the government urged families to evacuate their children. As a result, 459,000 <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> moved to stay with friends and relatives. For families without contacts in the countryside, entire school classes evacuated as groups accompanied by their teachers; by August 1944, 333,000 children had been relocated to rural areas where they continued their education in inns, temples and other public buildings. A further 343,000 urban residents were forced to leave their homes when they were destroyed to create firebreaks; these people either moved to the country or lived in temporary accommodation near their workplace.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{describe}} social workers discretion {{when it comes to the}} relation between children placed away from home <b>and</b> <b>their</b> biological <b>parents.</b> The study describes how the social worker designs the contacts with the biological parents, for instance the extension for the actual meeting. The results are based on six interviews conducted with social workers who work with foster children. They have responded to questions related to the contact between <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> biological <b>parent.</b> The questions are based on eight vignettes. The contents of the vignettes show different conditions that affect the contact, for example age and foster care attitudes The results of the study have been compared to other previous research in discretion of the social worker <b>and</b> contacts between <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> biological <b>parents.</b> In summary the study shows that there is Â high degree of independence for the social workers designing <b>their</b> work <b>and</b> that <b>their</b> level of discretion. The study shows that contacts between the foster <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> biological <b>parents</b> are designed differently and vary according to the social worker responsible for the actual case. The high degree of discretion creates opportunities for individual assessments in accordance to national legislation...|$|R
25|$|At midday on 3 October 1836 the {{foundation}} stone was laid by Ann Thwaytes. At 11 am gentlemen inhabitants, subscribers and visitors joined a procession at the St George's Baths and walked {{with the local}} charity school children (beneficiaries of Mrs Thwaytes) to the site to present her with a silver trowel. The ceremony was watched by invited ladies seated on a dais in a plantation decorated with flags, and enlivened by a military band. At 2 pm the charity <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> totalling 500, received a free dinner provided by Mrs Thwaytes. In the afternoon there were boat races, a punt chase and a tightrope performance. On the Pier during the evening there was a Grand Illumination, a firework display, another tightrope performance, magic feats by Ching Lau Lauro, {{a model of the}} Clock Tower in fireworks, the Pier entrance illuminated by 30,000 variegated lamps, and a released balloon carrying Mrs Thwaytes' name in fire. An address of thanks to her was read by George Rohrs, secretary to the Clock Tower trustees who had been appointed by Mrs Thwaytes.|$|E
25|$|For this {{challenge}} teams were altered due to blue now having 4 members and red being left with 2 after Jason's departure. Ivan and Katie chose Fenton {{to join their}} team and even the stakes. Next the teams were taken to a sausage kitchen. They then made their own sausage meat and ground it up into one long sausage {{that had to be}} rolled into normal sized sausages. Ivan was quite adapt at creating objects out of balloons so he was named the 'balloon man' for the challenge and helped the red team make over 400 sausages and win the round. New red team member Fenton was given the nickname 'bacon' as he had the reputation of 'bringing home the bacon.' The next part to the challenge was to construct a BBQ straight out of a flat-pack box. The blue team came out on top this time. Once assembled, the two teams then had to cook the sausages they had made for <b>children</b> (<b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents)</b> from the local athletics club, who were now cheering the teams on. Each sausage had to be served with a different condiment. Then as part of the presenting aspect of the show, the teams were each given a megaphone which they used to try to persuade the kids to try their sausages over the other teams. It seemed like an out of control bidding war and while Katie and Bill did well at the task, Fenton didn't even need a microphone. In the end the judges differed in their opinions of who won. Ben believed the red team made the better sausage sizzle while Mark thought blue had it in the bag. Blue were selected as the winners and two from the red team were sent home.|$|E
