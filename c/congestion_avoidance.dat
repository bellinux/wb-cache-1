30|$|<b>Congestion</b> {{detection}} and <b>avoidance</b> (CODA) [10] presents the first detailed investigation on <b>congestion</b> {{detection and}} <b>avoidance</b> in wireless sensor networks. CODA includes three elements - congestion detection based on receiving, open loop hop-by-hop back pressure, and closed loop multi-source rate adjustment. As with open loop hop-by hop back pressure, the source gets the back pressure signals {{depending on the}} local congestion state. For closed loop multi-source rate adjustment, the source gets an acknowledgement (ACK) from the sink and when the congestion occurs, the sink stops sending ACKs to the source. CODA controls the rate of flow of packets based on the additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) algorithm. This technique is energy-efficient, but {{the reliability of the}} successful delivery of the packets to the destination is not guaranteed, for on receiving back pressure signals (meaning, the signals received by the source node from the intermediate nodes), the nodes drop their packets based on the congestion parameters.|$|R

40|$|Functional {{standardization}} {{activities in}} ISO and in regional workshops are currently addressing network layer relays for the interconnection of {{several types of}} subnetworks. Relay systems are critical systems in the overall performance of the network {{because they are the}} points where network congestion can be build up or avoided. Particularly, when the interconnected subnetworks have very dissimilar bandwidths, congestion control becomes a very important issue in relay systems design. This paper addresses the problem of congestion control in relay systems for LAN/WAN interworking. Congestion control deals with the avoidance of collapse situations in intermediate systems due to traffic overload. It deals also with the guarantee of fairness in resource utilization, considering user needs of communication services expressed in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. To ensure <b>congestion</b> collapse <b>avoidance</b> and fairness, a channel service algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that, in a situation of overload and for different traffic patterns with different QoS requirements, the relay’s channel service and acknowledgment algorithms can guarantee justice in resource utilization and the expected QoS among the active channels. 1...|$|R

30|$|TCP-Vegas [33] {{is one of}} the TCP {{variants}} {{that uses}} a rate-based congestion control mechanism. It was developed at the University of Arizona by Brakmo and Peterson.

It emphasizes packet delay, rather than packet loss, as a sign to help determine the rate at which to send packets. In addition, it also modifies the <b>congestion</b> detection and <b>avoidance</b> algorithms to improve the overall throughput of TCP. Even though TCP-Vegas was not intentionally designed for wireless, the TCP performance can be improved because its inherent rate-based congestion control algorithm could pro-actively avoid possible congestion and packet losses by ensuring that the number of outstanding segments in the network is small.|$|R
