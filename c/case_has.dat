40|$|Clinical and imaging data of 4 {{cases of}} primary Sjögren's {{syndrome}} (pSS) combined with {{central nervous system}} (CNS) lesions were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical symptoms of 4 patients were as follows: 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> fever; 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> blurred vision; 2 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> lower extremity weakness; one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> single lower limb weakness; one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> unilateral limb weakness; one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> hemisensory reduction; one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> bilateral abducens paralysis; 3 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> peripheral neuropathy. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed increased CSF pressure (210 - 270 mm H 2 O) in 3 cases, increased number of leukocyte [(50 - 380) × 10 6 /L] in 3 cases, and increased protein (1. 30 - 2. 56 g/L) in 3 cases. Brain MRI showed multiple lesions in white matters. After high-dose steroid therapy, 3 <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> good prognosis, and one had recurrent lower extremity weakness after 6 months. pSS combined with CNS lesions is rare. Lumbar puncture and brain MRI is important for diagnosis, and high-dose steroid therapy may have good therapeutic effect.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2015. 04. 014 </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: We had {{evaluated}} {{our experience}} {{in the treatment of}} Morrey Modified Masons type III and IV radial head fractures with radial head prosthesis. Materials and Methods: From April 2011 to September 2014, modular radial head prostheses were performed in thirty patients. There were twenty female and ten male with mean age of forty years. The follow-up was a mean of 25 months. Fractures of the radial head have been classified by Morrey Modified Masons classification. The indications for a radial head replacement were type III fractures in 24 cases, type IV fractures in 6 cases, and comminuted radial fracture associated with disruption of the medial collateral ligament in 3 cases. Patients were assessed postoperatively and on follow-up based on Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) Score. Results: By using the MEPI, out of thirty <b>cases,</b> twenty <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> excellent results, seven <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> good results, two <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> fair results, and one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> poor result. Twenty-eight <b>cases</b> <b>had</b> no complications, one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> infection, and one <b>case</b> <b>had</b> implant failure. Conclusion: Modular radial head prosthesis can be used successfully for treatment of the Morrey Modified Masons type III and IV radial head fractures...|$|R
5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no <b>case</b> <b>has</b> previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>case</b> <b>has</b> {{not been}} {{formally}} overruled, two Supreme Court {{decisions in the}} 1970s and 1980s have undone its effect by ruling that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for a federal common law cause of action for recovering possession based on the common-law doctrine of aboriginal title. Moreover, the New York courts' interpretation of the Nonintercourse Act is no longer good law. Modern federal courts hold that only Congress can ratify a conveyance of aboriginal title, and only with a clear statement, rather than implicitly.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of the ruling {{in this case was}} that it tested the constitutionality of the Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations.
