40|$|Organizations need {{to improve}} their {{processes}} to continually achieve customer satisfaction and, {{to do that in}} an effective and efficient way, should use quality tools. The main objective of this research project is to improve the level of quality through the use of quality tools in a company in the installation phase. The PDCA cycle is applied as a methodology to trigger the use of quality tools in problems solving. It is also intended to verify the effectiveness of the PDCA cycle as a methodology for quality tools implementation. A case study was performed starting with the diagnosis of the quality management function, identifying the most critical processes. Subsequently, an analysis of the historical data of the company was made to detect problems and prioritize actions. After, the intervention focused on solving a specific process problem following the PDCA cycle and using quality tools in all its steps. The presented methodology can help companies to increase the use of quality tools which, according to recent study, continues to have little use. All tools have proved to be useful and effective. The application of the Taguchi method to determine the optimum combination of factors of a station (together with other improvement actions) caused a 50 % decrease of the most <b>critical</b> <b>defective</b> component and an overall reduction of 29 % in the level of nonconformities in the preparation section.

40|$|Patient {{satisfaction}} {{assessment is}} regarded as a major pointer {{of the quality of the}} pharmacy services patients received in the tertiary care hospitals Quetta. This study was set out to evaluate patient satisfaction with pharmaceutical services. The evaluation of various literatures supports the level of patient satisfaction in various studies. A <b>critical</b> but <b>defective</b> situation in healthcare is that patient satisfaction has not been taken seriously enough; patient satisfaction and patient trust demonstrate patient loyalty and satisfaction are directly linked to services, recommending the hospital and their willingness to pay the bill. A Cross sectional descriptive study led in tertiary care hospitals of Quetta to determine the patient satisfaction with pharmacist and pharmacy services. This study was done in different government hospitals in Quetta city of Pakistan. The prime results pf current study specified that persons with middle to low or no income were not pleased with pharmacy facilities. It designates that facilities related to exact medications, particularly their obtainability, information on side effects, storage, predictable consequences from the medicines and other were accountable for the lower level of satisfaction this was consistent with studies where they have similar response.

40|$|Objective: To {{highlight}} {{the importance of}} insulin-related medical errors in causing poor outcomes in a hos-pital setting and to propose a systems approach for improvement. Results: Evidence reported in the medical literature has identified insulin therapy errors as a large and clini-cally important problem. Insulin has been labeled {{as one of the}} top five “high-risk medications ” in the inpatient set-ting. Although insulin therapy can be lifesaving in the hos-pital setting, it can be life-threatening if used inappropri-ately. Widespread major systemic problems, such as heavy patient loads for physicians and nurses, absence of backup checks in <b>critical</b> areas, <b>defective</b> communication and coordination, illegible handwriting, and unawareness of the importance of blood glucose control, create obsta-cles to appropriate and safe care of patients receiving insulin in the hospital. With thorough analysis of the set-ting, additional training, collective establishment of goals focused on patient safety, insertion of backup checks in areas susceptible to errors, encouragement of sharing of key clinical information, and, where possible, implemen-tation of electronic medical records, systemic and knowl-edge-based problems will be minimized and outcomes will improve in insulin-treated hospitalized patients. Conclusion: Analysis and redesign of systems to develop a “culture of safety ” will ultimately reduce insulin-related medical errors, provide a safe inpatient environment, and yield better outcomes.

40|$|SummaryAutophagy is a homeostatic process {{involved}} in the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components, including damaged organelles and proteins. In both genetic and dietary models of obesity, we observed a severe downregulation of autophagy, particularly in Atg 7 expression levels in liver. Suppression of Atg 7 both in vitro and in vivo resulted in defective insulin signaling and elevated ER stress. In contrast, restoration of the Atg 7 expression in liver resulted in dampened ER stress, enhanced hepatic insulin action, and systemic glucose tolerance in obese mice. The beneficial action of Atg 7 restoration in obese mice could be completely prevented by blocking a downstream mediator, Atg 5, supporting its dependence on autophagy in regulating insulin action. Our data demonstrate that autophagy is an important regulator of organelle function and insulin signaling and that loss of autophagy is a <b>critical</b> component of <b>defective</b> insulin action seen in obesity...|$|R
50|$|GPR56 was {{the first}} {{adhesion}} GPCR causally linked to a disease. Loss-of-function mutations in GPR56 cause a severe cortical malformation known as bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). Investigating the pathological mechanism of disease-associated GPR56 mutations in BFPP has provided mechanistic insights into the functioning of adhesion GPCRs. Researchers demonstrated that disease-associated GPR56 mutations cause BFPP via multiple mechanisms. Li et al. demonstrated that GPR56 regulates pial basement membrane (BM) organization during cortical development. Disruption of the Gpr56 gene in mice leads to neuronal malformation in the cerebral cortex, which resulted in 4 <b>critical</b> pathological morphologies: <b>defective</b> pial BM, abnormal localized radial glial endfeet, malpositioned Cajal-Retzius cells, and overmigrated neurons. Furthermore, the interaction of GPR56 and collagen III inhibits neural migration to regulate lamination of the cerebral cortex. Next to GPR56, the α3β1 integrin is also involved in pial BM maintenance. Study from Itga3 (α3 integrin)/Gpr56 double knockout mice showed increased neuronal overmigration compared to Gpr56 single knockout mice, indicating cooperation of GPR56 and α3β1 integrin in modulation {{of the development of}} the cerebral cortex. More recently, the Walsh laboratory showed that alternative splicing of GPR56 regulates regional cerebral cortical patterning.|$|R
40|$|This {{study reveals}} a {{function}} of endogenous galectin- 3, an animal lectin recognizing β-galactosides, in regulating dendritic cell motility both in vitro and in vivo, which to our knowledge is unreported. First, galectin- 3 -deficient (gal 3 −/-) bone marrow-derived dendritic cells exhibited defective chemotaxis compared to gal 3 +/+ cells. Second, cutaneous dendritic cells in gal 3 −/- mice displayed reduced migration to draining lymph nodes upon hapten stimulation compared to gal 3 +/+ mice. Moreover, gal 3 −/- mice were impaired {{in the development of}} contact hypersensitivity relative to gal 3 +/+ mice in response to a hapten, a process in which dendritic cell trafficking to lymph nodes is <b>critical.</b> In addition, <b>defective</b> signaling was detected in gal 3 −/- cells upon chemokine receptor activation. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that galectin- 3 is localized in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in stimulated dendritic cells and macrophages. Furthermore, galectin- 3 was enriched in lipid raft domains under these conditions. Finally, we determined that ruffles on gal 3 −/- cells contained structures with lower complexity compared to gal 3 +/+ cells. In view of the participation of membrane ruffles in signal transduction and cell motility, we conclude that galectin- 3 regulates cell migration by functioning at these structures...|$|R
40|$|Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) {{originate}} in dorsal thalamus, extend ventrally along the lateral thalamic surface, {{and as they}} approach hypothalamus make a lateral turn into ventral telencephalon. In vitro studies show that hypothalamus releases a chemorepellent for TCAs, and analyses of knockout mice indicate that Slit chemorepellents and their receptor Robo 2 influence TCA pathfinding. We show that Slit chemorepellents are the hypothalamic chemorepellent and act through Robos to steer TCAs into ventral telencephalon. During TCA pathfinding, Slit 1 and Slit 2 are expressed in hypothalamus and ventral thalamus and Robo 1 and Robo 2 are expressed in dorsal thalamus. In collagen gel cocultures of dorsal thalamus and Slit 2 -expressing cells, axon number and length are decreased on the explant side facing Slit 2 -expressing cells, overall axon outgrowth is diminished, and axons {{turn away from the}} Slit 2 -expressing cells. Thus, Slit 2 is an inhibitor and chemorepellent for dorsal thalamic axons. Collagen gel cocultures of dorsal thalamus with sections of live diencephalon, with and without the hypothalamus portion overlaid with Robo 2 -fc-expressing cells to block Slit function, identify Slits as the hypothalamic chemorepellent. Thus, Slits are chemorepellents for TCAs endogenous to hypothalamus and steer TCAs from diencephalon into ventral telencephalon, a <b>critical</b> pathfinding event <b>defective</b> in Slit and Robo 2 mutant mice...|$|R

40|$|The {{neonatal}} {{intensive care}} unit {{is the site of}} some of the most dramatic technology, complex decision-making and costly activity in the current range of medical institutions. Thus, the decisions made there are particularly visible, and of concern to a society which has increasingly scrutinized and challenged medical practices. Questions of marginal utility and cost-benefit relationships are becoming increasingly prominent. These concerns are heightened by the social and political tensions over issues of the time of initiation of life, quality of life, and assurances of equity for those less well off or handicapped from birth. Robert Weir's book, Selective Nontreatment of Handicapped Newborns, successfully summarizes the current dilemmas and identifies areas of uncertainty and lack of knowledge which cloud the decision-making processes. The book reviews the positions of the major protagonists of the last several years; inevitably, their positions will undergo continuous evolution in response to new data and vigorous political and public policy activity. Weir appropriately identifies the difficulty in arriving at an accurate prognosis as an important and prominent problem in decision-making about defective newborns. The population of surviving, compromised newborns is relatively unfamiliar and their problems remain largely unstudied. Weir's discussion of the desirability of the establishment of Infant Care Review Committees in those institutions which care for defective and handicapped newborns thoughtfully concludes that such committees are, on the balance, desirable. As experience accumulates with Infant Care Review Committees, they should serve the positive purpose of generating open discussion of legitimate disagreements. These committees will provide a forum in which decision-makers can disclose uncertainty, consider alternatives, and receive counsel. To achieve this purpose, the committees must be appropriately structured, and explicitly defined as deliberative rather than judgmental in intent. Infant Care Review Committees should ideally serve the interests both of society and of medicine in reassuring the public that <b>critical</b> decisions about <b>defective</b> newborns are not made capriciously, and are not influenced by professional coercion or conspiracy. The increased visibility of the decision-making process may help to restore the eroding public confidence in the medical professions as well as to increase the level of knowledge among both professionals and lay people concerning the difficult choices faced in contemporary neonatal medicine. ...|$|R
