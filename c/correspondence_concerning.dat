5|$|As secretary, Calhoun had {{responsibility}} for management of Indian affairs. He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, {{to preserve the}} sovereignty of eastern Indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments. In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes. Calhoun opposed the invasion of Florida launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the First Seminole War, which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe. The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the Adams–Onís Treaty. A reform-minded modernizer, he attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in the Indian Department and in the Army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads, but Congress either {{failed to respond to}} his reforms or responded with hostility. Calhoun's frustration with congressional inaction, political rivalries, and ideological differences spurred him to create the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824. The responsibilities of the bureau were to manage treaty negotiations, schools, and trade with Indians, in addition to handling all expenditures and <b>correspondence</b> <b>concerning</b> Indian affairs. Thomas McKenney was appointed as the first head of the bureau.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, {{experts from}} the Library of Congress {{traveled}} to Moscow to copy previously secret archives of the CPUSA records, sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping by party organizers. The records provided an irrefutable link between Soviet intelligence and information obtained by the CPUSA and its contacts in the U.S. government from the 1920s through the 1940s. Some documents revealed that the CPUSA was actively involved in secretly recruiting party members from African-American groups and rural farm workers. Other CPUSA records contained further evidence that Soviet sympathizers had indeed infiltrated the State Department, beginning in the 1930s. Included in CPUSA archival records were confidential letters from two U.S. ambassadors in Europe to Roosevelt and a senior State Department official.

This was a feminist essay publication, written {{in the form of a}} debate i letters between two female signatures, in which she argued in favor of a social conscience, democracy and gender equality, and recommended [...] between women as a protection against male guardianship and superiority. She stated that the only way to reach true love within a relationship is to be equals, adding that as men so often want to rule over women, it is much harder to retain friendship with them than with another woman. She discussed love and friendship, upbringing and education, monarchy and religion. In February 1773, the essay was renamed Brefväxling emellan Adelaide och någre wittre snillen i omwäxlande ämnen (Correspondence between Adelaide and some literary geniuses in various subjects), and later that year Fortsättning af Adelaides brefwäxling, angående Fru Windhams historie (Adelaide's continuing <b>correspondence,</b> <b>concerning</b> the history of Mrs Windham).|$|E

60|$|Many {{things more}} might be {{observed}} on this curious head of our author's speculations. But, taking leave {{of what the}} writer says in his serious part, if he be serious in any part, I shall only just point {{out a piece of}} his pleasantry. No man, I believe, ever denied that the time for making peace is that in which the best terms maybe obtained. But what that time is, together with the use that has been made of it, we are to judge by seeing whether terms adequate to our advantages, and to our necessities, have been actually obtained. Here is the pinch of the question, to which the author ought to have set his shoulders in earnest. Instead of doing this, he slips out of the harness by a jest; and sneeringly tells us, that, to determine this point, we must know the secrets of the French and Spanish cabinets[55], and that Parliament was pleased to approve the treaty of peace without calling for the <b>correspondence</b> <b>concerning</b> it. How just this sarcasm on that Parliament may be, I say not; but how becoming in the author, I leave it to his friends to determine.|$|E

It is shown that simple two- or four-state turbo-SPC codes with multiple component codes can perform comparably as (or even better than) the 16 -state standard turbo codes. Using more complex trellis codes (with state number more than 4) appears unnecessary for such codes. Instead, performance improvement {{can be achieved by}} increasing the number of component codes, which maintains the low decoding complexity property of turbo-SPC codes.

6000|$|It was {{not without}} {{reference}} to Tito's appointed visit that the papers containing this correspondence were brought out to-day. Here was a new Greek scholar whose accomplishments were to be tested, and on nothing did Scala more desire a dispassionate opinion from persons of superior knowledge than on that Greek epigram of Politian's. After sufficient introductory talk concerning Tito's travels, after a survey and discussion of the gems, and an easy passage from {{the mention of the}} lamented Lorenzo's eagerness in collecting such specimens of ancient art to the subject of classical tastes and studies in general and their present condition in Florence, it was inevitable to mention Politian, a man of eminent ability indeed, but a little too arrogant--assuming to be a Hercules, whose office it was to destroy all the literary monstrosities of the age, and writing letters to his elders without signing them, as if they were miraculous revelations that could only have one source. And after all, were not his own criticisms often questionable and his tastes perverse? He was fond of saying pungent things about the men who thought they wrote like Cicero because they ended every sentence with [...] "esse videtur:" [...] but while he was boasting of his freedom from servile imitation, did he not fall into the other extreme, running after strange words and affected phrases? Even in his much-belauded `Miscellanea' was every point tenable? And Tito, who had just been looking into the `Miscellanea,' found so much to say that was agreeable to the secretary--he would have done so from the mere disposition to please, without further motive--that he showed himself quite worthy to be made a judge in the notable <b>correspondence</b> <b>concerning</b> the culex. Here was the Greek epigram which Politian had doubtless thought the finest in the world, though he had pretended to believe that the [...] "transmarini," [...] the Greeks themselves, would make light of it: had he not been unintentionally speaking the truth in his false modesty? ...|$|E

The demand, as {{expressed}} in the Minute of Consultation, and in the public instructions of the board to the Resident to make the requisition, is [...] "for such part of the cavalry entertained in his service as he can spare"; and the demand is in this and in no other manner described by the Governor-General and Council in their letter to the Court of Directors. But in a Narrative of the said Warren Hastings's, addressed to Edward Wheler, Esquire, it appears, that, upon the Rajah's making difficulties, according to {{the representation of the}} said Hastings, relative to the said requisition, the <b>correspondence</b> <b>concerning</b> which the said Hastings hath fraudulently suppressed, he, the said Hastings, instead of adhering to the requisition of such cavalry as the Rajah could spare, and which was all that by the order of Council he was authorized to make, did, of his own private and arbitrary authority, in some letter which he hath suppressed, instruct the Resident, Markham, to make a peremptory demand for two thousand cavalry, which he well knew to be more than the Rajah's finances could support, estimating the provision for the same at 96,000l. a year at the lowest, though the expense of the same would probably have been much more: which extravagant demand the said Hastings could only have made in hopes of provoking the Rajah to some imprudent measure or passionate remonstrance. And this arbitrary demand of cavalry was made, and peremptorily insisted on, although in the original treaty with the said Rajah it was left entirely optional whether or not he should keep up any cavalry at all, and in the Minute of Consultation it was expressly mentioned to be thus optional, and that for whatsoever cavalry he, the said Rajah, should furnish, he should be paid fifteen rupees per month for each private, and so in proportion for officers: yet the demand aforesaid was made without any offer whatsoever of providing the said payment according to treaty.|$|E

40|$|This <b>correspondence</b> <b>concerns</b> the {{estimation}} algorithm for hinging hyperplane (HH) models, a piecewise-linear model for approximating functions of several variables, suggested in Breiman (1993). The estimation algorithm is analyzed {{and it is}} shown {{that it is a}} special case of a Newton algorithm applied to a sum of squared error criterion. This insight is then used to suggest possible improvements of the algorithm so that convergence to a local minimum can be guaranteed. In addition, the way of updating the parameters in the HH model is discussed. In Breiman, a stepwise updating procedure is proposed where only a subset of the parameters are changed in each step. This connects closely to some previously suggested greedy algorithms and these greedy algorithms are discussed and compared to a simultaneous updating of all parameters...|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} of Curry, and also at {{the time of}} Howard, the proofs-as-programs <b>correspondence</b> <b>concerned</b> only intuitionistic logic, i.e. a logic in which, in particular, Peirce's law was not deducible.

The basic Curry-Howard-style correspondence for classical logic is given below. Note the correspondence between the double-negation translation used to map classical proofs to intuitionistic logic and the continuation-passing-style translation used to map lambda terms involving control to pure lambda terms. More particularly, call-by-name continuation-passing-style translations relates to Kolmogorov's double negation translation and call-by-value continuation-passing-style translations relates to a kind of double-negation translation due to Kuroda.|$|R
