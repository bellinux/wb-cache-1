25|$|For {{single-phase}} AC, if the transformer is <b>center-tapped,</b> {{then two}} diodes back-to-back (cathode-to-cathode or anode-to-anode, depending upon output polarity required) can form a full-wave rectifier.

[...] However, for most industrial and high-power applications, three-phase rectifier circuits are the norm.

50|$|Volts {{center tapped}} (VCT) {{describes}} the voltage output of a center tapped transformer. For example: A 24 VCT transformer will measure 24 VAC across the outer two taps (winding as a whole), and 12 VAC from each outer tap to the <b>center-tap</b> (half winding). These two 12 VAC supplies are 180 degrees {{out of phase}} with each other, thus {{making it easy to}} derive positive and negative 12 volt DC power supplies from them.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{solid state}} devices became available, the {{half-wave}} circuit, and the full-wave circuit using a <b>center-tapped</b> transformer, were very {{commonly used in}} industrial rectifiers using mercury-arc valves. [...] This was because the three or six AC supply inputs could be fed to a corresponding number of anode electrodes on a single tank, sharing a common cathode.|$|E
2500|$|For {{three-phase}} at utilization voltages a {{four-wire system}} {{is often used}}. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used {{so there is no}} need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single <b>center-tapped</b> transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local <b>center-tapped</b> transformer with a voltage of 55V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110V between the two conductors for running the tools.|$|E
2500|$|An {{aspect of}} most {{rectification}} {{is a loss}} from the peak input voltage to the peak output voltage, caused by the built-in voltage drop across the diodes (around 0.7 V for ordinary silicon p–n junction diodes and 0.3 V for Schottky diodes). Half-wave rectification and full-wave rectification using a <b>center-tapped</b> secondary produces a peak voltage loss of one diode drop. Bridge rectification has a loss of two diode drops. This reduces output voltage, and limits the available output voltage if a very low alternating voltage must be rectified. As the diodes do not conduct below this voltage, the circuit only passes current through {{for a portion of}} each half-cycle, causing short segments of zero voltage (where instantaneous input voltage is below one or two diode drops) to appear between each [...] "hump".|$|E

Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.|$|E

50|$|A voltage doubler uses {{two stages}} to {{approximately}} double the DC voltage {{that would have}} been obtained from a single-stage rectifier. An example of a voltage doubler is found in the input stage of switch mode power supplies containing a SPDT switch to select either 120 V or 240 V supply. In the 120 V position the input is typically configured as a full-wave voltage doubler by opening one AC connection point of a bridge rectifier, and connecting the input to the junction of two series-connected filter capacitors. For 240 V operation, the switch configures the system as a full-wave bridge, re-connecting the capacitor <b>center-tap</b> wire to the open AC terminal of a bridge rectifier system. This allows 120 or 240 V operation {{with the addition of a}} simple SPDT switch.|$|R

The paralleling stations thus reduce voltage drops by feeding a locomotive from both directions along its contact wire and spreading the load across all the contact and feed wires of a multitrack system. The split-phase arrangement also gains the increased efficiency of operating at 50 kV while the highest voltage with respect to ground remains only 25 kV.

The voltages between the three phases are the same in magnitude, however the voltage magnitudes between a particular phase and the neutral vary. The phase-to-neutral voltage of two of the phases will be half of the phase-to-phase voltage. The remaining phase-to-neutral voltage will be √3/2 the phase-to-phase voltage.
