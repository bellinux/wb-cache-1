40|$|We {{propose a}} method for the {{statistical}} analysis of fMRI data that tests <b>cluster</b> <b>units</b> rather than voxel units for activation. The advan-tages of this analysis over previous ones are both conceptual and sta-tistical. Recognizing that the fundamental units of interest are the spatially contiguous clusters of voxels that are activated together, {{we set out to}} approximate these <b>cluster</b> <b>units</b> from the data by a clustering algorithm especially tailored for fMRI data. Testing the <b>cluster</b> <b>units</b> has a two-fold statistical advantage over testing each voxel separately: the signal to noise ratio within the unit tested is higher, and the num-ber of hypotheses tests compared is smaller. We suggest controlling FDR on clusters, i. e. the proportion of clusters rejected erroneously out of all clusters rejected, and explain the meaning of controlling this error rate. We introduce the powerful adaptive procedure to control the FDR on clusters. We apply our cluster based analysis (CBA) to both an event-related and a block design fMRI vision experiment, and demonstrate its increased power over voxel-by-voxel analysis in these examples as well as in simulations...|$|R

40|$|The cluster {{approach}} {{is considered by}} the authors as the tool to ensure the accelerated development of the country’s industrial complex. In the article the authors examine the problem of forming {{the model of the}} cluster development in high-tech sectors of industry and the methods for evaluating its economic effectiveness. Unlike traditional approaches, the authors of the article identify a <b>cluster</b> <b>unit</b> as the main structural element of the development model of the innovative industrial cluster. They think that a <b>cluster</b> <b>unit</b> is one member of the cluster (i. e. one enterprise). This point of view is differed from modern scientists` opinion, who view a <b>cluster</b> <b>unit</b> as the complex of enterprises operating within cluster units. The {{purpose of the study was}} the development and the economic evaluation of the model of the cluster development. In this research the authors examined the cluster of industrial biotechnologies. They have developed and proposed the model of the development of the cluster of industrial biotechnologies: the Non-commercial partnership (NP) “The biotechnology cluster of the Kirov region”. This model takes into account the peculiarities of the innovative production. The authors have calculated the absolute and relative effect from clustering taking into account the effectiveness and profitability indicators of the cluster units activities within the cluster in question and the evaluation of the project activity of the cluster. Thus the authors have proved the economic effectiveness of the proposed model of the cluster development. The received research results allow us to conclude that the designed model of the development of the NP “The biotechnology cluster of the Kirov region” provides a steady growth trend of positive economic effect from the corporate activities of the enterprises within the cluster and increase in the region’s competitiveness in the production of high-tech industrial products...|$|E
