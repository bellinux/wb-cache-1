40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} {{correlation}} between monocular mild myopic juvenile myopia degree and dominant eye. METHODS: Totally 158 patients with juvenile monocularly mild myopia in our hospital from December 2012 to December 2013 were retrospectively analyzed, and cylindrical mirror astigmatism was used for spherical equivalent conversion. On {{the basis of the}} myopic degree, they were divided into three groups, 30 cases in group A(- 0. 25 ～- 0. 75 D), 92 cases in B group(- 1. 0 ～- 2. 0 D), 36 cases in group C(- 2. 25 ～- 3. 0 D). The <b>card</b> <b>hole</b> method was selected to measure dominant eye for subjectsat nearly 33 cm and 5 m. After glasses correction of ametropia, the far and near dominant eyes were received measurement again. RESULTS: The monocular mild myopia of dominant eye was compared with the non-dominant eye adjustment function, and there was no significant difference(P > 0. 05). The dominant eye, non-dominant eye mean diopter and other correlations of eyes in the three groups were compared, and there was no significant difference(P > 0. 05). The dominant eye of three groups at 5 m was compared, and there was significant difference(P P P P CONCLUSION: The formation of myopic anisometropia is related to the degree of clearly seeing objects, although glasses correction can improve the clarity and visual, but affect the choice of the dominant eye, because the myopic anisometropia appears most early in the dominant eye, therefore optician correction stage, which should be taken into consideration, and avoid the severity of the adolescent myopia...|$|E

50|$|The IBM 059 was the Verifier {{companion}} to the IBM 029 Card Punch. In design, it differed radically {{from the earlier}} 056 verifier, in that it used optical sensing of <b>card</b> <b>holes</b> instead of mechanical sensing pins. This made the 059 much quieter than the 056 (which was often louder than the 024 keypunch). The optical sensors used a single light source, which was distributed to various sites within the machine via fiber-optic lightpipes.

5000|$|In poker, an out is any unseen card in {{the deck}} that will give a player the best hand. A wrap is a {{straight}} draw with 9 or more outs.

In hold-em, where players have 2 <b>hole</b> <b>cards,</b> the most straight outs possible is 8.

2500|$|In most non-U.S. casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, {{meaning that}} the dealer does not draw nor consult his or her second card until after all players have {{finished}} making decisions.

In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called for. For instance, holding 11 against a dealer 10, the correct strategy is to double in a <b>hole</b> <b>card</b> game (where the player knows the dealer's second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no <b>hole</b> <b>card</b> game.

50|$|If {{the first}} or second card dealt is exposed, then this is {{considered}} a misdeal. The dealer then retrieves the card, reshuffles the deck, and again cuts the cards.

After completing the deal, the dealer replaces the exposed card with the top card on the deck, and the exposed card is then used as the burn card.
