5|$|Fraudulent {{accounting}} {{can arise}} {{from a variety}} of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior. This environment <b>could</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.|$|E
5|$|These SWNT forests (buckypaper) {{were grown}} by the super-growth CVD method to about 10 μm height. Two factors <b>could</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> strong light {{absorption}} by these structures: (i) a distribution of CNT chiralities resulted in various bandgaps for individual CNTs. Thus a compound material was formed with broadband absorption. (ii) Light might be trapped in those forests due to multiple reflections.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose {{a higher}} risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them <b>could</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E

5|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF), {{a progressive}} multi-system lung disease, {{has been considered}} {{in the search for}} a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific genemuch more likely to occur in Europeanscauses CF. This mutation in the CF-causing gene is not a factor in DPB, but a unique polymorphism (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation <b>could</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> DPB.|$|E

25|$|Tobacco smoking {{increases}} the risk of developing panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and panic attacks; smoking started in adolescence or early adulthood particularly increases this risk of developing panic disorder. While the mechanism of how smoking increases panic attacks is not fully understood, a few hypotheses have been derived. Smoking cigarettes may lead to panic attacks by causing changes in respiratory function (e.g. feeling short of breath). These respiratory changes in turn can lead to the formation of panic attacks, as respiratory symptoms are a prominent feature of panic. Respiratory abnormalities have been found in children with high levels of anxiety, which suggests that a person with these difficulties may be susceptible to panic attacks, and thus more likely to subsequently develop panic disorder. Nicotine, a stimulant, <b>could</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> panic attacks. However, nicotine withdrawal may also cause significant anxiety which <b>could</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> panic attacks.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the genetic and {{environmental}} influences underlying the relationship between dimensions of personality and school maladjustments among children and adolescents. In this study, participants were Japanese twins in grade 4 to 9, a total of 259 twin pairs. Results of bivariate genetic analyses found that patterns of school maladjustment varied by the dimension of personality. : (1) The relationship between Reward Dependence and signs of nonsocial behavior (e. g., withdrawal, avoid social situations) in school <b>could</b> be <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> additive genetic and non-shared environmental influences.

25|$|Paroxetine is {{the most}} potent SSRI drug available, but it is less {{selective}} for SERT than fluvoxamine and sertraline. Paroxetine also has weak NET inhibition which <b>could</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> its efficacy in depression, especially at higher doses. As demonstrated in table 2, paroxetine also inhibits the NOSs enzyme which could be the reason for its sexual dysfunction adverse effect, especially in men. Paroxetine shows the highest affinity for muscarinic receptors of all the SSRIs which results in weak anticholinergic activity and therefore undesirable adverse effects.|$|E
