5|$|Once {{the cargo}} is discharged, the crew begins to <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> holds. This is {{particularly}} important if the next cargo is of a different type. The immense size of cargo holds and the tendency of cargoes to be physically irritating add {{to the difficulty of}} cleaning the holds. When the holds are <b>clean,</b> <b>the</b> process of loading begins.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table. With this strategy, it may become necessary to <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 {{the stretch}} of canal from Abergarwed locks to Tyn-yr-Heol lock at Tonna was {{polluted}} when iron-bearing water began discharging from a mine adit of the Ynysarwed coal mine. This turned the water orange, and deposited ferruginous sediment along the canal. A treatment plant and reedbeds were installed to <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> mine water, and this £1.6million project was commissioned in 1999.|$|E

In April 2008 the widow of Shelathia Harvey also sued Stokes, as well as Savannah Foods. It was a wholly owned subsidiary after Imperial bought them out and the factory was still owned in its name. In August, 2008 Malcolm Frazier succumbed to his injuries, bringing {{the total number of}} deaths to fourteen. Frazier, who suffered burns over 85% percent of his body, died at the Joseph M. Still Burn Center, where he had remained since the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Juvenile Caribbean reef {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks {{such as the}} tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the bull shark (C. leucas). Few parasites are known for this species; one is a dark {{variegated}} leech often seen trailing from its first dorsal fin. Off northern Brazil, juveniles seek out cleaning stations occupied by yellownose gobies (Elacatinus randalli), which <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> sharks of parasites while they lie still on the bottom. Horse-eye jacks (Caranx latus) and bar jacks (Carangoides ruber) routinely school around Caribbean reef sharks.|$|E
5|$|SBASE, {{along with}} the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, have adopted a zero {{tolerance}} policy on graffiti in the Buenos Aires Underground, imposing fines ranging from AR$400–6000 and up to 30 days community service, the culprits often being made to <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> cars they vandalised. Increased vigilance from over 500 police officers, as well as close to 300 CCTV cameras, have aided in decreasing new acts of vandalism by 85% in 2014, with a further decrease of 50% in 2015 after security was intensified.|$|E

It took workers several days to <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> buildings and remove all of the loose shards of glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E

Members of the SS censored the outgoing mail.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a {{water-repellent}} film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> wings. It {{has been found that}} bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled, rather their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.|$|E
5|$|This growth {{spurred the}} {{reorganisation}} of {{the governance of}} the town. Prior to 1818, the town was run by a mixture of bodies. The Sheffield Town Trust and the Church Burgesses, for example, divided responsibility {{for the improvement of}} streets and bridges. By the 19th century both organisations lacked funds and struggled even to maintain existing infrastructure. The Church Burgesses organised a public meeting on 27 May 1805 and proposed to apply to Parliament for an act to pave, light and <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> city's streets. The proposal was defeated.|$|E

5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans the cubs, and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps <b>clean.</b> <b>The</b> cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six to eight months of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|As far as {{possible}} elderly inmates were expected to undertake {{the same kind of}} work as the younger men and women, although concessions were made to their relative frailty. They might alternatively be required to chop firewood, <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> wards, or carry out other domestic tasks. In 1882 Lady Brabazon, later the Countess of Meath, set up a project to provide alternative occupation for non-able-bodied inmates, known as the Brabazon scheme. Volunteers provided training in crafts such as knitting, embroidery and lace making, all costs initially being borne by Lady Brabazon herself. Although slow to take off, when workhouses discovered that the goods being produced were saleable and could make the enterprise self-financing, the scheme gradually spread across the country, and by 1897 there were more than 100 branches.|$|E

5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century {{there were a number of}} unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.|$|E
