25|$|By {{treating}} the fingerprint with gold nanoparticles with attached <b>cotinine</b> antibodies, and then subsequently with a fluorescent agent attached to <b>cotinine</b> antibodies, the fingerprint of a smoker becomes fluorescent; non-smokers' fingerprints stay dark.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown a {{positive}} relationship between psychological distress and salivary <b>cotinine</b> levels in smoking and non-smoking adults, indicating that both firsthand and secondhand smoke exposure may lead to higher levels of mental stress.|$|E
25|$|The secretions, skin {{oils and}} dead cells {{in a human}} {{fingerprint}} contain residues of various chemicals and their metabolites present in the body. These can be detected and used for forensic purposes. For example, the fingerprints of tobacco smokers contain traces of <b>cotinine,</b> a nicotine metabolite; they also contain traces of nicotine itself. Caution should be used, as its presence {{may be caused by}} mere contact of the finger with a tobacco product.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cotinine</b> has an in vivo {{half-life}} {{of approximately}} 20 hours, and is typically detectable {{for several days}} (up to one week) after the use of tobacco. The level of <b>cotinine</b> in the blood, saliva, and urine is proportionate {{to the amount of}} exposure to tobacco smoke, so it is a valuable indicator of tobacco smoke exposure, including secondary (passive) smoke. People who smoke menthol cigarettes may retain <b>cotinine</b> in the blood for a longer period because menthol can compete with enzymatic metabolism of <b>cotinine.</b> African American smokers generally have higher plasma <b>cotinine</b> levels than Caucasian smokers. Males generally have higher plasma <b>cotinine</b> levels than females. These systematic differences in <b>cotinine</b> levels were attributed to variation in CYP2A6 activity. [...] At steady state, plasma <b>cotinine</b> levels are determined by the amount of <b>cotinine</b> formation and the rate of <b>cotinine</b> removal, which are both mediated by the enzyme CYP2A6. [...] Since CYP2A6 activity differs by sex (estrogen induces CYP2A6) and race (due to genetic variation), <b>cotinine</b> accumulates in individuals with slower CYP2A6 activity, resulting in substantial differences in <b>cotinine</b> levels for a given tobacco exposure.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{tests can}} detect <b>cotinine</b> in the blood, urine, or saliva. Salivary <b>cotinine</b> {{concentrations}} are highly correlated to blood <b>cotinine</b> concentrations, and can detect <b>cotinine</b> {{in a low}} range, making it the preferable option for a less invasive method of tobacco exposure testing. Urine <b>cotinine</b> concentrations average four to six times higher than those in blood or saliva, making urine a more sensitive matrix to detect low-concentration exposure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cotinine</b> is an {{alkaloid}} {{found in}} tobacco {{and is also}} the predominant metabolite of nicotine. <b>Cotinine</b> {{is used as a}} biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke. <b>Cotinine</b> is currently being studied as a treatment for depression, PTSD, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. <b>Cotinine</b> was developed as an antidepressant as a fumaric acid salt, <b>cotinine</b> fumarate, to be sold under the brand name Scotine but it was never marketed.|$|E
5000|$|Cotinine: A {{metabolite}} of nicotine, <b>cotinine</b> {{is present}} in smokers. Like carbon monoxide, a <b>cotinine</b> test {{can serve as a}} reliable biomarker to determine smoking status. <b>Cotinine</b> levels can be tested through urine, saliva, blood, or hair samples, with one of the main concerns of <b>cotinine</b> testing being the invasiveness of typical sampling methods.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cotinine,</b> the {{metabolite}} of nicotine, is a biomarker of second-hand smoke exposure. Typically, <b>cotinine</b> {{is measured}} in the blood, saliva, and urine. Hair analysis has recently become a new, noninvasive measurement technique. <b>Cotinine</b> accumulates in hair during hair growth, which results in a measure of long-term, cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke. [...] Urinary <b>cotinine</b> levels have been a reliable biomarker of tobacco exposure and {{have been used as}} a reference in many epidemiological studies. However, <b>cotinine</b> levels found in the urine only reflect exposure over the preceding 48 hours. <b>Cotinine</b> levels of the skin, such as the hair and nails, reflect tobacco exposure over the previous three months and are a more reliable biomarker.|$|E
50|$|Research into nicotine's most {{predominant}} metabolite, <b>cotinine,</b> {{suggests that}} some of nicotine's psychoactive effects are mediated by <b>cotinine.</b>|$|E
50|$|By {{treating}} the fingerprint with gold nanoparticles with attached <b>cotinine</b> antibodies, and then subsequently with a fluorescent agent attached to <b>cotinine</b> antibodies, the fingerprint of a smoker becomes fluorescent; non-smokers' fingerprints stay dark.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>cotinine</b> is {{the main}} {{metabolite}} to nicotine and {{has been shown to}} be pharmacologically active, it has been suggested that some of nicotine's effects in the nervous system may be mediated by <b>cotinine</b> and/or complex interactions with nicotine itself.|$|E
50|$|However, {{nicotine}} replacement therapies (i.e., gum, lozenge, patch, inhaler, and nasal spray) {{used to help}} tobacco users quit contain nicotine. Use {{of nicotine}} replacement therapy {{will result in a}} positive test for <b>cotinine.</b> Therefore, the presence of <b>cotinine</b> is not a conclusive indication of tobacco use. <b>Cotinine</b> levels can be used in research to explore the vexed question of the amount of nicotine delivered to the user of e-cigarettes, where laboratory smoking machines have many problems replicating real-life conditions.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to nicotine, <b>cotinine</b> binds to, activates, and desensitizes {{neuronal}} nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, {{though at}} much lower potency in comparison. It has demonstrated nootropic and antipsychotic-like effects in animal models. <b>Cotinine</b> treatment {{has also been}} shown to reduce depression, anxiety, and fear-related behavior as well as memory impairment in animal models of depression, PTSD, and Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, treatment with <b>cotinine</b> in humans was reported to have no significant physiologic, subjective, or performance effects in one study, though others suggest that {{this may not be the}} case.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cotinine,</b> a {{substance}} found in tobacco {{and also a}} metabolite of nicotine ...|$|E
50|$|Nico-N was {{developed}} by South Korean scientist and professor Hyun-Won Kim of the University of Yonsei’s College of Medicine.Nico-N ingredients include Chinese quince, dried orange peel, mulberry leaf, green tea, ginkgo nut, liquorice root, apple, platycodon, lemon, celery and Chinese matrimony vine. Nico-N was treated {{in the form of}} chewing gum to 36 healthy male smokers with at least 2 years of smoking history. Urine analysis showed that <b>cotinine</b> concentration of smokers treated with Nico-N increased dose dependently compared to the non-treated control group. <b>Cotinine,</b> a nontoxic metabolite of nicotine, could be removed from the body in urine. Increase of the <b>cotinine</b> production from the smokers treated with Nico-N indicates the detoxification effect of Nico-N against nicotine.|$|E
50|$|Increased {{nicotine}} or <b>cotinine</b> (the nicotine metabolite) {{is detected}} in urine or blood, or serum nicotine concentrations increase.|$|E
50|$|Peak plasma {{levels of}} {{nicotine}} occur 2-10 min after smoking tobacco. Nicotine undergoes a large first-pass effect {{during which the}} liver metabolizes 80-90%. Protein binding ranges from 4.9% to 20%. The apparent volume of distribution varies between 1 and 3 l/kg. The metabolites include isomethylnicotinium ion, nornicotine, <b>cotinine,</b> and nicotine-1-N-oxide. Nicotine passes into breast milk in small quantities. In addition to nicotine, tobacco smoke contains small amounts of the alkaloids anatabine, anabasine, nornicotine, N-methylanabasine, anabaseine, nicotine N'-oxide, myosmine, β-nicotyrine, <b>cotinine,</b> and 2,3'-bipyridyl.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cotinine</b> levels <10 ng/mL are {{considered}} to be consistent with no active smoking. Values of 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL are associated with light smoking or moderate passive exposure, and levels above 300 ng/mL are seen in heavy smokers - more than 20 cigarettes a day. In urine, values between 11 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated with light smoking or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 500 ng/mL or more. In saliva, values between 1 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated with light smoking or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 100 ng/mL or more. [...] <b>Cotinine</b> assays provide an objective quantitative measure that is more reliable than smoking histories or counting the number of cigarettes smoked per day. <b>Cotinine</b> also permits the measurement of exposure to second-hand smoke (passive smoking).|$|E
50|$|Glucuronidation and {{oxidative}} metabolism of nicotine to <b>cotinine</b> are both inhibited by menthol, an additive to mentholated cigarettes, thus increasing the half-life of nicotine in vivo.|$|E
50|$|Nicotine has a {{half-life}} of 1-2 hours. <b>Cotinine</b> is {{an active}} metabolite of nicotine that remains in the blood with a half-life of 18-20 hours, {{making it easier to}} analyze.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown a {{positive}} relationship between psychological distress and salivary <b>cotinine</b> levels in smoking and non-smoking adults, indicating that both firsthand and secondhand smoke exposure may lead to higher levels of mental stress.|$|E
50|$|Workers roll {{an average}} of 500-1000 beedies per day, {{handling}} 225 - 450 g of tobacco flake. Studies have shown that <b>cotinine</b> levels in the bodily fluids of beedi workers are elevated even among {{those who do not}} use tobacco.|$|E
50|$|Pyridine {{alkaloids}} {{are present}} in tobacco as free bases and salts. Nicotine accounts for 90-95% of the plant's pyridines with Nornicotine and anatabine accounting for roughly 2.5% each. Pyridyl functional groups present in minute amounts include anabasine, myosmine, <b>cotinine</b> and 2, 3′-bipyridyl.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>cotinine</b> {{in the waters}} of Fishing Creek was measured eight times in 2008 and 2009. All of these times, the concentration was less than 26 nanograms per liter. The {{concentration of}} diltiazem was also measured eight times in 2008 and 2009.|$|E
50|$|Nicotine is metabolized in {{the liver}} by {{cytochrome}} P450 enzymes (mostly CYP2A6, and also by CYP2B6) and FMO3, which selectively metabolizes (S)-nicotine. A major metabolite is <b>cotinine.</b> Other primary metabolites include nicotine N-oxide, nornicotine, nicotine isomethonium ion, 2-hydroxynicotine and nicotine glucuronide. Under some conditions, other substances may be formed such as myosmine.|$|E
50|$|While both {{measures}} offer high {{sensitivity and}} specificity, they differ in usage method and cost. As an example, breath CO monitoring is non-invasive, while <b>cotinine</b> testing {{relies on a}} bodily fluid. These two methods can be used either alone or together, for example, {{in a situation where}} abstinence verification needs additional confirmation.|$|E
50|$|The {{relative}} risk {{of cardiovascular disease}} is 1.2-1.3 with exposure to sidestream smoke due the cyanide present in the smoke. There is also evidence that sidestream smoke causes negative effects in children, both behaviorally and cognitively. One study found that higher levels of <b>cotinine</b> in children were correlated with a decreased ability to perform in reading and math.|$|E
50|$|Because casinos tend {{to allow}} smoking on the {{gambling}} floor, American croupiers {{are exposed to}} secondhand smoke. A health hazard evaluation of several Las Vegas casinos showed that nonsmoker croupiers suffered from more respiratory ailments than their administrative counterparts at the casinos and had <b>cotinine</b> and NNAL (both components of secondhand smoke) in their urine samples. Britain banned smoking in all public places, including casinos, in 2007.|$|E
50|$|The secretions, skin {{oils and}} dead cells {{in a human}} {{fingerprint}} contain residues of various chemicals and their metabolites present in the body. These can be detected and used for forensic purposes. For example, the fingerprints of tobacco smokers contain traces of <b>cotinine,</b> a nicotine metabolite; they also contain traces of nicotine itself. Caution should be used, as its presence {{may be caused by}} mere contact of the finger with a tobacco product.|$|E
50|$|Since nicotine-containing e-liquids {{are made}} from tobacco they may contain {{impurities}} like <b>cotinine,</b> anabasine, anatabine, myosmine and beta-nicotyrine. The majority of e-cigarettes evaluated included carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs); heavy metals such as cadmium, nickel, and lead; and the carcinogen toluene. However, in comparison to traditional cigarette smoke, the toxic substance levels identified in e-cigarette vapor were 9- to 450-fold less. E-liquid with tin was cytotoxic. E-cigarettes cannot be considered absolutely safe {{because there is no}} safe level for carcinogens.|$|E
50|$|Nicotine can be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or to facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Urinary or salivary <b>cotinine</b> concentrations are frequently measured {{for the purposes of}} pre-employment and health insurance medical screening programs. Careful interpretation of results is important, since passive exposure to cigarette smoke can result in significant accumulation of nicotine, followed by the appearance of its metabolites in various body fluids. Nicotine use is not regulated in competitive sports programs.|$|E
50|$|E-cigarettes provide {{nicotine}} to {{the blood}} quicker than nicotine inhalers. The levels were above that of nicotine replacement product users. E-cigarettes {{seem to have a}} pharmacokinetic nicotine profile closer to nicotine replacement products than with traditional cigarettes. How efficiently different e-cigarettes give nicotine is unclear. Serum <b>cotinine</b> levels are comparable to that of traditional cigarettes, but are inharmonious and rely upon the user and the device. Blood nicotine levels raised more gradually and took more time to get to peak concentration with e-cigarettes than with traditional cigarettes.|$|E
50|$|Cytochrome P450 2A6 (abbreviated CYP2A6) is {{a member}} of the {{cytochrome}} P450 mixed-function oxidase system, which is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body. CYP2A6 is the primary enzyme responsible for the oxidation of nicotine and <b>cotinine.</b> It is also involved in the metabolism of several pharmaceuticals, carcinogens, and a number of coumarin-type alkaloids. CYP2A6 is the only enzyme in the human body that appreciably catalyzes the 7-hydroxylation of coumarin, such that the formation of the product of this reaction, 7-hydroxycoumarin, is used as a probe for CYP2A6 activity.|$|E
5000|$|E-cigarettes used in indoor environments can {{put at risk}} nonsmokers to {{elevated}} levels of nicotine and aerosol emissions. Nonsmokers exposed to e-cigarette aerosol produced by a machine and pumped into a room {{were found to have}} detectable levels of the nicotine metabolite <b>cotinine</b> in their blood. The same study stated that 80% of nicotine is normally absorbed by the user, so these results may be higher than in actual second hand exposure. In 2015 a report commissioned by Public Health England concluded that e-cigarettes [...] "release negligible levels of nicotine into ambient air with no identified health risks to bystanders".|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{tobacco smoke}} can be {{evaluated}} either by directly measuring tobacco smoke pollutants {{found in the}} air or by using biomarkers, an indirect measure of exposure. Carbon monoxide monitored through breath, nicotine, <b>cotinine,</b> thiocyanates, and proteins are the most specific biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure. Biochemical tests are a much more reliable biomarker of second-hand smoke exposure than surveys. Certain groups of people are reluctant to disclose their smoking status and exposure to tobacco smoke, especially pregnant women and parents of young children. This is due to their smoking being socially unacceptable. Also, {{it may be difficult}} for individuals to recall their exposure to tobacco smoke.|$|E
50|$|Secondhand {{smoke is}} {{a major cause of}} disease and {{premature}} death, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems in nonsmoking adults. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, there is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure. Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and are more susceptible to respiratory infections, asthma, and ear infections. One study showed that children who live in homes in which no one smokes inside have a 45% increase in <b>cotinine</b> levels if they live in multi-unit housing compared with detached homes, due to seepage through walls and shared ventilation systems.|$|E
