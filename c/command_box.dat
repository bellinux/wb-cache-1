30|$|Our {{proposed}} two-axis sun-tracking algorithm works {{based on}} calculations of the incidence angle according to date, time, and geographical position of panel (which means latitude, longitude, and zenith. The sun-tracking system (shown in Fig.  7) {{is set to}} start working at sunrise by a 24 -hour timer. According to different reasons in defined and predetermined time, the <b>command</b> <b>box</b> starts working {{and based on the}} specified time, enables the motor and other components of the system to move. Thus, by rotating the main shaft which is done by an electromotor force, ratchet shaft will also revolve from east to west. In this status, two contrived gears on top of the ratchet shaft are unitized separately that will cause the panel moving from up to down and vice versa. Therefore the panel moves in two axes from east to west and up to down and vice versa. According to the calculated time and order of the <b>command</b> <b>box,</b> the panel moves towards the sun during the day. At the end of the day, using the contrived buttons while finishing the task of the system and pushing keys, the device will automatically turn to its initial dawn position and make it ready to work for the next day. Note that this system is able to rotate the panel 180 ° from sunrise to sunset (from east to west) during the day and 90 ° from morning to noon (from down to up) and 90 ° from noon to evening (from up to down) to move it completely towards the sun so that can make the panel benefit maximum form the incidence time of sunlight.|$|E
5000|$|Neuer {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a [...] "complete" [...] and modern goalkeeper. He has earned critical acclaim from former players and pundits for his speed, stamina, composure, concentration, mentality as well being able to adapt to any given situation on the pitch. He is particularly known for his exceptional reflexes, ball control and footwork, when the situation demands he will often fill the role of a sweeper when opposing players have beaten the offside trap or his team's defensive line. Although at times he has been criticised for his positioning and not being particularly adept at one-on-one situations, Neuer compensates this by possessing accurate distribution of the ball due to his strength in launching swift counter-attacks from the back with his long throwing range and his ability to read the game and anticipate crosses. He also excels in organising his team's defences and despite not being an accurate penalty-specialist <b>commands</b> his <b>box</b> well.|$|R
5000|$|Tyson's first nationally {{televised}} bout {{took place on}} February 16, 1986, at Houston Field House in Troy, New York against journeyman heavyweight Jesse Ferguson. Tyson knocked down Ferguson with an uppercut in the fifth round that broke Ferguson's nose. During the sixth round, Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to obey his <b>commands</b> to <b>box,</b> the referee finally stopped the fight near {{the middle of the}} sixth round. The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification (DQ) of his opponent. The ruling was [...] "adjusted" [...] to a win by technical knockout (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result. The rationale offered for the revised outcome was that the fight was actually stopped because Ferguson could not (rather than would not) continue boxing.|$|R
40|$|Two {{full scale}} mockups of the Centaur upper stage were designed, {{fabricated}} and delivered to NASA.

The Centaur upper stage booster is designed to carry the spacecraft Galileo to Jupiter, and the spacecraft Ulysses to an orbit around the Sun after launch from the Space Shuttle. The flight vehicle has several Extravehicular Activity (EVA) contingency tasks that require crew training. This need for crew training generated the requirement for the Centaur WETF crew trainer, which is high fidelity in areas of expected crew interface. During the production of the Centaur WETF crew trainer, the need for a jumper cable from Centaur to the Orbiter was identified. This EVA contingency task would be the installation of a cable from the Orbiter cargo bay sill to various <b>command</b> data <b>boxes</b> on Centaur to allow crew control deployment should a failure occur. This task required the upgrading of volumetric boxes on the trainer to a high fidelity configuration including electrical connector installation and cable routing...|$|R
5000|$|Knightsbridge was {{the name}} given to a static base or [...] "box" [...] {{established}} around a junction of tracks some 20 km east of Tobruk and 16 km south of Acroma.

Knightsbridge was therefore a key position and the heavy armoured battles which started in late May 1942 pivoted on this position, with fierce fighting throughout this area. A battlefield cemetery was created in all of these area to bury the Commonwealth troops killed in these actions.|$|R
50|$|Many {{aspects of}} the game were {{designed}} to improve playability, especially for non-hardcore war gamers. For instance, the game used small icons of men or tanks to indicate unit types, instead of the more opaque NATO unit markers that are commonly used in the wargame field. On the Macintosh platform, existing UI guidelines were used for all operations. The game eschewed the traditional highly-modal interfaces of most games, using Mac menus, mouse <b>commands</b> and dialogs <b>boxes</b> for most interaction. For instance, giving commands to a unit to move was handled simply by clicking on the unit and then dragging it to the desired location, stacks of units could be moved with a shift-drag. This UI element has since become common.|$|R
50|$|The game {{starts with}} a drop into the {{building}} from a hang glider. Then, while watching out for pumas and guards, the player has to search through the <b>command</b> center for <b>boxes</b> of supplies. Some of the boxes contain one of 14 pieces of punched tape, which on all but the first level must be collected and taken to the computer terminal. Once this has been achieved, the player must {{make their way to}} the bottom centre of the underground caves, and escape using the motorcycle which can be found there. In all, the site covers over 700 computer screens. There are nine missions of increasing difficulty level (codenamed Rin, Kyo, Toh, Sha, Kai, Jin, Retsu, Zai and Zen), each with more objectives (such as collecting more pieces of punched tape, or having to disable an electrified perimeter fence protecting the tunnel).|$|R

5000|$|Kaufering {{station was}} opened on 1 November 1872 with the {{completion}} of the Buchloe-Kaufering-Landsberg railway. The line from Munich to Buchloe was opened on 1 May 1873. The Lechfeld Railway via Bobingen to Augsburg was opened on 15 May 1877. Kaufering was now a railway junction. On 5 April 1893, signalling at the station was centralised, which meant that the levers for setting the switches and signals were brought together on a single a lever frame. A <b>command</b> signal <b>box</b> was installed in the station building; this was operated by the dispatcher and two other signalmen. The station was rebuilt in 1906 as part of the duplication of the Munich-Buchloe line and it received a pedestrian subway and platform canopies; a warming-up shed for locomotives and a waterworks were built. In World War II, the volume of traffic increased at the station because there was a munitions factory {{in the vicinity of the}} station. An air-raid shelter was built in 1944. The transport of all munitions and the concentration camp prisoners, who were forced to build the shelter, passed through Kaufering station. As a result, the station's network of tracks developed during the war and Kaufering now had 15 tracks. On 27 June 1979, the mechanical interlocking was replaced by a push button interlocking. The old waterworks was demolished in 1981. The extension of the platform tunnels to the south to the new park-and-ride facility was completed in 1997.|$|R
40|$|Web {{structure}} mining in static web contents {{decreases the}} accuracy of mined outcomes and affects the quality of decision making activity. By structure mining in web hidden data, the accuracy ratio of mined outcomes can be improved, thus enhancing the reliability and quality of decision making activity. Data Mining is an automated or semi automated exploration and analysis of large volume of data in order to reveal meaningful patterns. The term web mining is the discovery and analysis of useful information from World Wide Web that helps web search engines to find high quality web pages and enhances web click stream analysis. One branch of web mining is web structure mining. The goal {{of which is to}} generate structural summary about the Web site and Web pages. Web structure mining tries to discover the link structure of the hyperlinks at the inter-document level. In recent years, Web link structure mining has been widely used to infer important information about Web pages. But {{a major part of the}} web is in hidden form, also called Deep Web or Hidden Web that refers to documents on the Web that are dynamic and not accessible by general search engines; most search engine spiders can access only publicly index able Web (or the visible Web). Most documents in the hidden Web, including pages hidden behind search forms, specialized databases, and dynamically generated Web pages, are not accessible by general Web mining applications. Dynamic content generation is used in modern web pages and user forms are used to get information from a particular user and stored in a database. The link structure lying in these forms can not be accessed during conventional mining procedures. To access these links, user forms are filled automatically by using a rule based framework which has robust ability to read a web page containing dynamic contents as activeX controls like input <b>boxes,</b> <b>command</b> buttons, combo <b>boxes,</b> etc. After reading these controls dummy values are filled in the available fields and the doGet or doPost methods are automatically executed to acquire the link of next subsequent web page. The accuracy ratio of web page hierarchical structures can phenomenally be improved by including these hidden web pages in the process of Web structure mining. The designed system framework is adequately strong to process the dynamic Web pages along with static ones...|$|R
