5|$|Aspects of Jackson's {{personal}} life, {{including his}} changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, {{he was accused}} of <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity, with earnings of $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication. Jackson is also remembered for his generous philanthropy and his pioneering efforts in charitable fundraising within the entertainment industry. In October 2017, Forbes announced that Jackson had topped the publication's list of top-earning dead celebrities for the fifth straight year with annual earnings of $75 million.|$|E

According to Taraborrelli, the assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed ten-year-old. Some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that Jackson also had body dysmorphic disorder, a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how his or her physical appearance is perceived by others.|$|E

5|$|The Cartman {{drug market}} subplot was heavily {{influenced}} by the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman resembling fictional drug lord Tony Montana and KFC founder Colonel Sanders as antagonist Alejandro Sosa.

Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E
5|$|Following the Stonewall riots, lesbian {{themes in}} {{literature}} {{became much more}} diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as The Furies, and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian. Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values {{are evident in the}} writings of Dorothy Allison, who focuses on <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> and deliberately provocative lesbian sadomasochism themes.|$|E
5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E

5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse.</b> While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little or nothing to do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. The government itself was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E

He continued with his themes concerning <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making a clear distinction between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E
