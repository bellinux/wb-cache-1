25|$|Studies in {{controlled}} environments on {{the giant}} trevally's feeding strategies have found hunting in schools increases their <b>capture</b> <b>efficiency,</b> {{but is not}} necessary for an individual's survival. When a school is formed during feeding, one individual will take a leading position, with others trailing behind it. Several individuals will attack the prey school, striking and stunning the prey, with the leading individual generally being more successful. Some individuals act individually and opportunistically within the school {{if one of the}} prey fish becomes isolated, with the main advantage of schooling appearing to be the ability to further break up and isolate prey schools. The only time hunting in schools is a disadvantage is when only isolated prey are present, such as close to a reef; here, an individual hunter has a greater probability of capturing it than if a group is present. Another hunting strategy of the giant trevally is to 'escort' monk seals, a behavior which has been observed near the Hawaiian Islands. The trevally swim close by the seal, and when the seal stops to forage, the trevally positions its mouth inches away from the seal. If a prey item is disturbed, the trevally will attempt to steal the prey from the seal, which routinely does occur. The seal does not appear to gain any benefit from this relationship, and it is thought juvenile seals being followed in this way may be outcompeted by the larger fish. A similar strategy has been employed by fish in the presence of large reef sharks, as they use the larger animal as a tool to ambush prey. The opportunistic nature of giant trevally has also been made evident by studies on the mortality rate of undersized or egg-bearing lobsters released from traps at the water's surface of the Hawaiian Islands. The fish are efficient predators of these crustaceans, with individuals often seizing a lobster before it could sink to the seafloor after being released, or attacking before the lobster moves into a defensive position. Some bolder, large individuals are even known to eat the lobster head first when its in a defensive stance.|$|E

At Itirapina, São Paulo, 1262 amphibians and reptiles were obtained in 72 pitfalls (100 L, with drift fence) during six months (<b>capture</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of 11, 9 amphibians and reptiles/pitfall/month and 0, 38 snake/pitfall/month). At Rio Pitinga, Amazonas, over 600 amphibians and reptiles were caught in 50 pitfalls (100 - 150 L, with drift fence) during three months (<b>capture</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of ca. 4. 00 amphibians and reptiles/pitfall/month and 0. 87 snake/pitfall/month). <b>Capture</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of 1. 25 to ~ 3. 92 amphibians and reptiles/pitfall/month were obtained in four other unpublished studies made by other authors in Brazil, all of them using 20 - 35 L traps, either with or without drift fences.

40|$|The recent {{episodes of}} haze in Southeast Asia have caused {{some of the}} worst {{regional}} atmospheric pollution ever recorded in history. In order to control the levels of airborne fine particulate matters (PM) indoors, filtration systems providing high PM <b>capturing</b> <b>efficiency</b> are often sought, which inadvertently also results in high airflow resistance (or pressure drop) that increases the energy consumption for air distribution. A pre-conditioning mechanism promoting the formation of particle clusters to enhance PM <b>capturing</b> <b>efficiency</b> without adding flow resistance in the air distribution ductwork could provide an energy-efficient solution. This pre-conditioning mechanism can be fulfilled by acoustic agglomeration, which is a phenomenon that promotes the coagulation of suspended particles by acoustic waves propagating in the fluid medium. This paper discusses the basic mechanisms of acoustic agglomeration along with influencing factors that could affect the agglomeration efficiency. The feasibility to apply acoustic agglomeration to improve filtration in air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems is investigated experimentally in a small-scale wind tunnel. Experimental results indicate that this novel application of acoustic pre-conditioning improves the PM 2. 5 filtration efficiency of the test filters by up to 10 % without introducing additional pressure drop. The fan energy savings from not having to switch to a high <b>capturing</b> <b>efficiency</b> filter largely outstrip the additional energy consumed by the acoustics system.

The collision rates between these fractal aggregates (200 - 1000 μm) and small (1. 48 μm) particles were measured for individual aggregates that had settled through a {{suspension of the}} small particles. Aggregate permeabilities calculated from measured settling velocities were 3 orders of magnitude greater than predicted by a permeability model based on a homogeneous distribution of primary particles within the aggregates. Collision frequencies were 1 order of magnitude higher than predicted by a curvilinear model and about 2 orders of magnitude lower than predicted by a rectilinear collision model. The <b>capture</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of small particles by settling aggregates were < 0. 2 % based on the total volume of water swept out by an aggregate. Fluid collection efficiencies, collision frequencies, and particle <b>capture</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the fractal aggregates decreased with the magnitude of fractal dimensions. A fractal permeability model was developed by modifying the Brinkman correlation to describe the permeability {{as a function of}} aggregate size. This model was used in conjunction with a filtration model to predict capture rates and <b>capture</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of small particles by settling fractal aggregates.

The first mold, (device 1), was fabricated from a sheet of Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) material, similar to Plexiglas. The device features were micro-engraved onto {{the face of the}} material. The second mold, (device 2), was fabricated from the use of fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3 D printing. The pumping efficiency of the PDMS devices was analyzed through the characterization of the micro-pumps flowrate with respect to the pumps driving pressure and the actuation frequency. Tested at a driving pressure of 10 psi, the flowrate for device 1 peaked at 75 µL/min with a 7 Hz actuation frequency before failing, while device 2 peaked at 498 µL/min with a 15 Hz actuation frequency. Using the techniques of rapid prototyping and fused deposition modelling a pneumatically actuated 3 D printer based micro-pump and micro-mixer are fabricated. The devices were fabricated using a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) material as an alternative material to the present polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The micro-pump’s fluid flow output was analyzed through the characterization of the micro-pumps flowrate with respect to the pumps driving pressure and the actuation frequency.

Although phenotypic screening is possible with the existing techniques, retrieval of interesting bacteria from a larger population for their subsequent analysis is still challenging. Moreover, the handling of such small cells suffers from low throughput and high manual work. Hence, novel technologies are required for capturing, isolating and subsequently analyzing single cells in a high throughput context. Within the MeBioS Biosensor group, an innovative approach for conducting high throughput time-lapse studies on single non-adherent cells has been recently demonstrated, based on digital microfluidic platform (DMF). In the current work, we present an application of the adapted system, expanded with optical-tweezers 3, for capturing and releasing magnetic bead-coupled single bacterial cells from a microwell.

By performing automated actuations, the microwells were seeded with antibody-functionalized-superparamagnetic beads, followed by an on-chip incubation of the beads with Salmonella cells. The array was then washed five times to remove unbound bacteria. A bacteria <b>capturing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 48 % was obtained for an antibody concentration of 0. 24 µg/µl.

In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time, a DMF platform enabled spatial isolation and selective retrieval of single non-adhering cells bound to magnetic beads using optical tweezers.
