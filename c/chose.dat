5|$|Less formally: Consider all {{possible}} (not actual) worlds {{in which you}} always choose the right. In all those, {{there will be a}} subpart of the world that says you were free to choose a certain right or wrong action, but does not say whether you <b>chose</b> it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then you'd <b>chose</b> the wrong.|$|E
50|$|A similar line of {{reasoning}} shows that <b>choosing</b> $98 is always better for Alice than <b>choosing</b> $99. The only situation where <b>choosing</b> $99 would give a higher payoff than <b>choosing</b> $98 is if Bob <b>chooses</b> $100—but if Bob is only seeking to maximize his own profit, he will always <b>choose</b> $99 instead of $100.|$|R
50|$|If Alice only {{wants to}} {{maximize}} her own payoff, <b>choosing</b> $99 trumps <b>choosing</b> $100. If Bob <b>chooses</b> any dollar value 2-98 inclusive, $99 and $100 give equal payoffs; if Bob <b>chooses</b> $99 or $100, <b>choosing</b> $99 nets Alice an extra dollar.|$|R
50|$|As an example, {{consider}} a sequential version of Battle {{of the sexes}} (pictured above on the left). This game has three Nash equilibrium: (O, o), (F, f), and one mixed equilibrium. We can construct a perfect information version (pictured above on the right). This game has only one subgame perfect equilibrium (O, Oo) If the first player <b>chooses</b> O, the second will <b>choose</b> Oo because 2 is better than 0. If the first player <b>chooses</b> F, the second will <b>choose</b> Ff because 3 is better than 0. So, player 1 is <b>choosing</b> between 3 if she <b>chooses</b> O and 2 if she <b>chooses</b> F. As a result, player 1 will <b>choose</b> O and player 2 will <b>choose</b> Oo.|$|R

5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office.

5|$|An {{issue with}} the Hinomaru and {{national}} anthem was raised once again when Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympic Games. Before the Olympic Games, {{the size of the}} sun disc of the national flag was changed partly because the sun disc was not considered striking when it was being flown with other national flags. Tadamasa Fukiura, a color specialist, <b>chose</b> to set the sun disc at two thirds of the flag's length. Fukiura also <b>chose</b> the flag colors for the 1964 as well as the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.|$|E
