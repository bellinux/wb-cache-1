50|$|In Indonesia, the Peranakans {{develop their}} own kebaya, most notably kebaya encim, derived from the name encim or enci {{to refer to a}} married Chinese woman. Kebaya encim was {{commonly}} worn by Chinese ladies in Javan coastal cities with significant Chinese settlements, such as Semarang, Lasem, Tuban, Surabaya, Pekalongan and Cirebon. It marked differently from Javanese kebaya with its smaller and finer embroidery, lighter fabrics and more vibrant colours. They also developed their own batik patterns, which incorporate symbols from China. The kebaya encim fit well with vibrant-coloured kain batik pesisiran (Javan coastal batik), which incorporated symbols and motives from China; such as dragon, phoenix, peony and lotus. For the Baba they will wear baju lokchuan (which is the Chinese men full costume) but the younger generation they will wear just the top of it which is the long sleeved silk jacket with <b>Chinese</b> <b>collar</b> or the batik shirt.|$|E

50|$|Our {{domestic}} cats, {{though they}} differ in colour, form no distinct races. The climates of Spain and Syria have alone produced permanent varieties: To {{these may be}} added the climate of Pe-chi-ly in China, where the cats have long hair and pendulous ears, and are the favourites of the ladies. These domestic cats with pendulous ears, of which we have full descriptions, are still farther removed from the wild and primitive race, than those whose ears are erect....I formerly remarked, that, in China, there were cats with pendulous ears. This variety is not found any where else, and perhaps it is an animal of a different species; for travellers, when mentioning an animal called Sumxu, which is entirely domestic, say, that they can compare it to nothing but the cat, with which it has a great resemblance. Its colour is black or yellow, and its hair very bright and glittering. The <b>Chinese</b> put silver <b>collars</b> about the necks of these animals, and render them extremely familiar. As they are not common, they give a high price, both on account of their beauty, and because they destroy rats.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} administers a Chinese {{version of the}} Safety Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ) to blue <b>collar</b> <b>Chinese</b> workers in Hong Kong (N= 120, 44 males, 66 females) and China (N= 313, 83 males, 223 females); it {{examines}} relations among safety climate (safety attitudes and communication), work stress (job strains) and safety performance (accident rates and occupational injuries). The study also aims at comparing safety climate and safety performance between older and younger workers, and {{between male and female}} workers. The results show that the Chinese SAQ is a moderately reliable instrument; some safety attitude scales are related to accident rates for both samples. Further, job strains (perceived work stress, psychological distress and job dissatisfaction) are related to accident rates or injuries With respect to age and gender differences, there are age differences in some safety attitude scales for the China sample but not the Hong Kong sample, with older workers exhibit more positive attitudes towards safety. However, there is no age difference in communication, accident rates or injuries for both samples. The results also show that there are some gender differences in safety attitude scales for both samples, with females reported more positive attitudes towards safety. However, there is no gender difference in communication, accident rates, or injuries for both samples. The implications of these results are discussed in the paper...|$|R
