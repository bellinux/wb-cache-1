In one room, the continuous lighting schedule（CL）of 24 h light(L) : 0 h dark (D) was maintained, ambient temperature kept normal（normal control group,NC）while in other three rooms,the chickens were subjected to <b>cool</b> <b>ambient</b> temperature to induce PHS. The continuous lighting schedule of 24 L: 0 D (Low temperature control group,LC) and the intermittent lighting (IL) schedule of 21 L: 3 D(group L 1) and 19 L: 5 D (group L 2) were imposed respectively from 9 to 30 days of age (From day 30 onwards all groups kept in continuous lighting). PHS incidence, body weights and feed intake were measured weekly for each group.

40|$|Pulsating {{flows in}} a Helmholtz pulse {{combustor}} tailpipe were numerically simulated by a commercial CFD software package, FLUENT. The effects of ambient temperature {{on the characteristics}} of the pulsating tailpipe flows were studied. Two study cases, with high and low levels of ambient temperature, were simulated with compressible flow equations. An additional case, with high ambient temperature, was simulated with incompressible (temperature-dependent density) flow equations. Results showed that the effect of ambient temperature on the mean temperature profile in the tailpipe was limited to the distance where the ambient fluid traveled into the tailpipe during the period of flow reversal. In this region, the amplitude of mass flow rate oscillation significantly increased, due to higher density associated with low ambient temperature. The overall effects of <b>cooler</b> <b>ambient</b> temperature included an increase in mean pressure at the entrance of the tailpipe and a decrease in the magnitude of velocity amplitude profile along the tailpipe. Interestingly, the mean velocities along the tailpipe, even at the tailpipe exit, were not affected by the <b>cooler</b> <b>ambient</b> air. The mean velocity at the exit corresponded to the higher temperature of fresh fluid from upstream, which was not affected by the ambient temperature, driven out of the tailpipe in each oscillation cycle. The linear acoustic theory with appropriate assumptions could be used to calculate the magnitude of the profiles of velocity amplitude along the tailpipe as a fair approximation, at least for the study cases in this thesis.

40|$|Experiments in this {{dissertation}} {{were conducted}} to characterize the effects of d-fenfluramine on body temperature and the mechanisms by which d-fenfluramine alter body temperature. The experiments were conducted in conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats. Body temperature was measured in all animals using telemetry. The results of the experiments indicated that d-fenfluramine altered body temperature in animals kept 28, 22, 16 and 4 degrees Centigrade. D-fenfluramine produced hyperthermia in animals kept at 28 degrees Centigrade and varying degrees hypothermia at normal and <b>cooler</b> <b>ambient</b> temperatures. Further experiments {{were conducted to}} explore the effects of d-fenfluramine on brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, cutaneous vascular tone and whole body oxygen consumption. In animals kept at 22 and 4 degrees Centigrade, we found that d-fenfluramine activated BAT, as indicated by a decrease in BAT norepinephrine content, to the same magnitude. Thus, the hypothermia seen at normal and <b>cooler</b> <b>ambient</b> temperature was not {{due to lack of}} BAT activation. Also, activation of BAT by d-fenfluramine was mediated through the sympathetic nervous system and through release of central serotonin, since ganglionic blocker pentolinium and serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine blocked d-fenfluramine-mediated BAT activation. In animals kept at 16 degrees Centigrade, d-fenfluramine increased tail-skin temperature (Tsk), an index of cutaneous vascular tone, indicating that d-fenfluramine produced cutaneous vasodilation. d-fenfluramine-induced increase in Tsk was mediated through withdrawal of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone to the tail, since pentolinium blocks this effect. In animals kept at 28 degrees Centigrade, d-fenfluramine produced a decrease in Tsk, indicating vasoconstriction. The effects of d-fenfluramine on the Tsk were mediated through release of serotonin, since fluoxetine blocked these effects. D-fenfluramine increased whole body oxygen consumption, an index of metabolic activity and the increase was due to BAT activation, since pentolinium prevented the increase. Thus, although d-fenfluramine increased metabolic activity through BAT activation, the increase was insufficient {{to make up for the}} heat loss produced by cutaneous vasodilation and thus produces hypothermia. The hyperthermia seen at 28 oC is due to activation of BAT and the subsequent inability of the animal to lose the excess heat due to cutaneous vasoconstriction produced by d-fenfluramine at 28 degrees Centigrade...|$|E

40|$|Key Question: What is the {{contribution}} of mass, metals and energy from starburst galaxies to the Intergalactic Medium? Summary of Present Knowledge: Starburst galaxies drive galactic-scale outflows or “superwinds ” that {{may be responsible for}} removing metals from galaxies and polluting the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). Superwinds are powered by massive star winds and by core collapse supernovae which collectively create T ∼ < 108 K bubbles of metal-enriched plasma within star forming regions. These over-pressured bubbles expand, sweep up <b>cooler</b> <b>ambient</b> gas, and eventually blow out of the disk into the halo. In the last decade tremendous progress was made in mapping cool entrained gas in outflows through UV/optical imaging and absorption line spectroscopy. These studies demonstrated that superwinds are ubiquitous in galaxies forming stars at high surface densities and that the most powerful starbursts can drive outflows near escape velocity. Theoretical models of galaxy evolution have begun to incorporate superwinds, using various ad-hoc prescriptions based on our knowledge of the cool gas. However, these efforts are fundamentally impeded by our lack of information abou...|$|E
