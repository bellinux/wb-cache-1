40|$|<b>Chicken</b> litter <b>or</b> <b>chicken</b> litter-based organic {{fertilizers}} {{are usually}} recycled {{into the soil}} to improve the structure and fertility of agricultural land. As {{an important source of}} nutrients for crop production, chicken litter may also contain a variety of human pathogens that can threaten humans who consume the contaminated food or water. Composting can inactivate pathogens while creating a soil amendment beneficial for application to arable agricultural land. Some foodborne pathogens may have the potential to survive {{for long periods of time}} in raw <b>chicken</b> litter <b>or</b> its composted products after land application, and a small population of pathogenic cells may even regrow to high levels when the conditions are favorable for growth. Thermal processing is a good choice for inactivating pathogens in <b>chicken</b> litter <b>or</b> <b>chicken</b> litter-based organic fertilizers prior to land application. However, some populations may become acclimatized to a hostile environment during build-up or composting and develop heat resistance through cross-protection during subsequent high temperature treatment. Therefore, this paper reviews currently available information on the microbiological safety of <b>chicken</b> litter <b>or</b> <b>chicken</b> litter-based organic fertilizers, and discusses about further research on developing novel and effective disinfection techniques, including physical, chemical, and biological treatments, as an alternative to current methods...|$|R
