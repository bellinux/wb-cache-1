50|$|Banks need to {{evaluate}} the risk of adverse events other than credit risks and market risks. These risks, called operational risks, include the major events most likely to cause bank failure, such as massive internal fraud. The international <b>compliance</b> <b>regime</b> for banks, Basel II, requires that such risks be quantified using a mixture of statistical theory, such as extreme value theory, and scenario analysis conducted by internal committees of experts. A bank regulator (such as the Federal Reserve in the United States) oversees the result. Negotiations between the parties result {{in a system that}} combines quantitative methods with informed and scrutinized expert opinion. This gives the potential to avoid as far as possible the problems caused by the paucity of data and the bias of pure expert opinion.|$|E

50|$|As said before, the BTWC has no {{organization}} to oversee its implementation and lacks an effective monitoring, compliance and verification regime. There exists a modest consultative compliance mechanism, but negotiations {{to establish an}} international organization for the prohibition of biological weapons to oversee implementation and conduct monitoring and verification have broken down in 2001. The lack of transparency {{make it difficult to}} assess the status and effectiveness of states parties’ measures to implement and comply with the BTWC. UNSCR 1540 has established a monitoring system based on states’ declarations on implementation through the reports provided to the 1540 Committee. The resolution does not provide a <b>compliance</b> <b>regime,</b> but rather favors cooperative efforts since non-compliance can be caused by lack of awareness or capacity. But if states persist in their non-compliance despite assistance, then the Committee will report this to the UNSC. Resolution 1540 also fulfills a function compliance role since it requires BTWC states parties to review their compliance with its obligations while they can use the more detailed criteria for national implementation in the resolution.|$|E

NGOs have been quite successful in attaining their goals for the design of the compliance regime: They won acceptance for the dual approach to compliance, with both a facilitative and an enforcement branch, a strong enforcement mechanism, and potentially significant scope for NGO participation in enforcement branch deliberations. A few advisory NGOs seem to have had influence on the design of the <b>compliance</b> <b>regime,</b> but it is more uncertain what their influence would have been without the US coming up with essentially the same approach. NGO influence on the interpretation of sinks and the design of the flexibility mechanisms, issues closely related to the <b>compliance</b> <b>regime,</b> has been very modest. With regard to enhancing future compliance, it is shown that NGOs are likely to pursue both internal and external strategies. The internal strategy denotes using instruments in the compliance system, including participation in compliance, monitoring and verification proceedings.

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{unresolved}} {{issues on the}} agenda of the forthcoming UN climate change negotiations in Cancún is the issue of {{what will happen to the}} Kyoto Protocol, since at present, there will be no targets for greenhouse (GHG) emissions from developed countries under the Protocol beyond 2012. To illuminate this aspect of the Protocol, this Policy Brief looks closer at the nature of the commitments and the <b>compliance</b> <b>regime</b> under the Kyoto Protocol. We argue that the <b>compliance</b> <b>regime</b> of the Protocol is not as robust as many of the Protocol’s supporters might think. The precise legal form of the commitments in the climate regime may have little impact on whether countries actually achieve their targets. Instead, we argue, negotiators should focus on agreeing a framework of commitments that are credible and enforceable, rather than focus excessively on the legal form of those commitments...|$|E

40|$|Corporate {{compliance}} {{is becoming}} increasingly “criminalized. ” What began {{as a means of}} industry self-regulation has morphed into a multi-billion-dollar effort to avoid government intervention in business, specifically criminal and quasi-criminal investigations and prosecutions. In order to avoid application of the criminal law, companies have adopted compliance programs that are motivated by and mimic that law, using the precepts of criminal legislation, enforcement, and adjudication to advance their compliance goals. This approach to compliance is inherently flawed, however—it can never be fully effective in abating corporate wrongdoing. Criminalized <b>compliance</b> <b>regimes</b> are inherently ineffective because they impose unintended behavioral consequences on corporate employees. Employees subject to criminalized compliance have greater opportunities to rationalize their future unethical or illegal behavior. Rationalizations are a key component in the psychological process necessary for the commission of corporate crime—they allow offenders to square their self-perception as “good people” with the illegal behavior they are contemplating, thereby allowing the behavior to go forward. Criminalized <b>compliance</b> <b>regimes</b> fuel these rationalizations, and in turn, bad corporate conduct. By importing into the corporation many of the criminal law’s delegitimizing features, criminalized compliance creates space for rationalizations, facilitating the necessary precursors to the commission of white collar and corporate crime. The result is that many compliance programs, by mimicking the criminal law in hopes of reducing employee misconduct, are actually fostering it. This insight, which offers a new way of conceptualizing corporate compliance, explains the ineffectiveness of many compliance programs and also suggests how companies might go about fixing them...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} disjoining {{pressure}} between a rigid spherical probe particle (attached to an AFM cantilever) and a liquid interface (e. g., oil/water or air/water) is treated in an analytic manner {{to describe the}} total force F exerted on the probe {{as a function of}} the distance X of the probe from the rigid substrate (AFM stage) on which the liquid interface resides. Two cases (i) a flat interface under gravity and (ii) a drop whose size is sufficiently small that gravity can be neglected have been examined. A simple numerical algorithm is given for computing F(X) (the AFM observable) from a given form for the disjoining pressure. Numerical results are displayed for electrostatic probe/interface interactions which reveal the linear <b>compliance</b> <b>regime</b> experimentally observed in AFM experiments on these systems. The slope of the linear <b>compliance</b> <b>regime</b> is shown to be a function of the properties of the interface (capillary length, particle radius, drop size, contact angle of drop on rigid substrate etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, risk in {{education}} has stimulated increasing attention and prominence, with principals bearing responsibility and liability for ‘managing’ risk in schools. As a consequence, compulsory risk <b>compliance</b> <b>régimes</b> have become increasingly complex, technical and time-consuming. This article focuses on the responses of principals to issues surrounding ‘risk’ and suggests that some risk processes themselves may be inherently risky. Principals fear that risk management régimes can incur professional and personal danger while ignoring some commonly known, politically sensitive, ‘risky’ areas. The article considers the scope of risk in schools before turning to ‘undiscussables’: how risk management puts principals at risk, and issues surrounding leaders as risk. Principals’ concerns about marginalization from systemic risk decision-making, the individuation of risk management responsibility and suggestions for action are discussed, along with areas for future research...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the {{uncertainty}} associated {{to the absence of}} a post-Kyoto regime regarding Greenhouse Gas mitigation is affecting investments in mitigation activities in the EU electricity sector and, thus, future emissions levels. Based on a wide survey of EU power companies, the paper identifies the most likely post-Kyoto scenarios considered by these firms and how they are coping with such uncertainty in their current investment decisions. The major conclusion is that the non-existence of a post-Kyoto regime is having a negative effect on current business investment decisions in mitigation activities, increasing risk premiums and financing costs. All in all, the companies surveyed foresee post-Kyoto <b>compliance</b> <b>regimes</b> with emissions trading systems that would guarantee the continuity {{of the value of the}} reductions made beforehand, although they differ in their perceptions of the form that a post-Kyoto regime could take. ...|$|R

40|$|Supply chain {{contracting}} {{has been}} discussed usually under the two compliance regimes, forced and voluntary. Various contracts show different coordination characteristics in these two regimes. However, in practice, the enforcement of contracted quantities in case of forced compliance is always an issue of concern. We propose a price <b>compliance</b> <b>regime</b> for contract where the penalties, {{in the form of}} price for non-compliance on quantity, are enforceable on both parties. In this paper, we model a contract where a supplier needs to build capacity before demand is realized under the proposed price <b>compliance</b> <b>regime.</b> A need for investment in capacity can be of the form of new capacity installation or capacity enhancement or updation, and is prevalent in practice, especially in industries that witness short product life cycles, have a high rate of new product launches or deploy high technology. When a supplier makes an investment decision under uncertainty of demand, she might under-invest in capacity. This is a major concern for a manufacturer, since it directly leads to loss of sales. We include the capacity and cost to build the capacity as variables in the contract modeled and analyze how the manufacturer can influence the capacity decision of the supplier with the given contract. We analyze the impact of various penalty parameters on the supplier's capacity decision, supply chain efficiency and relative allocation of supply chain profit across partners. Further, we consider a special case of uniformly distributed demand and find analytical closed-form conditions for a sub-set of coordinating contracts. We also consider a special case where the buyer and supplier arrive at a consensus on capacity-related decision and capacity is verifiable by the buyer. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{utilizes}} a neoinstitutionalist {{framework to}} argue that while Germany’s anticorruption infrastructure remains strong, resilient pathdependent tendencies often {{make it difficult to}} reform. The article analyzes three specific areas: the state’s attitude to regulating German business, meeting international anticorruption commitments, and doing justice to the rising transparency agenda. High-profile examples of corruption in multinational businesses prompted significant changes to these companies’ <b>compliance</b> <b>regimes.</b> This critical juncture, however, did not prompt reform across much of the Mittelstand. Germany’s preparedness to fulfill international commitments, meanwhile, has been strongly dependent on correspondence with the internal logic of German politics and law.

Finally, the rise of an international transparency agenda has not fit with the logics of German public life, and change has been minimal.
