40|$|BACKGROUND: Facial lipoatrophy {{is defined}} as the {{reduction}} in buccal and orbital fat pads along with a more global loss of fat within the subcutaneous tissue. It is the most common and distressing sign of human immunodeficiency virus-associated lipodystrophy. Injectable polyacrylamide hydrogel (Aquamid) is a synthetic nonbiodegradable polymer consisting of a minor backbone of 2. 5 percent cross-linked polyacrylamide and 97. 5 percent nonpyrogenic water and is used for cosmetic facial <b>contour</b> <b>correction.</b> Favorable results with maximum aesthetic gains with the use of polyacrylamide hydrogel for reconstruction of facial lipoatrophy on the face in significantly immunocompromised individuals are being reported. These results are attributable to its use in limited volume injected at multiple sites and in multiple sittings. METHODS: Aquamid has been used for the correction of severe nasolabial folds and mid and lower facial volume loss in patients affected by human immunodeficiency virus-associated lipodystrophy. Fifty patients were enrolled and treated, with a mean follow-up of 13. 1 months. Results were evaluated clinically, by standardized ultrasonography, and by psychological tests (visual analogue scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Assessment of Body Change and Distress questionnaire) to quantify patient satisfaction. RESULTS: No significant side effects or issues such as swelling, infections, allergies, or nodule formation were noted over the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Aquamid has provided a minimally invasive, effective, long-lasting facial <b>contour</b> <b>correction</b> that significantly improves {{the quality of life in}} human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients...|$|E

40|$|Methodological {{aspects of}} planar gamma {{scintigraphy}} used to quantify pulmonary aerosol deposition were investigated using an experimental dry powder formulation. Particles of micronized salbutamol sulphate were labelled with technetium- 99 m and admixed to an ordered mixture of unlabelled micronized salbutamol sulphate and larger carrier particles of lactose. The radioaerosol {{was administered to}} 24 healthy subjects, 12 in each of two consecutive, similarly designed studies. Pulmonary deposition was determined using two methods: repeated planar imaging, and pharmacokinetic assessments following charcoal co-administration to prevent gastrointestinal salbutamol absorption. After due consideration had been taken to ensure appropriate radiolabelling, image acquisition and processing procedures, a scintigraphic estimate of 26. 2 % (24. 2 - 28. 4 %) was obtained, which did not significantly differ from the pharmacokinetic estimate of 26. 4 % (24. 4 - 28. 7 %). In summary, pre-study validation of the radiolabelling technique, quality control of radioaerosols produced during the study, correction for re-distribution of radiolabel from the lungs, selection of regions of interest, assessment of lung <b>contours,</b> <b>correction</b> for tissue attenuation of gamma rays and establishment of the actual recovery of radioactivity in the scintigraphic measurements could potentially affect {{the accuracy of the}} scintigraphic estimate of pulmonary deposition and, thus, should be carefully considered in the design or evaluation of any such study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Intravascular optical {{coherence}} tomography (IVOCT) is an in-vivo {{imaging modality}} based on {{the introduction of a}} catheter in a blood vessel for viewing its inner wall using electromagnetic radiation. One of the most developed automatic applications for this modality is the lumen area segmentation, however on the evaluation of these methods, the slices inside bifurcation regions, or with the presence of complex atherosclerotic plaques and dissections are usually discarded. This paper describes a fully-automatic method for computing the lumen area in IVOCT images where the set of slices includes complex atherosclerotic plaques and dissections. Methods The proposed lumen segmentation method is divided into two steps: preprocessing, including the removal of artifacts and the second step comprises a lumen detection using morphological operations. In addition, it is proposed an approach to delimit the lumen area for slices inside bifurcation region, considering only the main branch. Results Evaluation of the automatic lumen segmentation used manual segmentations as a reference, it was performed on 1328 human IVOCT images, presenting a mean difference in lumen area and Dice metrics of 0. 19 mm 2 and 97 % for slices outside the bifurcation, 1. 2 mm 2 and 88 % in the regions with bifurcation without automatic <b>contour</b> <b>correction</b> and 0. 52 mm 2 and 90 % inside bifurcation region with automatic <b>contour</b> <b>correction.</b> Conclusion This present study shows a robust lumen segmentation method for vessel cross-sections with dissections and complex plaque and bifurcation avoiding the exclusion of such regions from the dataset analysis...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{past several}} years, traumas {{following}} road traffic accidents and other causes have increased, owing {{to an increase}} in mechanization and pace of life. These patients frequently have complicated injuries involving soft tissue and the craniofacial skeleton. Assessment of bony injuries and loss of portions of facial skeleton and their management {{has proved to be a}} challenge to the reconstructive surgeon. Aims: Primary bone grafting of craniofacial skeletal injuries provides an opportunity for one stage correction of bony defects. The varied spectrum of primary bone grafts for management of craniomaxillofacial injuries are evaluated in this study. Materials and Methods: Patients with a history of acute trauma resulting in facial skeletal injuries with or without bone loss were included in the study. Primary bone grafting was undertaken in situations requiring <b>contour</b> <b>correction,</b> replacement of skeletal losses and for rigid fixation of fracture segments. Olecranon, Iliac crest, ribs, Vascularized as well as nonvascularized outer table calvarial grafts and nonvascularized inner table calvarial grafts were used in this study. Results: Sixty two patients of craniomaxillofacial injury following trauma requiring primary bone grafting were considered in this study. Fifty seven percent of patients (n= 32) required primary bone grafting for replacement of bone loss while bone grafting for <b>contour</b> <b>correction</b> was done in twenty three patients. The parietal calvaria overlying the non-dominant hemisphere was used as a source of bone graft in forty-nine patients.

Background: Numerous operative techniques have been described to address the alar defect reconstruction. Composite auricular chondrocutaneous grafting is a well-established technique for reconstructing alar defects. It can provide excellent results because it matches nasal tissue well in terms of colour, texture, and contour. However, the size of composite graft that can be transferred is limited by its lack of blood supply.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} cone-beam CT (CBCT) guidance for setup error reduction and soft tissue visualization in accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients were recruited for the delivery of radiotherapy to the postoperative cavity (3850 cGy in 10 fractions over 5 days) using an APBI technique. Cone-beam CT data sets were acquired after an initial skin-mark setup and before treatment delivery. These were registered online using the ipsilateral lung and external <b>contours.</b> <b>Corrections</b> were executed for translations exceeding 3 mm. The random and systematic errors associated with setup using skin-marks and setup using CBCT guidance were calculated and compared. RESULTS: A total of 315 CBCT data sets were analyzed. The systematic errors for the skin-mark setup were 2. 7, 1. 7, and 2. 4 mm in the right-left, anterior-posterior, and superior-inferior directions, respectively. These were reduced to 0. 8, 0. 7, and 0. 8 mm when CBCT guidance was used. The random errors were reduced from 2. 4, 2. 2, and 2. 9 mm for skin-marks to 1. 5, 1. 5, and 1. 6 mm for CBCT guidance in the right-left, anterior-posterior, and superior-inferior directions, respectively. CONCLUSION: A skin-mark setup for APBI patients is sufficient for current planning target volume margins for the population of patients studied here. Online CBCT guidance minimizes the occurrence of large random deviations, which may have a greater impact for the accelerated fractionation schedule used in APBI. It {{is also likely to}} permit a reduction in planning target volume margins and provide skin-line visualization and dosimetric evaluation of cardiac and lung volumes...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{assess the}} feasibility, accuracy, and {{reproducibility}} of real-time full-volume 3 -dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (3 D RT-VTTE) to measure left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF) using a fully automated endocardial contouring algorithm {{and to identify}} and automatically correct the contours to obtain accurate LV volumes in sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation (AF). Background 3 D transthoracic echocardiography is not used routinely to quantify LV volumes and EF. A fully automated workflow using RT-VTTE may improve clinical adoption. MethodsRT-VTTE was performed and 3 D EF and volumes obtained using an automated trabecular endocardial contouring algorithm; an automated correction was applied to track the compacted myocardium. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and 2 -dimensional biplane Simpson method were the reference standard. ResultsNinety-one patients (67 in normal sinus rhythm [NSR], 24 in AF) were included. Among all NSR patients, there was excellent correlation between RT-VTTE and CMR for end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and EF (r = 0. 90, 0. 96, and 0. 98, respectively; p < 0. 001). In patients with EF ≥ 50 % (n = 36), EDV and ESV were underestimated by 10. 7 ± 17. 5 ml (p = 0. 001) and by 4. 1 ± 6. 1 ml (p < 0. 001), respectively. In those with EF < 50 % (n = 31), EDV and ESV were underestimated by 25. 7 ± 32. 7 ml (p < 0. 001) and by 16. 2 ± 24. 0 ml (p = 0. 001). Automated <b>contour</b> <b>correction</b> to track the compacted myocardium eliminated mean volume differences between RT-VTTE and CMR. In patients with AF, LV volumes and EF were accurate by RT-VTTE (r = 0. 94, 0. 94, and 0. 91 for EDV, ESV, and EF, respectively; p < 0. 001). Automated 3 D LV volumes and EF were highly reproducible. ConclusionsRapid, accurate, and reproducible EF {{can be obtained by}} RT-VTTE in NSR and AF patients by using an automated trabecular edge contouring algorithm. Furthermore, automated <b>contour</b> <b>correction</b> to detect the compacted myocardium yields accurate and reproducible 3 D LV volumes...|$|E
30|$|Management {{of facial}} {{asymmetry}} is very challenging. Treatment followed by two-dimensional (2 D) analysis alone, such as cephalometric prediction, can achieve midline correction. However, it is insufficient for facial <b>contour</b> <b>correction.</b> Three-dimensional (3 D) models and/or 3 D simulation {{are often used}} to overcome this issue. However, these bone-level simulations also have some limitations. Most cases of asymmetry require correction of yaw, and changes in yaw have a significant influence on the facial contour. Evaluation of facial contour is not sufficient only from the frontal and lateral directions; {{it should also be}} performed from the oblique direction. Our strategy for facial asymmetry is as follows. Using soft tissue simulation, gradual changes in yaw are evaluated from various angles to determine the optimal correction of yaw. Based on the determined movement, an intermediate splint is made with computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM). We developed 3 D positioning devices [1, 2] to maintain the original position of the mandible during surgery. Because treatment of asymmetry often requires upward and/or backward repositioning of the maxillary segment bilaterally or unilaterally, we developed a modified horseshoe osteotomy technique to avoid bony interference of the posterior part of the maxilla [3, 4]. This sequential process is explained through a case presentation.|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} of short-axis functional cardiac magnetic resonance {{images can be}} performed using automatic contour detection methods. The resulting myocardial contours must be reviewed and possibly corrected, which can be time-consuming, particularly when performed across all cardiac phases. We quantified the impact of manual contour corrections on both analysis time and quantitative measurements obtained from left ventricular short-axis cine images acquired from 1555 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort using computer-aided contour detection methods. The total analysis time for a single case was 7. 6 +/- 1. 7 min {{for an average of}} 221 +/- 36 myocardial contours per participant. This included 4. 8 +/- 1. 6 min for manual <b>contour</b> <b>correction</b> of 2 % of all automatically detected endocardial contours and 8 % of all automatically detected epicardial contours. However, the impact of these corrections on global left ventricular parameters was limited, introducing differences of 0. 4 +/- 4. 1 mL for end-diastolic volume, - 0. 3 +/- 2. 9 mL for end-systolic volume, 0. 7 +/- 3. 1 mL for stroke volume, and 0. 3 +/- 1. 8 % for ejection fraction. We conclude that left ventricular functional parameters can be obtained under 5 min from short-axis functional cardiac magnetic resonance images using automatic contour detection methods.

40|$|Adolescent {{idiopathic}} scoliosis is {{the most}} common spinal deformity encountered by General Orthopaedic Surgeons. Etiology remains unclear and current research focuses on genetic factors that may influence scoliosis development and risk of progression. Delayed diagnosis can result in severe deformities which affect the coronal and sagittal planes, as well as the rib cage, waistline symmetry, and shoulder balance. Patient′s dissatisfaction in terms of physical appearance and mechanical back pain, as well as the risk for curve deterioration are usually the reasons for treatment. Conservative management involves mainly bracing with the aim to stop or slow down scoliosis progression during growth and if possible prevent the need for surgical treatment. This is mainly indicated in young compliant patients with a large amount of remaining growth and progressive curvatures. Scoliosis correction is indicated for severe or progressive curves which produce significant cosmetic deformity, muscular pain, and patient discontent. Posterior spinal arthrodesis with Harrington instrumentation and bone grafting was the first attempt to correct the coronal deformity and replace in situ fusion. This was associated with high pseudarthrosis rates, need for postoperative immobilization, and flattening of sagittal spinal <b>contour.</b> Segmental <b>correction</b> techniques were introduced along with the Luque rods, Harri-Luque, and Wisconsin systems. Correction in both coronal and sagittal planes was not satisfactory and high rates of nonunion persisted until Cotrel and Dubousset introduced the concept of global spinal derotation.

30|$|Our study {{included}} 144 patients and used an automatic algorithm for artifact correction, {{which is based}} on a combination of a template of likely artifact areas and a level set segmentation method that delineates the outer <b>contour.</b> The automated <b>correction</b> method was able to substantially reduce the artifacts in 98 % of the included patients. The time to correct each attenuation map was about 1  min for the patients in GroupINNER and about 40  min for GroupOUTER using a standard MacBook Pro (Apple Inc., 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA, USA) and non-optimized code. It is, therefore, feasible to have images ready for reading with a delay less than an hour. This {{study included}} patients injected with five different tracers ([18 F]-FDG, [18 F]-FET, [11 C]-PiB, [64 Cu]-DOTATATE, and [68 Ga]-DOTATOC), so the method appears to be robust to the tracer type. The method only makes use of the NAC-PET image and the Dixon-water image to correct for the artifacts; both are readily available in all PET/MR exams, so the method does not require any extra scan time.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} an open environment for quantitative analysis of left ventricular function using ultrasound images. The system is primarily intended for experimental purposes, i. e. clinical research and the evaluation of quantification algorithms. The modular design allows easy expansion with new analysis methods. The core of our system is the user-interface and image presentation. Image analysis methods are included {{as a set of}} tools available to the operator. Using this approach, the expensive, expert knowledge of the cardiologist is used more efficiently than in most delineation systems. During delineation, images of a complete heart cycle can be simultaneously displayed dynamically ('cine mode') in a separate window. This feature improves visual edge perception and enables accurate determination of the endocardium even in cases of very poor echogenicity. The resulting contour can be corrected locally by interactive modification using 'rubber banding'. After delineation of the images from different echocardiographic views, volume, ejection fraction, and regional wall motion are determined. Studies using contrast-enhanced echocardiography can be quantified by image intensity analysis in a region of interest in order to determine myocardial perfusion. We evaluated our method by quantifying echocardiographic studies from 12 healthy volunteers. We compared the results with magnetic resonance imaging and concluded that {{there was no significant difference}} in volume and ejection fraction calculated from both modalities. Moreover, the image display features and <b>contour</b> <b>correction</b> methods were greatly appreciated by the cardiologists who used the system. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a two-stream wind tunnel was {{undertaken}} to allow the simulation and study of certain features of the flow field around the blades of high-speed axial-flow turbomachineries. The mixing of the two parallel streams with designed Mach numbers respectively equal to 1. 4 and 0. 7 will simulate the transonic Mach number distribution generally obtained along {{the tips of the}} first stage blades in large bypass-fan engines. The GALCIT hypersonic compressor plant will be used as an air supply for the wind tunnel, and consequently the calculations contained in the first chapter are derived from the characteristics and the performance of this plant. The transonic part of the nozzle is computed by using a method developed by K. O. Friedrichs. This method consists essentially of expanding the coordinates and the characteristics of the flow in power series. The development begins with prescribing, more or less arbitrarily, a Mach number distribution along the centerline of the nozzle. This method has been programmed for an IBM 360 computer to define the wall contour of the nozzle. A further computation is carried out to correct the contour for boundary layer buildup.

40|$|Background: In East Asian countries, a prominent, long, and squared contour of {{the lower}} third of the face is {{considered}} unattractive, strong, and masculine. To change such a facial contour into an ovular <b>contour,</b> <b>correction</b> of the chin area is essential to accomplish the overall curve in the mandibuloplasty, and various methods for the horizontal reduction of the chin area have been suggested. The horizontal osteotomy and central strip resection technique, {{which is the most}} widely used method, has comparatively little effect and some restrictions. To improve these points, the authors introduced an effective method for simultaneously reducing the width and height of the chin without additional procedures. Methods: From March 2010 to May 2013, 432 women and 117 men underwent mandibular contouring surgery. Of these patients, 321 needed correction of the chin shape with simultaneous mandibular contouring surgery. Narrowing and vertical reduction genioplasty was performed for these patients using an inverted V-shaped osteotomy with central bony segment resection. Results: Narrowing and vertical reduction genioplasty was successfully performed in all cases. No severe complications were observed. Transient sensory changes of the skin around the chin were observed in 87 patients, but all recovered within 3 months. All of the patients were satisfied with the results. Conclusions: The method that we introduce in this article is a simple and more effective method for simultaneous reduction of the width and height of the chin without additional procedures.

40|$|We {{present a}} general surface {{brightness}} correction method for compact extended sources imaged in the slow-scan pointed observation mode of the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) aboard the AKARI Infrared Astronomical Satellite. Our method recovers correct surface brightness distribution maps by re-scaling archived raw FIS maps using the surface-brightness-dependent inverse FIS response function. The flux {{of a target}} source is then automatically corrected for as the simple sum of surface brightnesses within the adopted contour encircling {{the perimeter of the}} target (i. e., <b>contour</b> photometry). This <b>correction</b> method is contrasted to the previous aperture photometry method for point sources, which directly corrects for the target flux with a flux-dependent scaling law. The new surface brightness correction scheme is applicable to objects of any shape from unresolved point sources to resolved extended objects, as long as the target is not deemed diffuse, i. e., the total extent of the target source does not exceed too much more than a single FIS scan width of 10 arcmin. The new correction method takes advantage of the well-defined shape (i. e., the scale invariance) of the point-spread function, which enables us to adopt a power-law FIS response function. We analyze the point-source photometric calibrator data using the FIS AKARI Slow-scan Tool (FAST) and constrained the parameters of the adopted power-law FIS response function. We conclude that the photometric accuracy of the new correction method is better than 10 % error based on comparisons with the expected fluxes of the photometric calibrators and that resulting fluxes without the present correction method can lead up to 230 % overestimates or down to 50 % underestimates.

For video based eye tracking system, {{there are a lot of}} concerns which has to take into count. Different types of occlusion like occlusion for eyebrows or eyelashes are the major problem for iris detection. The intensity of iris, eyelashes and eyebrows are almost similar. Hence, it is difficult to differentiate between them. In our paper, we proposed a method which will resolve the occlusion of eyelashes and eyebrows for combined eye region and iris tracking. We approached in a procedural way. Two modules are used. They are: rough eye region detection and iris center detection. In the first module, the face region is extracted from the image frame based on haar like feature. Eye region is detected by vertical and horizontal edge information of face ROI. In second module, some of processing task is done on detected rough eye region to find iris center. Here, the intensity of detected eye sub image is scaled. Otsu thresholding method is used for extracting binarized eye sub image. After this we have to select iris contour. For finding the exact iris contour, we depend on two features. Based on those two features, initially, a number of iris sub-image templates are stored. After storing them, we will use those templates for selection of exact iris contour when we need.
