5|$|<b>Calcareous</b> (composed {{of calcium}} carbonate) darts {{are found in}} {{a limited number of}} pulmonate {{families}} within the Stylommatophora.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} H.eburneus grow on the soil, mostly in {{coniferous}} woods, thickets and grassy areas. The fungus prefers soil that is moist, mesic, loamy and <b>calcareous.</b>|$|E
5|$|These are all corals and {{correspond}} to the fossil record time line. With readily-preserved hard <b>calcareous</b> skeletons, they comprise the majority of Anthozoan fossils.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the Marcellus, in the pyrite-carbonate bed between the {{carbonaceous}} black shale and a green <b>calcareous</b> shale bed, pyrite, carbonate, and groundwater reacted to form gossan iron oxide and gypsum.|$|E
5|$|Crushed shells {{are added}} as a <b>calcareous</b> {{supplement}} to the diet of laying poultry. Oyster shell and cockle shell are often {{used for this purpose}} and are obtained as a by-product from other industries.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking <b>calcareous</b> rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of <b>calcareous</b> sinter or tufa.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), {{but it can}} also rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus). It has a preference for neutral to <b>calcareous</b> soils.|$|E
5|$|Sponges were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: <b>calcareous</b> sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, {{studies have shown}} that the Homoscleromorpha, a group thought to belong to the Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.|$|E
5|$|The {{dorsal part}} of the body wall is a mantle (or pallium) which secretes <b>calcareous</b> s, plates or shells. It {{overlaps}} the body with enough spare room to form a mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecology of}} the area {{includes}} ancient woodland and <b>calcareous</b> grassland which supports nationally rare species including the Cheddar pink. The underlying rocks are Carboniferous Limestone containing phreatic caves at Shute Shelve Cavern and Picken's Hole from which fossils dating from the Middle Devensian have been recovered.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{probably}} favours <b>calcareous</b> soil, {{although it}} has been found on nearly every soil type. It appears on sand, peat, limestone soils, rankers and Cambisols. It endures acidic as well as alkaline and low-nutrient to relatively high-nutrient soils. Heavily eutrophic soils are inappropriate for its habitat.|$|E
5|$|The most {{universal}} {{features of}} the body structure of molluscs are a mantle with a significant cavity used for breathing and excretion, {{and the organization of}} the nervous system. Many have a <b>calcareous</b> shell.|$|E
5|$|These two localities are {{unusual in}} having cliff-top dunes of {{siliceous}} sand: cliff-top dunes are an unusual topographic formation, {{and nearly all}} soil in the area is <b>calcareous.</b> As Banksia species are intolerant of <b>calcareous</b> soils, and are not adapted to long range seed dispersal, the two populations of B.epica appear to be reproductively isolated. Nelson has suggested that {{there was once a}} continuous strip of siliceous sand along the coast, providing an extensive and unfragmented habitat for B.epica; rises in the sea level had submerged this strip, leaving only the cliff-top dunes as suitable habitat. The fact that the resultant isolated populations have not perceptibly speciated since then suggests that the species has been fragmented for only a short time, perhaps only since the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E
5|$|This former quarry has undulating <b>calcareous</b> {{grassland}} {{which is}} grazed by rabbits and cattle. It has a rich variety of flora, including sheep's fescue, dwarf thistle, mouse-ear hawkweed, wild thyme and common rock-rose. There are many bryophytes and lichens.|$|E
5|$|Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic}} of the area: ash–maple woodland (Fraxinus spp. and Acer spp.) often with abundant small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), <b>calcareous</b> grassland and mesotrophic grassland.|$|E
5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are {{more closely related to}} particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of the}} sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to <b>calcareous</b> sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to each other than either is to <b>calcareous</b> sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the deposit, these {{sandstones}} are reddish brown, very micaceous and shaley, sometimes containing <b>calcareous</b> nodules, ferruginous concretions and vegetable wax; above, they are gray and quartziferous. This is the Aye formation, including spiriferida like Cyrtospirifer verneuili, Rhynchonellida as Rhynchonella pugnus and R. boloniensis, some Orthoceras, Orthis striatula or Atrypa reticularis Well-preserved feldspar and mica probably come from wind erosion under a semi-arid climate of mountains present in the Netherlands today and extending to Düsseldorf.|$|E
5|$|Embedded in the <b>calcareous</b> {{skeleton}} {{are numerous}} microscopic polyps. They are connected internally {{by a system}} of canals and are concealed behind pores in the skeleton, the surface of which is smooth and lacks the corallites of true stony corals. The polyps have specialist functions, the gastrozooids processing and digesting the food caught by the dactylzooids which are grouped around them. The gastrozooids are small and plump and extend four to six tentacle stubs through their pores but are otherwise invisible. The dactylzooids have hairlike tentacles covered in cnidoblasts. Stings from the cnidocysts immobilize an item of prey and the tentacles thrust it through the mouth of an adjacent gastrozooid, from where it passes into the stomach for digestion. The polyps also extrude the coenosteum, the <b>calcareous</b> material of which the skeleton is composed. The coenosteum contains certain symbiotic microalgae called zooxanthellae. These are photosynthetic organisms which provide their hosts with energy and in return benefit from a protective environment in a well lit position. About 75% of the fire coral's energy requirements are provided by the zooxanthellae.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is {{native to}} the Northern Hemisphere, and {{distributed}} across Eurasia, North America and the British Isles, where there is open bog, heath, wetland and moorland, with standing water and <b>calcareous</b> peat or acidic soil. It can survive in the Subarctic and Arctic, and is found in Alaska, Finland and Greenland {{as far north as}} 83°N. The British botanist William Turner Thiselton-Dyer recorded E.angustifolium in the South African Republic in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the {{homogeneous}} Cardiff divides {{into the}} Bridgewater, Solsville, and Pecksport shale members, from base to top. The Bridgewater is a fissile dark silty shale with relatively rare fossils. A thin concretionary zone lies above, then the Solsville grades from a gray <b>calcareous</b> shale, to sandy siltstones and fine sandstones at the top, with the gray shale of the Pecksport shale and siltsone overlying it.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Mendips is open <b>calcareous</b> grassland, {{supporting}} {{a wide variety}} of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for arable agriculture, particularly since World WarI. As the demand for arable land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in temperate waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction enables them to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and <b>calcareous</b> sponges are abundant and diverse in shallower non-polar waters.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdown Hills form a flat plateau {{dominated}} by hard chert bands, {{made up of}} clay with flints, of Upper Greensand with some remnants of chalk. The cretaceous rocks rest over eroded Jurassic and Triassic beds, with an outcrop of Rhaetian beds. In the western areas the Upper Greensand is devoid of <b>calcareous</b> material but the sands yield fossils of marine bivalves and gastropods (snails) preserved in silica.|$|E
5|$|The Ediacara-type {{assemblage}} {{is named}} after Australia's Ediacara Hills, and consists of fossils preserved in facies of coastal lagoons and rivers. They are typically found in red gypsiferous and <b>calcareous</b> paleosols formed on loess and flood deposits in an arid cool temperate paleoclimate. Most fossils are preserved as imprints in microbial earths, but a few are preserved within sandy units.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series, {{which contain}} ooliths and fossil debris {{on top of}} Old Red Sandstone, and by Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Keuper. Evidence for Variscan orogeny {{is seen in the}} sheared rock and cleaved shales. In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature <b>calcareous</b> soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is native {{only to the}} eastern United States, congregating in colonies that often consist of fewer than 20individuals. They prefer <b>calcareous</b> {{wetlands}} (areas containing lime), including meadows, bogs, marshes, and spring seeps, that have both wet and dry regions. Their habitat is often {{on the edge of}} woods. Bog turtles have sometimes been seen in cow pastures and near beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|The hills {{are largely}} formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic of}} the area: ash–maple woodland, <b>calcareous</b> grassland and mesotrophic grassland. With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds, butterflies and small mammals. The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E
5|$|Walton and Ivythorn Hills {{are covered}} {{by a variety of}} {{semi-natural}} habitats. These include unimproved <b>calcareous</b> grassland, scrubland and coppiced woodland including field maple and Ash. The range of habitats are home to many species of invertebrate. Butterflies, Leafhoppers, Spiders and Soldier Flies are particularly well represented. There is also a population of Great Green Bush Cricket (Tettigonia viridissima).|$|E
5|$|Among scarce plants {{found on}} Sand Point are smallflower buttercup, and honewort. The range of soils {{at the site}} support various flora and fauna. The <b>calcareous</b> {{grassland}} is dominated by Festuca species and Dactylis glomerata, while the scrub towards {{the west of the}} site is dominated by hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), while that to the east consists of common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg). Less common plants include the cheddar pink (Dianthus gratianopolitanus) and Somerset hair grass (Koeleria vallesiana).|$|E
5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech forest on <b>calcareous</b> soil.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis, or sea ginger, is {{a species}} of colonial fire coral with a <b>calcareous</b> skeleton. It is found on shallow water coral reefs in the {{tropical}} west Atlantic Ocean. It shows {{a variety of different}} morphologies depending on its location. It feeds on plankton and derives part of its energy requirements from microalgae found within its tissues. It is an important member of the reef building community and subject to the same threats as other corals. It can cause painful stings to unwary divers.|$|E
5|$|Suillus bovinus {{is found}} in conifer woods and {{plantations}} across Europe, including subalpine regions in the Alps, up to altitudes of 800m (2500ft). It is common in Lithuania, where it associates with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the only naturally occurring pine in that country. Preferred soils of S.bovinus are often acidic, sand-based, or sometimes <b>calcareous</b> (chalky) and moraine. In Asia, it has been recorded in Taiwan, and in Japan, where it associates with Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora). In China, it has been recorded from provinces Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang.|$|E
5|$|The Everglades Forever Act, {{introduced}} by Governor Lawton Chiles in 1994, {{was an attempt}} to legislate the lowering of phosphorus in Everglades waterways. The act put the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500ppb in the 1980s). The SFWMD built Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) near sugarcane fields where water leaving the EAA flows into ponds lined with lime rock and layers of peat and <b>calcareous</b> periphyton. Testing has shown this method to be more effective than previously anticipated, bringing levels from 80ppb to 10ppb.|$|E
5|$|The Union Springs is an organic-rich, pyritiferous, thinly bedded, blackish gray {{to black}} shale with {{mudstone}} concretionary layers, and thin silt bands at the bottom. To the east, {{it becomes the}} Bakoven Member, a darker, less organic shale with fewer limestone layers. To the west the Union Springs beds thin, with its upper limestones merging with the overlying <b>calcareous</b> Cherry Valley Member. A regional unconformity appears in western New York, as the Union Springs lenses in and out, and then reappears in northwest Pennsylvania and northeast Ohio between the Onondaga and Cherry Valley.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} E.sinuatum grow solitarily or in groups, {{and have been}} found forming fairy rings. Fruit bodies appear mainly in autumn, and also in summer in North America, while in Europe the season is {{reported}} as late summer and autumn. They are found in deciduous woodlands under oak, beech, and less commonly birch, often on clay or <b>calcareous</b> (chalky) soils, but they may spread to in parks, fields and grassy areas nearby. Most members of the genus are saprotrophic, although this species has been recorded as forming an ectomycorrhizal relationship with willow (Salix).|$|E
5|$|The lake is {{surrounded}} with fringing reedbeds, carr woodland and grassland, which are managed by Bristol Water. The water conditions are eutrophic with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), lesser pondweed (Potamogeton pusillus), opposite-leaved pondweed (Groenlandia densa) and water-crowfoot (Ranunculus spp.). On neutral soils around the reservoir, pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), burnet-saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga) and devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) occur, and on <b>calcareous</b> soils fairy flax (Linum catharticum), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor subspecies minor) are found.|$|E
