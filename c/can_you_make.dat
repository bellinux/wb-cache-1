500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrymore decided next {{to star in}} Hamlet on stage, with Arthur Hopkins directing. They {{spent six}} months preparing, cutting over 1,250 lines from the text as they did so, and Barrymore opted to play Hamlet as [...] "a man's man", {{according}} to Norden. Barrymore later described his Hamlet as a [...] "normal, healthy, lusty young fellow who simply got into a mess that was too thick for him... {{he was a great}} fencer, an athlete, a man who led an active, healthy life. How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a sickly half-wit out of a man like that?" [...] Barrymore again used Carrington as a vocal coach; rehearsals started in October, and the play opened on November 16. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. Woollcott, writing for the New York Herald, opined that it was [...] "an evening that will be memorable {{in the history of the}} American theater". while John Corbin, the drama critic for The New York Times, agreed, writing that [...] "in all likelihood we have a new and a lasting Hamlet". The reviewer for Brooklyn Life stated that Barrymore had [...] "doubtless won the right to be called the greatest living American tragedian". In 1963, Orson Welles said that Barrymore was the best Hamlet he had seen, describing the character as [...] "not so much princely– he was a man of genius who happened to be a prince, and he was tender, and virile, and witty, and dangerous".|$|E

She asked him to tell Augustenburg not to hold prejudice toward any one. After having received the King's permission to bring Augustenburg to Sweden, he asked her of her opinion. She remarked {{that he had not}} yet arrived, nor given any direct reply whether he wished the throne. He answered: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{computer}} animation {{used throughout the}} film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. When the head of production handed the script to VFX Supervisor Markus Manninen, she reportedly laughed and wished him [...] "good luck". [...] "When we started talking," [...] said Manninen, [...] "the movie was still a high concept. But for everyone that looked at it, it screamed complexity. We launched off saying, how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> this movie tangible? How can you find smart ways to bring this world to life {{in a way that}} makes it a great movie and not feel like the complexity becomes the driver of the story, but the story and the emotion being the driver?" [...] In preparation, the animators took a six-hour kung fu class.|$|E
2500|$|According to Muslim commentators, after Ibrahim {{survived the}} great fire, notoriety in society grew bigger after this event. Nimrod, {{who was the}} King of Babylon felt that his throne was in danger, {{and that he was}} losing power because upon {{witnessing}} Ibrahim coming out of the fire unharmed, a large part of society started believing in Allah and Ibrahim being a prophet of Allah. Up until this point, Nimrod was pretending that he himself was a God. Nimrod wanted to debate with him and show his people that he, the king is indeed the god and that Ibrahim was a liar. Nimrod asked Ibrahim, [...] "What can your God do that I cannot?" [...] Ibrahim replied, [...] "My Lord is He who gives life and death." [...] Nimrod then shouted, [...] "I give life and death! I can bring a person from the street and have him executed, and I can grant my pardon to a person who was sentenced to death and save his life." [...] Ibrahim replied, [...] "Well, my lord Allah makes the sun rise from the East. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> it rise from the West?" [...] Nimrod was confounded. He was beaten at his own game, on his own territory and in front of his own people. Prophet Ibrahim left him there speechless and went back to his important mission, calling people to worship the one and only God, Allah.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{portrayal}} of this character is a racist caricature. Comedian Hari Kondabolu noted the negative reaction to Apu in the Indian American community in a Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell web exclusive segment. Comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani has also criticized the character and recalled that early in his career, he was asked to do the [...] "Apu accent" [...] as a stereotypical version of the [...] "Indian accent" [...] (although Nanjiani is Pakistani, not Indian). In a 2007 interview, Azaria acknowledged some of this criticism when he recalled a conversation with the writers of the show during the inception of the character: [...] "Right away they were like 'Can you do an Indian accent and how offensive <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> it?' basically. I was like, 'It's not tremendously accurate. It's a little, uh, stereotype,' and they were like, 'Eh, that's all right.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with the Huffington Post, Azaria said it should not be expected that the character's accent would [...] "suddenly change now" [...] or that the character would be written out, saying, [...] "I'd be surprised if [...] write him any less frequently because he's offensive." [...] As of 2016, Kondabolu is set to produce a feature-length documentary entitled The Problem with Apu, on the subject of [...] "how this controversial caricature was created, burrowed its way into {{the hearts and minds of}} Americans and continues to exist —intact— twenty-six years later." ...|$|E
