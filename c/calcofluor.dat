The {{reason for this is}} due to the ability of A. candidus to reside in a wide range of environments, from showerheads to storage tanks and potted plants. The fungus can be observed microscopically in infected tissued mounted in potassium or sodium hydroxide solution containing the fluorescent brightener, <b>calcofluor</b> white, or in fungal-specific tissue stains such as Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain. Aspergillus candidus secretes cytotoxic metabolites like terphenyl compounds and terprenins, as well as citrinin and immunotoxic (1→3)-β-D-glucans.

40|$|<b>Calcofluor</b> White is a {{fluorescent}} probe that interacts with polysaccharides and {{is commonly used}} in clinical studies. Interaction between <b>Calcofluor</b> White and carbohydrate residues of alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) was previously followed by fluorescence titration of the Trp residues of the protein. A stoichiometry of one <b>Calcofluor</b> for one protein has been found [J. R. Albani and Y. D. Plancke, Caubohydr. Res., 318 (1999) 193 - 200]. alpha(1) -Acid glycoprotein contains 40 % carbohydrate by weight and has up to 16 sialic acid residues. Since binding of <b>Calcofluor</b> to alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein occurs mainly on the carbohydrate residues, we studied in the present work the interaction between <b>Calcofluor</b> and the protein by following the fluorescence change of the fluorophore. In order to establish {{the role of the}} sialic acid residues in the interaction, the experiments were performed with the sialylated and asialylated protein. Interaction of <b>Calcofluor</b> with sialylated alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein induces a red shift of the emission maximum of the fluorophore from 438 to 450 nm at saturation tone <b>Calcofluor</b> for one sialic acid) and an increase in the fluorescence intensity. At saturation the fluorescence intensity increase levels off. Binding of <b>Calcofluor</b> to asialylated acid glycoprotein does not change the position of the emission maximum of the fluorophore and induces a decrease in its fluorescence intensity. Saturation occurs when 10 molecules of <b>Calcofluor</b> are bound to 1 mol of alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein. Since the protein contains five heteropolysaccharide groups, we have 2 mol of <b>Calcofluor</b> for each group. Addition of free sialic acid to <b>Calcofluor</b> induces a continuous decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the fluorophore but does not change the position of the emission maximum. Our results confirm the presence of a defined spatial conformation of the sialic acid residues, a conformation that disappears when they are free in solution. Dynamics studies on <b>Calcofluor</b> White and the carbohydrate residues of alpha(1) -acid glycoprotein are also performed at saturating concentrations of <b>Calcofluor</b> using the red-edge excitation spectra and steady-state anisotropy studies. The red-edge excitation spectra experiments show an important shift (13 nm) of the fluorescence emission maximum of the probe. This reveals that emission of <b>Calcofluor</b> occurs before relaxation of the surrounding carbohydrate residues occurs. Emission from a non-relaxed state means that the microenvironment of bound <b>Calcofluor</b> is rigid, inducing in this way the rigidity of the fluorophore itself a result confirmed by anisotropy studies.

40|$|We have {{isolated}} several Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants {{resistant to}} <b>calcofluor</b> that contain mutations in the PBS 2 or HOG 1 genes, which encode the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and MAP kinases, respectively, of the high-osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) pathway. We report that blockage {{of either of}} the two activation branches of the pathway, namely, SHO 1 and SLN 1, leads to partial resistance to <b>calcofluor,</b> while simultaneous disruption significantly increases resistance. However, chitin biosynthesis is independent of the HOG pathway. <b>Calcofluor</b> treatment also induces an increase in salt tolerance and glycerol accumulation, although no activation of the HOG pathway is detected. Our results indicate that the antifungal effect of <b>calcofluor</b> depends on its binding to cell wall chitin but also on the presence of a functional HOG pathway. Characterization of one of the mutants isolated, pbs 2 - 14, revealed that resistance to <b>calcofluor</b> and HOG-dependent osmoadaptation are two different physiological processes. Sensitivity to <b>calcofluor</b> depends on the constitutive functionality of the HOG pathway; when this is altered, the cells become <b>calcofluor</b> resistant but also show very low levels of basal salt tolerance.

The {{viability}} of algae belonging to divisions Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta and Xantophyta has been assessed by chlorophyll autofluorescence and after staining with fluorescent dyes rodamin B, neutral rot, <b>calcofluor</b> white and fluorescein diacetate.

In conclusion, FISH and <b>Calcofluor</b> staining provide rapid, and direct information on the involvement of filamentous fungi in biofilms which form in water.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{identification}} and characterization of cellulose as an extracellular matrix component present in the biofilm of a E. sakazakii clinical isolate, after growth in nutrient deficient (M 9) media. Using a bacterial artificial cloning (BAC) approach in E. coli, with subsequent screening of transformants for fluorescence on <b>calcofluor</b> plates, nine genes organized in two operons were identified as putatively responsible for the biosynthesis of cellulose. Among the genes already described for cellulose production in E. coli two more genes were identified, putatively transcribed together with the genes from the first operon. Putative cellulose in E. sakazakii ES 5 biofilm grown on glass cover slips was visualized by <b>calcofluor</b> staining and confocal fluorescence laser scanning microscopy. For the first time, the presence of cellulose in biofilms produced by E. sakazakii was confirmed by methylation analysis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Calcofluor</b> White (a {{fluorochrome}} dye) {{affected the}} growth of Geotrichum lactis by causing lysis of cells at the hyphal tips. This effect was prevented {{by the presence of}} an osmotic stabilizer. The growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was also affected, and multicellular aggregates were formed because of incomplete separation of mother and daughter cells; fluorescence microscopy indicated the presence of abnormally thick septa. The formation of rudimentary wall material by G. lactis protoplasts was promoted by <b>Calcofluor</b> or Congo red (another dye). The rate of chitin synthesis in protoplasts and growing cells was enhanced by both dyes. In contrast, both dyes inhibited chitin and beta (1, 3) -glucan synthases in isolated cell-free systems. Degradation rates for beta (1, 3) -glucan or chitin were not affected significantly by the dyes. Wheat germ agglutinin also affected chitin synthesis in protoplasts...|$|E
40|$|The sequenced yeast genome {{offers a}} unique {{resource}} {{for the analysis}} of eukaryotic cell function and enables genome-wide screens for genes involved in cellular processes. We have identified genes involved in cell surface assembly by screening transposon-mutagenized cells for altered sensitivity to <b>calcofluor</b> white, followed by supplementary screens to further characterize mutant phenotypes. The mutated genes were directly retrieved from genomic DNA and then matched uniquely to a gene in the yeast genome database. Eighty-two genes with apparent perturbation of the cell surface were identified, with mutations in 65 of them displaying at least one further cell surface phenotype in addition to their modified sensitivity to <b>calcofluor.</b> Fifty of these genes were previously known, 17 encoded proteins whose function could be anticipated through sequence homology or previously recognized phenotypes and 15 genes had no previously known phenotype...|$|E

40|$|A <b>calcofluor</b> white stainingwas {{performed}} on the synovial fluidsample {{the next day to}} help in the identification of the possi-ble causal pathogen. The fluorescent stain showedmany true sep-tate hyphae (see Fig. S 1 in the supplemental material) that had been missed on the initial Gram stain examination. After careful review of the original Gram stain, many areas were found to show “ghost ” prints of fungi with morphologies similar to those seen on the <b>calcofluor</b> white prep. The culture of the specimen grew a moderate number of Alternaria species or-ganisms. The isolate was susceptible to amphotericin, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin. Alternaria species are members of a heterogeneous group of dematiaceous fungi that rarely cause opportunistic infections in transplant recipients. During a 20 -year period from 1989 to 2008, 8 solid organ transplant recipients (63 % males; median age, 48 years) developed Alternaria species infections at the Mayo Clini...|$|E
40|$|<b>Calcofluor</b> White ST {{was used}} to monitor the {{morphological}} events in the biogenesis of cellulose in the microcyst wall of the wild-type strain (WS- 320) and two developmental mutants (mic- 1 and mic- 2) of Polysphondylium pallidum. During encystment, the cell surface acquires a Calcofluor-specific material {{which appears to be}} cellulose because of its sensitivity to purified cellulase. Cellulose-containing vesicles appear distributed throughout the cytoplasm of encysting cells of the three strains. Later, the cellulose-rich vesicles appear near the cell surface. Subsequently, the cell surface stains with <b>Calcofluor,</b> and the vesicles are no longer detectable. Intracellular vesicles resembling the cellulose-rich vesicles in size, in the timing of appearance, and in cellular location are also seen in thin sections. These vesicles are surrounded by a single unit membrane, and their amorphous matrix, which contains a dense irregular core, further implicates them {{as the basis for the}} bilayered microcyst wall...|$|E
