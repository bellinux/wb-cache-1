40|$|Spelling {{errors are}} usually studied in dictations, but {{teachers}} report {{that children with}} school difficulties often make spelling mistakes when they <b>copy</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> too. The present study examines the performance on a text copying task and a text dictation task of two groups of children known for their difficulties in spelling, that is, 22 with symptoms of ADHD and 13 with dyslexia, comparing them with matched controls to see whether children with spelling difficulties make more copying task errors than do controls, whether they make fewer mistakes when copying than when writing under dictation, and whether the pattern of errors remains the same or differs in copy and dictation tasks. Our results show that although children with spelling difficulties made fewer errors in the copying task than under dictation, they still made phonological errors and mistakes relating to accents and duplicates. The pattern of errors differed slightly between the children with dyslexia and those with ADHD, presumably {{as a consequence of}} their different underlying weaknesses—related mainly to phonology and orthographic representation in the case of dyslexia and to attentional control in the case of ADHD...|$|E

Journal of Neuroscience Methods 122 : 43 - 57 (a pre-print version is available: [URL] Each data file is subdivided in Groups corresponding the type of acquisition performed: one or several epochs of spontaneous activity recording; repetitive stimulation with a given odor. Each group is made of one (if say a single epoch of 60 seconds of spontaneous recording was made) or several (if say 100 stimulation with Citral were made) (sub-) groups containing the data of all the channels that were recorded during that epoch. Each of these sub-groups is made of 4 to 16 data sets: 1 dimensional arrays containing the raw data recorded from one of the 16 channels of our probe (made of 4 tetrodes) during a single acquisition epoch. All channels were sampled at 15 kHz. Each data file has attributes (metadata) README and LabBook. The first, README contains a shortened version of the present text; the second, LabBook contains a transcript of the lab book corresponding to the experiment. Most groups have a log_file_content attribute. This attribute contains a <b>copy</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> file that was automatically generated during data acquisition. Some recording details can be found there as well as the precise time and data of each recorded epoch. The data were kept for 14 years on CDs and {{about a third of the}} recordings got lost because of CD corruption! What's left still make 15 GBytes of data after compression: a substantial amount. This CD corruption explains why some groups don't have a log_file_content attribute: it was on a corrupted CD. Of the 14 experiments, 12 contain antennal lobe (the first olfactory relay of insects) recordings, 1 contains antennal lobe and alpha lobe recordings and 1 contains only alpha lobe recordings. Here the alpha lobe location should be taken with a little bit of caution since the latter is not as easy to locate as the antennal lobe in the locust.

We first describe and evaluate algorithms for detecting three eye movement characteristics from EOG signals - saccades, fixations, and blinks - and propose a method for assessing repetitive patterns of eye movements. We then devise 90 different features based on these characteristics and select a subset of them using minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection (mRMR). We validate the method using an eight participant study in an office environment using an example set of five activity classes: <b>copying</b> <b>a</b> <b>text,</b> reading <b>a</b> printed paper, taking hand-written notes, watching a video, and browsing the web. We also include periods with no specific activity (the NULL class). Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and a person-independent (leave-one-out) training scheme, we obtain an average precision of 76. 1 % and recall of 70. 5 % over all classes and participants. The work demonstrates the promise of eye-based activity recognition (EAR) and opens up discussion on the wider applicability of EAR to other activities that are difficult, or even impossible, to detect using common sensing modalities...|$|R
