40|$|In this study, the {{collecting}} date <b>of</b> softwood <b>cuttings,</b> rooting media, ortet age {{and cutting}} type were investigated on Alnus glutinosa subsp. barbata (C. A. Mey.) Yalt. Rooting media and cutting type {{showed no significant}} effect on the rooting percentage (RP), ramet height (RH) and rootlet number (RN) while ortet age showed {{significant effect on the}}se parameters. The highest RP as 56. 7 and 48. 3 % were obtained for the tip cuttings and basal <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> 1 + 0 aged ortets, respectively, while the lowest RP as 0 %, was obtained for the tip <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> 2 + 0 aged ortets. Determining of the lower RP for the <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> 2 + 0 aged ortets than the <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> the older ortets can be explained together with the ortet genetic character. The highest RH (18. 3 cm) was obtained for the tip <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> the 1 + 0 aged ortets and RN (8. 3 number) was obtained for the basal <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> the same ortets. The highest mean RP were obtained for the <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> 1 + 0 aged seed originating ortets and physiologically 1 + 0 aged sprout originating ortets as 41. 35 and 35. 55 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{principle}} producing the <b>cutting</b> track <b>of</b> cutter, to study the influence <b>of</b> the <b>cutting</b> track <b>of</b> cutter {{on the process of}} high speed ball-end milling, the single-factor models for evaluating the <b>cutting</b> track <b>of</b> cutter are established. Adopting four kinds <b>of</b> the typical <b>cutting</b> track <b>of</b> cutter, the experiment of high speed ball-end milling is processed. The model of multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for the <b>cutting</b> track <b>of</b> cutter is established, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for the <b>cutting</b> track <b>of</b> high speed ball-end milling cutter is accomplished by the application of fuzzy mathematics theory. Results show that the <b>cutting</b> contact curve <b>of</b> cutter affects directly the process of high speed ball-end milling, fuzzy and uncertain properties exist in the evaluation for the <b>cutting</b> track <b>of</b> cutter. The optimum cutting track can be selected by multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for the <b>cutting</b> track <b>of</b> high speed ball-end milling cutter...|$|R
5|$|During the Great Patriotic War, a {{mounting}} of 15–40mm appliqué armour {{on about}} a hundred different T-26s was performed by local factories in Leningrad in 1941–1942, during the Siege of Odessa (1941), the Battle for Moscow and the Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942). A <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> armoured plates was more rough than developed during the Winter War; {{the majority of these}} modified tanks did not have a moving armoured gun mask as seen in Factory No. 174's original design, and some tanks had front appliqué armour only.|$|E
5|$|In 1879 Henry Colton, {{who worked}} for the Williamsport Lumber Company, {{supervised}} the <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> white pine on the land owned by Silas Billings; this land would later become the park. Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west rim of the Pine Creek Gorge. Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a trapper whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century. Fourmile Run flows through the park: its O'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper's brothers, who were loggers in the area.|$|E

Sumida strongly suspected that the saboteurs were being organised by internees in Changi Prison, and made preparations for a raid on the prison to catch the ringleaders. Sumida's chief suspect was British barrister Rob Heeley Scott, a prominent Foreign Office employee who had previously been detained for his anti-Japanese propaganda, released by the Kempeitai, and then later sent to Changi Prison.|$|E

40|$|Effects of auxin polar {{transport}} inhibitors, 2, 3, 5 -triio-dobenzoic acid (TIBA), 1 -N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and methyl 2 -chloro- 9 -hydroxyfluorene- 9 -carboxylate (morphactin IT 3456), as a lanolin paste, on root formation in <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> some species of Crassulaceae, such as Bryophyllum daigremontianum, B. calycinum, Kalanchoe blossfeldiana and K. tubiflora, were studied. <b>Cuttings</b> <b>of</b> these plants were easily rooted in water without any treatment. TIBA and morphactin IT 3456 completely inhibited root {{formation in the}} <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> these plants but NPA did not when these inhibitors were applied around the stem below the leaves. When TIBA and morphactin were applied around the stem near the top, but leaves were present below the treatment, the root formation was observed in B. calycinum and K. blossfeldiana but in a smaller degree than in control cuttings. These results strongly suggest that endogenous auxin is required for root formation in <b>cuttings</b> <b>of</b> Crassulaceae plants. The differential mode of action of NPA is discussed together with its effect on auxin {{polar transport}}...|$|R

5|$|Between Bow Bridge and Channelsea Bridge {{there were}} three others, said in 1303 to have been built to fill the gaps caused by the <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> mill streams through Maud's causeway, {{although}} {{there is evidence that}} the mills pre-dated the causeway. However, the mill owners took responsibility for the bridges, which crossed the mill streams for St Thomas's, Spileman's and Saynes mills. The last two were owned by the City of London, and the bridges were called Pegshole and St Michael's Bridges. An administrative mistake around 1814 resulted in the City of London taking responsibility for St Thomas's Bridge, but the miller did not complain as Pegshole bridge was smaller and therefore less costly to maintain. The names were eventually swapped, and all three were replaced by Groves Bridge in 1933, which crossed the widened Three Mills Wall River, the two branches of the Waterworks River having been combined into Three Mills Wall River, while Three Mills Wall Back River was filled in.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{moved into}} feature film work {{when he wrote}} and co-produced the 1979 film Starting Over. His next project was the {{critically}} acclaimed film Terms of Endearment, which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an Academy Award for all three roles. Basing his next film, Broadcast News, on his journalistic experiences, the film earned him a further two Academy Award nominations. Although his 1994 work I'll Do Anything was hampered by negative press attention due to the <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> all of its recorded musical numbers, As Good as It Gets (co-written with Mark Andrus) earned further praise. It was seven years until his next film, 2004's Spanglish. His sixth film, How Do You Know, was released in 2010. Brooks also produced and mentored Cameron Crowe on Say Anything... (1989) and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson on Bottle Rocket (1996).|$|E
5|$|Commercial logging {{had also}} been {{operating}} for years in the Trinity River country, {{but most of the}} timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high demand for housing domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, loggers took 439 million board feet from Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million board feet per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including the Wilderness Society, Audubon Society and Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> 18.4 million board feet of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.|$|E

The Top 100 theoretically takes its name from the 100 retail businesses which line Princes Street from the Octagon to the Exchange, although the actual number of businesses is not one hundred. This part of the city is sometimes seen as the creative heart of Dunedin, with numerous art galleries, video production companies, and the city's professional theatre (the Fortune Theatre) all being based in the area from Moray Place to Rattray Street.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Lumpur {{had seen}} a number of civil {{disturbances}} over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair {{that began with the}} confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place between members of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|Numerous fady protect {{wilderness}} areas, particularly {{including the}} Ankarana massif. Excessive <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> mangrove trees for wood or {{the setting of}} bush fires are both prohibited, as {{is the use of}} nets with holes less than 15 millimeters to prevent catching immature fish. Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo for a girl to wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, surgery or modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used for healing. These taboos are most strongly applied in the center of Antankarana territory around the village of Ambatoharaña and less so in the villages at the periphery of the region.|$|E

5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E
5|$|The 18th and 19thcenturies saw {{first the}} {{expansion}} of canals and then the construction of rail links. The River Derwent was canalised as far upstream as Malton and was linked to Pocklington by the <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> the Pocklington Canal. Other canals were cut to join the towns of Beverley and Driffield to the River Hull, which was also improved to aid navigation. The Market Weighton Canal connected the town directly to the Humber Estuary. An early rail link was constructed between Filey and Bridlington in 1847 and the Malton to Driffield railway {{was the first to}} cross the Wolds in 1853. These routes primarily served the agricultural community in helping to get their products to the expanding industrial markets in the West Riding of Yorkshire and to the port of Hull for export. The rail links served also to transport holidaymakers to the expanding coastal resorts of Bridlington, Hornsea and Withernsea. The canals and canalisation of some of the rivers helped to aid drainage in such of the low-lying ill-drained areas that then still existed. The landscape in the East Riding had changed little since the enclosure of the open fields in the 18th and 19thcenturies, except for the removal of some hedgerows to allow for the use of large agricultural machinery in the 20thcentury.|$|E
