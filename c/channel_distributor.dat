The statistical sensitivity analysis results show that, while the predicted average current density at the membrane/cathode interface is affected by uncertainties in a number of model parameters, the optimal designs of the PEM cathode and the interdigitated air distributor are quite robust...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Fundamental and phenomenological {{models for}} cells, stacks, and {{complete}} systems of PEFC and SOFC are reviewed and their predictive power is assessed by comparing model simulations against experiments. Computationally efficient models suited for engineering design include the (1 + 1) dimensionality approach, which decouples the membrane in-plane and through-plane processes, and the volume-averaged-method (VAM) that considers only the lumped effect of pre-selected system components. The former model {{was shown to}} capture the measured lateral current density inhomogeneities in a PEFC and the latter {{was used for the}} optimization of commercial SOFC systems. State Space Modeling (SSM) was used to identify the main reaction pathways in SOFC and, in conjunction with the implementation of geometrically well- defined electrodes, has opened a new direction for the understanding of electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, SSM has advanced the understanding of the COpoisoning- induced anode impedance in PEFC. Detailed numerical models such as the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for transport in porous media and the full 3 -D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Navier-Stokes simulations are addressed. These models contain all components of the relevant physics and they can improve the understanding of the related phenomena, a necessary condition for the development of both appropriate simplified models as well as reliable technologies. Within the LB framework, a technique for the characterization and computer- reconstruction of the porous electrode structure was developed using advanced pattern recognition algorithms. In CFD modeling, 3 -D simulations were used to investigate SOFC with internal methane steam reforming and have exemplified the significance of porous and novel fractal <b>channel</b> <b>distributors</b> for the fuel and oxidant delivery, {{as well as for the}} cooling of PEFC. As importantly, the novel concept has been put forth of functionally designed, fractal-shaped fuel cells, showing promise of significant performance improvements over the conventional rectangular shaped units. Thermo-economic modeling for the optimization of PEFC is finally addressed.
