40|$|The sum-rate {{capacity}} of a cellular system model is analyzed, considering the uplink and downlink channels, while addressing both non-fading and flat-fading channels. The focus is on a simple Wyner-like multi-cell model, where the system cells are arranged on a circle, assuming the <b>cell-sites</b> are located at {{the boundaries of the}} cells. For the uplink channel, analytical expressions of the sum-rate capacities are derived for intra-cell TDMA scheduling, and a “Wide-Band ” (WB) scheme (where all users are active simultaneously utilizing all bandwidth for coding). Assuming individual per-cell power constraints, and using the Lagrangian uplink-downlink duality principle, an analytical expression for the sum-rate {{capacity of}} the downlink channel is derived for non-fading channels, and shown to coincide with the corresponding uplink result. Introducing flat-fading, lower and upper bounds on the average per-cell sum-rate capacity are derived.

The resulting aminoacyl-d-Ala-d-Ala strand is the Achilles' heel of vancomycin-susceptible bacteria; binding of vancomycin to this sequence interferes with crosslinking and blocks <b>cell-sites.</b> wall synthesis. A mutant enzyme (VanA) from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faccium {{has been found to}} incorporate α-hydroxy acids at the terminal site instead of d-Ala; the resulting depsipeptides do not bind vancomycin, yet function in the crosslinking reaction. To investigate the binding specificity of these ligases, we examined their inhibition by a series of substrate analogs. Results: Phosphinate and phosphonate dipeptide analogs (which, after phosphorylation by the enzyme, mimic intermediates in the ligation reaction) were prepared and evaluated as reversible inhibitors of the wild-type ligases DdlA and DdlB from Escherichia coli and of the mutant enzyme VanA. Ki values were calculated for the first stage of inhibitor binding according to a mechanism in which inhibitor competes with d-Ala for both substrate binding sites. DdlA is potently inhibited by phosphinates but not by phosphonates, while DdlB and VanA show little discrimination; both series of compounds inhibit DdlB strongly and VanA weakly. Conclusions: VanA has greatly reduced affinity for all the ligands studied. The relative affinities of the inhibitors in the reversible binding step are not, however, consistent with the substrate specificities of the enzymes. We propose a mechanism in which proton transfer from the attacking nucleophile to the departing phosphate occurs directly, without intervention of the enzyme...|$|R

The study involved simulation of converging radio links over weather radar images of the radar reflectivity factor, from which the specific attenuation of rain at 30 GHz was derived. The average correlation of attenuation on two converging links as a function of their angular separation is shown to indicate the potential benefits in the use of <b>cell-site</b> diversity, especially in heavy rain. Results show that diversity gain exhibits a dependence on angular separation in the general form of sin (2).

While previous generation base stations could be considered simple voice and Internet Protocol (IP) packet transceivers, newer generation cellular base stations need to perform more of the user- and signaling functions for the cellular radio access network. If adversaries can physically break into newer base stations, they can perform a range of undesirable operations such as snooping on conversations, carrying out denial-of-service attacks on the serving area, changing the software base of the base stations, stealing authentication and encryption keys, and disrupting legitimate cellular operations. The <b>cell-site</b> vault is a secure processing environment designed to resist such tampering and to protect the sensitive functions associated with cellular processing. It provides an execution environment where ciphering functions, key management, and associated functions can execute without leaking sensitive information.

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} a wireless system of multiple cells, each having a {{downlink shared channel}} in support of high-speed packet data services. In practice, such a system consists of hierarchically organized entities including a central server, Base Stations (BSs), and Mobile Stations (MSs). Our goal is to improve global resource utilization and reduce regional congestion given asymmetric arrivals and departures of mo-bile users, a goal requiring load balancing among multiple cells. For this purpose, we propose a scalable cross-layer framework to coordinate packet-level scheduling, call-level <b>cell-site</b> selection and handoff, and system-level cell cover-age based on load, throughput, and channel measurements. In this framework, an opportunistic scheduling algorithm—the weighted Alpha-Rule—exploits the gain of multiuser diversity in each cell independently, trading aggregate (mean) down-link throughput for fairness and minimum rate guarantees among MSs. Each MS adapts to its channel dynamics and the load fluctuations in neighboring cells, in accordance with MSs ’ mobility or their arrival and departure, by initiating load-aware handoff and <b>cell-site</b> selection. The central server adjusts schedulers of all cells to coordinate their coverage by prompting cell breathing or distributed MS handoffs. Across the whole system, BSs and MSs constantly monitor their load, throughput, or channel quality {{in order to facilitate}} the overall system coordination.
