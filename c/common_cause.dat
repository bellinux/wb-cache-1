5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus is {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are at {{increased}} risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction. It is the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of infection in this population, as well as the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hospitalization. Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus {{are known}} to cause viral {{gastroenteritis}}. Rotavirus is the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> in adults due to acquired immunity. Norovirus is the cause in about 18% of all cases.|$|E

5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism {{is a state of}} insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the third most common cancer in the UK (around 46,400 people were {{diagnosed}} with the disease in 2014), {{and it is the}} most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of cancer death (around 35,900 people died in 2014).|$|E

5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol. Because of {{its wide}} availability paired with comparably high toxicity, (compared to ibuprofen and aspirin) {{there is a}} much higher potential for overdose. Paracetamol toxicity {{is one of the}} most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of drug overdoses. Additionally, in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of acute liver failure.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide, {{too little}} iodine {{in the diet}} is the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism. In {{countries}} with enough iodine in the diet, the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine, and their venom has been studied for bioactive factors. In 1993 Margatoxin was synthesized from the venom of the Central American bark scorpion, Centruroides margaritatus. This peptide selectively inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels.

5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the English Cocker Spaniel had a median age of eleven years and two months. According to the survey, the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of death for both breeds was cancer, while old age was the second most <b>common</b> <b>cause.</b> The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include ear infections, and a variety of eye problems. A large number of breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia. In {{a survey conducted}} by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with 1 being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic. The English Cocker was ranked 129th.|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, the most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually {{does not affect the}} production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous. The risk of being poisoned nowadays lies more in the accidental factor, where poison be induced or taken by accident. Poisoning is the 4th most <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> of death within young people. Accidental ingestions are most common in children less than 5 years old.|$|E

Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
