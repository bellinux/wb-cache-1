40|$|Weed {{seeds are}} {{scattered}} over the farm artificially and naturally. Many times man distributes weed seeds when he plants his crop by using crop seeds which contain weed seeds. Again he may scatter many weed seeds when he manures his land. Animals distribute seeds by carrying them in their hair as they do the cockle bur and sand bur, or they may eat certain seeds and pass them through the digestive tract unharmed and viable. Nature has provided {{many ways in which}} to distribute seeds but the two most important natural agencies are wind and water. Annual weeds can be quite easily controlled by cultivation, thereby keeping them from going to seed. The perennial weeds, especially those propogating vegetatively by rhizomes and rootstocks are very difficult to eradicate when once started on a farm. Therefore, the greatest precaution should be taken to avoid introducing noxious weed seeds on the land. The prevalent belief that weed seeds pass uninjured through the digestive tract of farm animals and still remain viable is based mostly upon observation and to some extent upon experimental results. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the percentage of weed seeds that will pass uninjured through the digestive tract of different farm animals, the percentage of recovered seeds which are viable, and how long they will remain viable in a manure pile which is going through the process of fermentation and decomposition.

We evaluated {{the role of}} SIA {{in a group of}} patients with severe lower extremity arterial occlusive disease. Methods: During a 2. 5 -year period, 39 patients with arterial occlusions (median length, 8 cm; range, 2 to 31 cm) were treated on an intention-to-treat basis with SIA. Twenty-five patients had gangrene, five had rest pain, and nine had disabling (<one block) claudication. There were 24 superficial femoral, two superficial-femoral-popliteal, four popliteal, two popliteal-tibial, five tibial, and two external iliac artery lesions. With fluoroscopic guidance, via a prograde <b>common</b> femoral artery <b>puncture</b> (n = 29) or a contralateral <b>common</b> femoral artery <b>puncture</b> (n = 9), a subintimal dissection plane was created across the occlusion with a standard guidewire and catheter. The arterial lumen was reentered distal to the occlusion, and the recanalized segment balloon was dilated. All patients were followed prospectively with arterial duplex scan. Results: SIA was technically successful in 34 of 39 patients (87 %). All five failures were from an inability to reenter the patent lumen distally. These five patients underwent successful bypasses that in no case were more distal than would have been required before SIA. In the 34 technically successful SIAs, pain completely resolved (14 / 14) and areas of gangrene (21 / 25) healed. The cumulative patency rate in patients who underwent successful SIA was 74 % ± 10 % at 12 months. The mean increase in ankle-brachial index after SIA was 0. 34 (range, 0. 1 to 0. 69). There were two distal embolic events, successfully treated surgically (n = 1) or with catheter-directed techniques (n = 1). Three patients underwent subsequent bypass, and the remaining five patients remain asymptomatic. Conclusion: SIA is feasible and can be effective in some patients with lower extremity arterial occlusions and threatened limbs. These results, plus SIA's many advantages, support an increasing role for it in the treatment of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 386 - 91. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given the {{frequent}} involvement of infra-popliteal arteries, an ipsilateral antegrade <b>common</b> femoral artery <b>puncture</b> (ACFAP) is usually preferred to a contralateral retrograde femoral access for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) {{in patients with}} critical limb ischemia (CLI). Because of {{the frequent}} difficulty to get a sufficient manual pressure on the puncture site, ACFAP is burdened by {{a high number of}} bleeding local complications, including retroperitoneal haematoma. We report a series of patients who consecutively received a clip-based arterial closure device after ACFAP and ipsilateral PTA for CLI. METHODS: Thirty patients (73 +/- 6 years; 18 men; 100 % diabetes) admitted to our hospital because of CLI consecutively underwent peripheral PTA after an ACFAP and received a clip-based arterial closure device. Time to haemostasis was defined as the interval elapsed between clip deployment and first observed haemostasis. All patients were mobilized after 6 h. Follow-up was 30 days. RESULTS: All patients were on double anti-platelet therapy. At the end of the procedure, Activation Clotting Time was 226 +/- 37 s. Procedural success in delivering the clip was 100 %. Time to haemostasis was 21 +/- 19 s. No major local vascular complications and in particular no retroperitoneal bleeding were documented. All patients could be discharged within the following 3 days.

Based on an April 2009 cross-sectional survey of vascular access cannulation practices in 171 dialysis units, a cohort of patients with corresponding vascular access survival information was selected for follow-up ending March 2012. Of the 10, 807 patients enrolled in the original survey, access survival data were available for 7058 patients from nine countries. Of these, 90. 6 % had an arteriovenous fistula and 9. 4 % arteriovenous graft. Access needling was by area technique for 65. 8 %, rope-ladder for 28. 2 %, and buttonhole for 6 %.

40|$|Introduction: There are {{indications}} that the pain parturients experience during labor {{is one of the}} most intense pain experiences known. Epidural analgesia (“an epidural”) is a widely used central neuraxial block very suitable for perinatal analgesia. The most <b>common</b> used <b>puncture</b> site for epidural analgesia is in the lumbar region. Given the fact that most pain experienced during the first phase of labor originates from the low thoracic (T 10 - L 1) spinal segments, we hypothesized that a epidural catheter placed in the lower thoracic epidural space would result in better analgesia and less instrumental assisted vaginal deliveries and caesarian sections than a catheter placed in the lumbar epidural space. Methods: To test this hypothesis, two studies were set up. Firstly a retrospective assessment of all epidurals during labor performed in the Deventer Hospital the past four years, to assess possible effects on primary labor outcome. Secondly a prospective observational study in which we included all parturients who received lumbar (L 1 -L 5) or thoracic (T 10 -L 1) epidural analgesia. We recorded pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the frequency of escape bolus requests during the first phase of labor. Results: The retrospective study had usable data from 1172 patients. Ninety-six received an epidural catheter in the thoracic region and 1096 a lumbar one. We found no significant differences in incidence of caesarian sections, spontaneous deliveries and instrumental deliveries. APGAR scores and total labor time were not significantly different. In the prospective study we included 44 patients. Thirteen had a thoracic and 31 a lumbar epidural catheter. While graphical representation did look promising, there were no significant differences in VAS scores, amount of escape bolus requests and time until escape bolus requests. A trend showing patients in the thoracic epidural group requiring less time between the puncture and transition to the delivery phase was seen. Conclusion: We found no significant difference in VAS pain scores reported by parturients with epidural catheters on lumbar or thoracic levels. Though there {{are indications}} that there are differences in the degree of analgesia and other labor parameters between the two epidural level modalities, such as a shorter total labor time and fewer escape bolus requests in the thoracic group, our results remain inconclusive. More research is needed to further objectify the difference in pain relief and labor outcome by thoracic and lumbar epidurals. ...|$|R
