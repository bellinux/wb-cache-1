40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{historically}} proven elements <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> harvesting planning is determining the amount of each roundwood - assortment, which defines the expected volume and quality <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> that will {{be obtained from the}} still standing forest stand intended for harvesting. Assortment proposal goes out from terrain measuring, and the resulting assortment is, after adjustments caused by the market opportunities, the basis for the felling projects. The volume and quality <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> in the stand depends on a number of factors that affected the forest {{at the time of its}} evolution, but especially during its silvicultural treatments. The assortment of the stand is largely influenced by the forest segmentation while thinning when the light profit, changing of the precipitation regime, damaging the roots by machines, soil compaction and others, affect both the volume and quality of wood close to the striproads. A higher proportion of striproads correlate with a higher proportion of trees which are affected in this way. This has a negative impact on the economy, because it can be assumed that the reduced quality <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> will even lower the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> harvested <b>timber.</b> Therefore, the work aims to assess the extent how the choice of accessing can affect the timber conversion...|$|R
50|$|After local {{postmistress}} Nancy Andrews donated {{a substantial}} {{parcel of land}} {{for the purpose of}} establishing an ambulance station next to the Duaringa Post Office, the Rockhampton Ambulance Committee engaged the services of architect Edward Hegvold to draw up plans for the proposed building. Once the plans were approved, the voluntary labour commenced construction. Six local residents donated timber, gravel and sand for concreting. Falling, loading, haulage and <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>timber</b> was done free of charge. Working bees were held over a number of months which is involved a total of about 80 personnel. 43 people assisted with the foundations and concreting, 30 worked on the carpentry and plumbing, 14 people helped with the painting while two people installed the electrical work.|$|R
40|$|Speech is {{the basis}} of human communication: in {{everyday}} life we automatically decode speech into language regardless of who speaks. In a similar way, {{we have the ability to}} recognize di erent speakers, despite the linguistic content of the speech. Additionally to the voice individuality of the speaker, the particular prosody of speech involves relevant information concerning the identity, age, social group or economical status of the speaker, helping us identify the person to whom we are talking without seeing the speaker. Voice conversion systems deal with the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> a speech signal to sound as if it was uttered by another speaker. It has been an important amount of work in the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>timber</b> <b>of</b> the voice, the spectral features, meanwhile the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> pitch and the way it temporarily evolves, modeling the speaker dependent prosody, is mostly achieved by just controlling the level and range. This thesis focuses on prosody conversion, proposing an approach based on a wavelet transformation of the pitch contours. It has been performed a study of the wavelet domain, discerning among the di erent timing of the prosodic events, thus allowing an improved modeling of them. Consequently, the prosody conversion is achieved in the wavelet domain, using regression techniques originally developed for the spectral features conversion, in voice conversion systems...|$|R

Climate change policies can affect both forest value and optimal forest management {{as they relate to}} and affect future decisions regarding the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> forest land into dairying. These decisions are also affected by uncertainty in climate change policy and uncertainties in the prices <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> milk and carbon dioxide. Conventional discounted cash flow valuation techniques cannot model these contingent future decisions and uncertainties so an alternative valuation approach based on real options techniques is required. This shows that climate change policies either adopted or being considered in New Zealand do indeed affect both forest value and the rate at which forests are likely to be converted into dairying but not always as expected...|$|R

40|$|There are {{significant}} commercial forestry activities in Botswana and in Zimbabwe. Operations in Botswana, unlike those in Zimbabwe, {{are limited to}} the felling and milling of indigenous timber. Zimbabwean operations include large- scale production, milling, and secondary <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber.</b> Technologies used in all these operations are basically traditional but generally satisfactory with respect to reliability and with respect to meeting market product specifications. In general, the industry in both countries takes a positive view to emerging technologies and attempts to keep abreast with developments in this area. The industry is, however, cautious about adopting these technologies. This caution derives mostly from the apparent satisfactory operations from the current technologies and from some fear of possible difficulties which may arise with respect to indigenizing these technologies once adopted. Besides these considerations, capacity exists for Zimbabwe particularly to engage some of these technologies. The most promising ones for Zimbabwe are {{in the area of}} secondary biobleaching for the expanding pulp and paper industry, timber drying kilns to enable effective control of timber delivery times, and information technology for operations management. ETs potential for Botswana is more limited. Prospects are greatest in timber waste conversion to charcoal and in localised power generation using timber wastes from field and sawmill operations. Any acquisition or development of these technologies will, however, be individual company effort without any significant assistance from government or from parent multinational companies...|$|E

Whilst wood-based panels, including oriented strand board (OSB), wood chipboard and cement bonded particleboard and medium density fibreboard (MDF) and other fibreboard are all manufactured in UK, laminated timber products are largely import-ed. In some ways this is an advantage; there are many manufacturers of wood products and there are competing suppliers for projects. On the other hand, the UK market is reliant on suppliers from outside the country providing sales and support services and products carry the burden of high transport costs.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a study <b>of</b> shipbuilding and <b>timber</b> {{management in the}} Royal Dockyards in the period 1750 – 1850, focusing on an archaeological investigation <b>of</b> ship <b>timber</b> marks. The first chapter outlines the concept <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> marking in shipbuilding contexts, stressing the multi-disciplinary approach to the study highlighted in the available archaeological and documentary evidence by which the practice <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> marking can be understood. Chapter two outlines the background to timber marking in the Georgian era {{and the development of}} the practice within the broader advances made in shipbuilding, technology and design prior {{to the end of the}} 17 th century. Chapter three outlines the developments in shipbuilding and the introduction of systems to control and standardise the management <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> in the Royal Dockyards in the 18 th century. In the latter half of the 18 th century we will see the attempts of naval reformers to develop these systems <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> management and pave the way for the sweeping changes made at the beginning of the 19 th century. Chapter four highlights these changes with the introduction <b>of</b> the <b>Timber</b> Masters and looks at the nature <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> management and the marking <b>of</b> <b>timbers</b> as identified in documentary sources. This evidence lays the foundation for the understanding <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> marking in the 19 th century as witnessed in the archaeological record. The remaining chapters present the much more extensive archaeological evidence for timber marking among several high profile assemblages. The main assemblages presented in Chapters 5 to 9 show the diversity <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> marking practices and how they relate to the working processes of the Royal Dockyards. The research offers new insights into the understanding of shipbuilding and the management <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> in the Royal Dockyards between 1750 and 1850 and explores the possibilities for further avenues of study.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} a combined constant drying-rate and diffusion model to simulate the drying <b>of</b> Pinus Radiata <b>timber</b> under kiln-drying conditions. The constant drying-rate and diffusion coefficients of the model, which control the drying rate of individual pieces <b>of</b> <b>timber,</b> were determined from calibrating the model against the experimental drying curves obtained under the kiln-drying conditions. The experimental drying curves were obtained from the gravimetric measurements of the moisture content <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> during kiln drying. Statistical relationships were developed for the constant drying-rate and the diffusion coefficients of the model as functions of kiln temperature and the dry basis density <b>of</b> <b>timber.</b> To determine the effects <b>of</b> variability <b>of</b> <b>timber,</b> a simulation scheme was developed based on the model, the probability distribution of the density <b>of</b> <b>timber,</b> the equations for the constant drying-rate coefficient and the diffusion coefficient.
