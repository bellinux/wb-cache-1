5|$|The {{town has}} two {{institutions}} of higher learning. Quincy College has a campus located in <b>Cordage</b> Park. The Plymouth campus opened in 1991, and the college's main campus is in Quincy. Curry College has a campus at {{the northern edge of}} Plymouth Center in the Citizens Bank building. The campus opened in 1994, and the main campus is located in Milton. While the University of Massachusetts Boston does not have a campus in Plymouth, it offers some courses at another location in <b>Cordage</b> Park.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth {{is one of}} two termini of the Kingston/Plymouth Old Colony Line of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's {{commuter}} rail, providing non-peak {{service to}} Braintree and as far north as Boston's South Station. The Plymouth MBTA station is near <b>Cordage</b> Park in North Plymouth, along Route 3A. (The other terminus is in Kingston and has more frequent train arrivals and departures. Its station is behind the Independence Mall.) No other railroad lines pass through the town.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Barkley went to Emory College (now part of Emory University) in Oxford, Georgia, the {{alma mater}} of several administrators {{and faculty members}} at Marvin. During the 1897–1898 {{academic}} year, he {{was active in the}} debating society and the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, but he could not afford to continue his education and returned to Clinton after the spring semester. He took a job teaching at Marvin College but did not make enough money to meet his basic living expenses. He resigned in December 1898 to move with his parents to Paducah, Kentucky, the county seat of McCracken County, where his father found employment at a <b>cordage</b> mill.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, after India {{became a}} republic, the Indian Standards Institute (now the BIS) {{brought out the}} first {{official}} specifications for the flag. These were revised in 1964 {{to conform to the}} metric system which was adopted in India. The specifications were further amended on 17 August 1968. The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and hemp <b>cordage.</b> The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the manufacturing process can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} {{presence}} in the region dates to 8,000years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds. About 2,000years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until about 500CE. Baskets, <b>cordage</b> nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1893, {{a number of}} {{industrial}} firms, including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the National <b>Cordage</b> Company went bankrupt. The resulting bank runs and failures {{became known as the}} Panic of 1893. In June of that year, President Grover Cleveland, who believed that the Panic was caused by the inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, called a special session of Congress in order to repeal it. The act was repealed on November 1, 1893. On June 13, 1898, Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars. Silver dollar production rose again, until the bullion was exhausted in 1904, when it ceased.|$|E
50|$|From the {{beginning}} {{the aim of}} the shipyard was to build the galleys for the Aragonese Armada. The shipyard was also a naval arsenal, which was used to store galleys and all the rigging and apparatus needed. The arsenal also produced a great deal of material, both sales and <b>cordages</b> for the ships and arms for the men. Naval arsenals of the time, normally, had to produce and store food also.|$|R

She seldom spoke: she ate and drank when food was brought to her: she was {{conscious}} neither of cold nor of wet, of well-being or ill. She sat upon a pile of <b>cordages</b> in the stern of the ship leaning against the taffrail and in imagination seeing the coast of England fade into illimitable space.|$|R
5|$|Nearly 78 {{percent of}} the {{estimated}} 26,000 trees harvested for use at Chetro Ketl were felled between 1030 and 1060. More than 7,000 trees were felled for kiva (round room) construction alone, with approximately 750 used in the great kiva. Roofs typically consisted of primary beams, secondary beams, {{and one or two}} layers of split shakes, probably of a juniper species or pinyon pine, which were locally available. Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine. In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. <b>Cordage</b> was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting mortar and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built into the wall interiors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} brings {{new knowledge}} on the particularities concerning the compared {{anatomy of the}} cardiac particular parts. It involved a number of 12 dissected pig hearts where there were some anatomical aspects worth mentioning on the valve, muscular and papillary forms, and also on the tendinous <b>cordages</b> of the left ventricle. Compared to the classical descriptions, especially concerning the human hearts, in this case, the observations made on pig hearts revealed {{that there is a}} large variety from one individual to another regarding the distribution of the muscular forms found. They are singled or multi papillary, they have a variable origin and a different distribution of the tendinous <b>cordages</b> concerning their insertion on the atria-ventricular valves. These aspects are high lightened also by the original photo images included in this paper. The observations made on this forms reveals the fact that at swine there is no common feature to be established regarding the shape and ventricular-valves distribution of these forms. On the other hand, the papillary septal and marginal forms appear constantly, but they are variable from one individual to another regarding the origin and distribution. They are seen as having {{an important role in the}} myocardial distribution of their own cardiac excite-conductive system. The forms noticed in the left ventricle are much more developed compared to the right one. From a physiological and clinical aspect, we concluded that the anatomical particularities found and described are very difficult to correlate with the individual’s specific cardiac activity...|$|R

The bitterness of remorse paralysed his thinking faculties. Martin-Roget's savage words struck upon his senses like blows from a sledge-hammer. He knew that nothing but his own folly was the cause of Yvonne's and his own misfortune. Yvonne had been safe from all evil fortune under the protection of her fine young English husband; he--the father who should have been her chief protector--had dragged her by brute force away from that husband's care and had landed her ... where?... A shudder like acute ague went through the unfortunate man's whole body as he thought of the future.|$|R
30|$|Ramie from a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant of the Urticaceae family {{is one of}} the most important bast plant fibers and has a silky luster. It is superior to cotton and silk in length and strength [19 – 21]. Ramie fibers have been applied to an increasing number of textile products including canvas, clothing fabrics, towels, <b>cordages,</b> and garments, due to their high tenacity, excellent thermal conductivity, good comfort, and significant tensile properties [21 – 23]. China and several other Asian countries are main producing areas of ramie fiber [24, 25]. Functional modification of ramie fibers is one way to promote product value and satisfy the increasing needs from consumers. Regarding modifications of ramie, Zheng et al. coated ramie fabrics with titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles via a dip-pad-dry process [26]. The ramie fabrics treated with TiO 2 showed antibacterial and UV-protective properties. However, the research focused on the functionalization of ramie with nanoparticles is very limited.|$|R
25|$|Although {{wood was}} {{plentiful}} in Oregon, {{construction of a}} ship required <b>cordage,</b> cloth for sails, {{and a range of}} other materials that were available only from the Hudson's Bay Company store at Fort Vancouver. John McLoughlin, Chief Factor at Fort Vancouver, was ill disposed to provide these.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} working under Wallace H. Carothers at E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company invented a plastic that can be drawn into strong, silk-like fibers. Nylon soon became popular as a fabric for hosiery as well as industrial applications such as <b>cordage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Kauai Heritage Center of Hawaiian Culture and the Arts {{was founded}} in 1998. Their mission is to nurture {{a greater sense of}} {{appreciation}} and respect for the Hawaiian culture.

25|$|Some Mississippian culture pottery was {{decorated}} with textile imprints on them. Vegetal <b>cordage</b> or netting was impressed sometimes over the entire external surface of a vessel. Some archaeologists theorize that the textiles used for the imprints were older fabrics that were past their use as garments. Corncobs were also used to create texture on pots.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{on board}} sailing ships the {{boatswain}} {{was in charge}} of a ship's anchors, <b>cordage,</b> colours, deck crew and the ship's boats. The boatswain would also {{be in charge of the}} rigging while the ship was in dock. The boatswain's technical tasks were modernised with the advent of steam engines and subsequent mechanisation.|$|E
25|$|Kicking straps / boom vangs, which {{control a}} boom-footed sail's leech tension by exerting {{downward}} force mid-boom. Normally {{this is a}} system of highly geared blocks, of flexible stainless steel wire and low stretch <b>cordage</b> but recently some sail boats have a short spar instead, often of carbon fibre. When sailing downwind the kicking strap (kicker) is tensioned to stop the boom lifting.|$|E
25|$|By 1900, Covington was {{the second-largest}} city and {{industrial}} region in Kentucky. At the time, its population of almost 43,000 was about 12% foreign-born and 5% black. Before World War I, it {{was connected to}} the Chesapeake & Ohio and Louisville & Nashville railways and offered steamboat service to ports on the Ohio River. Its factories had expanded to include cotton goods, machinery, and <b>cordage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rizal was {{implicated in}} the {{activities}} of the nascent rebellion and in July 1892, was deported to Dapitan in the province of Zamboanga, a peninsula of Mindanao. There he built a school, a hospital and a water supply system, and taught and engaged in farming and horticulture. Abaca, then the vital raw material for <b>cordage</b> and which Rizal and his students planted in the thousands, was a memorial.|$|E
25|$|The brig's {{foremast}} {{is smaller}} than the main mast. The fore mast holds a fore sail, fore top sail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal. Between the fore mast and the bowsprit are the fore staysail, jib, and flying jib. All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of <b>cordage</b> named the running rigging. This is opposed to the standing rigging which is fixed, and keeps mast and other objects rigid.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} backpack {{design is}} a bag {{attached to a}} set of shoulder straps. Such packs are used for general transportation of goods, and have variable capacity. The simplest designs consist of one main pocket. This may be combined with webbing or <b>cordage</b> straps, while more sophisticated models add extra pockets, waist straps, chest straps, padded shoulder straps, padded backs, and sometimes reflective materials for added safety at night. These packs are generally produced inexpensively.|$|E
25|$|In {{between these}} two tasks, Charlotte twice sailed to the Elbe. The first voyage was in 1823. Within a year she sailed again and arrived there on 12 August 1824. She was too large to arrive at Hamburg. On one voyage she brought back a cargo valued at Rs225,327. It {{consisted}} of iron and steel, canvas, <b>cordage,</b> masts and spars, spelter, and turpentine. On her return she paid the EIC 3.5% of the prime cost. She also paid 4% Town Duty on piece goods.|$|E
25|$|Sir John Call {{argued the}} {{advantages}} of Norfolk Island {{in that it was}} uninhabited and that New Zealand flax grew there. In 1786 the British government included Norfolk Island as an auxiliary settlement, as proposed by John Call, in its plan for colonisation of New South Wales. The decision to settle Norfolk Island was taken due to Empress Catherine II of Russia's decision to restrict sales of hemp. Practically all the hemp and flax required by the Royal Navy for <b>cordage</b> and sailcloth was imported from Russia.|$|E
25|$|Cunninghams, which {{tighten the}} luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling {{downward}} on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. The {{idea is to}} flatten the main sail in heavier weather or when sailing to windward. In its simplest form a stainless steel hook that goes through the cringle. From the hook a <b>cordage</b> tail passes through a turnblock on the deck {{at the base of}} the mast and back to a cleat on the deck. Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May 1795 Strachan, in , was {{in command}} of a {{squadron}} that attacked and destroyed a French convoy in Cartaret Bay. The British squadron spotted a convoy of 13 vessels and immediately gave chase. Twelve of the quarry escaped and got close to the shore where a small shore battery, their own armed escorts, and a brig and a lugger offered some protection. Strachan sent in the boats from the vessels in his squadron while Melampus and the ships provided covering fire. The French crews abandoned their vessels at {{the approach of the}} British and eventually the shore battery also stopped firing. The cutting out party retrieved all the vessels, save a small sloop, which was hard ashore and which they burnt. Melampus had eight men wounded and in all the British lost one man killed and 14 wounded. They captured a gun brig and a gun lugger, each armed with three 18-pounder guns. They also captured the convoy, which consisted of: Prosperitte (80 tons and carrying <b>cordage),</b> Montagne (200 tons and carrying timber, lead and tin plates), Catharine (200 tons and carrying ship timber), Hyrondelle (220 tons and carrying ship timber and pitch), Contente (250 tons, carrying powder), Nymphe (120 tons carrying fire wood), Bonne-Union (150 tons), Fantazie (45 tons carrying coals), Alexandre (397 and carrying ship timber, <b>cordage,</b> hemp and cannon), and Petit Neptune (113 tons and carrying ship timber). A later prize money report added the names of two more vessels, Crachefeu and Eclair. Crachefeu was the gun-brig and Eclair the gun-lugger; the Royal Navy took both into service.|$|E
25|$|A pump drill is {{a simple}} tool used to make holes in light {{materials}} by hand {{and has been in}} use for centuries. The drill itself is composed of: the drill shaft, a narrow board with a hole through the center, a weight (usually a heavy disc) acting as a flywheel, and a length of cord. The weight is attached {{near the bottom of the}} shaft and the hole board is slipped over the top. The <b>cordage</b> is run through a hole near the top of the shaft and affixed to either end of the hole board so that it hangs just above the weight. The end of the shaft usually has a square hole made to fit certain sized auger bits or a simple triangular bit made to cut while rotating in both directions.|$|E
25|$|Romantic {{descriptions}} of the beauty, mild climate, and fertile soil of Norfolk Island in the South Pacific led the British government to establish a subsidiary settlement of the New South Wales colony there in 1788. It was hoped that the giant Norfolk Island pine trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might {{provide the basis for}} a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making <b>cordage</b> and sails for the ships of the British navy. However, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807. The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.|$|E
25|$|The Fishing Heritage Gallery {{tells the}} story of 6,000 years of fishing. This artifact-rich gallery {{highlights}} 6,000 years of fishing along Florida's Gulf coast. Displays focus on the fishing industry of the Calusa, their predecessors, and traditions that carried into the 20th century. We explore the significance of maritime adaptation as a basis for social and political complexity. Included are topics such as fish, nets, native and post-contact fishing techniques, watercraft, and waterworks. Visitors will learn about the remarkable engineering endeavors of the Calusa, who constructed large canals across southwest Florida; and the long-lived net-fishing tradition. Interactive multimedia stations illustrate topics such as net making and <b>cordage</b> manufacture, and a miniature diorama of a fishing village captures the essence of Calusa fishing. Artifacts include 1,000-year-old palm-fiber fishing nets, Calusa net-making tools, a wide range of shell tools, and an ancient wooden canoe paddle.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of the cord spin twist wrapped on the paddle is either S, left to right, or Z, right to left. The type appears in E Virginia earlier (a mix of twist pre-200 CE), and through to Vermont {{after the end of}} the Middle Woodland period about CE 800. During the Sponemann phase (750-800 CE), Sponemann Site is the type site for non-American Bottom migrants making a high amount of Z-Twist pottery using chert for temper. These non-residents are a significant influx into the area with the first significant evidence for maize before the occurrence of the cities of Cahokia people. The other dominant phase in the region of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers confluence is the Patrick Phase. These people existed from 1350-1150 BP. Like Sponemann people, they were more complex than bands, but, less complex than chiefdoms and the indicators are not present that would show a ranking and stratification society). Patrick Phase pottery is marked predominantly with S-twist <b>cordage.</b>|$|E
