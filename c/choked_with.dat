5|$|From {{within the}} pocket, German {{formations}} seeking an escape route were filtering through {{gaps in the}} Allied lines between Trun and Chambois, heading towards the ridge from the west. The Poles could see the road from Chambois <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> troops and vehicles attempting to pass along the Dives valley. A number of columns moving down from the northeast that included tanks and self-propelled artillery were subjected to an hour-long bombardment from the 1st Armoured Regiment's 3rd Squadron, breaking them up and scattering their infantry.|$|E
5|$|Kaminsky {{stands up}} Incanto while he waits at a restaurant. He leaves, murdering a {{slightly}} overweight prostitute who injures {{him in a}} struggle. Incanto is forced to flee before he can fully dissolve the body. At the autopsy, Scully finds that the body's airways are <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> the same substance that dissolved Lauren. The State Genetic Lab report reveals that the skin under the victim's nails contains no oils or fatty acids, convincing Mulder that the killer is sucking body fat from his victims.|$|E
5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E

5|$|The oldest known tetrapodomorph is Kenichthys from China, dated {{at around}} 395 million years old. Two of the {{earliest}} tetrapodomorphs, dating from 380 Ma, were Gogonasus and Panderichthys. They had choanae and used their fins to move through tidal channels and shallow waters <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> dead branches and rotting plants. Their fins {{could have been used}} to attach themselves to plants or similar while they were lying in ambush for prey. The universal tetrapod characteristics of front limbs that bend forward from the elbow and hind limbs that bend backward from the knee can plausibly be traced to early tetrapods living in shallow water. Pelvic bone fossils from Tiktaalik shows, if representative for early tetrapods in general, that hind appendages and pelvic-propelled locomotion originated in water before terrestrial adaptations.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash was}} only {{accessible}} to vehicles via a single residential street. With {{the surge of}} rescue personnel who converged on the area, the roads leading to the site soon became <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> traffic. Emergency vehicle drivers abandoned their vehicles counter to established policy {{in the course of}} the rescue efforts. This prevented other vehicles from being able to access the crash area. The road was so impassible, many rescue workers left their vehicles miles away and made it to the scene on foot. Fog also grounded rescue helicopters for two hours. As a result, many critically injured survivors were not evacuated until 23:30. Eventually, four helicopters from the New York City Police Aviation Unit evacuated 21 people from the crash site. There were also major problems with communication by rescuers. Radio frequencies became overloaded and authorities on site were unable to make command decisions in some cases. The head of surgery of the Nassau County Medical Center was present at the scene but unable to direct patients to the best locations because many rescuers were radioing the center itself to get advice on where they should send the survivors. Medical professionals on site reported that some hospitals received the most up-to-date information by watching the news coverage. Despite these problems, however, only three of the passengers found alive died of their injuries.|$|E

25|$|Two {{hundred years}} after the {{construction}} of Ptolemy's canal, Cleopatra {{seems to have had}} no west–east waterway passage, because the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, which fed Ptolemy's west–east canal, had by that time dwindled, being <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> silt.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of the canal, between Higham and Gravesend, continued to be used until 1934. It suffered bomb damage during World War II, and some areas have been back-filled or are <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> reed growth.

25|$|The {{project was}} {{conceived}} in the 1970s by the Boston Transportation Planning Review {{to replace the}} rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to Logan Airport, and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, Michael Dukakis (governor) and Fred Salvucci (secretary of transportation) {{came up with the}} strategy of tying the two projects together—thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.|$|E

The advance guard avoided the trap and {{delivered}} Empress Matilda safely to Gloucester, but the queen's army destroyed the Angevin main body as an effective fighting force; only remnants managed to escape. Robert of Gloucester's soldiers held together, but when his soldiers reached the Test they could go no further.

25|$|Meanwhile, Army Group A had cut the BEF's {{lines of}} {{communication}} into France and driven it back towards the coast at Dunkirk, cutting off the British troops at Calais and Boulogne from the main force. When planning the evacuation from Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo), the BEF's commanders decided that Calais and Boulogne should still be held as supply points for further fighting or possible exit points for a final withdrawal. On 17 May, 1st S/L Bty was ordered back to Calais, a move made difficult because all the roads were <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> refugees. There it operated in the S/L role to defend the port.|$|E

A bus took the ATS to Port Chalmers, which was <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> vehicles, where residents from Aramoana briefed the group about the township and Gray. ATS members took a reconnaissance flight over the township in an RNZAF UH-1H Iroquois helicopter. The helicopter initially flew high as it had no armour from small arms fire; Gray had shot at a private news helicopter earlier that morning.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> plants with dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
25|$|The BEF {{began its}} planned {{advanced}} into Belgium, but the German Army {{broke through the}} Ardennes, forcing the BEF to withdraw again, the AA batteries giving cover leap-frog fashion. Soon they were sucked into the ground battle, split into sub-units to join rearguard actions or moved back from one key point to another, with all the roads <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> refugees. By 21 May, 151st Bty had A Trp defending Hazebrouck, where an enemy aircraft was brought down, while B Trp was at Merville. Next, A Trp went to the defence of Cassel, where it was attacked by tanks and aircraft. One gun was hit and one had to be abandoned. Second Lieutenant Forbes went out to find the remaining two guns but was never heard of again. Sergeant Lord and 22 men eventually got out at Dunkirk.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the late}} 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly {{distributary}} {{was the main}} channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the Adi Ganga. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels {{were more or less}} equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges. It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges. One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.|$|E

25|$|The {{attention}} {{over the}} rescue attempt of Collins created {{interest in the}} creation of Mammoth Cave National Park, of which Sand Cave is now a part. Fear and superstition kept cavers away from Sand Cave for decades. The National Park Service has sealed the entrance with a steel grate for public safety. Expeditions into Mammoth Cave showed that portions of Mammoth actually run under Sand Cave, but no connection has ever been discovered. In the 1970s, cave explorer and author Roger Brucker and a small group entered Sand Cave to conduct research for a book about Collins. The team surveyed Sand and discovered an opening in the collapsed tunnel through which a smaller caver can crawl, showing {{that it would have been}} possible to feed and heat Collins after February 4, 1925. They proceeded as far as the passage where Collins was trapped; it was <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> gravel and unsafe to excavate. In April 1983, George Crothers led an archaeological investigation that documented many 1925 artifacts in the cave. These were removed for future preservation.|$|E
25|$|Since closure, some {{sections}} {{have fallen}} {{into a state of}} disrepair. Although most of the lock gates have long since rotted away, many of the locks themselves are in excellent condition, being constructed from local Mourne granite. It is now overgrown for much of its length; however, this means that it is now a haven for wildlife. This includes larger mammals like otters, and the Brackagh Bog area provides habitat for several species which are not found elsewhere in Northern Ireland, including plants, damselflies, dragonflies and 19 species of butterflies. There is a flow of fresh water along the canal, and good stocks of fish. Coarse fishing for perch, roach, bream and pike is possible on the River Bann, on the ship canal, and on parts of the canal, although the lower sections are <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> weed. The towpath has been reopened, and is now part of the Ulster Way long distance footpath. It has been incorporated into the National Cycle Network, and is maintained by two wardens throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate forces {{opposing}} Sherman's advance {{were from}} the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, commanded by Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton, a Pennsylvanian who chose {{to fight for the}} South. The officer in direct command of the defenses of Vicksburg was Maj. Gen. Martin L. Smith, who commanded four brigades led by Brig. Gens. Seth M. Barton, John C. Vaughn, John Gregg, and Edward D. Tracy. Brig. Gen. Stephen D. Lee commanded a provisional division with brigades commanded by Cols. William T. Withers and Allen Thomas; Lee was the primary commander of the Confederate defense in the Walnut Hills until the arrival late on December 29 of Maj. Gen. Carter L. Stevenson. Although the Union forces outnumbered the men to their front by two to one (30,720 to 13,792), they faced a formidable maze of both natural and man-made defenses. First was a thick entanglement of trees, which was broken intermittently by swampland. Chickasaw Bayou, a stream that was chest-deep, 50 yards wide, and <b>choked</b> <b>with</b> trees, also acted as a potential barrier to Sherman's men because it was parallel to the planned line of advance and could interrupt communication between units. Furthermore, the Confederates had formed dense barriers using felled trees for abatis.|$|E
