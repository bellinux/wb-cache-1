2500|$|This calvary {{is part of}} the Plougonven [...] "enclos paroissial". On an {{octagonal}} base, {{the structure}} is 4 metres high and on the two <b>corniches</b> running around this base are a series of sculptural groups which depict scenes from {{the life and death of}} Jesus Christ. Erected in 1554, the sculptural work was executed by the workshop of the [...] "ymageurs", Bastien and Henry Prigent (see note 1) who also worked on the calvary at Pleyben. [...] The calvary suffered considerable damage in 1794 during the aftermath of the French revolution after which the statues were hidden away in the cemetery grounds by the local people for safe-keeping. In 1810 the calvary was re-erected but with a wooden cross, this replaced in 1836 by a cross in stone. Then from 1897 to 1898, the sculptor Yann Larhantec carried out a substantial restoration, taken further in 2009 by Pierre Floc'h. The Calvary is dedicated to St Yves the parish's patron. The enclosure church itself dates to 1523 and is designed in the shape of a Latin cross with a nave and eight side chapels. It contains many sculptures and interesting features.|$|E
60|$|At 7.15 a.m. we {{struck the}} camp at Jebel Kibár, and moved due eastward towards the Pass. This {{north-eastern}} Khuraytah (Col) is termed the Khuraytat el-Hismá or el-Jils, after a hillock on the plateau-summit, to {{distinguish it from}} the similar feature to the south-west: the latter {{is known as the}} Khuraytat el-Zibá; or el-T h m , the local pronunciation of Tihámah. About two miles of rough and broken ground lead {{to the foot of the}} ladder. The zigzags then follow the line of a mountain torrent, the natural Pass, crossing its bed from left to right and from right again to left: the path is the rudest of <b>corniches,</b> worn by the feet of man and beast; and showing some ugly abrupt turns. The absolute height of the ascent is about 450 feet (aner. 26.70--26.25) and the length half a mile. The ground, composed mostly of irregular rock-steps, has little difficulty for horses and mules; but camels laden with boards (the mess-table) and long tent-poles must have had a queer time--I should almost expect after this to see an oyster walking up stairs. Of course, they took their leisure, feeling each stone before they trusted it, but they all arrived without the shadow of an accident; and the same was the case during the two subsequent descents.|$|E

"Indépendamment de l'intérêt que ces couches présentent au géologiste sous un nombre de rapports qu'il seroit trop long et peut-être inutile de détailler, elles présentent même pour le peintre, un superbe tableau. Je n'ai jamais vu de plus beaux rochers et distribués en plus grandes masses; ici, blancs; là, noircis par les lichens; là, peints de ces belles couleurs variées, que nous admirions au Grimsel, et entremêlés d'arbres, dont les uns couronnent le faîte de la {{montagne}}, et d'autres sont inégalement jetés sur les <b>corniches</b> qui en séparent les couches. Vers le bas de la montagne l'oeil se repose sur de beaux vergers, dans des prairies dont le terrein est inégal et varié, et sur de magnifiques chàtaigniers, dont les branches étendues ombragent les rochers contre lesquels ils croissent. En général, ces granits en couches horizontals redent ce pays charmant; car, quoiqu'il y ait, comme je l'ai dit, des couches qui forment des saillies, cependant elles sont pour l'ordinaire arrangées en gradins, ou en grandes assises posées en reculement les unes derrière les autres, et les bords de ces gradins sont couverts de la plus belle verdure, et d'arbres distribués de la manière la plus pittoresque. On voit è mme des montagnes très-élevées, qui out la forme de pain de sucre, et qui sont entourées et couronnées jusqu'à leur sommet, de guirlandes d'arbres assis sur les intervalles des couches, et qui forment l'effet du monde le plus singulier."-Voyages, § 1758.|$|E

50|$|The Corniche was {{the only}} new Rolls-Royce {{developed}} under Volkswagen's ownership, before the marque was phased out in 2003. All <b>Corniches</b> were completely hand-built. The car was considered a slightly softer, and even more exclusive, version of the Bentley Azure.|$|E
50|$|The last 25 Corniche {{models to}} be built, {{completed}} {{in the summer of}} 1995, were unique turbocharged versions and were called the Corniche S. In total, 5,146 Corniche Convertibles had been built, plus 1,108 Saloons (Coupés, that is), and 140 Bentley <b>Corniches.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{elevated}} pedestal or plinth which bears {{a statue}} {{and which is}} raised from the substructure supporting it (typically roofs or <b>corniches)</b> is sometimes called an acropodium. The term is from the Greek akros or [...] "topmost" [...] and pous (root pod-) or [...] "foot".|$|E

5000|$|In Wilhelminism, people {{disliked the}} noble modesty of the building. In 1895 to 1899, {{the number of}} <b>corniches</b> was raised and above the windows relief {{ornaments}} were placed.

He is also credited with the design of the Rolls-Royce Corniche announced after his retirement by Mulliner Park Ward in 1971. As at 2009, one of these <b>Corniches</b> remained in use as the Imperial Processional Car of the Emperor of Japan.|$|E
50|$|Howard and Stanley {{travel to}} the French Riviera, but Stanley is soon {{astonished}} by Sophie's ability {{to go into a}} fugue state and apparently pull out highly personal details about him and his family. Stanley witnesses a seance in which Sophie communicates with the deceased patriarch of the American family. A candle floats up from the table and Howard grabs it to try to discern what trickery is at play, but is astounded to find no apparent subterfuge. Stanley begins spending time with Sophie. He takes her to visit his aunt and they drive a convertible along the picturesque rocky <b>corniches.</b>|$|E

When I was 15, I arrived {{at the airport and}} I was waiting for my father and Picasso talked to me and I remember the <b>Corniches</b> and the open cars and gingham and all of that… It was what I saw as glamour as a little girl.” ...|$|E
