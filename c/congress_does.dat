5|$|In 1882, {{a formal}} opinion by the Attorney General {{concluded}} that resignation from <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> not free a member {{to be appointed}} to civil office because the Clause speaks to the term for which a member was elected, and that term still exists, even if a member resigns. Therefore, as in the Paterson matter nine decades earlier, Iowa Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood, who had resigned a Senate seat with a term that did not expire until March 1883, was ineligible for appointment {{to the position of}} United States Tariff Commissioner. In 1896, the Comptroller of the Treasury determined, after the fact, that former Senator Matthew Ransom's appointment as Minister to Mexico was invalid, as that office's salary had been increased during Ransom's term; the belated discovery precluded Ransom from drawing a salary.|$|E

Donnelly also voted in support of the failed resolution to authorize the President to continue the limited use of U.S. Forces in Libya. The resolution stated that <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> not support deploying, establishing, or maintaining the presence of units and members of U.S. Armed Forces on the ground in Libya unless the purpose of the presence is limited to the defense of U.S. government officials or NATO member forces from imminent danger.|$|E
25|$|Marshall first {{examined}} the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{and determined that}} the Act purported to give the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over writs of mandamus. Marshall then looked to Article III of the Constitution, which defines the Supreme Court's original and appellate jurisdictions (see Relevant Law above). Marbury had argued that the Constitution was only intended to set a floor for original jurisdiction that Congress could add to. Marshall disagreed and held that <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> {{not have the power}} to modify the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. Consequently, Marshall found that the Constitution and the Judiciary Act conflict.|$|E
25|$|Section 3 bars Congress from {{changing}} or modifying Federal law on treason {{by simple}} majority statute. Treason is also defined in this section. It's not enough merely {{to think a}} treasonous thought, {{there must be an}} overt act of making war or materially helping those at war with the United States. Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses. Congress is a political body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason. This allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition. However, <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> provide for other less subversive crimes and punishments such as conspiracy.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 Bill, H.R. 2389, to {{prohibit}} the Supreme Court's and most federal courts from considering any legal {{challenges to the}} government's requiring or promoting of the Pledge of Allegiance, died in the Senate after having passed in the House. This action is viewed in general as court stripping by Congress of the constitutional power of the Judiciary. Even if a similar bill is enacted, its practical effect may not be clear: proponents of the bill have {{said that it is}} a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, but opponents say <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> not have the authority to prevent the Supreme Court from hearing claims based on the Bill of Rights, since amendments postdate the original text of the Constitution and may thus implicitly limit the scope of Article III, Section 2. Judges and legal analysts have said that if Congress can remove from the judicial branch the ability to determine if legislation is constitutional, the US separation of powers would be disturbed, or rendered non-functional.|$|E
500|$|Following Greer's {{order on}} March 18, 2005 {{to remove the}} feeding tube, Republicans in the United States Congress subpoenaed both Michael and Terri Schiavo to testify at a congressional hearing. Greer told congressional attorneys, [...] "I have had no cogent reason why the (congressional) {{committee}} should intervene." [...] He also stated that last-minute action by <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> not invalidate years of court rulings.|$|E
500|$|The Court further {{stated that}} {{although}} congress allowed the resale and gifting {{of a gun}} by an individual, without requiring form or background checks, that is not proof that congress did not care about straw buyers. [...] "Yes, Congress decided to regulate dealers’ sales, while leaving the secondary market for guns largely untouched.... And yes, that choice (like pretty much everything <b>Congress</b> <b>does)</b> was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw arrangements are {{not a part of}} the secondary market, separate and apart from the dealer’s sale." [...] The Court also rejected Abramski's claim that since Alvarez was able to buy the gun legally on his own the misrepresentation is not material, stating: [...] "Abramski’s false statement was material because had he revealed that he was purchasing the gun on Alvarez’s behalf, the sale could not have proceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to be an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter, would not have complied with §922(c)’s restrictions on absentee purchases." [...] The court held that Abramski's case is analogous to a situation where a person that can buy a gun legally buys a gun under an alias. Such misrepresentation is material regardless of the fact that the buyer may purchase a gun legally, and the theory of [...] "no harm, no foul" [...] should not apply. Finally, the Court rejected Abramski's claim that the misrepresentation is not in violation of §924, because it is not part of what the dealer is statutorily required to maintain on his record. The Court held that §924 requires the dealer to maintain information [...] "required by this chapter", and that ATF Form 4473 is required by this chapter.|$|E

5000|$|The Court {{states that}} the {{significance}} of the lack of a Federal cause of action [...] "cannot be overstated." [...] The ruling relies heavily on the notion of respect for congressional intent. The Court interprets the fact that <b>Congress</b> <b>did</b> not create a cause of action to be conclusive evidence that <b>Congress</b> <b>did</b> not intend for claimed violations of the FDCA as elements of a state cause of action to be [...] "substantial" [...] enough to confer federal-question jurisdiction.|$|R

2500|$|On January 24, 2007, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{issued a}} report on this subject.

2500|$|Article I of the Constitution creates {{and sets}} forth the {{structure}} {{and most of the}} powers of Congress.

Section Seven lays out the process for creating laws, and Section Eight enumerates numerous powers. [...] Section [...] Nine is a list of powers <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> not have, and Section Ten enumerates powers of the state, some of which may only be granted by Congress. Constitutional amendments have granted Congress additional powers. Congress also has implied powers derived from the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause.|$|E

It added: [...] "The World Jewish <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> not aim at weakening any existing organizations, but rather to support and stimulate them."

50|$|Writing for the majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist {{noted that}} the National Minimum Drinking Age Act clearly met the first three {{restrictions}}, leaving only the latter two restrictions worthy of consideration. Rehnquist wrote that the <b>Congress</b> <b>did</b> not violate the Tenth Amendment because it merely exercised its right to control its spending. Rehnquist wrote that the <b>Congress</b> <b>did</b> not coerce the states because it cut {{only a small percentage}} of federal funding. It thus applied pressure but not irresistible pressure.|$|R
2500|$|Just as longstanding is the {{principle}} that [...] "tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident." [...] Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952); Astoria Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). In such cases, <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> not write upon a clean slate. Astoria, 501 U.S. at 108. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must [...] "speak directly" [...] to the question addressed by the common law. Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U.

2500|$|The {{separation}} of powers principle is particularly noteworthy {{in regard to the}} Congress. The Constitution declares that the Congress may exercise only those legislative powers [...] "herein granted" [...] within Article I (as later limited by the Tenth Amendment). It also, by implied extension, prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative authority to either of the other branches of government, a rule known as the nondelegation doctrine. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> have latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an [...] "intelligible principle" [...] which governs the agency's exercise of the delegated regulatory authority. That the power assigned to each branch must remain with that branch, and may be expressed only by that branch, is central to the theory. The nondelegation doctrine is primarily used now as a way of interpreting a congressional delegation of authority narrowly, in that the courts presume Congress intended only to delegate that which it certainly could have, unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to [...] "test the waters" [...] of what the courts would allow it to do.|$|E

60|$|Even our Foreign Office must {{be aware}} that in {{every country in the}} world there is now bitter {{suspicion}} of and keen hostility towards merely diplomatic representatives. One of the most significant features of the time is the evident desire of the Labour movement in every European country to take part in a collateral conference of Labour that shall meet when and where the Peace <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> and deliberate and comment on its proceedings. For a year now the demand of the masses for such a Labour conference has been growing. It marks a distrust of officialdom whose intensity officialdom would do well to ponder. But it is the natural consequence of, it is the popular attempt at a corrective to, the aloofness and obscurity that have hitherto been so evil a characteristic of international negotiations. I do not think Labour and intelligent people anywhere are going to be fobbed off with an old-fashioned diplomatic gathering as being that League of Free Nations they demand.|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} the fifth interrogatory, I must say here that as to the {{question}} of the abolition of the slave-trade between the different States, I can truly answer, as I have, that I am pledged to nothing about it. It is a subject to which I have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it. In other words, that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it. I could investigate it if I had sufficient time to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject, but I have not done so, and I say so frankly to you here and to Judge Douglas. I must say, however, that if I should be of opinion that <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> possess the constitutional power to abolish the slave-trade among the different States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power unless upon some conservative principle, as I conceive it, akin to what I have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia.|$|E
60|$|Let us go {{a little}} further. You {{remember}} we once had a National Bank. Some one owed the bank a debt; he was sued, and sought to avoid payment {{on the ground that}} the bank was unconstitutional. The case went to the Supreme Court, and therein it was decided that the bank was constitutional. The whole Democratic party revolted against that decision. General Jackson himself asserted that he, as President, would not be bound to hold a National Bank to be constitutional, even though the court had decided it to be so. He fell in precisely with the view of Mr. Jefferson, and acted upon it under his official oath, in vetoing a charter for a National Bank. The declaration that <b>Congress</b> <b>does</b> not possess this constitutional power to charter a bank has gone into the Democratic platform, at their National Conventions, and was brought forward and reaffirmed in their last Convention at Cincinnati. They have contended for that declaration, in the very teeth of the Supreme Court, for {{more than a quarter of}} a century. In fact, they have reduced the decision to an absolute nullity. That decision, I repeat, is repudiated in the Cincinnati platform; and still, as if to show that effrontery can go no further, Judge Douglas vaunts in the very speeches in which he denounces me for opposing the Dred Scott decision that he stands on the Cincinnati platform.|$|E
