5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for <b>cell-based</b> rather than egg-based culture become available. <b>Cell-based</b> culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|One major {{advantage}} of genome-scale RNAi screening {{is its ability}} to simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes. With the ability to generate a large amount of data per experiment, genome-scale RNAi screening has led to an explosion data generation rates. Exploiting such large data sets is a fundamental challenge, requiring suitable statistics/bioinformatics methods. The basic process of <b>cell-based</b> RNAi screening includes the choice of an RNAi library, robust and stable cell types, transfection with RNAi agents, treatment/incubation, signal detection, analysis and identification of important genes or therapeutical targets.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{regarding}} {{the mechanism of}} action, pro-angiogenic methods can be differentiated into three main categories: gene-therapy, targeting genes of interest for amplification or inhibition; protein-therapy, which primarily manipulates angiogenic growth factors like FGF-1 or vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF; and <b>cell-based</b> therapies, which involve the implantation of specific cell types.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, 2005, IBM and Mercury Computer Systems {{announced}} a partnership agreement to build <b>Cell-based</b> computer systems for embedded {{applications such as}} medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace and defense, seismic processing, and telecommunications. Mercury has since then released blades, conventional rack servers and PCI Express accelerator boards with Cell processors.|$|E
25|$|After using {{bacterial}} <b>cell-based</b> {{method to}} select DNA-binding proteins, {{it is necessary}} to check the specificity of these domains as {{there is a limit to}} the extent to which the bacterial cell genome can act as a sink for domains with an affinity for other sequences (or indeed, a general affinity for DNA).|$|E
25|$|Glycosyltransferases {{have been}} widely used in the both {{targeted}} synthesis of specific glycoconjugates as well as the synthesis of differentially glycosylated libraries of drugs, biological probes or natural products in the context of drug discovery and drug development (a process known as glycorandomization). Suitable enzymes can be isolated from natural sources or produced recombinantly. As an alternative, whole <b>cell-based</b> systems using either endogenous glycosyl donors or <b>cell-based</b> systems containing cloned and expressed systems for synthesis of glycosyl donors have been developed. In cell-free approaches, the large-scale application of glycosyltransferases for glycoconjugate synthesis has required access to large quantities of the glycosyl donors. On the flip-side, nucleotide recycling systems that allow the resynthesis of glycosyl donors from the released nucleotide have been developed. The nucleotide recycling approach has a further benefit of reducing the amount of nucleotide formed as a by-product, thereby reducing the amount of inhibition caused to the glycosyltransferase of interest â€“ a commonly observed feature of the nucleotide byproduct.|$|E
25|$|Patient-side {{autologous}} {{therapy in}} the US {{is subject to}} change. New guidance issued (FDA#218 Guidance for Industry - <b>Cell-Based</b> Products for Animal Use) will likely require stem cell therapy to be produced via cGMP. Resources required to implement these changes may change the US veterinary stem cell industry more towards a hub and spoke approach or towards allogeneic therapy, and away from patient-side therapy.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, pro-angiogenic protein therapy uses well-defined, {{precisely}} structured proteins, with previously defined optimal {{doses of}} the individual protein for disease states, and with well-known biological effects. On the other hand, an obstacle of protein therapy is the mode of delivery. Oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intramuscular routes of protein administration are not always as effective, as the therapeutic protein may be metabolized or cleared before it can enter the target tissue. <b>Cell-based</b> pro-angiogenic therapies are still early stages of research, with many open questions regarding best cell types and dosages to use.|$|E
25|$|Active {{cellular}} therapies usually {{involve the}} removal of immune cells from the blood or from a tumor. Those specific for the tumor are cultured {{and returned to the}} patient where they attack the tumor; alternatively, immune cells can be genetically engineered to express a tumor-specific receptor, cultured and returned to the patient. Cell types {{that can be used in}} this way are natural killer cells, lymphokine-activated killer cells, cytotoxic T cells and dendritic cells. The only US-approved <b>cell-based</b> therapy is Dendreon's Provenge, for the treatment of prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|However, how {{sulfatide}} buildup causes demyelination and neural degeneration {{is still}} mostly unknown. Metachromatic Leukodystrophy results in neurological manifestations that are {{centered on the}} impairment of {{the central nervous system}} and the peripheral nervous system, including the following: seizures, progressive coordination and speech problems, and behavioral disturbances. Treatment is still being studied and evaluated, but mice studies indicate that treatments, including gene therapy, <b>cell-based</b> therapies using oligodendrocyte progenitors cells, enzyme replacement therapy, or adeno-associated viral and lentiviral mediated gene therapy may prove to be effective in reducing the effects of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy.|$|E
25|$|The IRA {{declared}} a brief ceasefire in 1972 {{and a more}} protracted one in 1975, when there was an internal debate over the feasibility of future operations. The armed group reorganised itself in the late 1970s into a smaller, <b>cell-based</b> structure, {{which was designed to}} be harder to penetrate. The IRA now tried to carry out a smaller scale but more sustained campaign which they characterised as the 'Long War', with the eventual aim of weakening the British government's resolve to remain in Ireland. The British Army called this the 'terrorist phase' of the IRA's campaign.|$|E
25|$|Early {{clinical}} studies with protein-based therapeutics largely {{focused on the}} intravenous or intracoronary administration of a particular growth factor to stimulate angiogenesis in the affected tissue or organ. Most of these trials did not achieve statistically significant improvements in their clinical endpoints. This ultimately led to an abandonment of this approach and a widespread belief in the field that protein therapy, especially with a single agent, was not a viable option to treat ischemic cardiovascular disease. However, the failure of gene- or <b>cell-based</b> therapy to deliver a suitable treatment choice for diseases resulting from poor blood flow {{has led to a}} resurgence of interest in returning to protein-based therapy to stimulate angiogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis {{represents}} an excellent therapeutic {{target for the}} treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult. A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and <b>cell-based</b> therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.|$|E

2500|$|Modeling EEC {{syndrome}} {{in vitro}} {{has been achieved}} by reprogramming EEC fibroblasts carrying mutations R304W and R204W into induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. EEC-iPSC recapitulated defective epidermal and corneal fates.

Of interest, similar effect had been observed on keratinocytes derived from the same patients. PRIMA-1MET could become an effective therapeutic tool for EEC patients.|$|E
2500|$|A 2009 {{study by}} Ratmir et al. aimed to improve in vivo-like {{conditions}} for 3D tissue via [...] "stacking and de-stacking layers of paper impregnated with suspensions of cells in extracellular matrix hydrogel, {{making it possible}} to control oxygen and nutrient gradients in 3D, and to analyze molecular and genetic responses". It is possible to manipulate gradients of soluble molecules, and to characterize cells in these complex gradients more effectively than conventional 3D cultures based on hydrogels, cell spheroids, or 3D perfusion reactors. Different thicknesses of paper and types of medium can support a variety of experimental environments. Upon deconstruction, these sheets can be useful in <b>cell-based</b> high-throughput screening and drug discovery.|$|E
2500|$|The Apple II, also {{invented by}} Wozniak, was {{introduced}} on April 16, 1977, {{at the first}} West Coast Computer Faire. It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character <b>cell-based</b> color graphics and open architecture. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded {{by the introduction of}} a 5Â¼inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II. The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first [...] "killer app" [...] of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program. VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office. Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the early}} years of the conflict, it became less common for the IRA to use large numbers of men in its armed actions. Instead, smaller but more {{specialised}} groups carried out sustained attritional attacks. In response to the 1975 ceasefire and the arrest of many IRA volunteers in its aftermath, the Provisionals re-organised their structures in 1977 into small <b>cell-based</b> units. While these were harder to infiltrate, the greater secrecy also caused a distance to develop between the IRA and sympathetic civilians. They also embarked on a strategy known as the [...] "Long War" [...] â€“ a process of attrition based on the indefinite continuation of an armed campaign until the British government grew tired of the political, military and financial costs involved in staying in Northern Ireland. The British Army characterised this change in the IRA campaign as a move from [...] "insurgency" [...] to a [...] "terrorist phase".|$|E
2500|$|While {{they fight}} pathogens, {{neutrophils}} also release inflammatory cytokines and enzymes that damage cells. [...] One of their important jobs {{is to produce}} Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) to kill bacteria, for which they use an enzyme called myeloperoxidase. [...] The enzymes and ROS produced by neutrophils and other leukocytes damage cells and prevent cell proliferation and wound closure by damaging DNA, lipids, proteins, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and cytokines that speed healing. [...] Neutrophils remain in chronic wounds for longer {{than they do in}} acute wounds, and contribute to the fact that chronic wounds have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS. [...] Since wound fluid from chronic wounds has an excess of proteases and ROS, the fluid itself can inhibit healing by inhibiting cell growth and breaking down growth factors and proteins in the ECM. This impaired healing response is considered uncoordinated. However, soluble mediators of the immune system (growth factors), <b>cell-based</b> therapies and therapeutic chemicals can propagate coordinated healing.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, {{cell culture}} {{manufacturing}} {{technology can be}} applied to influenza vaccines as they are with most viral vaccines (e.g., polio vaccine, measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, chickenpox vaccine). In this system, viruses are grown in closed systems such as bioreactors containing large numbers of cells in growth media rather than eggs. The surge capacity afforded by <b>cell-based</b> technology is insensitive to seasons and can be adjusted to vaccine demand, as capacity can be increased or decreased by the number of bioreactors or the volume used within a bioreactor. In addition to supporting basic research on <b>cell-based</b> influenza vaccine development, HHS is currently supporting a number of vaccine manufacturers in the advanced development of <b>cell-based</b> influenza vaccines with the goal of developing U.S.-licensed <b>cell-based</b> influenza vaccines produced in the United States.|$|E
