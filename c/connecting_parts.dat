5|$|The Liffey River—then called Pennyroyal Creek—was first bridged at Carrick in 1828 with {{a simple}} log structure. This was {{replaced}} in the 1830s with a more substantial bridge, though still wooden. As of 1834 the areas' roads were poor and vehicles frequently became bogged {{on the road to}} Westbury. A bridge over the South Esk, at what is now Hadspen, was built in 1843. It replaced a frequently impassable ford and more reliably connected Carrick to Launceston. Liffey bridge was repaired and raised in the mid-1860s, keeping the original foundations. In May 1875 water sufficiently eroded these foundations to lead to the bridge's collapse, when one of the two supporting piles (logs) gave way. All of the Liffey bridges, and the <b>connecting</b> <b>parts</b> of the road, were subject to inundation when the river flooded; the 1929 Tasmanian Floods carried the bridge away. In the 1950s the road was reconstructed and the bridge again replaced. To reduce the incidence and impact of flooding both were raised substantially leaving the mill's ground floor far below the road level.|$|E

25|$|Firearms use {{triggers}} {{to initiate}} the firing of a cartridge in the firing chamber of the weapon. This is accomplished by actuating a striking device {{through a combination of}} spring and kinetic energy operating through a firing pin to strike and ignite the primer. There are two primary types of striking mechanisms, hammers and strikers. Hammers are spring-tensioned masses of metal that pivot on a pin when released and strike a firing pin to discharge a cartridge. Strikers are, essentially, spring-loaded firing pins that travel on an axis in-line with the cartridge eliminating the need for a separate hammer. The connection between the trigger and the hammer is generally referred to as the sear surface. Variable mechanisms will have this surface directly on the trigger and hammer or have separate sears or other <b>connecting</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E

Due to the incident, the city authorities decided to halt all electric taxis on safety concerns, 15 of which were M300 EVs out of a fleet of 30 electric taxis. The city's official investigation team found {{the cause of the}} fire was the car's defective battery pack due to lack of quality control during manufacturing. According to the investigation report, the battery pack problems include: leaking of battery cells; damage of the insulation between battery cells and the walls of the aluminum container in which the cells were stacked; short circuits occurred within certain containers and those involving supporting and <b>connecting</b> <b>parts.</b> One of the stronger short circuits ignited the car’s back seats. [...] The lead investigators said that [...] "...in sealing and packing the battery cells, in loading and unloading the battery stacks, insufficient attention had been paid to several safety factors; monitoring procedures had been inefficient or neglected in the process of manufacturing, battery charging/switching, and vehicle driving, failing to detect anomalies." [...] The report added that the battery cells on the car were made by Zhejiang Wanxiang Group.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMachine {{condition}} monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery {{are very important}} because of the wide use of rotating machinery in industry. Couplings and gears are used in many mechanical sys tems to connect elements and transmit power.

In the present study, the dynamic behavior of a system with an unsymmetrical nonlinearity and a signif icant mass of the <b>connecting</b> <b>part</b> was investigated both experimentally and by numerical simulation.
