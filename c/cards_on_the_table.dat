5|$|Director Jewison can put his <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> let {{his camera}} cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid {{also has a}} less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Despard (as Major Despard) and Rhoda Dawes (maiden name) both {{also appear}} in <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table.</b>|$|E

25|$|Among Toledo's {{publications}} are {{works on}} {{economic growth and}} structural reforms. His latest book, Las Cartas sobre la Mesa (The <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table),</b> recounts his political career and the founding of Perú Posible.|$|E
25|$|Calculators: calculators are poker {{tools that}} {{calculate}} {{the odds of}} a hand (combined with the <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> if there are any) to win the game. Calculators provide precise odds but they cannot be used in live games and are therefore mostly used on Internet poker games.|$|E
25|$|This {{novel is}} notable as {{several of her}} earlier {{characters}} reappear in this book. In addition to Ariadne Oliver, Major Despard and his wife Rhoda (who met {{and fell in love}} in <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table)</b> also participate in the plot. Mrs Dane Calthrop from The Moving Finger also reappears in approximately the same role as she played in that book: the rational but devoted Christian who wants the evil stopped.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rules of}} the game are much like whist. The dealer places down a <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> (e.g. 10 ♣), then the other player must: ...|$|R
60|$|A {{thoroughly}} annoying post. He pitched <b>the</b> <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{stood up}} and went to the window, where Ann, after a momentary reconnaisance at Chitterlow's hieroglyphics, came to join him.|$|R
50|$|If {{there is}} a bonus <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> during initial deal, the dealer {{collects}} the bonus card and turns the top card of the draw pile face-up and places it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
25|$|The novel {{mentions}} {{several other}} Poirot investigations: the detective {{is seen to}} retell to Colonel Carbury the story of <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table,</b> and Colonel Race from this investigation is mentioned. Nadine Boynton actually confronts Poirot with his own actions in the conclusion of Murder on the Orient Express, Poirot suggesting that she was told {{by one of the}} case's figures. Miss Pierce also comments on The A.B.C. Murders when she recognises Poirot as a great detective.|$|E
25|$|Like The Secret Adversary, The Man in the Brown Suit {{is less a}} {{novel of}} pure {{detection}} than it is a thriller typical of its period. It follows the adventures of Anne Beddingfeld as she becomes involved {{in a world of}} diamond thieves, murderers, and political intrigue in this tale set in exotic South Africa. Colonel Race makes his first appearance in the novel; he later appears in <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table,</b> Sparkling Cyanide, and Death on the Nile.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{insurance}} bet {{is susceptible to}} advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card {{has more than a}} chance of one in three of being a ten. Advantage play techniques can sometimes identify such situations. In a multi-hand, face-up, single deck game, it is possible to establish whether insurance is a good bet simply by observing the other <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> after the deal; even if there are just 2 player hands exposed, and neither of their two initial cards is a ten, then 16 in 47 of the remaining cards are tens, which is larger than 1 in 3, so insurance is a good bet. This is an elementary example of the family of advantage play techniques known as card counting.|$|E
5000|$|The turn {{continues}} with the player flipping {{over the top}} card from the draw pile {{and looking for a}} card of <b>the</b> same month <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> If <b>the</b> player locates a matching <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>the</b> player collects both cards along with the cards matched in step 2. Otherwise, the drawn card is added to <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of drawing}} from a stock, the game starts with three face-up <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>On</b> their turn, players may swap one or three cards from their hand for <b>the</b> <b>table</b> cards.|$|R
6000|$|Randal {{promised to}} dine with Kitty {{when they met}} in London. Before {{he left the room}} he pointed to his <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> [...] "Let my friend see that message," [...] he said, as he went out.|$|R
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need {{you to tell me}} this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|... 3 Splash {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Chris True from AllMusic highlighted Hashire! {{as a career}} stand out track from Kumi's discography. Ian Martin from the same publication reviewed [...] "Lick Me" [...] and [...] "Ecstasy" [...] from the Universe album and was divided. For [...] "Lick Me", he said, [...] "She wears her sexuality on her sleeve, with song titles like [...] "Lick Me" [...] laying their erotic playing <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> from the get-go, and her lack of any recognizable singing ability compensated for by {{an awful lot of}} gumption." [...] For [...] "Ecstasy", he commended her [...] "hard working ethic" [...] in many songs, highlighting the song and concluded that, [...] "All of this reveals a desperate need to achieve success no matter what, but also the humanity of the effort underpinning it." [...] Greenberg commended the production of [...] "Ecstasy", and said that [...] "Lick Me" [...] was [...] "slightly off-tempo" [...] that [...] "brings Kumi back to more standard territory." [...] A reviewer from CD Journal complimented the production of each song, and described the EP as [...] "catchy" [...] and [...] "danceable". Hiraga Tetsuo from Hot Express was positive, who commended Kumi's song writing and the [...] "summer" [...] theme throughout the EP.|$|E
2500|$|She has {{authored}} over 56 {{novels and}} greatly dislikes people modifying her characters. She {{is the only}} one in Poirot's universe to have noted that [...] "It’s not natural for five or six people to be on the spot when B is murdered and all have a motive for killing B." [...] She first met Poirot in the story <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> and has been bothering him ever since.|$|E
50|$|Hints: If {{you want}} your partner to return <b>the</b> same suite <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next turn, slam <b>the</b> <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> as you play. Note that this {{practice}} is not allowed in some areas and generally frowned upon as not very professional behavior.|$|R
5000|$|Variant 1: {{a player}} with a build <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> is not {{permitted}} to trail a card until that build has been taken in or rebuilt upon by an adversary; they may, however, pair or continue their [...] "build" [...] with any <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two players: The dealer places four <b>cards</b> face-up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> then deals five {{cards to}} their opponent's hand and five cards to their hand. Then, the dealer places another four <b>cards</b> face-up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and deals another five cards to each player's hand, {{starting}} with the opponent.|$|R
2500|$|The {{characters}} of Ariadne Oliver, Pamela [...] "Poppy" [...] Stirling, Colonel and Rhoda Despard, Jim Corrigan, and Rev. and Mrs Dane Calthrop, are {{omitted from the}} adaptation; the omission of Rhoda and Colonel Despard is {{probably due to the}} fact that in the Agatha Christie's Poirot adaptation of <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table,</b> Rhoda dies in place of Anne Meredith, and Colonel Despard falls in love with Anne instead.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{standard}} Set game, the dealer lays out <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> until either twelve are laid down or someone sees a set and calls [...] "Set!". The player who called [...] "Set" [...] takes the {{cards in the}} set, and the dealer continues to deal out cards until twelve are on the table. A player who sees a set among the twelve cards calls [...] "Set" [...] and takes the three cards, and the dealer lays three more <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> (To call out [...] "set" [...] and not pick one up quickly enough results in a penalty.) It is possible {{that there is no}} set among the twelve cards; in this case, the dealer deals out three more cards to make fifteen dealt cards, or eighteen or more, as necessary. This process of dealing by threes and finding sets continues until the deck is exhausted and there are no more sets on the table. At this point, whoever has collected the most sets wins.|$|E
2500|$|Officer's skat (German: [...] ) is {{a variant}} for two players. Each player gets 16 <b>cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{in front of}} him, 8 facing down and 8 {{on top of each}} of them with face shown. Bidding is {{replaced}} by declaring a game type and trump by the companion. When a top card is played, the hidden card is uncovered, making a total of 16 tricks in that game. Scoring is like normal skat.|$|E
6000|$|The spy laid a <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> [...] "I'll {{come back}} for him or send for him," [...] he said. [...] "I suppose I can go now, if I leave my name and address?" [...] With those words, {{he put on his}} hat, and walked out.|$|R
50|$|Three players: The dealer places three <b>cards</b> face-up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> then deals four {{cards to}} each player's hand, {{starting}} with the player {{to the right and}} continuing counterclockwise. Then, the dealer places another three <b>cards</b> face-up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and deals another three cards to each player's hand, again starting with <b>the</b> player <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right.|$|R
50|$|The {{cost of a}} {{meal was}} {{traditionally}} calculated by the number and size of dishes left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> patron's <b>table</b> at <b>the</b> end. In modern yum cha restaurants, dim sum servers sometimes mark orders by stamping a <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Servers in some restaurants use different stamps so that sales statistics for each server can be recorded.|$|R
2500|$|Hercule Poirot {{became famous}} in 1926 with the {{publication}} of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, whose surprising solution proved controversial. The novel is still among the most famous of all detective novels: Edmund Wilson alludes to it in the title of his well-known attack on detective fiction, [...] "Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?" [...] Aside from Roger Ackroyd, the most critically acclaimed Poirot novels appeared from 1932 to 1942, including Murder on the Orient Express, The ABC Murders (1935), <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> (1936), and Death on the Nile (1937), a tale of multiple homicide upon a Nile steamer. Death on the Nile was judged by detective novelist John Dickson Carr to be among the ten greatest mystery novels of all time.|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{features}} the characters Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver. The {{story is a}} [...] "village mystery", a subgenre of whodunit which Christie usually reserved for Miss Marple. The novel is notable for its wit and comic detail, something that had been little in evidence in the Poirot novels of the 1930s and 1940s. Poirot's misery in the run-down guesthouse, and Mrs Oliver's observations {{on the life of}} a detective novelist, provide considerable entertainment {{in the early part of}} the novel. The publication of Mrs McGinty's Dead may be considered as marking the start of Poirot's final phase, in which Ariadne Oliver plays a large part. Although she had appeared in <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> in 1936, Mrs Oliver's most significant appearances in Christie's work begin here. She appears in five of the last nine Christie novels featuring Poirot to be written, and appears on her own without Poirot at all in The Pale Horse (1961).|$|E
2500|$|In The Observers {{issue of}} 1 May 1938, [...] "Torquemada" [...] (Edward Powys Mathers) said, [...] "I {{have to confess}} I have just been beaten again by Agatha Christie. There was no excuse. I was feeling in {{particularly}} good form; and {{the worst of it}} is that she handicapped herself in the latest game with what in anyone else would be insolent severity. Murder on the Nile (sic) was entirely brilliant; Appointment with Death, while lacking the single stroke of murderer's genius which provided the alibi in the former story, must be counted mathematically nearly twice as brilliant, since the number of suspects is reduced by nearly half. Indeed, though we begin our story in Jerusalem and meet our murder in Petra, the Red Rose City, we might as well be in a snowbound vicarage as far as the limitation of suspicion is concerned. And it is in this respect that Agatha Christie repeats her <b>Cards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> triumph and beats Steinitz with a single row of pawns." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} Machiavelli {{is being able}} to make changes to the combinations of <b>cards</b> already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> current player, if desired, may reorganize the cards in order to make new combos that make it easier to play one or more cards in his hand.All new combinations must be valid, and players can not remove any <b>cards</b> already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
6000|$|We {{had been}} out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, and had {{returned}} about six o'clock on a cold, frosty winter's evening.

50|$|Brelan {{is played}} by three, four or five players, with a 32-card pack, each {{receiving}} 3 cards and a fourth turned from the stock. The best hand is a brelan carre, or four of a kind, made {{with the aid of}} <b>the</b> turn-up <b>card</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> followed by a simple brelan or prial. Brelan favori is a pair royal composed of 2 cards in the hand and the card turned.|$|R
