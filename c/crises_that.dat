5|$|The {{history of}} {{sustainability}} traces human-dominated ecological systems {{from the earliest}} civilizations to the present time.

5|$|Beaumont {{was fully}} {{involved}} in the political <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> punctuated the reign of Henry VI: Griffiths has labelled him one of 'a small group of like-minded men, led by Suffolk' who could work for the king whether in council or on royal progress, although his attendance at council seems to have become more sporadic by 1443. As Steward of England, he personally- although accompanied by, for example, other lords such as Buckingham and the earl of Salisbury- arrested Humphrey, duke of Gloucester for treason, in Bury St Edmunds 18 February 1447.|$|E
50|$|A {{military}} {{alliance is}} an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other {{in case of a}} <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> has not been identified in advance.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving her}} union post in 1908 Bondfield worked as organising {{secretary}} for the WLL and later as women's officer for the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW). She {{was elected to the}} TUC Council in 1918, and became its chairman in 1923, the year she was first elected to parliament. In the short-lived minority Labour government of 1924 she served as parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Labour. Her term of cabinet office in 1929–31 was marked by the economic <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> beset the second Labour government. Her willingness to contemplate cuts in unemployment benefits alienated her from much of the Labour movement, although she did not follow Ramsay MacDonald into the National Government that assumed office when the Labour government fell in August 1931.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E

25|$|This {{argument}} {{also often}} {{points to the}} series of <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> befell North Korea in the early 1990s, beginning {{with the fall of}} its long-time ally the Soviet Union in 1991, followed by the death of Kim Il-sung (1994), several natural disasters, the North Korean famine and economic crisis, all before 1999. These also could have served as motivation for a new method of consolidation of power.|$|E
25|$|The {{early decades}} {{were marked by}} discontinuity, due to {{epidemics}} and <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> plagued the region between the 1420s and the 1430s following the annexation of the Piedmont territories to the Duchy of Savoy and by difficult relations between the University and the local Public Administration. After a series of interruptions in its activities, the university was moved to Chieri (between 1427 and 1434) and later, in 1434, to Savigliano.|$|E

25|$|The Great Famine of 1315–1317 (occasionally dated 1315–1322) was {{the first}} of a series of {{large-scale}} <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> struck Europe early in the fourteenth century.

The famine caused millions of deaths over an extended number of years and marked a clear end to the period of growth and prosperity from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries.|$|E

25|$|More specifically, it {{has been}} seen by Batson as {{comprising}} a willingness to view religious doubts in a positive manner, acceptance that religious orientation can change and existential complexity, the belief that one's religious beliefs should be shaped from personal <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> one has experienced in one's life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quest respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).|$|E

25|$|In July, {{following}} {{a series of}} <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> undermined their authority with the public, {{the head of the}} Provisional Government resigned and was succeeded by Alexander Kerensky, who was more progressive than his predecessor but not radical enough for the Bolsheviks or many Russians discontented with the deepening economic crisis and the continuation of the war. While Kerensky's government marked time, the socialist-led soviet in Petrograd joined with soviets that formed throughout the country to create a national movement.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} {{contends that}} the state developed out {{of economic and social}} <b>crises</b> <b>that</b> were prominent in late-medieval Europe. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the involvement of leaders in the domains of other leaders under religious reasons was the primary problem dealt with in the Peace of Westphalia. In addition, Marxist theory {{contends that the}} economic crisis of feudalism forced the aristocracy to adapt various centralized forms of organization so they could retain economic power, and this resulted {{in the formation of the}} modern state.|$|E
