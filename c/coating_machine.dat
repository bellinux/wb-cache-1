5000|$|Many {{industrial}} {{coating processes}} involve {{the application of}} a thin film of functional material to a substrate, such as paper, fabric, film, foil, or sheet stock. If the substrate starts and ends the process wound up in a roll, the process may be termed [...] "roll-to-roll" [...] or [...] "web-based" [...] coating. A roll of substrate, when wound through the <b>coating</b> <b>machine,</b> is typically called a web.|$|E

In 1978, a new 16,000 Sq Ft factory {{was built on}} the South Lowestoft Industrial Estate (formally known as Cooke Park). Harrod UK installed its first powder <b>coating</b> <b>machine</b> in 1979, acquired its first specialist delivery lorry in 1980 and purchased a robotic welder in 1985. In 2014, Harrod UK received an Investors in People Gold award. This is the highest standard available and is achieved by roughly 1% of all companies striving to achieve the IIP status.|$|E
50|$|The term {{universal}} joint {{was used in}} the 18th century and was in common use in the 19th century. Edmund Morewood's 1844 patent for a metal <b>coating</b> <b>machine</b> called for a {{universal joint}}, by that name, to accommodate small alignment errors between the engine and rolling mill shafts. Ephriam Shay's locomotive patent of 1881, for example, used double universal joints in the locomotive's drive shaft. Charles Amidon used a much smaller universal joint in his bit-brace patented 1884. Beauchamp Tower's spherical, rotary, high speed steam engine used an adaptation of the universal joint circa 1885.|$|E
50|$|The PVC coating liquid (vinyl Organisol or Plastisol) {{contains}} {{chemicals to}} achieve the desired properties of color, water and mildew resistance, and flame retardancy. Fabric can also be manufactured that contains high levels of light transmission or can be made completely opaque. After the coating {{has been applied to}} the scrim, the fabric is put through a heating chamber that dries the liquid coating. PVC coatings are available in a range of colors, although non-standard colors can be pricey. Colors may be subject to minimum order runs that allow the <b>coating</b> <b>machine</b> to clear out traces of any previous color.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>coating</b> <b>machines</b> used in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry: coating pans and automatic coaters. Coating pans are used mostly to sugar coat pellets. Automatic coaters are used for all kinds of coatings; they can be equipped with a remote control panel, a dehumidifier, and dust collectors. An explosion-proof design is required for applying coatings that contain alcohol.|$|R
50|$|Reverse roll <b>coating</b> <b>machines</b> demand high {{specifications}} {{in their}} construction, e.g. for the machining and bearings of the rollers and for highly uniform speed control. This makes them relatively expensive {{compared to other}} coating technologies. Unlike many other coating methods, they can however handle coatings with a very wide range of viscosities, from 1 to more than 50000 mPas, and are capable of producing extremely polished finishes on the coatings they apply. They have been produced {{in a variety of}} 3-roll an 4-roll configurations.|$|R
5000|$|Lens coating: An {{antireflection coating}} {{is applied to}} the {{finished}} lenses. The lenses are first cleaned, and then loaded into a fixture. The fixture, containing a large number of lenses, is placed in the <b>coating</b> <b>machine.</b> After finishing the process the glass lenses are removed from the holder and the holder is cleaned by sand-blasting or other techniques. Usually the optical coating is done by one of two methods: physical vapour deposition (PVD), in which oxide materials evaporate and are deposited on the lens, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Chemical reactions take place in a vacuum and the reaction product is deposited on the lens. The lenses are coated for two reasons: ...|$|E
50|$|Cofrin {{was born}} in Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1883, to Paige Cofrin and Alfaretta Ward Cofrin. At age 13, Cofrin worked his family's farm after his father's death where he {{cultivated}} a strong work ethic that influenced a prosperous career. By age 16 Cofrin worked {{away from home and}} gained employment at a paper mill as a <b>coating</b> <b>machine</b> helper. After working a few years at various paper mills on the East Coast, Cofrin moved to Green Bay. His first job in Green Bay was at the Northern Paper Mill, where he worked as a supervisor. After working at the Northern Paper Mill, Cofrin and a few other employees of the started their own business. The mill was a small paper company that was known as the Fort Howard Corporation. In 1924 he was granted a patent for making crepe paper. Cofrin was president of the Fort Howard Corporation until his retirement in 1960, when his son John P. Cofrin took over the position. Cofrin died in 1980 at the age of 96.|$|E

30|$|The {{maintenance}} strategy for coating machines {{used for the}} production of electronic circuit panels is adopted to examine both crisp and fuzzy TOPSIS. Considering the significant role and frequent failure of the <b>coating</b> <b>machine,</b> maintenance management aims to investigate the most suitable {{maintenance strategy}} that can improve the performance of the <b>coating</b> <b>machine</b> with existing resources. After a discussion, five maintenance strategies with respect to six evaluation factors are determined as potential candidates in the assessment process. Autonomous maintenance (AM), corrective maintenance (CM), design out maintenance (DOM), predictive maintenance (PdM), and preventive maintenance (PM) are the five potential maintenance strategies considered during the assessment process.|$|E
50|$|Gelatin silver print {{paper was}} made {{as early as}} 1874 on a {{commercial}} basis, but it was poor quality because the dry-plate emulsion was coated onto the paper only as an afterthought. <b>Coating</b> <b>machines</b> {{for the production of}} continuous rolls of sensitized paper were in use by the mid-1880s, though widespread adoption of gelatin silver print materials did not occur until the 1890s.

40|$|Plant {{proteins}} from leguminous {{seeds are}} a highly interesting {{raw material for}} paper coating processes. Due to their high molecular weight and their amphotheric character they can act as binder and co-binder in paper coating formulations for offset or rotogravure papers. At present, plant proteins are used only in small amounts as the runnability on industrially used high-speed <b>coating</b> <b>machines</b> is limited. To overcome this situation, both protein isolates and protein based binders have to be evaluated regarding rheological characteristics under high-shear conditions. Solubility behaviour nd rheological characteristics will be presented. Relults are pointing out, that the solubility can be enhanced when dissociating the globulin protein fraction into sub-units with reduced molecular weight. The rheological behaviour will be discussed using standard binder formulations with varying binder content at different temperatures...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of the up-scaling of {{industrial}} deposition methods, the demands on productivity as well as on precision are continuously increasing. Both requirements are conflictive, since e. g. an increase of the substrate size for higher productivity often involves homogeneity issues. The increasing complexity and size of <b>coating</b> <b>machines</b> hampers their further enhancement by pure empirical approaches. For this reason, the research and development on coating technology nowadays becomes more focused on simulation methods. At Fraunhofer institute for surface engineering and thin Films we have developed a particle-in-cell monte carlo simulation environment for transport phenomena and gas discharges in the low-pressure regime. This tool can be used for predictions and optimizations in the development of new deposition sources, furthermore the general insight in plasma discharge mechanisms can be improved...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} deposition {{conditions for}} the preparation of hard amorphous carbon films with hardness values above 50 GPa are now well known: high energy of the impinging carbon particles and low deposition temperature. Such conditions are in good accordance with the widely accepted subplantation concept. Notwithstanding this basic understanding, {{the influence of the}} specific plasma conditions such as electron temperature and ion energy distribution are rather uncertain. A number of suitable carbon ion sources: ArF and Nd-YAG lasers, laser controlled Arc (Laser Arc) and filtered high current pulsed Arc (f-HCA) have been applied. Using the same investigation methods for all plasma sources enables a direct comparison of plasma parameters and film properties. The plasma investigation includes electron temperature, ionization state and distribution of the kinetic energy, the film characterization evaluates the mechanical and optical properties. A very productive plasma source is the filtered high current pulsed Arc(f-HCA), which will be applied in industrial <b>coating</b> <b>machines.</b> A general insight in the necessary plasma conditions allows us to improve the f-HCAand develop new plasma sources...|$|R
40|$|Amorphous {{hydrogenated}} {{diamond-like carbon}} films (a-C:H) {{are well known}} for their high hardness, high wear resistance and low friction coefficients. The incorporation of additional elements leads to considerable modifications of the coating properties. E. g. silicon containing a-C:H:Si coatings provide low friction coefficients and lower surface energies. Incorporation of Si and O (a-C:H:Si:O) leads to highly hydrophobic coatings with still lower surface energies (< 25 mN/m). Both types of modified coatings had anti-adhesive properties. Modified DLC coatings were prepared by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) processes, powered with radio frequency, bipolar pulsed DC voltage or by a linear micro wave plasma source in industrial scale <b>coating</b> <b>machines.</b> The different DLC modifications can be combined in a multilayer coating for optimization of properties. The developed modified DLC films with low surface energies and high wear resistance are promising for several technical applications, e. g. for forming or pressing tools or for reduction of fouling effects in heat exchangers. These coatings were used to realize an alternative approach for inside coating of pipes. After coating deposition on flat metal sheets followed a cold forming process to fabricate a pipe and a welding along the joint line to close the pipe...|$|R
