40|$|In {{connection}} with the project of erecting an equestrian statue for King Frederick the Great of Prussia, the Berlin sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow was in the autumn 1791 sent on a research tour to the three Baltic capitals, Stockholm, St. Petersburg and Copenhagen. Here he studied and discussed similar recent projects with fellow artists, and brought reports back to Berlin on the equestrian statues by Pierre Hubert L'Archevêque and Johan Tobias Sergel (Gustavus Adolphus in Stockholm), by Étienne Maurice Falconet (Peter the Great in St. Petersburg) and by Jacques François Joseph Saly (Frederick V in <b>Copenhagen).</b> <b>Documents</b> not previously published throw {{new light on the}} contacts Schadow during these travels established with the Danish painter Nicolai Abildgaard, a contact, it is here argued, that strengthened Schadow's commitment to use a historically accurate, more realistic and less idealised stylistic idiom when depicting great figures from the national past...|$|R
40|$|Addiction is {{a central}} issue in a liberal society of {{autonomous}} citizens, as the nodal point of addiction is self-control - or rather the lack of it. By looking at different ways of problematizing and working upon addiction, one might also get some idea of different ways of conceptualizing and practicing freedom. The {{point of departure for}} my paper is practices of methadone maintenance in different regimes of drug treatment. The article illustrates how treatment practices produce different forms of subjectification of drug addicts, depending on the discourses and technologies these practices articulate, and by implication, how they constitute different ways of problematizing freedom as something to be worked upon. My argument is based on interviews with managers of the drug treatment system in <b>Copenhagen,</b> <b>documents</b> concerning drug policy and drug treatment on a local and national level as well as addiction research. My analyses in this paper are tentative and a first report from a study currently under way. </p...|$|R
50|$|Lemkos (Лeмки, Łemkowie, Lemko: Лeмкы, translit. Lemkŷ; sing. Лeмкo, Lemko) are {{an ethnic}} {{sub-group}} inhabiting {{a stretch of}} the Carpathian Mountains known as Lemkivshchyna. Many Lemkos are classified as a branch of Ukrainians by the Ukrainian government. Ukraine has signed but not honored the CSCE/OSCE <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Document</b> of 1990, Article IV particularly, granting self-identified Lemkos minority rights status in Ukraine. Slovakia identifies them as a sub-group of Rusyns (Ruthenians), an East Slavic minority distinct from Ukrainians. Rusyns themselves have been abandoning Ukrainian nationality, enforced during Communism, {{in favor of a}} Rusyn identity, which can be observed in the minority statistics of Slovakia.|$|E
5000|$|Election {{observation}} is also prescribed by various international legal instruments. For example, paragraph 8 of the 1990 <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Document</b> states that [...] "The OSCE participating States {{consider that the}} presence of observers, both foreign and domestic, can enhance the electoral process for States in which elections are taking place. They therefore invite observers from any other CSCE participating States and any appropriate private institutions and organizations who may wish to do so to observe the course of their national election proceedings, to the extent permitted by law. They will also endeavor to facilitate similar access for election proceedings held below the national level. Such observers will undertake not to interfere in the electoral proceedings".|$|E
5000|$|At the {{invitation}} of the United States government, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sent a team of observers to monitor the presidential elections in 2004. It {{was the first time}} the OSCE had sent observers to a U.S. presidential election, although they had been invited in the past. In September 2004 the OSCE issued a report on U.S. electoral processes and the election final report. The report reads: [...] "The November 2, 2004 elections in the United States mostly met the OSCE commitments included in the 1990 <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Document.</b> They were conducted in an environment that reflects a long-standing democratic tradition, including institutions governed by the rule of law, free and generally professional media, and a civil society intensively engaged in the election process. There was exceptional public interest in the two leading presidential candidates and the issues raised by their respective campaigns, as well as in the election process itself." ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} the opportunities the Municipality of Copenhagen has to strengthen diversity through the social housing sector {{by looking at}} the interplay between the positions of the Danish State and the Municipality of Copenhagen. The examination has been conducted as a Pierre Bourdieu inspired field study of the field of housing policy in what is roughly the geographical area of the Copenhagen Municipality. Our understanding of the field of housing policy in Copenhagen is derived from historical and contemporary developments and struggles between positions in the field. Furthermore we have made use of Jane Jacobs’ thoughts about how diversity is constitutional for the good city. The methods used to gather data consists of two interviews with representatives of the social housing sector in Denmark and the Municipality of <b>Copenhagen,</b> official <b>documents</b> from different actors within the field, maps and secondary statistics. From our analysis we have concluded that the vision of diversity represented by the Municipality of Copenhagen is threatened by inconsistencies in the housing policies, which prevents the achievement of the vision...|$|R

50|$|The first High Commissioner, Max van der Stoel, {{focused on}} {{clarifying}} and defining his mandate. He did this by consulting many experts on minority rights and international law, and thereby developing {{a set of}} guidelines and practices for overcoming the ambiguities in the mandate. Through the broadly defined mandate, {{he was able to}} approach the role in the best way he saw fit. The approach taken by van der Stoel came to define how his successors approached the role too. His definition of “national minorities” had three different elements. Firstly, a national minority could be distinguished from the rest of society through linguistic, ethnic or cultural characteristics. Secondly, that minority strived to protect and strengthen those characteristics which made up its identity. Finally, he referenced paragraph 32 of the 1990 CSCE <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Document,</b> which emphasised that being a part of a national minority was a person’s individual choice. In the approach taken by van der Stoel and his successors, there is no requirement that a national minority be a numerical minority in the population. In many cases a national minority will be a majority in certain countries or regions.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Document</b> {{was adopted}} {{in the wake of}} the Cold War, with the {{situation}} of ‘national minorities’ in Central and Eastern Europe and former Soviet States in mind. However, by recognising the potential for the violation of human rights to lead to conflict, the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Document</b> remains relevant to minority situations throughout the world. This article explores the increasing relevance of these rights to Muslim minorities in Western Europe. It is argued that if Western European States wish to proactively prevent conflict with their Muslim populations, lessons can be learnt from the approach {{adopted in the}} <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Document.</b> In particular, the emphasis on encouraging societal cohesion in order to reduce the potential for conflict, through effective participation in public affairs and intercultural dialogue and tolerance, is a message that must be heeded by Western European States...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the implications of both individual and collective dimensions {{of the right to}} self-identify and reappraises the key challenges to its realisation. The article argues that the status of the right to self-identify as a fundamental right remains unclear over {{a quarter of a century}} after its inclusion in the CSCE/OSCE <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Document</b> in 1990. The article starts by revisiting some of the ‘justice-oriented’ arguments made in the early 1990 s about the need for group-differentiated rights in order to highlight the importance of the right to self-identify as an integral part of the European minority rights framework. It then proceeds to argue that the case for giving greater prominence to this right is strengthened if the challenge of cosmopolitanism is also considered. The second part of the article is focused more specifically on the challenges to the realisation of the right, particularly the collective dimension. It argues that this can be attributed to the continued deference to States in relation to the scope of application of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and that there needs to be a greater focus on the internalisation of the right at the domestic level...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. By the mid- 1990 s, {{a set of}} {{standards}} concerning minority protections emerged from elite-level dialogue between European states, particularly within the forums provided by international institutions. Developing a post-Cold War minority rights ‘regime’ {{was thought to be}} critical, particularly for Western elites, in stemming population flows westwards precipitated by emerging ethnic tensions. Post-Cold War standards have been delineated within key agreements of the two organizations most involved {{in the development of a}} new minority rights regime: the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe (COE). These include the OSCE’s 1990 <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Document</b> and 1991 Geneva Report as well as the COE’s 1995 Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Post-Cold War ‘European’ norms ultimately include the following principles: (1) the notion of identity being an individual’s choice; (2) the idea that ‘individuals belonging to national minorities’ should have unimpeded access to human rights accorded to all individuals; (3) the idea that they must free from state-sponsored discrimination and share equality before the law; (4) the right to maintain and develop minority culture privately and publicly; (5) the right to form contacts with foreigners of the same cultural background; (6) the right to charge their respective governments of violating the above in European-wide forums; and finally responsibility for (7) demonstrating loyalty to the states individuals belonging to national minorities call home...|$|E
