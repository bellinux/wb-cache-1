5|$|Deception {{and problem}} solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players {{use a variety of}} ways to hide the truth while the {{children}} employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving concepts to piece together the <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.|$|E
5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 Dungeons & Dragons {{role-playing}} game module Ruins of Adventure {{was produced}} {{using the same}} adventure scenario as Pool of Radiance, using the same plot, background, setting, {{and many of the}} same characters as the computer game. The module thus contains useful <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> successful completion of the computer missions. Ruins of Adventure contains four linked miniscenarios, which form the core of Pool of Radiance. According to the editors of Dragon magazine, Pool of Radiance was based on Ruins of Adventure, and not vice versa.|$|E

50|$|Hilario recounts {{a version}} of the death of Odysseus from {{stingray}} venom, which provides Flavia with a <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> death of Titus.|$|R
5|$|The {{communications}} between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite, provide {{the only significant}} <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location of Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see next section). The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Cutter first {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He {{is a friend}} of Nate's and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she {{inquires}} about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe claustrophobia, requiring a lot of prompting just to squeeze through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Nate, Chloe, and Sully {{in the first part of}} the game with finding the <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He gets injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nate to go on and stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like a blunt, common thug, he appears to be well educated, quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sully's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazarevic in the second game.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, paleontological {{exploration}} intensified {{everywhere and}} {{ceased to be}} a largely European and North American activity. In the 135 years between Buckland's first discovery and 1969 a total of 170 dinosaur genera were described. In the 25 years after 1969 that number increased to 315. Much of this increase was due to the examination of new rock exposures, particularly in previously little-explored areas in South America and Africa. Near the end of the 20th century the opening of China to systematic exploration for fossils has yielded a wealth of material on dinosaurs and the origin of birds and mammals. Also study of the Chengjiang fauna, a Cambrian fossil site in China, during the 1990s has provided important <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> origin of vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|John Kramer's widow Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an {{internal}} affairs detective from the precinct where Detective Mark Hoffman works. She incriminates Hoffman {{in exchange for}} protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman ever since he saved his life by gunning down a homeless man, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom and now uses a cane and prosthetic foot, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a self-help guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying his own survival story. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and {{a lower level of}} activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
30|$|The {{case for}} the lack of {{engagement}} was presenting ideas and not receiving any comments from the partner. The presence of silence is a <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lack of engagement.|$|R
50|$|After {{two letters}} are picked, if no correct guess is given, another toss-up puzzle is played. Each toss-up puzzle is a <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main phrase puzzle that's in play.|$|R
50|$|Each {{question}} {{gives the}} contestant three opportunities <b>to</b> answer: answering <b>the</b> question alone, {{answering the question}} with an additional <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> answer, and answering the question {{with a choice of}} two answers.|$|R
5|$|Night Trap is an {{interactive}} movie video game that uses full motion video (FMV) {{to present the}} story and gameplay. The player is instructed by the in-game police squad to watch live surveillance footage of the Martin household and trigger traps to capture anyone that is seen endangering the house guests. Cameras are situated in eight locations {{in and around the}} house: the entry way, living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, driveway, and two hallways. A map is available as well so the player can see how the rooms are connected. The player can freely switch between viewing the different cameras to keep up on house activities and pick up clues from conversations. Kelli, an undercover agent, will also provide <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player. The player must avoid trapping her, any other agent, or the house guests.|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Eagle is {{the only}} feature film {{directed}} by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints of the film are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut's book. More stills have recently been found to exist, {{many of which are}} reproduced in Dan Auiler's book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at a flea market in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. Although these images gave <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (£3,700). Hitchcock's notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl, by train, horse and cart, and by foot.|$|E
5|$|The strongest <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side}} of the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic {{function of}} the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of each episode, host Anderson Cooper {{encouraged}} viewers to {{keep an eye out for}} a hidden <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mole's identity. One clue was revealed in each episode, ranging from straightforward references to Bill's background to highly esoteric wordplays. Some <b>clues</b> were presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> players, while others were available only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home audience.|$|R
25|$|The {{questions}} of how sleep {{evolved in the}} animal kingdom and how it developed in humans are especially important because they might provide a <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> functions and mechanisms of sleep respectively.|$|R
40|$|Disseminated {{histoplasmosis}} can be <b>the</b> initial <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{presence of}} AIDS. In HIV infected patients, histoplasmosis can present with unusual manifestations, without a positive exposure history {{or outside the}} typical endemic area. Untreated histoplasmosis can be potentially life-threatening and <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> diagnose it effectively and efficiently are essential...|$|R
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character of his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying {{the depth of the}} engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
5|$|Paranota plus leg gene {{recruitment}} hypothesis: The fossil larvae of Coxoplectoptera provided {{important new}} <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disputed {{question of the}} evolutionary origin of insect wings. Before the larvae fossil discovery the paranotal-hypothesis and the leg-exite-hypothesis have been considered as incompatible alternative explanations, which have both been supported {{by a set of}} evidences from the fossil record, comparative morphology, developmental biology and genetics. The expression of leg genes in the ontogeny of the insect wing has been universally considered as conclusive evidence in favour of the leg-exite-hypothesis, which proposes that insect wings are derived from mobile leg appendages (exites). However, the larvae of Coxoplectoptera show that the abdominal gills of mayflies and their ancestors, which are generally considered as corresponding structures to insect wings, articulated within the dorsal tergite plates. This cannot be seen in modern mayfly larvae, because their abdominal tergites and sternites are fused to rings, without any traces left even in embryonic development. If larval gills and wings are corresponding ("serial homologous") structures and thus share the same evolutionary origin, the new results from Coxoplectoptera demonstrate that also wings are of tergal origin, as proposed by the classical paranotal-hypothesis. Staniczek, Bechly & Godunko (2011) therefore suggested a new hypothesis that could reconcile the apparently conflicting evidence from paleontology and developmental genetics: wings first originated as stiff outgrowths of tergal plates (paranota), and only later in evolution became mobile, articulated appendages through secondary recruiting of leg genes.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the city of Los Angeles, in the year 1947, with players {{assuming}} the role of Los Angeles Police Department officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps. The game starts with Phelps as a uniformed patrolman, and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives players a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns players with cases that they must solve. After each case, players receive a rating of 1–5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crime, players can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps' war memories. Near the end of the final desk, players assume control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the player character for {{most of the rest of}} the game; although different in appearance and personality, he controls identically to Phelps.|$|E

50|$|The celebrities {{once again}} tried <b>to</b> convey <b>the</b> {{identity}} of a famous person or place <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contestants. One celebrity gave a <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> controlling contestant, who had five seconds to guess who {{it was with a}} correct word guess. If it wasn't guessed, the next celebrity in line gave a <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next contestant. This continued until one player guessed the word, with a maximum of four clues. A correct guess on the first clue was worth $200, and decreased in $50 increments for each clue needed afterward. $500 won the game and a chance to win $10,000 more at the Bonus Board.|$|R
5|$|Katherine Marlowe is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. She is the coldly calculating leader of a secret society whose roots date back over four hundred years {{to the court of}} Queen Elizabeth I. She has a long-standing rivalry with Nathan Drake over Sir Francis Drake’s ring – something they both contend is rightfully theirs and is also the key to an ancient mystery. Katherine Marlowe is a much more cerebral enemy than Drake has confronted in the past, using both psychological and physical tactics to get what she is after. Marlowe also has the assistance of her team of highly trained agents in this secret society – they are far more elusive and dangerous than the hired guns Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan have faced before. She treats her subordinates with slight disdain, getting annoyed with Talbot for hiring Charlie Cutter. Marlowe appears to have studied Nathan's past and reveals that he's not actually the direct decedent of Sir Francis Drake - he was merely in an orphanage named after the great explorer. She first meets a teenage Drake in Colombia, forcing him to give her the Cipher disk he had just stolen from a museum to her but fails to get Sir Francis Drakes ring when he runs off. Twenty years later, she meets with Drake in an Alleyway and steals his ring. However, she soon discovers it's a fake and promptly loses both the disc and the ring when Drake steals both. Marlowe then sends Talbot and her agents to France and Syria, successfully getting the <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location of Ubar. She then captures Nate and Sully and leaves for the lost city. Nathan eventually finds her using a winch to drag out King Solomon's hallucinogenic Talisman from the lakes in Ubar and destroys the foundations of the city, causing Marlowe to fall into a pool of quicksand. Though Drake attempts to save her, Marlowe submerges and dies.|$|E
5|$|Zoran Lazarević is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Graham McTavish. He is a homicidal Serbian terrorist. The {{majority of the world}} believes he is dead after a bombing, but he survives with half of his face scarred. Lazarevic pays Flynn to betray Drake, tricking him into giving Flynn information on the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and causing Drake's arrest. In reality, Lazarevic wants to possess the mythic Cintamani Stone, which the fleet was supposedly transporting. He discovers that the fleet never had the stone, and dispatches a group of mercenaries to Nepal for <b>clues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location of the legendary city of Shambhala. He incites a civil war in the region to aid in his search and distract from any possible discovery. In Nepal, Lazarevic personally executes Fisher's cameraman Jeff, and follows Drake after he discovers the location of Shambhala's entrance. Lazarevic invades the small Tibetan village harboring Drake and Elena, seeking the key to reveal Shambhala. He kidnaps Schäfer and forces him to reveal the general area of the entrance. When Drake and Fisher follow, Lazarevic apprehends them and forces Drake to reveal the entrance to Shambhala. There, he drinks the sap of the Cintamani Stone, which is made of the sap of the Tree of Life. He battles Drake with his newfound powers, but is defeated by Drake and beaten by the guardians of Shambhala and assumingly killed when the temple falls apart. He appears later along with Harry Flynn and Eddy Raja in the online co-op story in Uncharted 3. Lazarevic uses a pump-action shotgun as his main weapon.|$|E
