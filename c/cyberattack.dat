This version had been modified to propagate using the same EternalBlue exploit that was used by WannaCry. Due to another design change, it is also unable to actually unlock a system after the ransom is paid; this led to security analysts speculating that the attack {{was not meant to}} generate illicit profit, but to simply cause disruption.|$|E

50|$|In October 2012, {{a former}} United States {{government}} {{official said that}} American authorities believe that Iranian hackers, who were likely supported by the Iranian government, were responsible for <b>cyberattacks</b> against oil and gas companies in the Persian Gulf. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has called the <b>cyberattacks</b> the most destructive <b>cyberattacks</b> in the private sector. Another American official said that the Obama administration knows that a government {{was responsible for the}} <b>cyberattacks,</b> which was confirmed by American agencies investigating the <b>cyberattacks.</b>|$|R

Beginning roughly one week earlier, DDoS attacks had repeatedly taken the site offline for extended periods. Cybersecurity analysts speculated that the attack was {{on the scale of}} the 2016 Dyn <b>cyberattack</b> and suggested that {{only a small number of}} groups would have the ability to take down a highly-trafficked site for extended lengths of time.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} before the 2016 election, Frank uses ICO as a pretext to {{enacting}} martial law in urban areas and consolidating polling places in key states. Done mainly through back channels with Democratic governors, this is officially done {{in the name of}} safety, but in practice disenfranchises rural Republican voters. To keep the strategy of fear going, Doug blackmails hacker Aidan Macallan into launching a massive <b>cyberattack</b> on the NSA, slowing down Internet traffic and wiping out hundreds of thousands of files. The Underwood Administration pins the attack on ICO.|$|E

30|$|As {{stated in}} [13], SDN {{technologies}} can be configured to devise three lines {{of defense for}} minimizing the potential risks of <b>cyberattacks</b> in individual microgrid operations. These three lines take effect in close coordination for striving against <b>cyberattacks.</b> More specifically, {{the first line of}} defense including application-segmentation and online verification is aimed at restricting and detecting cyber intrusions which can deter attackers from executing <b>cyberattacks</b> on intra-microgrid communications; the second line of defense including moving-target defense and defensive deception is designed to make it difficult for attackers to achieve their goals in case attackers can successfully infiltrate the microgrid communication network; the third line of defense including self-healing communication networking plays a role in restoring cybersecurity when intra-microgrid communications are inevitably affected by <b>cyberattacks.</b> The communications would be secured such that attackers could have a minute chance for penetrating and compromising the communication network while the MGMC would have a better opportunity for mitigating the implications of <b>cyberattacks</b> effectively and promptly.|$|R
40|$|Cyberwar is {{everywhere}} - in the media, in the military, among politicians and in academia. It {{is the new}} weapon of mass discussion. But {{there is no such}} thing as cyberwar. This observation, however, does not render <b>cyberattacks</b> unimportant. The article revisits the debate on Carl von Clausewitz's On War (1832), and examines the utility of <b>cyberattacks</b> as a tool in future war. In doing so, the article not only targets the misunderstandings and exaggerations prevalent in the literature, but demonstrates that Clausewitz's On War, albeit being two centuries old, is a valuable analytical lens in making sense of the relationship between <b>cyberattacks</b> and war. Drawing on the Clauzewitzian trinity, the article finds that <b>cyberattacks</b> can be useful tools in warfare, particularly in the initial stages of war. They are easily deployable and have already proven capable of causing physical damage. However, the article argues that <b>cyberattacks</b> remain inferior to conventional military weaponry, ultimately rendering cyberwar - understood as a war fought primarily through cyberspace - unlikely...|$|R

500|$|In {{the days}} before the election, Underwood pushes Congress to {{formally}} declare war on ICO, and orders the CIA to kill one of the terrorists and make it look like he had died fleeing capture. Underwood still lags in the polls, however, and on election night it appears he is going to lose to Conway. With help from Stamper and campaign strategist LeAnn Harvey (Neve Campbell), Underwood has NSA contractor Aidan Macallan (Damian Young) stage a <b>cyberattack</b> on several election stations. He also uses the fear of a possible terrorist attack to pressure the governors of Tennessee and Ohio to halt voting. The tactics work; the two states refuse to declare a winner, and the election drags on unresolved for several weeks.|$|E

2500|$|Semiautonomous swarming, {{in which}} the actors {{occasionally}} interfere with one another, is seen in attacks on computer networks by loose confederations of malicious hackers. On occasion, especially when the attack uses a botnet, some of the units may try to overpower and control one another, {{as well as the}} target. One of the observations of the Center on Terrorism and Irregular Warfare was that unfocused mass disruption was not a useful terrorist, and by extension general military, tactic. The 9/11 attacks had symbolism. A <b>cyberattack</b> on a stock market would have symbolism.

2500|$|In a major {{speech on}} January 21, 2010, Clinton, {{speaking}} {{on behalf of}} the U.S., declared that [...] "We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas", while highlighting how [...] "even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable." [...] She also drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet. Her speech, which followed a controversy surrounding Google's changed policy toward China and censorship, appears to mark a split between authoritarian capitalism and the Western model of free capitalism and Internet access. Chinese officials responded strongly, saying Clinton's remarks were [...] "harmful to Sino-American relations" [...] and demanded that U.S. officials [...] "respect the truth", and some foreign policy observers thought that Clinton had been too provocative. But the White House stood behind Clinton, and demanded that China provide better answers regarding the recent Chinese <b>cyberattack</b> against Google. Clinton's speech garnered marked attention among diplomats, as {{it was the first time}} a senior American official had clearly put forth a vision in which the Internet was a key element of American foreign policy.|$|E

40|$|Meeting Theme: Powering Up the Next GenerationCyber {{security}} is one critical issue for internet protocol (IP) -based cyber-physical systems. To protect physical systems from possible malicious intrusions, cyber infrastructures, e. g., firewalls, are installed in systems. However, with more intelligent <b>cyberattacks,</b> existing firewalls {{may not be}} advanced enough to protect these intelligent <b>cyberattacks,</b> which increase the probability of outages and reduce system reliability levels. In this case, cyber infrastructures should be updated to deal with more intelligent <b>cyberattacks.</b> This paper proposes a probabilistic method for making decisions about updating strategies of cyber infrastructures. Considering stochastic characteristics of <b>cyberattacks,</b> a reliability-based cost-effective updating model for cyber infrastructures is formulated. The optimal updating strategy balances the system reliability and the cost caused by updating cyber infrastructures. The proposed method is illustrated on the IEEE 30 -bus system, and the results show the feasibility for informing updating cyber infrastructures. © 2015 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
