The retention behaviour of sulphated heparin and chondroitin disaccharides of different charge levels was studied on PGC capillary columns. It was found that the retention was strongly dependent on the choice of buffer and number of sulphate groups on the disaccharides. An increase in retention was observed when the temperature or the concentration of the organic modifier was increased. A packed capillary PGC column was also used to separate the polar drug L-DOPA and four of its metabolites in plasma.

The formulations consist of HDPE as the base polymer, a <b>carrier</b> chemical <b>pack</b> containing an organic unsaturated silane and a free radical generating agent and condensation catalyst. In designing and formulating silane crosslinkable blow molded HDPE compounds with satisfactory properties, ASTM D 2647 {{was used as the}} reference. Grafting and crosslinking reaction was proposed for the formulated system. The product was characterized for the chemical, thermal, physical and mechanical properties. The chemical reactions during grafting and crosslinking involved a three step mechanisms. Extrusion blow molded bottle were stored in water for curing at various temperature and time. DSC, FTIR and TGA were used to determine the chemical groups involved in the reactions and gel contents were determined in parallel. The results from curing showed that a further formation of Si-O-Si crosslinkâ€™s took place after the point at which maximum gel contents has been reached. Mechanical measurements indicated that further crosslinkâ€™s were formed within the existing gel. Suitable range concentration relating to 100 parts of base polymer was found for vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMO) to be between 1. 6 to 2. 0 phr. The concentration of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) initiator was between 0. 1 to 0. 5 phr. The concentration of dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL condensation catalyst) was being 0. 005 to 0. 02. When the DBTL amount was less than 0. 005 phr, the crosslinking reaction did not proceed sufficiently. As the DBTL amount was larger than 0. 02 phr, local crosslinking proceeds in the extruder at the time of extrusion, results in great deterioration of the products. The selected components used in the formulation are HDPE grade HB 6200, vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMO) as the crosslinking agent, dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as the initiator, dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) as the condensation catalyst and Irganox 1010 as the antioxidant.

40|$|ANGLÈS] In recent years, {{the growing}} number of oceanographic {{applications}} that rely on underwater communications has motivated extensive research in the field. These scientific projects usually require data acquisition from sensor networks or the use of unmanned underwater vehicles. One method to establish communication with such underwater systems is through the use of wired links. However, cables are hard to install or repair at certain depths, and can dramatically limit the mobility of both communication ends. Underwater wireless communications do not have such constraints and therefore present a much more attractive approach for underwater data transfer. Electromagnetic waves typically provide higher throughputs than any other wireless communication method. However, they suffer from tremendous attenuation in water mediums. Consequently, underwater radio communications are only applicable to very short range high-speed links. For general purpose communications, acoustic waves are the preferred method. The fact that the wave propagation speed is five orders of magnitude smaller causes serious issues, such as long end-to-end delays and extreme Doppler distortion produced by the relative motion between transmitter and receiver. The underwater channel also suffers from multipath propagation produced by wave refraction, as well as reflections from the surface and the sea bed. The aforementioned issues complicate the design of an underwater acoustic system, which is able to offer both reliability and a reasonable communication speed at the same time. The aim of this work is to increase the robustness of the state-of-the-art underwater communication schemes. We achieve this goal using multiple transmitting and receiving elements, where each transmitter-receiver combination counts as an additional communication channel. The increased number of parallel channels drastically reduces the the error probability of the link, i. e. the probability that all channels are experiencing simultaneous fading. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is considered for frequency-selective underwater acoustic (UWA) channels as it offers low complexity of fast Fourier transform-based (FFT) signal processing, and ease of reconfiguration for use with different bandwidths. In addition, by virtue of having a narrowband signal on each carrier, OFDM is easily conducive to multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system configurations. MIMO systems have been considered for UWA channels both for increasing the system throughput via spatial multiplexing and for improving the systems performance via spatial diversity. The focus of our present work is on transmit diversity, which we pursue through the use of Alamouti coding applied across the carriers of an OFDM signal. Space-frequency block coding (SFBC) is chosen over traditional space-time block coding (STBC) as better suited for use with acoustic OFDM signals. Namely, while the Alamouti coherence assumption may be challenged between two adjacent OFDM blocks on a time-varying acoustic channel, it is expected to hold between two adjacent OFDM carriers: frequency coherence assumption coincides with the basic OFDM design principle which calls for carriers to be spaced closely enough that the channel transfer function can be considered flat over each sub-band. Previous studies in radio communications have also revealed situations in which SFBC outperforms STBC. Two types of approaches have been considered for MIMO OFDM acoustic systems: nonadaptive, where each block is processed independently using pilot-assisted channel estimation, and adaptive, where coherence between adjacent blocks is exploited to enable decision-directed operation and reduce the pilot overhead. Both approaches require front-end synchronization for initial Doppler compensation through signal resampling. Front-end processing remains unchanged for multiple transmitters if they are co-located and experience the same gross Doppler effect. Otherwise, multiple resampling branches may be needed to compensate for transmitter-specific Doppler shifting. Leveraging on the adaptive MIMO-OFDM design, we develop a receiver algorithm for the SFBC scenario. Specifically, we decouple the channel distortion into a slowly-varying gain and a faster-varying phase, which enables us to track these parameters at different speeds. For estimating the channel, we use either the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm or a newly developed algorithm based on least squares with adaptive thresholding (LS-AT). This algorithm computes the full-size LS solution to the impulse response (IR) domain channel representation, then truncates it to keep only the significant IR coefficients. However, unlike the typical truncated LS solutions which use a fixed truncation threshold, the threshold is determined adaptively so as to provide a proper level of sparseness. LS-AT is found to perform close to OMP, at a lower computational cost. Once an initial channel estimate is formed, its tracking continues via time-smoothing. Simultaneously, an estimate of the residual Doppler scale is made for each of the two transmitters, and this estimate is used to predict and update the carrier phases in each new OFDM block. The advantages of Alamouti SFBC are contingent upon frequency coherence, which increases as more <b>carriers</b> are <b>packed</b> within a given bandwidth (the bandwidth efficiency simultaneously increases). However, there is a fine line after which inter-carrier interference (ICI) will be generated, and this line should not be crossed if simplicity of Alamouti detection is to be maintained. We assess this trade-off through simulation and experimental data processing, showing the existence of an optimal number of carriers and an accompanying transmit diversity gain. [CASTELLÀ] En los últimos años, el volumen de investigación en el campo de las comunicaciones subacuáticas ha aumentado de forma considerable. La nueva variedad de aplicaciones científicas como, por ejemplo, el control de la polución y las especies marinas autóctonas, la monitorización de movimientos sísmicos del suelo marino o la exploración subacuática del hielo del Ártico, entre otras, han motivado su investigación más allá de las aplicaciones militares. Estas aplicaciones requieren, en la mayoría de casos, el uso de redes de sensores o de vehículos subacuáticos no tripulados, que habitualmente se comunican mediante redes inalámbricas a fin de evitar las restricciones de movilidad y la complejidad que supone la instalación de cableado submarino. La fuerte atenuación que sufren las ondas electromagnéticas en el medio acuático restringe su uso exclusivamente a enlaces de alta capacidad pero corto alcance del orden de centímetros. Las comunicaciones de propósito general se establecen mediante ondas acústicas. En estos casos, la velocidad de propagación de onda es cinco órdenes de magnitud inferior y juega un rol muy importante, debido a que los retrasos de propagación en enlaces de pocos kilómetros son del orden del segundo. Además, el movimiento relativo entre transmisor y receptor genera una severa distorsión por efecto Doppler que requiere procesado de señal adicional en el receptor. El canal subacuático también se caracteriza por la propagación multicamino, provocada por refracción y las reflexiones de la onda con la superficie y el fondo marino. Las dificultades mencionadas complican el diseño de un sistema que sea a la vez fiable y tenga una capacidad de transmisión razonable. El objetivo de este proyecto es diseñar un sistema que transmite códigos espacio-frecuencia, con la finalidad de obtener diversidad en transmisión y mejorar de forma notable la calidad del enlace de comunicaciones. La motivación para investigar los códigos espacio-frecuencia se basa en el hecho que recientemente se han obtenido resultados esperanzadores con el uso de códigos espacio-tiempo. No obstante, la variación de canal limita de forma considerable el rendimiento de los códigos espacio-tiempo, ya que el código se extiende a más de un bloque temporal. El objetivo es evitar este efecto cambiando la dimensión temporal por frecuencia aún manteniendo la estructura y beneficios del código original. Así, las diferentes partes del código son multiplexadas de forma simultánea en diferentes frecuencias y la transmisión completa del código se consigue con un solo uso de canal. En este proyecto se utiliza como modulación el multiplexado en división de frecuencia ortogonal (OFDM), principalmente porqué ofrece un método muy sencillo para ecualizar canales selectivos. La modulación OFDM también ofrece una versatilidad muy interesante para reconfigurar el ancho de banda y el espaciado entre frecuencias portadoras. Además, el uso combinado de OFDM y los sistemas multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) simplifica notablemente el procesado de señal, ya que cada portadora puede ser tratada como un canal no selectivo. Los sistemas MIMO se usan en canales acústicos subacuáticos tanto para incrementar la velocidad de transmisión como para mejorar el rendimiento de los sistemas aprovechando la diversidad espacial. En nuestro caso, se usa un sistema MIMO con el objetivo de obtener diversidad en transmisión a partir del uso de códigos Alamouti transformados al dominio frecuencial. Los códigos bloque espacio-frecuencia (SFBC) son más adecuados para la modulación OFDM que los códigos espacio-tiempo (STBC). Esto se debe a que los bloques OFDM suelen tener una duración considerable que puede comprometer la condición de coherencia, la cual exige un canal constante durante todos los bloques que conforman el código. Cuando se usan códigos SFBC, la coherencia de canal debe ser respetada de la misma manera pero durante dos portadoras adyacentes. Afortunadamente este requisito coincide con la condición de diseño de la modulación OFDM, en la cual las portadoras adyacentes deben ser suficientemente cercanas como para que el canal pueda considerarse constante.
