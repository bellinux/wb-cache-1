40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{future of}} the {{biodiesel}} industry will rely on several critical issues. The major factors are {{the price of a}} barrel of crude oil versus the price of soybean oil, and the cost of turning both products into usable diesel fuel. While this relationship will be the primary focus of {{whether or not it is}} feasible to produce soybean-based biodiesel, there are many other variables that will affect the underlying economic incentives for this industry to grow. Over time, technology will improve and the cost of production will decrease. Unfortunately, creating the market at a time when the profitability is low is difficult, and this makes advances in technology slow in coming online. Government subsidies, at both the federal and state levels have played a role in jumpstarting the industry, but many wonder whether this funding is being used in the best way possible, and if so, how much should the government be willing to put in to the industry. Unfortunately, in some ways, the government programs on biofuels are working against each other, in the sense that promoting both ethanol and biodiesel causes a struggle over available land for corn and soybeans. This drives land prices higher which increases the cost of production for both crops, and eventually lowers the profit margin on producing either biofuel since the raw product prices continue to rise. In general, all biodiesel plants face the same <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> and production, with regards to construction and soybean oil. The largest expense in production is the feedstock, soybean oil, which makes up nearly ninety percent of the final product, biodiesel. The other approximately ten percent of the biodiesel is a combination of methanol, or other alcohol, and a catalyst. Labor, electricity, maintenance, insurance, etc. make up the remaining costs of production. This leaves plants with few options for lowering their costs relative to other producers. The focus of this paper is to look at these other operating costs, find a range across the industry, and using FAPRI's 2007 U. S. Crops model, determine a best and worst case scenario looking at the future of this industry and how it will be influenced by these other operating costs. This project will help decide whether current government support for the biodiesel industry is sufficient for the sector to remain viable long-term. CAFNR On Campus Research Internshi...|$|E

Therefore, the established firm and the start-up firm seem to select different types of projects. We claim that this is the consequence of their optimal project allocation mechanism, which depends on their comparative advantage. The start-up firm may seem more "innovative" than the established firm because the comparative advantage <b>of</b> the <b>start-up</b> firm is to commercialize "innovative" projects, i. e. projects that do not fit with the established firms' existing assets. Our model integrates various facts found in the industrial organization literature about the entry rate, firm focus, firm growth, industry growth and innovation.

40|$|Taylor Farms {{has been}} one of the leading foodservice {{companies}} for the past 17 years. It is looking to expand its operations to include a line that would process red and yellow onions. To determine if this expansion would prove to be profitable, a projected budget for three scenarios was created. The scenarios were formulated to account for the “normal” base period, a “worst” case scenario, and a “best” case scenario. These three scenarios would account for periods where revenues and expenses were either higher or lower than the expected averages. The initial start-up costs as well as expenses of day-to-day operations and revenues were projected for each scenario for the period of 2012 to 2017. The addition of the line would prove to be profitable if the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> was covered within a 5 -year period and the internal rate of return was 7 % or higher. The analysis of the projected budgets determined that the “normal” case scenario would cover the initial <b>start-up</b> <b>cost</b> around June <b>of</b> 2017.

The growing importance of science is due to exciting breakthroughs in biology, information technology and advanced materials that have promise of tremendously improving human welfare. Along with the growing importance of science has come a growing flow of external funds to universities to support research. What is not well known, however, is that increasingly the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> research are being funded at universities {{are coming out of}} internal university funds. Over the last three decades of the 20 th century the percentage of university research that is funded out of internal funds rose from about 11 to 20 and internal research expenditures per faculty member almost quadrupled in real terms.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{models for}} short term planning (24 hours) of a hyro dominated hydrothermal power system. The {{purpose of the}} models is to minimizae the system operation costs to provide a forecasted load and keep enough spinning reserve. This thesis presents models for short term planning (24 hours) of a hydro dominated hydrothermal power system. The purpose of the models is to minimize the system operation cost to provide a forecasted load and keep enough spinning reserve.   The thesis focuses on two issues in hydro power modelling. The first issue {{is the relationship between}} water discharged and power generated. This relationship is a non-linear and non-convex function. If the plant has several units, the efficiency of the plant will have local maximums, so called local best-efficiency points. The second issue is {{to take into account the}} <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> <b>of</b> hydro units in the planning.   The hydro model is mixed-integer. Dischargs are allowed at zero flow, the local best-efficiency points and on the continuous part between the local best-efficiency point with the highest flow and the point with maximum flow. This last continuous part is modelled as a linear function. In order to get data for the start-up cost a survey among the largest power producers in Sweden has been made, where three questions about <b>start-ups</b> <b>of</b> hydro power units has been asked: What causes the costs in the start-up?, How much does a start-up cost? and How do start-ups effect the short-term scheduling strategies of power producers in Sweden? The results show that a fair estimate <b>of</b> the <b>start-up</b> <b>cost</b> is about $ 3 /MW nominal output. For the thermal plants a standard model with polynomial operation cost, start-up costs and ramp-rate constraints has been used. The model also includes the possibilities of purchasing and selling power to forecasted prices.   The planning problem is formulated as a mathematical programming problem. The solution technique uses Lagrange relaxation to decompose the problem into subproblems. There will be one subproblem for each hydro and thermal plant. In order to find good feasible solutions a heuristic technique to change the integer variables in the hydro system has been developed. The Lagrange multipliers are updated with the subgradient method.   The models are tested in three different load situations; a winter day (heavy load), an autumn day (medium load) and a summer day (light load). The result shows that the method gives near optimal schedules in reasonable computation time in cases with a normal part of the thermal units committed. The assumed start-up cost results in that hydro units almost never are started or stopped for one hour only. QC 20161206 </p...|$|R

40|$|Wind power varies over time, mainly {{under the}} {{influence}} of meteorological fluctuations. The variations occur on all time scales. Understanding these variations and their predictability is of key importance for the integration and optimal utilization of wind in the power system. There are two major attributes of variable generation that notably impact the participation on power exchanges: Variability (the output of variable generation changes and resulting in fluctuations in the plant output on all time scales) and Uncertainty (the magnitude and timing of variable generation output is less predictable, wind power output has low levels of predictability). Because of these variability and uncertainty wind plants cannot participate to electricity market, especially to power exchanges. For this purpose, the paper presents techno-economic analysis of work of wind plants together with combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant as support for offering continues power to electricity market. A model of wind farms and CCGT plant was developed in program PLEXOS based on real hourly input data and all characteristics of CCGT with especial analysis of techno-economic characteristics of different types of starts and stops of the plant. The Model analyzes the followings: <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> different start-stop characteristics (hot, warm, cold start-ups and shutdowns) and part load performance of CCGT. Besides the costs, the technical restrictions were considered such as start-up time depending on outage duration, minimum operation time, and minimum load or peaking capability. For calculation purposes, the following parameters are necessary to know {{in order to be able}} to economically evaluate changes in the start-up process: ramp up and down rate, time of start time reduction, fuel mass flow during start, electricity production during start, variable <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> process, <b>cost</b> and charges for life time consumption for each start and start type, remuneration during start up time regarding expected or unexpected starts, the cost and revenues for balancing energy (important when participating in electricity market), and the cost or revenues for CO 2 -certificates.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{literature on}} power markets with high shares of fluctuating renewables suggests that more frequent <b>start-up</b> procedures <b>of</b> thermal power plants may become an increasing concern, both for costs and possibly also for market design.

In contrast, increased flexibility of biomass power plants, additional power storage and larger block sizes have opposite effects. While the relevance <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> <b>costs</b> grows only moderately under baseline assumptions, it may increase further under alternative developments of system flexibility.

40|$|Althougln {{start-up}} and shutdown only {{account for}} {{a small percentage of}} the total operating time of an industrial chemical plant, still up to 4 6 % of the accidents occur during the start-up or shutdown. Furthermore, a large part <b>of</b> the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> a <b>start-up</b> account for the extra personnel that is needed on site. Therefore, it is logical to optimise both start-up time and safety. For this optimisation, dynamic models that simulate start-up behaviour are needed. The basis for this graduation assignment is a dynamic model of a glycolether process that has been developed in the equation-oriented simulation environment gPROMS. This process has a typical process layout, which consists of a reaction and recovery section with recycle. The recycle is used for heat integration with the feed. During start-up the system must be heated, because the reaction can only start at a high temperature. In this work the reboiler provides the heat and through the recycle the reactor is heated, making the use <b>of</b> a <b>start-up</b> heater unnecessary. Starting up the system in an integrated way and the presence of discontinuities provide a numerically challenging problem. Discontinuities are present, because the distillation column model incorporates equations for liquid weeping and vapour flowing through a downcomer; flows that are typically present during the first phase <b>of</b> a <b>start-up.</b> General guidelines for start-up were used to generate a basic start-up procedure, which is used for comparison with the optimised procedure. The optimisation objectives are a minimisation <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> time and a maximisation <b>of</b> safety during <b>start-up</b> <b>of</b> the integrated process. Safety includes a maximum breakthrough of reactants to the separation section, a maximum temperature in the reactor and a maximum temperature change everywhere in the process. A Pareto curve is used to visualise the trade-off between these objectives. Optimisation strategies for the reactor comprise choosing the optimal feed temperature (and thereby the optimal recycle temperature), choosing the optimal moment and quantity of reactant and catalyst addition and choosing the moment that the cooling water is started. Strategies for the distillation column involve establishing an optimal reboiler duty strategy and choosing the initial amount and composition of material in the reboiler and condenser. It has been found that ramping PO feed as well as the cooling water flow have a large influence on the safety objective. It has also been found that the total feed flow should be low for safety and for start-up time, because a large excess of MeOH absorbs so much heat from the process that the reaction can not start-up gradually. The temperature of the feed should be high to minimise start-up time, but low for a maximisation of safety. The Pareto curve obtained from the optimisations in gPROMS shows a trade-off between the objectives time and safety. It also shows that not much extra safety is gained if the start-up time is extended very long. However, which operating point on the curve is preferred depends on specific preferences.

In addition, it determined the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> providing treatment or support to these women through a psychological intervention that was delivered by trained community health workers. This thesis was a sub-study of the AFFIRM study (Africa Focus on Intervention Research for Mental Health) whose main objective {{was to determine the}} effectiveness, acceptability, cost-effectiveness and potential sustainability of a task-shifted psychological intervention offered to depressed mothers. To determine the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> maternal depression, health care costs were analyzed over a period of 3 months from both patient and provider perspectives; this information was obtained from participants during their first antenatal visit. These health service costs (excluding antenatal and well-baby visits) were compared between psychologically distressed pregnant women with different severity levels of depression; no depression, mild depression and moderate/severe depression. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the task-shifted intervention was calculated from a provider's perspective and compared to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the 'enhanced usual care' that was offered to women in the control arm. The main costs that were analyzed were the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> screening, <b>start-up</b> <b>costs,</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the rooms and recurrent costs. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the robustness of the study results. The results show that as the severity of maternal depression increases, the use of health services also increases. The health service utilisation costs among women with moderate/severe depression ($ 128. 27 per mother/child pair per 3 month period) were almost seven times those of women who did not have depression ($ 19. 70 per mother/child pair), amounting to a mean <b>cost</b> difference <b>of</b> $ 108. 57. For the intervention, salaries, followed by screening costs were the major cost drivers, with screening costs amounting to $ 26. 69 per mother screened positive. Assuming the intervention was delivered to completion without loss to follow up, the cost per mother for the intervention was $ 230. 47 in comparison to $ 69. 93 per mother for enhanced usual care. A sensitivity analysis showed that the screening costs were sensitive to the prevalence of maternal depression. From this study, it can be concluded that women with maternal depression use more health services and incur higher health care costs. It is possible to provide support to these women using psychological approaches that are delivered by lower level staff such as community health workers. This treatment can be affordable, depending on the budget constraints...|$|R

It is important to obtain a better grip on the growth development <b>of</b> <b>start-ups.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study is to map the development <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> in terms <b>of</b> employment growth and, in addition, to understand: what are the determinants <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>start-ups?...</b>|$|R

This paper {{is focused on the}} design of a stand-alone micro-grid for rural electrification. The aim of this work is to define the best mix of energy sources and the optimal size of the energy storage for a small isolated village on the Ghana seaside. We obtain the optimal solution by simulating one year of operation for several different combinations of prime movers and battery sizes and comparing the economic performance in terms <b>of</b> levelized <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> electricity. We adopt a rolling-horizon strategy to simulate the micro-grid operation, which optimizes generators and loads schedule over a 12 hours time horizon. We solve a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem for each time step, exploiting weather forecast for predicting the energy available from sun and wind and taking into account a realistic operation of each component like energy losses and <b>costs</b> during <b>start-up</b> <b>of</b> dispatchable generators and ageing cost for the battery. The optimal configuration found includes a 30 kWel wind turbine, a 60 kWel photovoltaic array, a 30 kWel biomass fired ORC and a 50 kWel diesel. The limited use of the diesel engine in the optimal solution demonstrates that energy access in a sustainable and economic way is possible even in rural contexts. Finally, two sensitivity analyses are presented varying the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the biomass and the error of wind speed forecast. cf 201...|$|R

To give incentives to the unemployed for starting a business, entrepreneurial activities should be rewarded with grants that cover the basic <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> living during the first six months <b>of</b> <b>start-up.</b> The overall goal of such an instrument is to increase the survival probability of entrepreneurs when their freshly created businesses are still vulnerable (for details on how to design start-up grants without creating windfall profits, see Caliendo and Kritikos, 2010).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{factors influencing}} {{the choice of}} liability status by the owners <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> firms. We propose a theoretical model that encompasses risk aversion, as well as differentials across liability states in the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital and tax rates, as reasons why entrepreneurs choose one liability status over another. The likelihood of observing limited liability is predicted to be concave in the project size and the financial wealth of the entrepreneur. We use a recently collected data set on German start-up firms to test the model and find {{strong support for the}} model's predictions. ...|$|R

They find that financial liberalization increases the total financial size <b>of</b> the individual <b>start-up</b> entrepreneurial project both via {{the increased use of}} external and of own funds. In addition, the volume <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> finance responds positively to international capital inflows, as represented by loans from nonresident banks and remittances, and negatively to the volume of offshore deposits. The positive impact of remittances on total volume <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> financing is via financing by the entrepreneur. capital flows, entrepreneurial traits, financial freedom, Global Entrepreneurship Monitor survey, informal finance, start-up financing,...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with Bayesian estimation and prediction in the context <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> demonstration tests in which rejection of a unit is possible when a pre-specified number of failures is observed prior to obtaining the number of consecutive successes required for acceptance of the unit. A method for implementing Bayesian inference on the probability of success is developed for use when the test result <b>of</b> each <b>start-up</b> is not reported or even recorded, and only the number of trials until termination of the testing is available. Some errors in the related literature on the Bayesian analysis <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> demonstration tests are corrected. The method developed in this paper is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method incorporating data augmentation, and it additionally enables Bayesian posterior inference {{on the number of}} failures given the number <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> trials until termination to be made, along with Bayesian predictive inferences on the number <b>of</b> <b>start-up</b> trials and the number of failures until termination for any future run <b>of</b> the <b>start-up</b> demonstration test. An illustrative example is also included. start-up demonstration test, Bayesian estimation, MCMC, data augmentation,...|$|R
40|$|Master of Agri{{business}}Department of Agricultural EconomicsMichael W. WoolvertonA {{business plan}} serves two main functions: One {{is to provide}} a set of guidelines and expectations for running the business and the other would be to request funding from either a traditional or non-traditional lending source. Most business plans consist of the executive summary, business description, market analyses, management team, operations, and financial projections. Stephenson Enterprises {{is in the process of}} obtaining funding for a start-up business that will manufacture a biodegradable low cost substitute loose-fill packaging material. Due to the relatively high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> this <b>start-up,</b> external funding is necessary. The first choice is to approach a large bank with the business plan, secondary choices if necessary would include smaller banks. The third choice would be alternative funding such as nonprofit organizations that provide start-up funding, however many of these are limited in the amount they lend. In order to garner funding for this entrepreneurship, it was decided that a business plan was needed. A business plan has two primary functions. One function is to set forth some guidelines as to how a firm is operated as well as what is projected. The second, and perhaps most often the reason a business plan is developed is to secure funding from a financial institution. Within the business plan a myriad of financial data was gathered to include: financial analysis, financial projections, cash flow, balance sheet, break-even analysis, sales proforma, income statements and sensitivity analyses. In addition to the financial data, a market analysis was conducted to provide insight into the local market. This business plan will not only provide an estimate of financials but will also serve as a guide book for operating the business...|$|R
40|$|Start-ups is the {{new wave}} of firms which are now {{mushrooming}} around Malaysia. However, as this wave is still at its infancy the success rate <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> in Malaysia is extremely low. It has been long established that organisational culture does indeed effect the performance of a firm, however there haven’t been any reports on the effect of organisational culture on the success <b>of</b> <b>start-ups.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this report is to investigate how different types of organisational cultures contribute to the success <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> in Malaysia. In order to do that,this research has decided to use a quantitative approach through the usage of a questionnaire to acquire the all relevant data. 80 requests were send out but there were only 43 respondents. This report has successfully revealed the different existing organisational culture types in current firms and also identified the main organisational culture types existing within each participating start-ups. After which the report successfully examine the effects of the organisational cultures to the corresponding start-ups. The conclusion obtained from this report is that firstly, organisational culture does effect the success <b>of</b> the <b>start-ups</b> in Malaysia. Second, contrary to what was concluded in the literature, both bureaucratic and competitive culture was proven to {{have a positive effect on}} the success <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> in Malaysia. Third, as the literature suggested, the participative and learning culture was also proven to have a positive effect on the success <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> in Malaysia. Forth, the ranking for organisational culture based on the degree of positive effect on the success <b>of</b> <b>start-ups</b> starting from most effective: learning culture, participative culture, competitive culture, and lastly bureaucratic culture...|$|R
