A retrospective facility based costing study conducted in 40 non-government organization and public health facilities in Kenya and Swaziland. Economic and financial costs were collected retrospectively for the year 2010 / 11, from each study site with an aim to estimate the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> of six integrated HIV and SRH services. A full cost analysis using a combination of bottom-up and step-down costing methods was conducted from the health provider's perspective. The main unit of analysis is the economic unit <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> for each service. Costs are converted to 2013 International dollars. The mean <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> for the HIV/SRH services ranged from $Int 14. 23 (PNC visit) to $Int 74. 21 (HIV treatment visit). We found considerable variation in the unit <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> across settings with family planning services exhibiting the least variation ($Int 6. 71 - 52. 24) and STI treatment and HIV treatment visits exhibiting the highest variation in unit cost ranging from ($Int 5. 44 - 281. 85) and ($Int 0. 83 - 314. 95), respectively. Unit costs of visits were driven by fixed costs while variability in visit costs across facilities was explained mainly by technology used and service maturity. For all services, variability in unit costs and cost components suggest that potential exists to reduce costs through better use of both human and capital resources, despite the high proportion of expenditure on drugs and medical supplies.

Results showed that hospital ownership (public or private) {{and size of the}} dental clinics were associated with the cost of providing dental services and the volume of services provided. Among 23 hospitals studied, private hospitals had a much lower <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit,</b> had more paid attending dentist staff, paid their resident dentists less, and had significantly more billings paid by Medicaid and by patients than public hospitals.

40|$|Abstract Objective A {{great deal}} of {{international}} attention has been focussed recently on how much additional funding is required to scale up health interventions to meet global targets such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Most of the cost estimates {{that have been made}} in response have assumed that unit costs of delivering services will not change as coverage increases or as more and more interventions are delivered together. This is most unlikely. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} measure the impact of patient load on the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> at primary health care facilities and the extent to which this would influence estimates of the costs and financial requirements to scale up interventions. Methods Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore the determinants of variability in unit costs using data for 44 countries with a total of 984 observations. Findings Controlling for other possible determinants, we find that the cost of an outpatient visit is very sensitive to the number of patients seen by providers each day at primary care facilities.

The other beneficiaries without liver cancer who used medical services in 2009 served as the control patients. Results: Among the 2335 identified liver cancer patients, 2178 (93. 3 %) patients used outpatient services and 1193 (51. 1 %) patients used inpatient services. Liver cancer accounted for 1. 8 % of the NHI’s total <b>cost.</b> The <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> was United States dollars (US$) 59. 30 for outpatient care and US$ 2070. 30 for inpatient care.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Sexually {{transmitted}} infection (STI) {{services were}} {{offered by the}} nongovernmental organization Médecins Sans Frontières-Holland in Banteay Meanchey province, Cambodia, between 1997 and 1999. These services targeted female sex workers but were available to the general population. We conducted {{an evaluation of the}} operational performance and costs of this real-life project. METHODS: Effectiveness outcomes (syndromic cure rates of STIs) were obtained by retrospectively analysing patients' records. Annual financial and economic costs were estimated from the provider's perspective. Unit costs for the cost-effectiveness analysis included the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit,</b> <b>per</b> partner treated, and per syndrome treated and cured. FINDINGS: Over 30 months, 11, 330 patients attended the clinics; of these, 7776 (69 %) were STI index patients and only 1012 (13 %) were female sex workers. A total of 15 269 disease episodes and 30 488 visits were recorded. Syndromic cure rates ranged from 39 % among female sex workers with genital ulcers to 74 % among men with genital discharge; there were variations over time. Combined rates of syndromes classified as cured or improved were around 84 - 95 % for all syndromes. The total economic costs of the project were US 766, 046 dollars. The average <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> over 30 months was US 25. 12 dollars and the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> partner treated for an STI was US 50. 79 dollars. The average <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> STI syndrome treated was US 48. 43 dollars, of which US 4. 92 dollars was for drug treatment. The <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> syndrome cured or improved ranged from US 46. 95 - 153. 00 dollars for men with genital ulcers to US 57. 85 - 251. 98 dollars for female sex workers with genital discharge.

One solution may be to reduce the remuneration of CBD agents, but this approach may lower their productivity. Programs also need to consider reducing other costs, including those for supervision and training. Methods: The <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> agent visit—including <b>costs</b> associated with payments to agents and to s u p e rvisors {{and the costs of}} tra i n i n g — was calculated for three CBD programs in Tanzania. The output measure was visits in which contra c e p t i ves were provided or refe r rals made for fa m i l y planning services. Simulations were used to examine the impact of changes in agent remuneration on <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit,</b> assuming different levels of spending on training and supervision. Results: The program that paid agents the highest annual compensation (US$ 398) also had the highest <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> agent ($ 701), but it had the highest number of <b>visits</b> <b>per</b> agent (425). The p r o gram that had the lowest annual payments per agent ($ 33) also had high <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> agent ($ 558), because its other costs were high and its agents produced few visits (105). The simulations showed that an increase in the amount spent on agent remuneration reduces <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit,</b> because the number of agent visits increases, thereby spreading out supervision and tra i n-ing costs over a larger number of visits. C o n clusions: The challenge for CBD programs seeking to reduce their costs is to determ i n e which cost components to decrease so as to minimize any reduction in visits. For ex a m p l e, programs that spend little on compensation might improve their perfo rmance by spending more on compensation but less on training or supervision...|$|R

The incidence of fluid overload is underreported and its economic impact is unknown. An evaluation of fluid overload cases in US hospitals was performed {{to assess the impact}} of fluid overload on length and cost of hospital stay. Study design and methods: Retrospective analysis was performed using a clinical and economic database covering > 600 US hospitals. Data were collected for all inpatients discharged during 2010 who received ≥ 1 unit FFP during hospitalization. Incidence of fluid overload was determined through International Classification of Diagnosis (ICD- 9) codes. Multivariate regression analysis was performed for primary outcome measures: hospital length of stay (LOS) and total hospital costs. Results: Data were analyzed for 129, 839 FFP-transfused patients, of whom 4, 138 (3. 2 %) experienced fluid overload (including TACO). Multivariate analysis, adjusting for baseline characteristics, found that increased LOS and hospital costs were independently associated with fluid overload. Patients diagnosed with fluid overload had longer mean LOS (12. 9 days versus 10. 0 days; P < 0. 001) and higher mean hospital <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> ($ 46, 644 versus $ 32, 582; P < 0. 001) compared with patients without fluid overload.

Estimates were made of total project <b>costs,</b> average <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> mother counselled and average <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> peer counselling <b>visit.</b> Alternative intervention packages were explored in the sensitivity analysis. We also estimated the resources required to fund the scale up to district level, of a breastfeeding intervention programme within a public health sector model. Results Annual project costs were estimated to be US$ 56, 308. The largest cost component was peer supporter supervision, which accounted for over 50 % of total project <b>costs.</b> The <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> mother counselled was US$ 139 and the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> was US$ 26. The <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> week of EBF was estimated to be US$ 15 at 12 weeks post partum. We estimated that implementing an alternative package modelled on routine public health sector programmes can potentially reduce costs by over 60 %. Based on the calculated average costs and annual births, scaling up modelled costs to district level would cost the public sector an additional US$ 1, 813, 000. Conclusion Exclusive breastfeeding promotion in sub-Saharan Africa is feasible and can be implemented at a sustainable cost. The results of this study can be incorporated in cost effectiveness analyses of exclusive breastfeeding promotion programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. </p...|$|R
30|$|Results {{from our}} study show {{definite}} cost control effects of GBPS compared with traditional FFS, for total medical expense, MI fund expense and OOP expense. Except for those hypertensive patients above {{the age of}} 65  years old, the cost control effects of GBPS compared with OOP remain significant even after being stratified by age and gender. Qiu et al. also reported the cost control effects of GBPS for inpatient hospital expenditure from the analysis of 40 cerebral infarction patients in Tianjin (Qiu 2009). Total hospitalization <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> decreased by 8.7 % from CNY 10307.5 before the implementation of GBPS to CYN 9411.0 after implementation. Along with total medical expense, drug use proportion and average length of hospital stay also decrease with GBPS. In this sense, by prospective payment, GBPS {{can be an effective}} method to curtail the fast rising medical expenditure and limit the incentive of health care providers to offer unnecessary service.|$|R
40|$|In Ireland, {{there are}} four {{anticoagulants}} available for prescribing to patients with atrial fibrillation for stroke prevention. A key feature of the three most recent anticoagulants is that monitoring is redundant. Despite this, there is continued prescribing of the incumbent anticoagulant, warfarin, which requires monitoring. Lack of information regarding the cost of monitoring, and the extra burden it places on health budgets and patients, motivated this costing study. Using micro costing, the costs of warfarin treatment (including monitoring) was disaggregated and isolated from both the patientsâ and health care providerâ s perspectives in a Cork hospital. Costs {{to the health care}} provider per patient <b>per</b> clinic <b>visited</b> were 21. 57. Patient <b>costs</b> incurred <b>per</b> patient per clinic were 48. 50. Thus, the total <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> patient <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> were 70. 07. This result reveals that while the pharmaceutical cost of warfarin is low; it is not an inexpensive therapy when monitoring costs are considered...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} cost {{structure}} of home health agencies by estimating an empirical cost function {{for those that}} are Medicare-certified, ten years following the implementation of prospective payment. 2010 national Medicare cost report data for certified home health agencies were merged with case-mix information from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). We estimated a fully interacted (by tax status) hybrid cost function for 7, 064 agencies and calculated marginal costs as percent of total costs for all variables. The home health industry is dominated by for-profit agencies, {{which tend to be}} newer than the non-profit agencies and to have higher average <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> patient but lower <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit.</b> For-profit agencies tend to have smaller scale operations and different cost structures, and {{are less likely to be}} affiliated with chains. Our estimates suggest diseconomies of scale, zero marginal cost for contracting with therapy workers, and a positive marginal cost for contracting with nurses, when controlling for quality. Our findings suggest that efficiencies may be achieved by promoting non-profit, smaller agencies, with fewer contract nursing staff. This conclusion should be tested further in future studies that address some of the limitations of our study...|$|R
40|$|Background. RGHC runs a Hospice at Home service {{providing}} 24 / 7 care. An independent study calculated {{the cost of}} a RGHC visit and the total community cost of home care, including all health care professional (HCP), carer, and family member visits. Methods. Over a period of 145 days, 550 calls and 335 visits made to/by the night team were recorded, averaging 3. 79 per night. The salary <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> hour for each nurse, plus organizational add on costs, was calculated. To derive a total community cost, 35 families, considered by the nursing team to be able to consent, kept a diary for up to two-weeks, recording all HCP, carer and family support visits and duration of each visit. 17 diaries were returned. Descriptive analysis was used with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS v 22). Costs were taken for HCPs and social care services from the PSSRU data 2015 / 16. Results. The average length of the diaries was 10. 4 days. For 3. 79 <b>visits</b> <b>per</b> night the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> was £ 195 (taking into consideration that RGHC nurses travel in pairs). The 17 patient diaries covered a total of 177 days and showed a range of visits and complexity of care. RGHC staff provided 19...|$|R

Consequently, the new library will by no means be cheaper than the old, paper-only library, but will involve {{significantly}} higher costs. At the same time the performance for users will be multiplied: The system of scientific information procurement will be significantly more efficient in terms of <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> user <b>visit,</b> while the overall system will be more expensive. In business language, we will see falling <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> information unit and rising system costs due to the explosion of usage numbers.|$|R

This study describes {{the costs and}} outcomes of FO in patients receiving multiple continuous infusions. Materials and methods: A retrospective study was conducted using a hospital administrative database covering > 500 US hospitals. An FO cohort included adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with a central line receiving IV loop diuretics and 2 + continuous IV infusions on 50 %+ of their ICU days; a directly matched non-FO cohort included patients without IV diuretic use. The primary outcome {{of the study was}} total hospitalization <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit.</b> Additional outcomes were ICU costs, mortality, total and ICU length of stay (LOS), 30 -day readmission rates, and ventilator use. Unadjusted descriptive analysis was performed using chi-squared or paired t-tests to compare outcomes between the two cohorts. Results: A total of 63, 974 patients were identified in each cohort. The total hospitalization <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> for the FO cohort was US$ 15, 344 higher than the non-FO cohort (US$ 42, 386 vs US$ 27, 042), and the ICU cost for the FO cohort was US$ 5, 243 higher than the non-FO cohort (US$ 10, 902 vs US$ 5, 659). FO patients had higher mortality (20 % vs 16. 8 %), prolonged LOS (11. 5 vs 8. 0 days), longer ICU LOS (6. 2 vs 3. 6 days), higher risk of 30 -day readmission (21. 8 % vs 21. 3 %), and ventilator usage (47. 7 % vs 28. 3 %) than the non-FO cohort (all P< 0. 05). Conclusion: In patients receiving multiple continuous infusions, FO is associated with increased health care resources and costs. Maximally concentrating medications and proactively providing continuous medications in small-volume infusions (SVI) could be a potential solution to prevent iatrogenic FO in critically ill patients. Further prospective research is warranted {{to assess the impact of}} the SVI dispensing model on patient outcomes and health care costs.

40|$|Introduction: In {{developing}} countries diabetes mellitus affects economically productive age group; more often affecting the productive {{member of the}} family. The objective {{of the study was}} to estimate the direct and indirect cost of illness of patients with DM attending the selected outpatient clinics in Kathmandu Valley. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in four outpatient clinics in Kathmandu Valley among 227 diabetic patients selected purposively. It was conducted from July to September, 2010. An adapted and pretested semi structured questionnaire was administered to diabetic patients aged 20 to 60 years with a minimum of a year of illness. Results: The mean total <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> by a diabetic patient to an outpatient clinic wasUS$ 13. 3 (95 % CI: 11. 70 - 14. 92). Likewise the total cost incurred in the treatment and care of DM per month was US$ 40. 41 (95 % CI: 36. 38 - 44. 45) and per annum was US$ 445 (95 % CI: 396. 11 - 495. 61). In addition, the study results also showed that with increase in total direct <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> annum the duration of illness also increases. Conclusions: There is a high cost burden on the patient with DM visiting the selected private sector outpatient clinics. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Keywords: cost burden; diabetes mellitus; direct cost; indirect cost; treatment cost...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. Health {{care costs}} are {{increasing}} {{at more than}} twice the rate of inflation, thus, public officials are seeking safe and economic methods to deliver quality prenatal care to poor pregnant women. This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between the cost and effectiveness of three prenatal clinic staffing models: physician based, mixed staffing, and clinical nurse specialist with physicians available for consultation. METHODS. Maternal and neonatal physiological outcome data were obtained from the hospital clinical records of 156 women attending these clinics. The women were then interviewed concerning their satisfaction with their prenatal care clinic. The financial officer from each clinic provided data on the clinic staffing costs and hours of service. RESULTS. There were no differences in outcomes for the maternal-neonatal physiological variables, although newborn admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) approached significance among the clinics. The clinic staffed by clinical nurse specialists had the greatest client satisfaction and the lowest <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit.</b> CONCLUSIONS. The use of clinical nurse specialists might substantially reduce the cost of providing prenatal care while maintaining quality, and might thereby save valuable resources...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{proliferation}} of Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI) schemes designed to enhance access to modern health care services and provide financial protection to workers in the informal and rural sectors. In June 2011, the Government of Ethiopia introduced a pilot CBHI scheme in rural parts of the country. This paper assesses the impact of the scheme on utilization of modern health care and the cost of accessing health care. It adds to the relatively small body of work that provides a rigorous evaluation of CBHI schemes. We find that enrolment leads to a 30 to 41 percent increase in utilization of outpatient care at public facilities, a 45 to 64 percent increase in the frequency of visits to public facilities and at least a 56 percent decline in the <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>visit</b> to public facilities. The effects of the scheme on out-of-pocket spending are not as clear. The impact on utilization and costs combined with a high uptake rate of almost 50 percent within two years of scheme establishment, suggests that this scheme has the potential to meet the goal of universal access to health care...|$|R
