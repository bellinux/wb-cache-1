5|$|As {{early as}} the 7th century Muhammad was {{attacked}} by non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism. In modern times, <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> also dealt with Muhammad's sincerity in claiming to be a prophet, his morality, warfare, and his marriages.|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the original upon its release, although it was generally critically well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> been deeply divided. Modern critics and scholars have noted the strong lesbian overtones of the film, which Universal acknowledged {{from the start of}} filming and exploited in some early advertising.|$|E
5|$|Several reviewers {{have been}} {{critical}} of the event. The most frequent <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> been related to the match between The Undertaker and Giant Gonzalez, Hulk Hogan's title win, and the Roman togas worn by announcers.

The disagreements about this have been vociferous and are unresolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between sections 3 and 4 and parliamentary sovereignty has been commented on most extensively. The most common <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> been of the implied limitations on legislative supremacy. Opponents of this <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> questioned both its factual accuracy and its {{suggestion that the}} weakening of parliamentary sovereignty should be avoided. They instead cite morality and constitutionalism as among positive features of this change. The limits of courts' powers have also been queried. The retroactivity of law making is one criticism related {{to the rule of}} law, although the advancement of human rights is seen as a positive feature also associated with the rule of law. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague and there have been warnings of to the imposition of the judiciary on parliament's domain, these have also been challenged.|$|E
5|$|Korematsu v. United States {{was decided}} {{the next year}} and overshadowed both the Yasui and Hirabayashi cases. None of these cases have ever been {{overturned}} by the Supreme Court.

Murphy also makes collective criticisms {{of his fellow}} professionals for not attending events and has branded other players' concerns over prize money as a joke. Murphy's harshest <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> been reserved for Ronnie O'Sullivan. Murphy highlights what he perceives to be O'Sullivan's lack of professionalism.|$|E
5|$|The Ordinances {{were never}} again reissued, and {{therefore}} hold no permanent {{position in the}} legal history of England {{in the way that}} Magna Carta, for instance, does. The <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the ascendancy of the commons. Yet the document, and the movement behind it, reflected new political developments in its emphasis on how assent was to be obtained by the barons in parliament. It {{was only a matter of}} time before it was generally acknowledged that the Commons were an integral part of that institution.|$|E
5|$|A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an {{unconventional}} lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Free and Independent Faction. His literary debut came late in life, closely following {{the start of}} his close friendship with Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu and their common affiliation with the influential conservative literary society Junimea. Although viewed with reserve by many of his colleagues there, and primarily appreciated for his records of oral tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> often described him, alongside Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici, {{as one of the most}} accomplished representatives of Junimist literature.|$|E

5|$|Alpha Flights Northstar, {{a member}} of the {{original}} Alpha Flight superhero team, was the first major gay character created by Marvel Comics. Creator John Byrne said that Northstar was planned to be gay from his inception in 1979. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106, the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. Storylines involving Northstar in Alpha Flight and his limited series have generally ignored his sexuality: <b>Criticism</b> <b>has</b> been levelled at the fact that in 30 years Northstar has never been shown kissing another man, though he finally kissed his boyfriend Kyle in the first issue of the 2011 relaunch of the series. Northstar eventually became {{a member of}} the X-Men. During his time in this team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another gay teen, Graymalkin.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light Rail to Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the light rail to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. <b>Criticism</b> <b>has</b> also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|The Millennium Park {{project has}} been the subject of some {{criticism}} since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.|$|E

5|$|The gender-based <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> also {{affected}} younger male {{fans of the}} show, such as with Michael Morones above. Another story that gained national attention was that of Grayson Bruce, a nine-year-old fan who was told to stop bringing a Rainbow Dash backpack to school to prevent bullying that he was receiving. An online campaign to show support for Grayson gained over 32,000 supporters on its Facebook page, and the brony fanbase, the show's creators and voice actors, and various news commentators like Glenn Beck, Ronan Farrow and Eugene Volokh have stood up for the boy's actions. The school later revised its decision after speaking to the family and clarifying it {{was not trying to}} blame the student for the incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} of Angkor Wat {{in the modern}} era began with the establishment of the Conservation d'Angkor (Angkor Conservancy) by the École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO) in 1908; before that date, activities at the site were primarily concerned with exploration. The Conservation d'Angkor was responsible for the research, conservation, and restoration activities carried out at Angkor until the early 1970s, and a major {{restoration of}} Angkor was undertaken in the 1960s. However, work on Angkor was abandoned during the Khmer Rouge era and the Conservation d'Angkor was disbanded in 1975. Between 1986 and 1992, the Archaeological Survey of India carried out restoration work on the temple, as France did not recognise the Cambodian government at the time. <b>Criticism</b> <b>has</b> been raised about both the early French restoration attempts and particularly the later Indian work, with concerns over damage done to the stone surface by the use of chemicals and cement.|$|E
5|$|Watts' {{performances}} in the championships saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 AFL draft at seventeen years of age, a year younger than most of his fellow draftees. The hype surrounding Watts {{in his first season}} was profound until he made his debut in the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood in the 2009 season. The management of his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club because he was played despite being unready for senior football. Instead, Watts was used as a promotional tool {{to create a sense of}} hope for long-suffering fans. <b>Criticism</b> <b>has</b> followed Watts closely throughout his career due to the expectations that were placed on him being the number one draft pick and many believing he was not living up to his potential.|$|E

5|$|Works by {{winners and}} nominees of the Campbell Award were {{collected}} in the New Voices series of anthologies, edited by George R. R. Martin, which had five volumes covering the awards from 1973 through 1977 and which were published between 1977 and 1984. Campbell nominees and winners, such as Michael A. Burstein, who was nominated in 1996 and won in 1997, have commented that the largest effect of winning or being nominated for a Campbell is not on sales but instead that it gives credibility with established authors and publishers. <b>Criticism</b> <b>has</b> been raised about the Campbell that due to the eligibility requirements it honors writers who become well-known quickly, rather than necessarily the best or most influential authors from a historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|After A Song to David, {{he tried}} to publish a {{collection}} of his Psalms translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations. Newbery then hired Smart's new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced Smart {{to find a new}} publisher, delaying the printing of his Psalms. Finally, on 12 August 1765, he printed A Translation of the Psalms of David, which included Hymns and Spiritual Songs and a second edition of A Song to David. This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery's edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart's. However, modern <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> received Smart's version in a more favourable light. While working on this project, he was also working on a translation of the Phaedrus and a verse translation of Horace. His verse Horace was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an opt-out clause that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another <b>criticism</b> <b>has</b> been that the program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E
