5|$|In the 1980s, Franklin {{participated in}} an {{organized}} campaign to win the right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the freedom of conscience provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed this form of <b>conscientious</b> <b>objection.</b> Her paper was {{to be part of}} an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating the Income Tax Act. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{was born}} in New Orleans, Louisiana; his parents were leaders in the African American community. Ford {{attended}} Wayne State University and Grambling State University, from which he was expelled in 1969 before graduating for leading civil rights demonstrations.

Ford {{was a member of}} the Southern Christian Leadership Conference staff from 1966 to 1972 and worked for Martin Luther King, Jr. as a member of an advance team of the Poor People's Campaign.

25|$|There is {{currently}} {{no provision for}} <b>conscientious</b> <b>objection.</b> Article 72 of the Turkish Constitution states: “National service is the right and duty of every Turk. The manner in which this service shall be performed, or considered as performed, either in the Armed Forces or in public service, shall be regulated by law.” This in principle would allow for a non-military alternative. Turkey, Belarus and Azerbaijan are the only European countries that have not introduced any legislation on <b>conscientious</b> <b>objection.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The church {{rate was}} a {{personal}} charge imposed on the occupier of land or of {{a house in the}} parish, and, though it was compulsory, much difficulty was found in effectually applying the compulsion.

According to the amendment planned on the issue, those refusing to perform compulsory military service {{will no longer be}} forcibly drafted to the military while they are under detention and will be able to be defended by a lawyer while being tried. They will also be able to benefit from the Probation Law.|$|E

A number of Witnesses from Northern Transylvania were interned in a prison camp in the Serbian town of Bor, alongside Jews and Adventists.|$|E
25|$|Several {{theories}} {{have emerged as}} to the motives for the hijacking.

But later it was reported that the hijacker sought political asylum in Italy due to his <b>conscientious</b> <b>objection</b> to serving in the military.|$|E
25|$|Most directly, {{criticism}} of communism was not tolerated.
