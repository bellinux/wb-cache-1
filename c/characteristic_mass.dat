40|$|The {{formation}} of galaxies is {{studied in the}} context of the fragmentation of massive diffuse ionized gas clouds.

40|$|Observations of {{the stellar}} initial mass {{function}} are reviewed. The flattening at low mass is {{evidence for a}} <b>characteristic</b> <b>mass</b> in star formation, which could be the minimum stellar mass for the onset of deuterium burning or the thermal Jeans mass. Variations in {{the mass of the}} flattened part are important for understanding star formation; e. g., starburst galaxies may be an example where the <b>characteristic</b> <b>mass</b> is larger than it is locally. A steeper high-mass slope in the extreme field studied by Massey et al. {{may be the result of}} cloud destruction and the termination of star formation by ionization, with a normal IMF in each separate cluster. The lack of a density dependence in cluster IMFs suggests that star and protostar interactions play little role in star formation or the IMF. These considerations, along with indirect observations of the IMF in the early Universe, suggest that the IMF does not vary much in its basic form over position and time, but that shifts in the <b>characteristic</b> <b>mass</b> might occur in regions with extremely high or low star formation activity.

40|$|Abstract. The cosmic {{ultraviolet}} background (UVB) heats the intergalactic medium (IGM), as {{a result}} the gas in dark matter halos below a certain mass is too hot to cool within a Hubble time. The UVB effectively suppresses the formation of dwarf galaxies. Using high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations we show that photo heating leads to small baryon fractions in halos below ∼ 6 × 10 9 h − 1 M⊙, independent of the cosmic environment. The simulations are carried out assuming a homogeneous UVB with flux densities as given by Haardt &Madau (1996). A halo may stop to condense gas significantly after the universe is reionised, namely when its mass falls below the <b>characteristic</b> <b>mass</b> scale set by the photo heating. Assuming a spherical halo model we derive this <b>characteristic</b> <b>mass</b> analytically and identify the main mechanisms that prevent the gas from cooling in small halos. The theoretically derived <b>characteristic</b> <b>mass</b> is smaller than the one obtained from observations. Increasing the energy per ionising photon by a factor between four and eight would be sufficient to reconcile both. This is equivalent to an average temperature of the IGM of ∼ 10 4 K. In this sense the faint end of the luminosity function may serve as a calorimeter for the IGM...|$|E
40|$|Galaxy {{surveys have}} shown that {{luminous}} galaxies are mainly distributed in large filaments and galaxy clusters. The remaining large volumes are virtually devoid of luminous galaxies. This is in concordance {{with the formation of}} the large-scale structure in the universe as derived from cosmological simulations. However, the numerical results indicate that cosmological voids are abundantly populated with dark matter haloes which may in principle host dwarf galaxies. Observational efforts have in contrast revealed that voids are apparently devoid of dwarf galaxies. We investigate the formation of dwarf galaxies in voids by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Due to the cosmic ultraviolet background radiation low-mass haloes show generally a reduced baryon fraction. We determine the <b>characteristic</b> <b>mass</b> below which dwarf galaxies are baryon deficient. We show that the circular velocity below which the accretion of baryons is suppressed is approximately 40 [*]kms− 1. The suppressed baryon accretion is caused by the photo-heating due to the UV background. We set up a spherical halo model and show that the effective equation {{of the state of the}} gas in the periphery of dwarf galaxies determines the <b>characteristic</b> <b>mass.</b> This implies that any process which heats the gas around dwarf galaxies increases the <b>characteristic</b> <b>mass</b> and thus reduces the number of observable dwarf galaxies...|$|E

40|$|We use percent-level {{precision}} photometric redshifts in the UltraVISTA-DR 1 near-infrared {{survey to}} investigate the changing relationship be- tween galaxy stellar mass and the dark matter haloes hosting them to z∼ 2. We achieve this by measuring the clustering properties and abundances {{of a series of}} volume-limited galaxy samples selected by stellar mass and star-formation activity. We interpret these results in the framework of a phenomenological halo model and numerical simulations. Our measurements span a uniquely large range in stellar mass and redshift and reach below the <b>characteristic</b> stellar <b>mass</b> to z∼ 2. Our results are: 1. At fixed redshift and scale, clustering amplitude depends monotonically on sample stellar mass threshold; 2. At fixed angular scale, the projected clustering amplitude decreases with redshift but the co-moving correlation length remains constant; 3. <b>Characteristic</b> halo <b>masses</b> and galaxy bias increase with increasing median stellar mass of the sample; 4. The slope of these relationships is modified in lower mass haloes; 5. Concerning the passive galaxy population, <b>characteristic</b> halo <b>masses</b> are consistent with a simply less-abundant version of the full galaxy sample, but at lower redshifts the fraction of satellite galaxies in the passive population {{is very different from the}} full galaxy sample; 6. Finally we find that the ratio between the <b>characteristic</b> halo <b>mass</b> and median stellar mass at each redshift bin reaches a peak at (M_h/M_) ∼ 12. 2 and the position of this peak remains constant out to z∼ 2.
