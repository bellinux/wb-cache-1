40|$|Managing {{uncertainty}} {{when the}} demand is irregular and sporadic (i. e. "lumpy") is a complex issue {{as well as an}} unexplored one. This study analyses the behaviour of forecasting techniques when dealing with lumpy demand at the master production scheduling level. In particular, three forecasting techniques (exponentially weighted moving average, early sales and order overplanning) are considered. It is argued that demand lumpiness is a multidimensional phenomenon, generated by different market characteristics, namely, numerousness of customers, heterogeneity of customers, frequency of order placing, variety of each customer's request and correlation between <b>customers</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Hence, the performances of the three forecasting methods are compared, through simulation experiments, with different values of the sources of lumpiness. A framework is then proposed that indicates the domain of applicability of each forecasting technique according to the prevailing source of lumpiness in the market...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of <b>Customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> prediction, it is necessary to have a systematic review of previous studies on this subject. To this effect, this paper therefore provides a systematic review of <b>Customer</b> <b>behaviours</b> prediction studies with a focus on components of customer relationship management, methods and datasets. In order to provide a comprehensive literature review and a classification scheme for articles on this subject 74 <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> prediction papers in over 25 journals and several conference proceedings were considered between the periods of 1999 - 2014. Two hundred and thirty articles were identified and reviewed for their direct relevance to predicting <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> out of which 74 were subsequently selected, reviewed and classified appropriately. The findings show that the literature on predicting <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> is ongoing and is of most importance to organisation. It was observed that most studies investigated customer retention prediction and organizational dataset were mostly used for the prediction as compared to other form of dataset. Also, comparing the statistical method to data mining in predicting <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour,</b> it was discovered through this review that data mining is mostly used for prediction. On the other hand, Artificial Neural Network is the most commonly used data mining method for predicting <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The review was able to identify the limitations of the current research on the subject matter and identify future research opportunities in <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> prediction...|$|R

40|$|Peak {{demand has}} been a growing problem for both {{security}} of supply and cost of generation and transmission. International research has attributed a significant influence of human behaviour on home energy for homes with similar households and appliances. Demand side management has had many successful programmes aimed at managing demand growth and load shape. The energy management strategy, “Demand Response”, aims to achieve peak energy demand reduction by eliciting behaviour change. Demand Response management encompasses energy needs analysis, information provision to <b>customers,</b> <b>behaviour</b> induction, smart meter technology, and new signalling and feedback concepts for residential customers. There is concern that pricing mechanisms alone may impact negatively on lower-socio economic households. This paper reviews the two main strategies {{that have been used}} to reduce residential demand for electricity at peak times, direct load control and variable pricing. The current research program studies residential energy activities during winter morning and evening peaks and possible behaviour modifications to manage peak demand. This paper reports the demand response to three different signals: price, environmental impact, and risk of black-outs. The results show that demand response could effectively be achieved by focusing on normal energy use activities at peak times and the behaviour of the members of households during peak hours. A programme to develop the necessary technology and provide credible information and understandable signals about risks and consequences could reliably provid...|$|E

Further, this project aims at contributing {{to the development of}} new knowledge regarding a multi-sensory brand-experience through the performance of an experiment. A quantitative research method with a deductive research approach has been used for this study, where theoretical concepts have been described and from which a number of hypotheses have derived as means to test the theoretical framework. In order to test our hypotheses, a research strategy in the form of experiments has been performed in the computer department at Media Markt, Kalmar. General assumptions have then been drawn from the analysis of the results in order to provide sound recommendations for marketers regarding sensory marketing in general and foremost the multi-sensory brand-experience.    The result of our study shows that it is beneficial for marketers to use styling elements and sensorial cues as means to connect with customers and enhance their emotional response. The study also shows that a combination of the sensorial cues of sight and sound together contributes to an experience that is positive and memorable for the customers.

In this context, a better understanding of its <b>customers</b> <b>behaviour</b> would be a key feature for the success of the company. To achieve this goal, EDF holds two information sources i. e., a comprehensive customers ' invoicing file with few individual data though, as well as survey results performed in regional centres, which contain more data per customer. We herein present a new method of data fusion based on the generation of virtual individuals. For each of them, a full set of variables will be accessible. This procedure is based on two steps. Firstly, a Multiple Correspondences Analysis (MCA) from an existing master sample is performed on fundamental variables. A sample of virtual individuals (SVI) is randomly selected, based on the distribution of each significant MCA factor. Then, for each virtual individual, a specific value is given for each fundamental variable which is the most correlated to one of the MCA factors. Secondly, the distinct sets of secondary samples are grafted to the previous SVI. A simultaneous estimation of variables distribution is made as based on PLS regression on variables shared by all samples. The use of this method brings about two advantages, namely the possibility to choose SVI size and the avoidance of variance underestimation generally encountered in using the imputation methods. This process has been so far applied to the treatment of two databases, i. e. two surveys, in order to generate the expected artificial sample. Validation and perspectives will be herein further discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the banking industry of students at Kristianstad University. We wanted to test the theory of Customer based brand equity in the banking industry but also to challenge this theory with other independent theories which we have identified as important concerning <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> the banking industry. The banking industry is an interesting business since it affects nearly everyone. Banks are known to focus much of their marketing on customer retention which makes this specific industry extra interesting for an investigation about <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Kevin Keller‟s theories on Customer based brand equity was the catalyst that created our interest in this subject. The combination of this theory and the specific nature of the banking industry helped us form our problem. The chosen segment to investigate was students at Kristianstad University.

40|$|Peak {{demand is}} an issue in power supply system when demand exceeds the {{available}} capacity. Continuous growth in peak demand {{increases the risk of}} power failures, and increases the marginal cost of supply. The contribution of the residential sector to the system peak is quite substantial and has been a subject of discussion internationally. For example, a study done in New Zealand in 2007 attributed about half of system peak load to the residential sector. International research has attributed a significant influence of human behaviour on households energy use. “Demand Response” is a demand side management tool aimed at achieving peak energy demand reduction by eliciting behaviour change. It encompasses energy needs analysis, information provision to <b>customers,</b> <b>behaviour</b> induction, smart metering, and new signalling and feedback concepts. Demand response is far advanced in the industrial and commercial demand sectors. In the residential sector, information barriers and a lack of proper understanding of consumers’ behaviour have impeded the development of effective response strategies and new enabling technologies in the sector. To date, efforts to understanding residential sector behaviour for the purpose of peak demand analysis has been based on pricing mechanism. However, not much is known about the significance of other factors in influencing household customers’ peak electricity demand behaviour. There is a tremendous amount of data that can be analyzed and fed back to the user to influence behaviour. These may include information about energy shortages, supply security and environmental concerns during the peak hours. This research is intended {{to begin the process of}} understanding the importance of some of these factors in the arena of peak energy consumption behaviour. Using stated preference survey and focus group discussions, information about household customers’ energy use activities during winter morning and evening peak hours was collected. Data about how customers would modify their usage behaviour when they receive enhanced supply constraint information was also collected. The thesis further explores households’ customer demand response motivation with respect to three factors: cost (price), environment (CO 2 -intensity) and security (risk of black-outs). Householders were first informed about the relationship between these factors and peak demand. Their responses were analyzed as multi-mode motivation to energy use behaviour change. Overall, the findings suggest that, household customers would be willing to reduce their peak electricity demand when they are given clear and enhanced information. In terms of motivation to reduce demand the results show customers response to the security factor to be on par with the price factor. The Environmental factor also produced a strong response; nearly two-thirds of that of price or security. A generic modelling methodology was developed to estimate the impact of households’ activity demand response on the load curve of the utility using a combination of published literature reviews and resources, and own research work. This modelling methodology was applied in a case study in Halswell, a small neighbourhood in Christchurch, New Zealand, with approximately 400 households. The results show that a program to develop the necessary technology and provide credible information and understandable signals about risks and consequences of peak demand could provide up to about 13 % voluntary demand reduction during the morning peak hours and 8 % during the evening peak hours...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{research}} has highlighted that dysfunctional <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> is commonplace in service exchange interactions. However, most {{research has}} focused on what forms of dysfunctional behaviours that are prevalent in a face-to-face context. Instead of focusing on traditional face-to-face interactions, this thesis will address and consider dysfunctional <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> in a live chat support context. Moreover, the reason why certain behaviours are perceived as dysfunctional in an online context will also be discussed from a role discrepancy perspective. Methodology: The methodological approach relies on a qualitative case study of the online casino company LeoVegas. The research is carried out by conducting ten semi-structured interviews with the firm's live chat customer-contact employees. The interviews were conducted via the video chat application Skype. Findings: The findings highlight five <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> categories that the respondents perceived as dysfunctional. The employees thought these behaviours violated the rules and norms of the service script. However, the data implied role discrepancies between the employees and customers, where the customers and the employees had different views of the service script. The reason for these discrepancies were due to customer ignorance of reading the terms and conditions, which the employees and LeoVegas recognized as the service script. This resulted in customer violations of the service scripts which the employees perceived as dysfunctional <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Originality/Contribution:The thesis contributes with five employee perceived categories of dysfunctional <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> in a relative unstudied online support context.  A theoretical contribution of the study is the introduction of a new perception of dysfunctional <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour,</b> with the researchers arguing that dysfunctional <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> is not about customers violating the service script but rather that there is a role discrepancy between the customers and the employees. This leads to an important managerial implication, that managers need to ensure role congruence between employees and customers so that role discrepancy may be avoided...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com (Marketing Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Organisations {{are facing}} {{increasing}} pressures {{in terms of}} customer service since customers tend to become more demanding as competition within industries increases. In order to succeed in this changing marketplace, organisations should focus on forming and maintaining long-term relationships with their customers. Developing long-term relationships, in turn, depends on the organisation?s ability to exceed customers? expectations and to continuously ensure customer satisfaction. Service organisations in particular {{find it difficult to}} provide constant customer satisfaction due to the high level of human involvement in service delivery, which often leads to inevitable service failures. Service failures, as a result, cause the disconfirmation of service expectations. This disconfirmation gives rise to customer dissatisfaction, which is generally considered as the initiator of customer complaint behaviour. Culture is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential factors affecting <b>customers?</b> <b>behaviour</b> in response to dissatisfaction with a purchase experience. Customers? culture could have an impact on the manner in which customers engage in complaint behaviour, and could also have a bearing on how service failures and organisations? service recovery efforts are perceived. Organisations functioning in a multicultural country such as South Africa could therefore benefit from gaining a more profound understanding of cultural influences on customer behaviour and specifically complaint behaviour. The primary objective of this study was to determine the influence of culture on customers? complaint behaviour pertaining to service failures within the context of the South African banking industry. A structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from banking customers residing in Gauteng, who were sampled by means of a non-probability sampling method. In total, 600 respondents participated in this study, comprising 150 each from the black, coloured, Indian/Asian and white cultural groups. Results from the study indicate that although the majority of respondents have a propensity to complain, no practically significant differences were found between respondents from different cultures with regard to their propensity to complain. Results furthermore showed no differences between the different cultural groups in terms of their complaint behaviour following a hypothetical service failure. Although it was established that respondents expect the bank to do something about the service failure ? in particular correcting the problem and providing an explanation for the problem ? respondents? expectations regarding service recovery and perceptions of the bank?s service recovery efforts were found not to have been influenced by their respective cultures. The results, in addition, showed that a higher service recovery effort had a more positive effect on respondents? post-recovery satisfaction, likelihood of maintaining their relationship with the bank and loyalty, than that of a lower service recovery effort. It is recommended that banks should not view their customers differently in terms of their cultural backgrounds, but that they should rather focus continuously on providing all customers with the same level of quality service, even after a service failure has occurred. Banks should also encourage all customers to voice complaints directly to them in order to minimise the harmful effects of negative word-of-mouth and to improve recoveries from failures. Since respondents in this study indicated that they expect banks to offer an apology in the case of a service failure, to provide an explanation of the cause of the problem and to correct the problem, banks should ensure that a high level of quality interaction takes place between the dissatisfied customer and employees following a service failure. Such an approach requires banks to ensure that their employees are motivated and competent to solve customers? problems. It is therefore also recommended that banks should invest resources in employee selection, training, development, empowerment, discretionary decision-making power and support in order to ensure that customer-facing employees are able to provide a satisfactory service recovery, and are able to efficiently manage the complaint process. Recommendations for future research include extending this study to other service settings in order to determine whether there are similarities or differences in the influence of culture on customers? complaint behaviour pertaining to service failures. Future research can be conducted in collaboration with a specific bank in order to discover more specific information with regards to service failures and complaint situations within the bank, as well as customers? perceptions of the bank?s existing service recovery systems. Finally, since no differences between cultural groups were found, this study can be replicated in order to compare South African customers with those in other countries in order to determine differences in national cultures.

30|$|Other {{relevant}} literature {{dealing with}} the problem of extracting knowledge from <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be found in business intelligence. In this field, many data mining and OLAP techniques have been developed, enriching the analytic tools [4], [27], not only for marketing purposes but also to detect frauds [28], or for public health surveillance [29]. Data mining and <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> has gone also one step forward, by exploiting sentiment analysis as a prediction tool for a product success/failure [30].|$|R

It also explores the environment of the restaurant and the use of atmospherics by the restaurateurs through the reactions of the customers. The dimensions of colour, design, lighting, and restaurant layout, among others, were measured. Qualitative data taken from 300 youth customers were analyzed, and interpretations of the relationships were made. It was found that atmospheric elements contributed significantly in each representation of <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Evaluating the {{performance}} of any organization {{is an essential part}} for overcoming their weaknesses. Customer is always on prior for finding and assessing the company's performance. They are always respectable for every organization. In this paper we first examine the Customer Relationship Management (CRM), especially <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> and <b>customer</b> profiling. Then we describe the general overview of most common data mining techniques. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} how data mining techniques can extract respectable knowledge from the large customer's database and how to analyze <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> to improve business performance. Therefore, we proposed a model for CRM with the efficient implementation of data mining, for improving <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour.</b> For this, we evaluate and analyze the customer understanding by using rule induction process on clustered data from customer's database with reference to the customer query...|$|R

However, <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{is not fully}} rational and actions are often performed with a delay. This paper focusses on measuring the interest rate risk of variable rate {{savings accounts}} on a value basis (duration) and on the problem how to hedgethese accounts. In order to model the embedded options and the <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> we implement a partial adjustment specification.

The present paper shows that customers’ identification with a retailer is a central element to establish strong emotional ties i. e. affective commitment between customers and the retailer. These emotional ties to the retailer in turn (a) motivate loyalty intentions but also (b) motivate so-called <b>customer</b> extra-role <b>behaviours.</b> <b>Customer</b> extra-role <b>behaviours</b> include additional <b>customer</b> <b>behaviours</b> that enable companies to achieve a competitive advantage, because their customers are more resilient to negative information, participate in improvement processes, and help other customers...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{extended}} {{our knowledge of}} critical <b>customer</b> <b>behaviours</b> experienced by frontline staff members and the potential impacts of such behaviours on their engagement at work. While employee engagement is positively associated with service quality (Harter, Schmidt, & Heyes, 2002), Gallup (2015 a, 2015 b) has found that only 32 % of American workers, 13 % of employees worldwide, and 6 % of workers in China were engaged at work. This study attempted to recognize clues of frontline employee experience relevant to their engagement levels. The main {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate relationships between perceived <b>customer</b> <b>behaviours</b> (including <b>customer</b> participation, citizenship <b>behaviour,</b> complaint behaviour, and misbehaviour) and frontline employee engagement (FEE) in a sample of Chinese service workers. The secondary {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the roles that employee emotional assessment (EEA) of such service encounters play into these relationships. Also examined was whether workplace social support (WSS) mediated or moderated these relationships. Six hundred and three customer-facing frontline employees in nine restaurants, twelve hotels, and two provincial parks at Hainan Island of China completed the survey. Results suggested that EEA worked as a mediator and WSS played both mediator and moderator roles when <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> had an effect on FEE. The positive effects of customer participation and citizenship behaviour on FEE were largely accounted for by WSS and partially explained by EEA of such <b>behaviours.</b> EEA of <b>customer</b> complaint <b>behaviour,</b> to a large extent, helped explain the negative effect of such <b>behaviour</b> on FEE. <b>Customer</b> misbehaviour had no significant effect on FEE. Further, higher levels of WSS from supervisors was linked to higher levels of FEE. Rewards and recognition from supervisors as well as sharing meals with them enhanced the positive effect of <b>customer</b> participation <b>behaviour</b> on FEE and buffered the negative impact of <b>customer</b> non-verbal complaint <b>behaviour</b> on FEE. Additionally, restaurant employees reported the highest levels of FEE among survey respondents. Findings highlighted the need for <b>customer</b> <b>behaviour</b> intervention to encourage their participation and manage their complaint behaviours during service encounters. Implications for practice are also discussed in the manager/supervisor development such as sensitivity training and workplace culture improvement to create the right environment for engagement...|$|R
