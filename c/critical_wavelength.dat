Since there is ample experimental evidence that the mold surface topography affects gap nucleation at the mold-shell interface and the uniformity of the shell, we explore how the wavelength of the upper mold surface impacts the evolution of Ptr for specific material combinations and process parameters. For this purpose, the mold-shell materials {{are assumed to be}} combinations of four pure materials, viz., aluminum, copper, iron and lead: these materials offer a wide range of thermal and mechanical properties. <b>Critical</b> <b>wavelengths,</b> for which Ptr and its time derivative simultaneously equal zero, are predicted for all mold-shell material combinations. The theoretical model also predicts the existence of wavelength bands which are delimited by upper and lower <b>critical</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> All wavelengths that lie within the bands lead to gap nucleation, whereas all wavelengths that lie outside of the bands do not. The effects of distortivity ratio, which {{is a measure of the}} extent to which the mold-shell interface deforms under a given thermal loading, and selected process parameters (such as the mean mold thickness, contact resistance, and pressure) on bandwidth size, are considered in detail.

40|$|Alfvenic {{waves are}} {{ubiquitous}} {{in the solar}} atmosphere and their dissipation may {{play an important role}} in atmospheric heating. In the partially ionized solar chromosphere, collisions between ions and neutrals are an efficient dissipative mechanism for Alfven waves with frequencies near the ion-neutral collision frequency. The collision frequency is proportional to the ion-neutral collision cross section for momentum transfer. Here, we investigate Alfven wave damping as a function of height in a simplified chromospheric model and compare the results for two sets of collision cross sections, namely those of the classic hard-sphere model and those based on recent quantum-mechanical computations. We find important differences between the results for the two sets of cross sections. There is a <b>critical</b> interval of <b>wavelengths</b> for which impulsively excited Alfven waves are overdamped as a result of the strong ion-neutral dissipation. The <b>critical</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are in the range from 1 km to 50 km for the hard-sphere cross sections, and from 1 m to 1 km for the quantum-mechanical cross sections. Equivalently, for periodically driven Alfven waves there is an optimal frequency for which the damping is most effective. The optimal frequency varies from 1 Hz to 10 ^ 2 Hz for the hard-sphere cross sections, and from 10 ^ 2 Hz to 10 ^ 4 Hz for the quantum-mechanical cross sections. Future observations at sufficiently high spatial or temporal resolution may show the importance of high-frequency Alfven waves for chromospheric heating. For instance, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) may be able to detect the <b>critical</b> <b>wavelengths</b> and optimal frequencies and so to test the effective collision cross section in the chromospheric plasma.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of MHD waves and instabilities in a weakly ionised system, e. g., an interstellar molecular cloud. We determine all the <b>critical</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of perturbations across which the sustainable wave modes can change radically (and so can their decay rates), and various instabilities are present or absent. These <b>critical</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are essential for understanding the effects of MHD waves (or turbulence) on the structure and evolution of molecular clouds. Depending on the angle of propagation relative to the magnetic field and the physical parameters of a cloud, there are wavelength ranges in which no wave can be sustained as such. Yet, for other directions of propagation or different properties of a model cloud, there may exist some wave mode(s) at all wavelengths. For a typical cloud, magnetically-driven ambipolar diffusion leads to removal of any support against gravity that most short-wavelength waves (or turbulence) may have had, and gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion sets in and leads to cloud fragmentation into stellar-size masses, as first suggested by Mouschovias three decades ago [...] a single-stage fragmentation theory of star formation, distinct from the hierarchical fragmentation picture. Phase velocities, decay times, and eigenvectors (the densities and velocities of neutral particles and the plasma, and components of the magnetic field) are determined as functions of the wavelength of the disturbances and are explained physically. Comparison of the results with nonlinear analytical or numerical calculations is also presented, excellent agreement is found, and confidence in the analytical, linear approach is gained to explore phenomena difficult to study through numerical simulations.

The problem is also similar to flame propagation, except that here the front propagation speed is limited by catalyst diffusion rather than by activation kinetics.

Phenomenological Markstein numbers {{with respect to the}} combustion products are obtained by means of the comparison between the measurements of the flame radii as a function of time and the results of the analytical integration of the linear relation between the flame speed and either flame stretch rate or flame curvature. The burning velocity is obtained at zero stretch, and the effect of the flame stretch acting upon it is expressed by a Markstein length. Because both flame curvature and aerodynamic strain contribute to the flame stretch rate, there is a Markstein number associated with each of these components.|$|E
40|$|A {{bifurcation}} {{criterion for}} the transition from straight to oscillatory quasistatic crack propagation in an isotropic material {{is derived from the}} requirement of pure mode I stress fields at the crack tip (K-II= 0) on the entire crack path, henceforth called global bifurcation criterion. For a small-amplitude sine-shaped crack path which is observed in experiments at the transition, it is shown to be sufficient to postulate K-II= 0 only for two phases of the crack path instead, which simplifies calculations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous works [1] used {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} models to investigate the effects of barely visible impact damage (BVID) in sandwich structures. Through a comprehensive numerical study {{it was found that}} sandwich honeycomb panels with BVID fail due to wrinkling or core crushing at significantly lower loads than undamaged panels. The critical load is controlled by the depth and size of damage, both of which control the foundation support and the resistance to wrinkles forming. In this article a simplified, closed-form analytical model is developed to predict critical stresses through a complete range of damage sizes and depths. This model extends previous work [1] by finding an expression for the <b>critical</b> wrinkling <b>wavelength</b> in a closed-form solution.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a monoatomic layer, deposited on a substrate, is described by a dynamical model of the reaction-diffusion type. This model {{takes into account the}} possible coexistence of two types of gains with different orientations with respect to the substrate. It combines reaction (adsorption and desorption) and nonlinear diffusion terms, which, close to the critical point of the order-disorder transition of the adsorbed layer, are of the Cahn-Hilliard type. At high temperatures, uniform grain distributions are expected to develop. At low temperatures, uniform grain distributions may become spatially unstable for sufficiently high adatom mobility. Nanoscale spatial patterns may then develop, which correspond to grain distributions, where grains with different orientations coexist. Links with atomistic simulations and experiments are discussed. It is argued that, for Al or Cu layers, deposited on substrates like TiN, Si 2, Ta, etc. instability temperatures and <b>critical</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are well in the experimentally accessible range. © 2004 Elsevier B.

5000|$|Dental composites, {{also called}} [...] "white fillings", are {{a group of}} {{restorative}} materials used in dentistry. Crowns and in-lays {{can be made in}} the laboratory from dental composites. These materials are similar to those used in direct fillings and are tooth-colored. Their strength and durability is not as high as porcelain or metal restorations and they are more prone to wear and discolouration. As with other composite materials, a dental composite typically consists of a resin-based matrix, which contains a modified methacrylate or acrylate. Two examples of such commonly used monomers include bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (BISMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA), together with tri-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGMA). TEGMA is a comonomer which can be used to control viscosity, as Bis GMA is a big molecule with high viscosity, for easier clinical handling. Inorganic filler such as silica, quartz or glasses, are added to reduce polymerization shrinkage by occupying volume and to confirm radio-opacity of products due to translucency in property, which can be helpful in diagnosis of dental caries around dental restoration. The filler particles give the composites wear resistance as well. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. A coupling agent such as silane is used to enhance the bond between resin matrix and filler particles. An initiator package begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when external energy (light/heat, etc.) is applied. For example, camphorquinone can be excited by visible blue light with <b>critical</b> <b>wavelength</b> of 460-480 nm to yield necessary free radicals to start the process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{results on}} {{momentum}} transfer during photoionization processes {{determine how the}} ionizing photon momentum is split between the ejected electron and the recoiling ion. This leads to improved radiative force calculations. The consequences of this recoil for radiative forces are demonstrated by comparing for lithium the new accurate results with calculations based on simpler approximations commonly used in the past. We show that at some densities and temperatures typical of deep stellar envelopes, the total radiative force on lithium becomes negative (outgoing stellar radiation pushing the ions inwards); however this negative force is then negligible compared to gravity. In stellar envelope calculations, the exact results for hydrogenoid states are well approximated by the simpler formula that Sommerfeld obtained for the hydrogen 1 s state.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{expected from}} the quasilinear theory of the lower hybrid drift instability at the Earth's magnetopause is recalculated. The resulting diffusion coefficient is in principle just marginally large enough to explain {{the thickness of the}} boundary layer under quiet conditions, based on observational upper limits for the wave intensities. Thus, one possible model for the boundary layer could involve equilibrium between the diffusion arising from lower hybrid waves and various low processes. However, some recent data and simulations seems to indicate that the magnetopause is not consistent with such a soft diffusive equilibrium model. Furthermore, investigation of the nonlinear equations for the lower hybrid waves for magnetopause parameters indicates that the quasilinear state may never arise because coalescence to large wavelengths, followed by collapse once a <b>critical</b> <b>wavelengths</b> is reached, occur on a time scale faster than the quasilinear diffusion. In this case, an inhomogeneous boundary layer is to be expected.
