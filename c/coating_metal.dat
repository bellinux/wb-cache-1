Magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) was coated successfully on the magnesium metal in ammonium dihydrogen phosphate solution. The in vitro degradation behaviour of the MPC <b>coated</b> <b>metal</b> was evaluated using electrochemical techniques. The MPC coating increased the polarisation resistance (RP) of the metal by ~ 150 % after 2 h immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) and reduced the corrosion current density (icorr) by ~ 80 %.

40|$|A new {{biomimetic}} {{method for}} <b>coating</b> <b>metal</b> implants enables the fast formation of dense and homogeneous calcium phosphate coatings. Titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) disks were {{coated with a}} thin, carbonated, amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) by immersion in a saturated solution of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and carbonate. The ACP-coated disks then were processed further by incubation in calcium phosphate solutions to produce either crystalline carbonated apatite (CA) or octacalcium phosphate (OCP). The resorption behavior of these three biomimetic coatings was studied using osteoclast-enriched mouse bone-marrow cell cultures for 7 days. Cell-mediated degradation was observed for both carbonated apatite and octacalcium phosphate coatings. Numerous resorption lacunae characteristic of osteoclastic resorption were found on carbonated apatite after cell culture.

One of the most important areas of <b>metal</b> <b>coating</b> is to inhibit corrosion in metal surface. Metals react with oxygen in daily life. To prevent these oxidation reactions <b>metal</b> <b>coating</b> is used.
