5|$|Shown {{right is}} an X-ray {{structure}} showing a complex between a diaminocarbene and potassium HMDS. This complex was formed when excess KHMDS {{was used as}} a strong base to deprotonate the formamidinium salt. Removing lithium ions resulting from deprotonation with reagents such as LDA <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> problematic. Potassium and sodium salt by-products tend to precipitate from solution and can be removed. Lithium ions may be chemically removed by binding to species such as cryptands or crown ethers.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{techniques have}} traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins, as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E

5|$|Regionally {{developed}} ecotypes can {{be threatened}} with extinction when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This {{is sometimes called}} genetic mixing. Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material {{can lead to the}} replacement of local genotypes if the hybrids are more fit and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population {{to such a degree that}} none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.|$|E

25|$|Carbamate pesticides, such as carbaryl, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> pernicious since {{toxicity}} {{can take}} as long as two days to become evident, allowing infected pollen to be returned and distributed throughout the colony.

25|$|Another form {{of grief}} in animals is when an {{individual}} loses its mate; this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> brutal when the species is monogamous.

25|$|On rare occasions, panellists will {{challenge}} themselves, usually by mistake or for laughs. The game rewards {{those who make}} entertaining challenges, {{even if they do}} not speak for very long. If successful, last-second challenges <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> rewarding, as they allow one to speak for a short time but earn two pointsâ€”one for the challenge and one for being the last speaker.|$|E
25|$|Changing flood regimes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> {{problematic}} when {{exotic species}} are favored by altered conditions. For example, dam regulation changes floodplain hydrology {{in the southwest}} US by impeding annual flooding cycles. This modification has been implicated in the dominance of saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) over the native cottonwood (Populus deltoids). Cottonwoods {{were found to be}} competitively superior to saltcedar when flooding allowed seeds of both species to cogerminate. However, the lack of flooding caused by altered hydrology creates more favorable conditions for the germination of saltcedar over cottonwoods.|$|E

25|$|Treatment for {{meconium}} impaction typically {{involves the}} use of enemas, although persistent cases may require mineral oil or IV fluids. It is possible to tell that the meconium has passed when the foal begins to produce a softer, more yellow manure. Although meconium impactions rarely cause perforation, and are usually not life-threatening, foals are at risk of dehydration and may not get adequate levels of IgG due to decreased suckling and not enough ingestion of colostrum. Additionally, the foals will eventually bloat, and will require surgical intervention. Surgery in a foal <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> risky due to immature immune system and low levels of ingested colostrum.|$|E
25|$|Valley {{areas such}} as the South Wales Valleys, due to their north-south orientation, receive less {{sunshine}} than lowland areas because the mountains {{on either side of the}} valley obscure the sun in the early morning and late evening. This is noticeable in winter where there are only a few hours of sunshine. The mountains of Wales, northern England and Scotland <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> cloudy with extensive mist and fog. Near the coast, sea fog may develop in the spring and early summer. Radiation fog may develop over inland areas of Great Britain and can persist for hours or even days in the winter and can pose a major hazard for drivers and aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Absorbent {{underwear}}: Absorbent underwear or diapers {{can reduce}} embarrassment for bedwetters and make cleanup easier for caregivers. These products {{are known as}} training pants or diapers when used for younger children, and as absorbent underwear or incontinence briefs when marketed for older children and adults. Some brands of diaper are marketed especially for people with bedwetting. A major benefit is the reduced stress on both the bedwetter and caregivers. Absorbent underwear <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> beneficial for bedwetting children wishing to attend sleepovers or campouts, reducing emotional problems caused by social isolation and/or embarrassment in front of peers. Extended diaper usage may interfere with learning to stay dry at night, at least in adults with severe disabilities.|$|E

25|$|Openly {{transsexual}} {{people can}} have difficulty maintaining employment. Most {{find it necessary to}} remain employed during transition in order to cover the costs of living and transition. However, employment discrimination against trans people is rampant {{and many of them are}} fired when they come out or are involuntarily outed at work. Transsexual people must decide whether to transition on-the-job, or to find a new job when they make their social transition. Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous nameâ€”even deciding which rest room to use can prove challenging. Finding employment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> challenging for those in mid-transition.|$|E
25|$|Big {{wild animals}} such as bears and wolves are common in parts of Siberia and Russia's Far East, they also inhabit some thick forests north and east of Moscow in European Russia; female bears <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> {{dangerous}} when they have cubs, while male bears are especially dangerous if they wake up and roam in wintertime; wolves are dangerous in the winter period. The only poisonous snake in central European Russia is the viper; it mainly inhabits boggy and marshy forests but can occasionally be met in other types of forests, so high boots are advisable for forest trips and hikes. Tick-borne encephalitis is another hazard {{that is associated with}} forests and parks in Russia. Animals that are most prone to rabies are stray dogs and cats, wild foxes, wolves, hedgehogs, racoon dogs.|$|E
25|$|Kernel-mode {{rootkits}} {{run with}} the highest operating system privileges (Ring 0) by adding code or replacing portions of the core operating system, including both the kernel and associated device drivers. Most operating systems support kernel-mode device drivers, which execute with the same privileges as the operating system itself. As such, many kernel-mode rootkits are developed as device drivers or loadable modules, such as loadable kernel modules in Linux or device drivers in Microsoft Windows. This class of rootkit has unrestricted security access, but {{is more difficult to}} write. The complexity makes bugs common, and any bugs in code operating at the kernel level may seriously impact system stability, leading to discovery of the rootkit. One of the first widely known kernel rootkits was developed for Windows NT 4.0 and released in Phrack magazine in 1999 by Greg Hoglund. Kernel rootkits <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> difficult to detect and remove because they operate at the same security level as the operating system itself, and are thus able to intercept or subvert the most trusted operating system operations. Any software, such as antivirus software, running on the compromised system is equally vulnerable. In this situation, no part of the system can be trusted.|$|E
