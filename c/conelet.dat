Though Elephas celebensis is smaller-toothed and more hypsodont than the "hypsilophous stegodont" of Java (width of M 3 42 - 52 mm against 62 - 64 mm; height-width index 106 - 116 against 87 - 89 : Hooijer, 1954 a, b; Maglio, 1973 : 46, table 21), Maglio (1973 : 47) considers the differences not great when the degree of variation of known samples (in other species) is allowed for. Over the years, I studied molars of pygmy proboscideans from various Indonesian islands, and {{it never occurred to}} me that the Java pygmy would be same as that from Celebes until this suggestion was put forth by Dr. Maglio. I had described the Java form as a progressive Stegodon although I did notice the elephantid build of the molar ridges: "The structure of the ridges, with two large <b>conelets</b> at either end and a number of smaller <b>conelets</b> in between that form a transversely convex edge, is essentially elephantine" (Hooijer, 1954 a: 100). However, a molar was cut in mid-sagittal plane, and in that section, which I illustrated, the valleys are closed in at the bottom, Yshaped, as in a stegodont. Maglio (1973 : 47) observed that this is because of intermediate columns in the middle of the crown, confluent with the ridges. A cut laterally of the median line would have produced a valley section open to the bottom, V-shaped, as in an elephantid. Re-examination of the specimen (in the Geological Museum at Leiden) showed that the type of valley reproduced was indeed an artifact of sectioning. The valleys are Y-shaped only in the middle.

Although it is a non-destructive imaging method, the sampling process is destructive in that <b>conelets</b> are ‘destroyed’ because they cannot be grafted back onto the trees to develop into mature seed cones. However, reconstructed images create a permanent, tangible record and life-like image for future analysis, comparison or prediction studies (Perrin et al. 2010; van der Niet et al. 2010; Staedler et al. 2013).

The new model aims {{to deal with}} detected deficiencies in previous models: temporal shortage, overestimation of cone production on recent years, incompatibility with data from National Forest Inventory, difficulty for upscaling and ignorance of the inhibitory process due to resource depletion. Area of study: Spanish Northern Plateau and Central Range regions, covering an area where stone pine occupies more than 90, 000 ha Material and methods: Fitting data set include 190 plots and more than 1000 trees were cone production has been annually collected from 1996 to 2014. Models were fitted independently for each region, by means of zero-inflated log normal techniques. Validation of the models was carried out over the annual series of cone production at forest scale. Results: The spatial and temporal factors influencing cone production are similar in both regions, thus the main regional differences in cone yield are related with differences in the phenological timing, {{the intensity of the}} influent factors and forest intrinsic conditions. A significant inhibition of floral induction by resource depletion was detected and included into the model. Upscaling the model results in accurate prediction at forest scale. Research highlights: [1] The new model for annual cone production surpass the detected deficiencies of previous models, accurately predicting recent decay in cone production; [2] Regional differences in cone production are due to phenological and seasonal climatic differences rather than to between provenances genetic differences Keywords: zero-inflated models; pine nut; <b>conelet</b> losses; Leptoglossus occidentalis; forest upscaling...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a study undertaken {{to improve the}} capacity of seed orchard managers to select productive sites {{for the production of}} Pinus radiata seed. It is applied in its approach, with the major intent being to explore the relationship between environmental variables, and numbers of emergent female strobili at anthesis. Following the development of a sampling methodology for counting strobili, data were collected from 52 open grown stands of Pinus radiata ranging in age from 10 to 12 years located over a range of latitudes and altitudes east of the main dividing range of the South Island. Stands were selected to be reasonably close to a meteorological station. Based on existing knowledge of when environmental variables impact on the numbers of strobili carried at the time of anthesis, monthly temperature and water stress data for the spring months of the year prior to anthesis, and also for subsequent summer months, were correlated with numbers of strobili across sites. Winter temperatures prior to anthesis were also correlated with the strobilus data. The variables that were significantly correlated with strobilus number were then included in a stepwise multiple regression analysis with the intent of developing a statistical model for strobilus production. The multiple regression analysis selected the following variables into the model equation (with the percentage of the variance accounted for by each variable shown in brackets) : (i) Mean minimum temperature for February (around the time of seed-cone bud differentiation) (54 %). (ii) Integrated soil water stress for February and March (6 %). (iii) Accumulated growing degree days weighted against rainfall for the spring prior to seed-cone bud differentiation (4 %). (iv) Mean minimum temperature for May (between differentiation and anthesis) (1 %). Overall the model was able to account for around 65 % of between-site variability in strobilus number. The model variables suggested that predominantly temperature and to some extent rainfall govern the number of seed-cone buds that begin differentiating; and the number that finally reach antl 1 esis in the spring. Two years later in 1994 the statistical model was validated across 12 new South Island sites. It was found that the model estimates were in close agreement with actual counts, with 75 % of the residual values falling within the 95 % confidence limit bounds. Considering that mean February temperature was so highly correlated with strobilus number it was considered appropriate, whilst validating the model in the South Island, to extend sampling into the North Island. 11 stands were sampled, situated along both east and west coasts, where warmer summer temperatures prevail. However, the model estimates were less accurate in the North Island than the South. Both the data for 1992 and 1994 (total 74 sites) were combined and strobilus data were remodelled. Again the multiple regression analysis selected the mean minimum temperature of February as the variable that explained most of the between-site variance. The mean number of strobili at sites in the North Island was 1. 4 times greater than that for the sites in the South Island, with trees at the best North Island site carrying 38 % more strobili than those at the best site in the South Island. Considering that long-term data for the February temperature variable were readily available and that the relationship between temperature and strobilus production is likely to have an upper-limit, the Schumacher sigmoid growth function was fitted to the strobilus data for the 74 sites in the both the 1992 and 1994 studies. This function was found to satisfactorily describe the relationship between strobilus number and February temperature, although {{due to the lack of}} data points at the high end of the temperature range, the response curve was not typically sigmoid with a flattening off at higher temperatures. Using both a GIS mapping system and a climate surface model, mean minimum February temperatures for New Zealand were mapped to assist with the selection of potential seed orchard sites. It was apparent from the maps that prime sites for strobilus production are likely to be those that have a mean minimum February temperature > 15 °C, and that those sites tend to be on northern coastal headlands and capes with insular climates. The majority of the sites meeting the temperature criteria are in the North Auckland region. It is likely that a reproductive environment for Pinus radiata is one where the temperature does not vary greatly, either diurnally or seasonally. Assessments of <b>conelet</b> abortion and cone seed yield and weight, made at the time of counting strobili, showed that the levels of <b>conelet</b> abortion were independent of the numbers of strobili carried by trees. Seed weight was also unrelated to strobilus production, but seed number was correlated. The high strobilus-producing sites tended to yield more full seeds per cone. To verify the significance of the variables in the statistical model experimental studies were undertaken using clonal graft material at Amberley seed orchard, Canterbury. Firstly, an experimental study confirmed the importance in the model of February as a time to influence strobilus numbers. Grafts put into a low-intensity-light building for 2 week periods during February and early March produced no strobili the following spring, while strobilus production was unaffected on grafts moved at other times between January and the 26 th of March. In a further experiment, cooling grafts during the summer months reduced the number of strobili per whorl by 44 % and the number of grafts carrying strobili by up to 80 %. Siting grafts at cool inland sites during the winter on the Canterbury plain caused a loss of up to 61 % in seed-cone buds. However, neither warming grafts in a polyethylene house during long shoot primordial initiation/differentiation; or in a heated glasshouse during the winter months leading up to anthesis, increased strobilus production. The reasons for this are discussed. In hindsight it would appear that the maximum temperatures in the polyethylene house were too high for strobilus production, whilst in the heated glasshouse there was insufficient diurnal temperature variation, along with an interruption to the normal seasonal cooling pattern. Nonetheless, considering both the site predictions of the strobilus model and findings of these experiments it is proposed that an optimal reproductive environment for radiata pine is probably one where warm temperatures are relatively constant and do not vary greatly diurnally or seasonally. Summer soil water stress was implicated with strobilus production, although to a lesser extent compared to mean minimum February temperature. That is, the sites more water stressed during February and March tended to produce more strobili than those that were less water stressed. This effect was borne out by an irrigation pot trial in 1993 which showed that irrigation reduced the numbers of strobili carried by grafts by up to 45 %. However, due to persistent summer rain this effect was not satisfactorily demonstrated in an irrigation field trial conducted at Amberley seed orchard. The temperature and moisture conditions during the spring of the year prior to anthesis were found to indirectly impact on strobilus production by modifying the number of branches produced by grafts. When graft shoot growth was increased by modifying spring growing conditions, more branches developed per whorl. Finally, the effect of nitrogen fertiliser applications on strobilus production was tested across a range of sites and climates. There was no significant direct effect of N-fertiliser on strobilus production, regardless of N-form applied. It is unlikely that the use of nitrogen fertilisers in a well managed radiata pine seed orchard will enhance strobilus production; or that the inclusion of a soil-N variable in the model would improve its predictability. The statistical model developed in this thesis has added to knowledge regarding the identification and the importance of site environmental variables associated with female strobilus production in Pinus radiata. Further the model identified mean minimum February temperature as a key variable, for which long term data is readily available across New Zealand. These data were used to construct 2 mean minimum February temperature maps for New Zealand which can now be used to assist with seed orchard site screening. Experimentally it was demonstrated that temperature and moisture conditions govern the number of seed-cone buds that are differentiated and reach anthesis. It is recognised that environmental variables can impact on strobilus formation in both direct and indirect ways. The possibilities for extending the databases developed in this thesis to develop further understanding of seed production processes is advocated...|$|E

To enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the determination of sexual recognition of reproductive structures in conifers, the transcriptome of male and female <b>conelets</b> were characterized in a Chinese endemic conifer species, Pinus bungeana Zucc. ex Endl. The 39. 62 Gb high-throughput sequencing reads were obtained from two kinds of sexual <b>conelets.</b> After de novo assembly of the obtained reads, 85, 305 unigenes were identified, 53, 944 (63. 23 %) of which were annotated with public databases. A total of 12, 073 differentially expressed genes were detected between the two types of sexes in P. bungeana, and 5766 (47. 76 %) of them were up-regulated in females. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enriched analysis suggested that some of the genes were significantly associated with the {{sex determination}} process of P. bungeana, such as those involved in tryptophan metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, and cysteine and methionine metabolism, and the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways. Meanwhile, some important plant hormone pathways (e. g., the gibberellin (GA) pathway, carotenoid biosynthesis, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis (BR) pathway) that affected sexual determination were also induced in P. bungeana. In addition, 8791 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) from 7859 unigenes were detected in P. bungeana. The most abundant repeat types were dinucleotides (1926), followed by trinucleotides (1711). The dominant classes of the sequence repeat were A/T (4942) in mononucleotides and AT/AT (1283) in dinucleotides. Among these EST-SSRs, 84 pairs of primers were randomly selected for the characterization of potential molecular genetic markers. Finally, 19 polymorphic EST-SSR primers were characterized. We found low to moderate levels of genetic diversity (NA = 1. 754; HO = 0. 206; HE = 0. 205) across natural populations of P. bungeana. The cluster analysis revealed two distinct genetic groups for the six populations that were sampled in this endemic species, which might be caused by the fragmentation of habitats and long-term geographic isolation among different populations. Taken together, this work provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms of sexual identity in the reproductive organs of P. bungeana.

40|$|Copyright by the Ecological Society of AmericaMasting is a {{reproductive}} strategy {{defined as}} the intermittent and synchronized production of large seed crops by a plant population. The pollination efficiency hypothesis proposes that masting increases pollination success in plants. Despite its general appeal, no previous studies have used long-term data together with population- and individual-level analyses to assess pollination efficiency between mast and non-mast events. Here we rigorously tested the pollination efficiency hypothesis in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), a long-lived monoecious, wind-pollinated species, using a data set on 217 trees monitored annually for 20 years. Relative investment in male and female function by individual trees did not vary between mast and non-mast years. At both the population and individual level, the rate of production of mature female cones relative to male strobili production was higher in mast than non-mast years, consistent with the predicted benefit of reproductive synchrony on reproductive success. In addition, {{at the individual level}} we found a higher conversion of unfertilized female <b>conelets</b> into mature female cones during a mast year compared to a non-mast year. Collectively, parallel results at the population and individual tree level provide robust evidence for the ecological, and potentially also evolutionary, benefits of masting through increased pollination efficiency.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 This {{study was}} {{designed}} to help elucidate what differences, if any, exist within the species Alnus rubra Bong., grown naturally at various elevations and locations throughout the Pacific Northwest and coastal Alaska. Increasing importance of the species, including both economic and silviculture values, prompted the investigation into the early growth of red alder, an area in which detailed information is lacking. Two areas of investigation that were established included, first, an elevational transect from Newport to Marys Peak in the Coast Range of Oregon and, second, a study of ten geographic sources located throughout the range of Alnus rubra. Both phases of this investigation were conducted under three growth regimes involving the use of a 16 hour photoperiod and three thermoperiods (day-night temperatures are: 21 °, 16 °C; 10 °, 10 °C and 21 °, 21 °C). The Transect Study showed differences between red alder <b>conelets</b> (weight and size) and seeds (weights and germination) from different elevations to be significant at the 1 % level. The effect of the lower thermoperiod (10 °, 10 °C) in reducing the rate of germnination was also shown. No {{significant differences were found between}} seedlings representing the various elevations in other characteristics (height, diameter and leaf dimension). The Geographic Study, involving wildlings supplied by the U. S. Forest Service, was concerned primarily with seedling height growth and leaf size. Significant differences were found between seedlings from different geographic locations but, because of the limited number of seedlings available, the reliability of the data to accurately express variation between these locations is questionable. The effect of thermoperiod within a single tested environment was also significant but with results that were opposite to those obtained in the Transect Study. In the Geographic Study the height growth of seedlings under the cold condition (10 °, 10 °C) was significantly greater than for seedlings grown under the other growth conditions. In the Transect Study, the seedlings grown under the cold condition were significantly shorter than those grown under the other regimes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to evaluate different methods of improving seed production, seed germination, seedling survival and seedling growth when using natural regeneration with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seed trees and shelterwoods. Two experiments and a survey study were used to evaluate effects of (i) shelterwood density and seedling height at release on survival, damage and height growth of advance growth seedlings of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), (ii) release cutting on seed production, seed quality and needle nutrient contents in seed trees, (iii) weather and seed tree size on seed production, (iv) correlation between needle nutrient contents and seed production and seed weight, and (v) scarification in relation to seed fall. For all advance growth seedling sizes, growth was highest at shelterwood densities of 80 - 160 stems ha⁻¹, whereas the optimum density for survival was about 160 stems ha⁻¹. Height, top-shoot length and top-shoot diameter in seedlings the year before release cutting showed significant positive correlations with both survival and height growth. A majority of the small seedlings (< 20 cm) wilted the spring after overstorey release cutting, probably as a combined effect of drought in the humus and “light shock”. The only identified damaging agent causing significant mortality was pine weevil (Hylobius abietis L.). Cone and seed production were about five times higher in seed trees that had been released for 4 - 5 years, compared to control trees in the unreleased forest. Seed trees released for {{less than three years}} had about the same level of cone production as the controls. After release, the number of cones increased more in {{the lower part of the}} tree crowns than in the uppermost two metres. The concentration of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus in needles and mean needle dry weight was significantly higher in released trees compared to unreleased control trees. N, P and K concentrations in needles were significantly positively correlated to numbers of <b>conelets</b> as well as to mean 1000 -seed weight. In 1996, there were about eight times more cones than in 1995, probably because summer temperatures were higher in 1994 than in 1993, the years when the respective flower buds were initiated. Trees with a diameter at breast height of 400 mm produced twice as many cones as trees with a diameter of 300 mm. By timing soil scarification in relation to a rich seed fall twice as many seedlings were established compared to scarification immediately after release cutting. Unscarified plots showed poorest result according number of seedlings, and number of plots without seedlings (0 -plots). Height growth was significantly improved by scarification...|$|R
5000|$|Insects and mites {{that feed}} on the seeds and cones of P. pinaster can be {{effective}} biological control options. An insect or mite that acts as an ideal biological control should have a high reproductive rate and be host-specific, meaning that it preys specifically on P. pinaster. The life cycle of the predator should also match that of its specific host. Two key characteristics the predator should also exhibit are self-limitation {{and the ability to}} survive {{in the presence of a}} declining prey population. [...] Seed feeding insects are an effective control because they have high reproductive rates and target the seeds without diminishing the positive effect of the plant on the environment. Controlling the spread of P. pinaster seeds in the region is the key to limiting the growth and spread of this species because P. pinaster has the ability to produce a large number of seeds that are capable of dispersing very efficiently. [...] One possible option is Trisetacus, an eriophyid mite. The main advantage to using this mite to control the population of P. Pinaster is its specificity to P. pinaster; it can effectively control the population of P. pinaster by destroying the growing <b>conelets</b> in P. pinaster while limiting its impact to only this species. Another possible option is Pissodes validirostris, a cone-feeding weevil that lays eggs in developing cones. When the larvae hatch, they {{feed on the}} growing seed tissue, preventing P. pinaster seeds from forming and dispersing. Although the adults feed on the trees as well, they do not do any damage to the seeds and only feed on the shoots of the tree, so they do not appear to negatively impact the growth of the trees. Different forms of P. validirostris have diverged to become host-specific to different pine trees. The type of P. validirostris that originated from Portugal appears to have specialized to P. pinaster; therefore, this insect may be used in the future to control the spread of P. pinaster in South Africa. The uncertainties regarding the host-specificity of different types of P. validirostris, however, require more research to be completed before the introduction of the weevils into South Africa. An introduction of a species that is not host-specific to P. pinaster can lead to detrimental effects on both the environment and commercial industries that are dependent on certain tree species. Two other biological control possibilities include the pyralid moth species Dioryctria mendasella and D. mitatella, but these species attack the vegetative tissue instead of just the seeds of P. pinaster, harming the plant itself. [...] As of now, the eriophyid mite and cone-feeding weevil seem to hold the most potential to controlling the spread of P. pinaster in the regions it has invaded because they destroy the reproductive structures of the target invasive species.|$|R
