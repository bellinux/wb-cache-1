Direct Entry cadets complete the eighteen-month course, whilst cadets from ADFA join Duntroon in II Class, combining with the Direct Entry cadets and completing twelve months at the college. The leadership and military training provided at ADFA during the three years of training is considered the equivalent of III Class at RMC.|$|E

25|$|During reentry, {{there was}} a great deal of concern over whether Carpenter had {{actually}} survived, since he splashed down 250 miles off <b>course.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> two accounts of the Aurora 7 recovery, the first being that forty minutes after splashdown, Carpenter was located in his life raft, safe and in good health by Maj.

25|$|Football wise Sutton Coldfield is {{represented}} by Sutton Coldfield Town F.C., {{which was founded in}} 1879 and also to Romulus F.C. who share their ground at Coles Lane.

25|$|Animal {{experiments}} aid {{in investigating}} {{many aspects of}} human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, {{that it is difficult}} to control important variables for human subjects. Of <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} involves ocean venting {{of hydrogen}} sulfide gas. Portions {{of the deep}} ocean will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an anoxic zone, the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas, but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere allowing ultraviolet radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas. Of <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> species that can metabolize hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5000|$|... "TÃ¼rken raus" [...] and [...] "Deutschland den Deutschen" [...] {{were never}} officially released; they were {{distributed}} by copying the demo tapes.

25|$|The foreign {{invasion}} theory {{does not}} {{answer the question of}} where the inhabitants went. David Webster believed that the population should have increased {{because of the lack of}} elite power. Further, it is not understood why the governmental institutions were not remade following the revolts, which happened under similar circumstances in places like China. A study by anthropologist Elliot M. Abrams came to the conclusion that buildings, specifically in Copan, did not require an extensive amount of time and workers to construct. However, this theory was developed during a period when the archaeological evidence showed that there were fewer Maya people than there are now known to have been. Revolutions, peasant revolts, and social turmoil change circumstances, and are often followed by foreign wars, but they run their <b>course.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> no documented revolutions that caused wholesale abandonment of entire regions.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode B- rating. He said the episode [...] " [...] filled with more laughs than [...] predicted". While stating that Meg's humor {{comes from the}} same place each time, he enjoyed the action scenes in the episode. [...] Carter Doston of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 2.5/5 rating. He noted that the episode leaned on Taken too much, however he enjoyed some funny moments in it. He stated that [...] "the story seriously follows the same arc as the movie, just in 20 minutes. They find the Eastern Europeans who sold her to slavers, go on a car chase to rescue her and enter into a shootout on a boat to rescue her." [...] He continued, [...] "Of <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> jokes thrown in, and some humorous deconstructions of action movies and of the movie it parodies. For example, the 'car chase GPS' scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of <b>course</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

2500|$|Film Threat critic Scott Knopf {{gave the}} film a maximum five-star rating {{and called the}} script [...] "fantastic".
