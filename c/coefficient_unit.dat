In a system-on-chip (SoC) context, this method allows for full power gating of the <b>coefficient</b> <b>unit</b> without coefficient state loss, and runtime modifications of filtering specifications, such as filter order and cutoff frequency. Using trigonometric approximation methods for the sinc and resource sharing of computational units, a single coefficient is generated in five clock cycles. The approximation unit is compared against standard-cell-based memories, such as register and latch files, for energy and area, and the design is synthesized in 130 nm CMOS consumin...|$|E

Pearson correlation <b>coefficient,</b> <b>unit</b> root test, Co-integration test and Error correction model were employed to know linear relationship among these markets, non stationary or stationary series, OLS estimation for the long run relationship and short run relationship between these markets respectively. Monthly price series for a period of five years from September 2006 – August 2011 was used for the study. Accordingly, the result portrayed that, there is a strong relationship between the two secondary markets like Harar and Dire Dawa than central market.

40|$|Grounded in Freire's (1970) {{notion that}} the purpose of {{education}} in an unjust society is to bring about equality and justice, Critical Mathematics (CM) scholars consider mathematics to be a tool to understand, critique, and change the world by deconstructing power structures that marginalize certain groups. In particular, Gutstein's (2006) framework for integrating students' Community, Critical, and Classical mathematics knowledge bases (3 Cs) advocates for mathematics instruction that incorporates students' informal and everyday experiences. This involves investigations into social phenomena that draw on students' perspectives and experiences to inform critical analysis, while developing mathematical power. This dissertation presents the findings from a critical ethnographic study of a veteran teacher of color's approach to integrating the 3 Cs in his Precalculus class. In addition to discussing the creation and implementation of CM activities, this study examined the perspectives and participation of students of color during these curricular units. Data from 12 students of color, including interviews, focus groups, classroom observations, and student work, were collected {{over the course of a}} school year. Detailed descriptions are presented of three CM activities (i. e., Local Poverty Unit, AIDS Lab, Gini <b>Coefficient</b> <b>Unit).</b> Analysis of student participation found that students engaged most fully when units integrated transparent mathematical concepts into non-traditional social investigations. CM activities that lacked mathematical activity and/or reproduced traditional instructional norms resulted in high levels of open and passive resistance. Analysis of student perspectives found that repeated opportunities to integrate the 3 Cs promoted shifts in students' orientation toward mathematics. Some students came to see new ways of learning and using mathematics that included various means of participation and connections to one's personal life. In the end, students recognized that mathematics could be relevant and powerful for making sense of the world (reading the world), and acknowledged its potential for bringing about change (writing the world). Findings point to the essential role personalization plays in helping students develop a sense of social agency. That is, by prioritizing Community knowledge and inviting students to incorporate personal and family stories, teachers promote students' integration of their personal perspectives and experiences into their critical analyses...|$|E

In order {{to study the}} effect of the filling caves in the edge of loess tableland on loess slope stability, the slope stability of sliding from the caves was calculated in irrigation when caves were filled with compacted soil, lime soil, lime-ash soil and non-filled. The results show when caves are filled with lime soil the slope stability is the highest. The effects of variability of the physical and mechanical property indexes of caver filler on loess slope stability were researched further. The results show that (1) the variation <b>coefficients</b> of <b>unit</b> weigh and the shear strength indexes of cave filler “lime soil ” have small effect on the average value of safety reserve, but have big effect on the standard deviation of safety reserve, which explains that the design risks increase while the variation coefficient increasing. (2) with the increase of variation <b>coefficients</b> of <b>unit</b> weigh and the shear strength indexes of cave filler the failure probability increases. Especially when variation coefficient is bigger than 0. 3, the failure probability of loess slope is very sensitive to variation coefficient. (3) the effect of correlation <b>coefficient</b> among <b>unit</b> weight and the shear strength indexes of cave filler on failure probability increases with the variation coefficient increasing. It is very important to guarantee filling project. Good quality of filling construction will decrease the variability of cave filler, heighten the stability of loess slope, and decrease the occurrence of loess disasters...|$|R

40|$|Micro air {{vehicles}} (MAVs) {{have the}} potential to perform mission critical tasks not suitable for large aircrafts. To fulfill their potential, MAVs should be capable to maintain stable flight under different and even the most severe flight conditions. Due to their low inertia and low flight speed, MAVs are susceptible to wind gust during flight. It was observed that a flapping wing is more gust resistant than a traditional fixed wing. In this paper we numerically study the aerodynamic performance of a flapping airfoil in various gusty conditions by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. An algebraic moving grid technique is used to handle the dynamic airfoil motion. The effects of gust fluctuation amplitude, ratio of the flapping frequency to the gust frequency, airfoil kinematics are investigated. Our study shows that with certain kinematics, the flapping airfoil can effectively alleviate the freestream gust fluctuation and ensure a stable flight. However, no single parameter can determine whether the flapping wing can reduce the gust effect.
