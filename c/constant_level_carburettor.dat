30|$|The Maxwell {{resistance}} Ra {{could be}} related to the charge transfer resistance of the direct Co deposition. The decline in the first three minutes could be due to the diffusion limitation of the boric acid that forms complexes with Co 2 + ions for an easier deposition.

The <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> in Ra after 16  min coincides with the <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> in Rp suggesting that these adsorbed ions might {{be related to}} boric acid, such as e.g. B(OH) 4 −.

The inverse problem is solved using a variational penalization method with the total variation regularization of the coefficients. An operator splitting scheme is used to get efficient and robust numerical schemes for solving the obtained problem.

40|$|The {{activity}} of hepatic protein N-glycosylation was compared in rats {{of different ages}} by incubating UDP-[14 C]glucose with liver microsomes. Dolichyl-phosphate [14 C]glucose, [14 C]glucosyl-oligosaccharide-lipid and [14 C]glycoproteins formed were increased after birth to maximal levels at 2 weeks; thereafter dolichylphosphate [14 C]glucose remained constant, while [14 C]glucosyl-oligosaccharide-lipid and [14 C]glycoproteins were decreased to <b>constant</b> <b>levels</b> at 4 weeks. The postnatal change {{in the formation of}} [14 C]glycoproteins was similar to the change in the hexosamine content of N-glycans in liver microsomes and plasma, suggesting that the N-glycosylation of proteins in rat liver increases after birth to a maximum at 2 weeks, and thereafter decreases to a <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> at 4 weeks. The possibility of a regulatory role for dolichyl phosphate in glycoprotein synthesis in rat liver during postnatal development was eliminated by demonstrating the inefficiency of exogenous dolichyl phosphate on the postnatal changes in [14 C]glycoprotein formation. The transfer of [14 C]glucose from UDP-[14 C]glucose to denatured alpha-lactalbumin in liver microsomes increased to a maximum at 2 weeks and then decreased to a <b>constant</b> <b>level,</b> as with transfer to endogenous proteins (i. e. the formation of [14 C]glycoproteins). On the other hand, the transfer of oligosaccharide from exogenous [14 C]glucosyl-oligosaccharide-lipid to denatured alpha-lactalbumin reached a maximum at 2 weeks and then remained constant. These results strongly suggest that oligosaccharide-lipid available for N-glycosylation is limiting in rat liver after 2 weeks post partum. The activities of dolichyl-phosphate glucose, dolichyl-phosphate mannose and dolichyl-pyrophosphate N-acetylglucosamine synthases increased until 2 weeks post partum. Thereafter, the {{activity of}} dolichyl-pyrophosphate N-acetylglucosamine synthase decreased to a <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> at 4 weeks, while the activities of dolichyl-phosphate glucose and dolichyl-phosphate mannose synthases remained constant. These results suggest that N-glycosylation of proteins in rat liver increases until 2 weeks post partum, and that this depends on the activities of dolichol-pathway enzymes as a whole rather than on the activity of specific enzymes. N-Glycosylation then decreases to a <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> at 4 weeks due to decreases in the activities of enzymes responsible for oligosaccharide assembly on lipids, including dolichyl-pyrophosphate N-acetylglucosamine synthase...|$|R

40|$|The {{penetration}} of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase into various mammalian cells exhibits similar kinetics; {{the accumulation of}} both intracellular cyclase activity and cyclic AMP is rapid, reaching <b>constant</b> <b>levels</b> after 15 - 60 min of incubation. The kinetics of enzyme penetration into turkey erythrocytes is different; cyclase activity and cyclic AMP accumulate linearly and do not reach <b>constant</b> <b>levels</b> even after 6 h of incubation. In the preceding paper [Friedman, Farfel & Hanski (1987) Biochem. J. 243, 145 - 151] we {{have suggested that the}} <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> of intracellular cyclase activity reflects a steady state formed by continuous penetration and intracellular inactivation of the enzyme. In contrast with other mammalian cells, no inactivation of cyclase is observed in turkey erythrocytes. These results further support the notion that there is continuous penetration and deactivation of the invasive enzyme in mammalian cells. A 5 - 6 -fold increase in specific activity of the invasive cyclase is detected in a pellet fraction of human lymphocytes in which a similar increase in specific activity of the plasma-membrane marker 5 '-nucleotidase is observed. A similar increase in the invasive-cyclase specific activity is detected in a membrane fraction of human erythrocytes. Cyclase activity in a membrane-enriched fraction of human lymphocytes reached a <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> after 20 min of cell exposure to the enzyme. Similar time courses were observed for accumulation of cyclase activity and cyclic AMP in whole lymphocytes [Friedman, Farfel & Hanski (1987) Biochem, J. 243, 145 - 151]. We suggest therefore that cyclic AMP generation by the invasive enzyme as well as the intracellular inactivation process occur while it is associated with a membrane fraction identical, or closely associated, with the plasma membrane...|$|R
