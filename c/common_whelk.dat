50|$|Leptasterias polaris {{is a major}} {{predator}} in {{the cold}} waters in which it lives. Young individuals are mostly found on rocks less than 10 m deep and feed on such bivalve molluscs as the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and Hiatella arctica. Older individuals move to deeper waters where the seabed is sand or mud and feed on clams such as the Greenland cockle (Serripes groenlandicus), Spisula polynyma, the blunt gaper (Mya truncata) and the Atlantic jackknife clam (Ensis directus) which they dig up with their tube feet. They also eat gastropod molluscs such as the <b>common</b> <b>whelk</b> (Buccinum undatum) and the American pelicanfoot (Arrhoges occidentalis). In a laboratory study {{it was found that}} the starfish detected their prey by odours in the water. Hungry starfish which had not fed for two months, worked their way across the current until their olfactory tube feet, located near the tips of their arms, smelt an edible prey item after which they begin to travel up-current towards the source of the odour. Moving upstream in this way had the advantage that the prey was less likely to detect the approach of the starfish. Well fed starfish wandered in a more random fashion.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographies. Gastropods of {{the genus}} Burnupena are very <b>common</b> rocky-shore <b>whelks</b> endemic to the Southern African region. However, despite recent {{revisions}} {{of the genus}}, difficulties in identification persist, due mainly to the occurrence of phenotypic intermediates between sympatric species. Samples of Burnupena were collected from 17 sites {{along the coast of}} South Africa. Variation in shell morphology was examined using multivariate analyses. The results revealed that the degree of variation within species is very high, and that shell form and colour can be influenced by local environmental conditions. Nevertheless, most populations of the individual species clustered together. Morphological differences between species were small, although distinctions could be discerned, with not all species being confused with all other species. However, on the basis of morphology, {{there will always be a}} few individuals which will remain difficult to identify. Examination of the radulae from all of the species of Burnupena using both light and electron microscopy showed that the radula is of little or no practical value in distinguishing between species. Whilst some differences could be detected in some characters, these were not consistent, either within or between species. However, the radula is diagnostic at the generic level. The populations of Burnupena were analysed for allozyme variation at 25 loci. Variation within species was high, and in all of the species, significant population differentiation was obseNed. A significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance was found. Nei's genetic distances within species were low (means per species ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 05), and the populations of each species clustered together. Unlike their morphological differences, the species were mostly well differentiated genetically, with Nei's distances between species ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 45. Compared to the other species, B. cincta and B. lagenaria were relatively little differentiated from each other. B. catarrhacta was strongly differentiated from all of the other species.

The 2013 -investigation included analyses of 120 different contaminants or biological effect parameters in five types of samples (blue mussel, dog <b>whelk,</b> <b>common</b> periwinkle, cod and passive samplers). The contaminants include metals, organochlorines (e. g. PCB, DDT), PAH, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluroinated alkylated substances (PFAS) as well as contaminants that have recently received more attention such as hexabromcyclododecane (HBCD), chlorinated paraffins (SCCP, MCCP), phosphorus flame retardants (PFR), bisphenol A (BPA), tetrabrombisphenol A (TBBPA), phthalates and akylphenols. In the report, thirty representative substances or parameters were chosen for analyses of 750 time series (last 10 years). Of these there were statistically significant trends in 90 cases: 66 (9 %) were downwards and 24 (3 %) upwards. The dominance of downward trends indicated that contamination is decreasing for the measured substances. The downwards trends for TBT-concentrations and effect parameter (VDSI) confirmed that the legislation banning the use of TBT has been effective. Of the same 750 cases, 399 could be classified by the environmental classification system used by the Norwegian Environment Agency, 360 (90 %) were classified as insignificantly polluted, 27 (7 %) as moderately polluted, 10 (3 %) as markedly polluted, 1 (< 1 %) as severely polluted and 1 (< 1 %) as extremely polluted. Some cases warrant special concern, such as upward trend for mercury in cod fillet and high concentrations of several organic pollutants in cod liver from the Inner Oslofjord. Very high concentrations of DDE in mussels from the Sørfjord were related to earlier use of DDT as pesticide in orchards along the fjord. Miljødirektorate...|$|R

Here, we used a 35 -day experiment to evaluate how ocean warming and acidification may impact the nutritional qualities and physiological health of Dicathais orbita, a predatory muricid <b>whelk</b> <b>common</b> on the east coast of Australia, and discuss the broader ecological implications. Using an orthogonal experimental design with four treatments (current conditions [~ 23 °C and ~ 380 ppm of pCO 2], ocean warming treatment [~ 25 and ~ 380 ppm of pCO 2], ocean acidification treatment [CO 2 ~ 23 °C and ~ 750 ppm of pCO 2], and ocean warming and acidification treatment [CO 2, ~ 25 °C and ~ 750 ppm of pCO 2]), we showed that changes in moisture and protein content were driven by significant interactions between ocean warming and acidification. Elevated ocean temperature significantly decreased protein in the whelk flesh and resulted in concurrent increases in moisture. Lipid, glycogen, potassium, sulfur, and phosphorus content also decreased under elevated temperature conditions, whereas sodium, boron and copper increased. Furthermore, elevated pCO 2 significantly decreased lipid, protein and lead content. Whelks from control conditions had levels of lead in excess of that considered safe for human consumption, although lead uptake appears to be lowered under future ocean conditions and will be site specific. In conclusion, while D. orbita has received research attention as a potential food product with nutritious value, ocean climate change may compromise its nutritional qualities and reduce sustainable harvests in the future. Furthermore, ocean climate change may have deleterious impacts on the longevity and reproductive potential of this important rocky shore predator...|$|R

40|$|Background: The organotin {{compound}} tributyltin (TBT), {{used as an}} antifouling agent in ship hull paint, is known to cause imposex in several species of marine gastropods. Imposex is the imposition of male sexual characteristics on females, {{and can lead to}} female sterility. The <b>common</b> <b>whelk,</b> Buccinum undatum, is a common species in Norway and has received attention for its export potential. Because B. undatum varies geographically in reproduction and morphology it is important to study the species before exploiting the populations. No work has been done to assess imposex in the <b>common</b> <b>whelk</b> in Norway, and {{little is known about the}} species in Norway altogether. Methods: Buccinum undatum was caught at Berg and Balsnes in Balsfjord, Troms county, Northern Norway, for comparative studies of imposex and morphology. Shell length and male penis length were measured, and females were checked for imposex. Age was read by counting striae on the backside of the operculum. Sediment samples were taken at each location for analysis of TBT contents, and snails with and without imposex were also analyzed for TBT. Results: There was a significant difference in shell length between Berg and Balsnes. The whelks at Berg seemed to be longer than at Balsnes. There were no differences in incidence of imposex between the localities, nor between length groups within each locality. There seemed to be an increase in percentage of imposex with increasing age at Balsnes. No female whelks had imposex severe enough to cause sterility. TBT consentration was below detection limit in the sediments at both locations, while it was detected at low concentrations in females both with and without imposex. Conclusions: Buccinum undatum display morphological differences between close localities. TBT contamination at Berg and Balsnes is low and has low impacts on the whelk populations with respect to imposex. Imposex has no impact on reproductive abilities of the <b>common</b> <b>whelk</b> at Berg and Balsnes...|$|E
40|$|Cominella maculosa and C. virgata are <b>common</b> rocky shore <b>whelk</b> {{species from}} New Zealand. This study used DNA {{sequences}} from the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO 1) to expand an earlier unpublished dataset {{and examine the}} phylogeographic structure of both species in the Cook Strait region, of C. maculosa in the Chatham Islands, and of C. virgata in the northern North Island. Both species are {{found to have a}} considerable degree of phylogeographic structure, concordant with that reported by an earlier study and for other species with direct development. South Island sites sampled for C. maculosa had several private haplotypes and a high frequency haplotype that is shared with populations from the southern North Island. Together, these formed a ‘southern haplogroup’. Low diversity in ‘southern’ populations may reflect founder effects that would have occurred as part of a southward range expansion during the onset of the present interglacial period. The Chatham Islands samples had two haplotypes that formed a separate sub-group to the ‘southern haplogroup’, suggesting Chatham Islands populations are moderately isolated from those on mainland New Zealand but may have been founded from ‘southern’ populations relatively recently. The high frequency haplotype present in South Island samples of C. virgata is absent in Wellington samples but widespread in those from the north-eastern North Island. South Island populations may have been founded from the Hauraki Gulf through human-mediated translocation events. Phylogenetic analyses with a focus on C. virgata were conducted using the mitochondrial genes CO 1 and 16 SrRNA, and the nuclear gene 18 S rRNA, to expand an earlier published dataset. The purported northern subspecies C. virgata brookesi does not form a monophyletic lineage and voucher specimens fluidly intergrade with the nominal subspecies, with which it is synonymised. A lectotype is designated for Buccinum lineolatum Quoy & Gaimard, 1833, for which Cominella virgata is a replacement name. Potential causes of the disjunct distribution patterns of C. virgata and other mollusc taxa are discussed with particular reference to the formation and timing of marine straits through the Auckland Isthmus and Cook Strait...|$|R

Of these there were statistically significant trends in 104 cases: 86 were downwards and 18 upwards. The dominance of downward trends indicated that contamination is decreasing for the measured substances. The downwards trends for TBT-concentrations and effect parameter (VDSI) confirmed that the legislation banning the use of TBT has been effective.

Development is intracapsular in this species, with individuals hatching as crawling juveniles. While its reproductive cycle has been well documented, further work is necessary to provide a complete description of encapsulated development.

Number of eggs, veligers and juveniles per capsule are compared, and nurse egg partitioning, timing of nurse egg consumption and intracapsular size differences through development are discussed. Total development took between 133 and 140 days, over which 7 ontogenetic stages were identified.

Some whelks had survived being dredged several times. The very consistent size-shape relationship made it likely the whelks were all from a single habitat, probably in the fast tidal flows typical of the oyster-beds just north of the island. The whelks were harvested along with oysters: the whelks' shells were encrusted in a similar way to the oysters in the same midden, and the whelks even bore sub-adult oysters (spat), despite these being potential prey for whelks.

40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>whelk</b> Buccinum undatum is an {{abundant}} predatory and scavenging gastropod that is widely distributed {{on both sides}} of the North Atlantic, from Canada to New Jersey in North America and from Svalbard to France in Europe. The species range extends to 708 N along the western shores of Greenland and fossil shells (late Pliocene formation of Kap København) have been found as far north as 828300 N (Global Biodiversity Information Facility, 2013). It occurs on various substrates in coastal areas from low tide level to 200 m and sometimes deeper, but shows a preference for waters of about 20 – 30 m depth (Weetman et al., 2006; Włodarska-Kowalczuk, 2007; Heude-Berthelin et al., 2011). The biology of this important commercial species has been relatively well studied throughout its range, and includes studies of the seasonality of reproduction.

40|$|Identifying how {{the interplay}} between neutral and {{adaptive}} evolutionary processes shapes the spatial structure of natural populations is a central task in ecology and conservation biology. In marine populations, generally characterised by large population sizes and high gene flow, the simultaneous use of multiple descriptors (i. e. genetic, morphological, life-history, etc.) can be particularly helpful in unravelling the often subtle and complex spatial patterns observed. The gastropod Buccinum undatum (<b>common</b> <b>whelk)</b> lacks a planktonic larval stage, which could promote isolation of local populations and lead to phenotypic divergence through genetic drift or local adaptation. Despite the commercial significance of this species, {{the relative importance of}} these 2 forces remains unknown. Here, we used microsatellites, geometric morphometrics and shell thickness measurements to investigate the evolutionary dynamics generating spatial variation in 10 whelk populations in coastal waters around Ireland. Genetic diversity was generally high and genetic structure moderate but significant (overall FST = 0. 019), in accordance with an isolation-by-distance pattern. Phenotypic divergence, as measured by PST, was uncorrelated with, and much more pronounced than, neutral divergence (FST), indicating that environmental variation rather than population isolation drives phenotypic differentiation. For some traits, at least, diversifying selection is likely to be involved unless additive genetic components of phenotypic variation among populations are very low. Our results document a lack of correspondence between neutral and adaptive divergence, and highlight the need to couple connectivity estimates with the assessment of ecologically relevant traits in fisheries management and conservation...|$|E

This study utilized Buccinum undatum and Neptunea antiqua from the North Sea and the Irish Sea. Morphological alterations in the genital system (imposex phenomena), the histological structure of the gut, and the gonads were studied. TOT concentrations in soft body tissue and shells were determined. Females of both species displayed imposex phenomena (pseudohermaphroditism). The percentage of altered females per station ranged from 0 to 90 % in B. undatum and from 0 to 29 % in N. antiqua. Imposex index values in B. undatum reached 1. 09 near Helgoland and 0. 86 in N. antiqua sampled at 25 nautical miles from the Scottish northeast coast. Organotin compounds were detected in the soft bodies of snails from all stations. A chi-square analysis revealed a significant correlation between imposex stages and TOT concentrations in B. undatum but not in N. antiqua. Tributyltin (TBT) in B. undatum ranged from 1. 0 to 15. 9 ng g- 1 wet weight (Irish east coast). TBT concentrations in N. antiqua were higher and ranged from 2. 2 to 25. 7 ng g- 1. In both species, organotin compounds in the shells were below detection limits. Despite high TBT concentrations in soft tissues and the occurrence of imposex (offshore and inshore), female gonads were in good shape and no signs of limited reproductive capacity were found.

30|$|Monitoring {{bioaccumulation}} {{can also}} support risk assessment of various natural or anthropogenic {{events such as}} floods or dredging activities. For the maintenance of waterways, dredging of sediments may be necessary. As an example, the amount of sediments had increased to an unacceptable level in the Hamburg Port in 2004. In consequence, 6.5  Mio.[*]m 3 of sediments were dredged from the lower Elbe river in the Hamburg Port area and disposed 25  km north-west of the island Scharhörn in the inner German Bight between 2005 and 2010. To assess the potential ecological impacts on the marine environment, a comprehensive monitoring program has been established [43]. Among many other parameters, bioaccumulation of metals and organic chemicals has been measured in two benthic invertebrates (mussels (white furrow shell, Abra alba) and snails (<b>common</b> <b>whelk,</b> Buccinum undatum)) and fish (dab, Limanda limanda) sampled {{in and around the}} disposal site as well as in reference sites. These species were selected since they are abundant in the monitoring area and they represent different trophic levels. Since 2008, significantly increased levels of the organotin compounds monobutyltin (MBT) and dibutyltin (DBT) were detected in snails from the disposal site hinting at an increased bioavailability of contaminants due to the sediment disposals. Indeed, bioaccumulation decreased again after cessation of the disposals in 2010 : concentrations of the DDT metabolites p,p′-DDD and p,p′-DDE that had increased in snails sampled at the disposal site attained the same level as in reference sites in 2011. Sediment disposals had, in contrast to snails, no clear effect on concentrations of chemicals in fish and mussels. This shows that the selection of monitoring species can influence the outcome of monitoring studies.|$|E
40|$|Here {{we report}} {{a series of}} {{experiments}} on the development and occurrence of imposex in the <b>common</b> <b>whelk,</b> Buccinum undatum, {{under the influence of}} (chronic) exposure to butyltin compounds. The main objective of the experiments was to obtain more information about the effects of organotin compounds in the marine environment, which possibly relate to the reported decline of B. undatum in Dutch coastal waters. In these studies tributyltin (TBT) dose-dependently induced the development of male sexual organs in juvenile whelks. A TBT concentration > 7 ng Sn/l induced imposex in juvenile whelks. Growth in TBT-exposed juvenile whelks was significantly reduced compared to the reference group at a nominal TBT dose ≥ 4 ng Sn/l in one of the exposure studies. After 5 years in the laboratory, egg-laying was only observed in reference aquaria. Thus, TBT might impair whelk reproduction through growth reduction. The results showed a sensitivity towards imposex development in different life-stages. Juveniles were the most sensitive, adolescent females also responded, but adult females did not respond to TBT exposure, although they dose-dependently increased their organotin (OT) body-burden when exposed. Environmental TBT during only the in ovo stage, did not result in an increased masculinisation compared to non-exposed developing whelks. Histological studies showed no sterilisation due to mechanical blockage of the (adult) female genital opening by sperm-duct tissue. Gonadal development in 2 -year old juveniles was not observed. This implies that the differentiation of a penis and a vas deferens, which already occurred in the first few months after hatching, was not controlled by gonadal factors. No other sexual characteristics than those already visible with the eye were found. TBT inactivated CYP 450 to its inactive form CYP 420 in in vitro exposure studies with microsomal fractions of whelks. The studies have shown TBT to disrupt sexual development dose dependently in juvenile common whelks. TBT also dose dependently exerts an effect on enzymatic (CYP 450) processes. Although no mechanical sterilisation was observed, reproduction might be impaired through growth reduction. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Common</b> <b>whelk,</b> Buccinum undatum (L.) is a {{conspicuous}} benthic scavenger in Irish waters, {{and is a}} valuable fisheries resource in South East Ireland. B. undatum is fished {{in many parts of}} its range, and previous studies have shown that certain life history parameters, which vary with location, make this species vulnerable to overexploitation. This makes research into each exploited stock essential to ensure sustainable fisheries management of the species. In 2003, interest in B. undatum as a complementary species in the inshore fishery east of the Inishowen Peninsula, North West Ireland, initiated investigation into fisheries related biological and population aspects of the species in this region. The current study presents estimates of spatial variation and density of the stock, size at age and growth rates, size and age at onset of sexual maturity, and timing of reproductive events in the region of the North West Irish whelk fishery for the period of June 2003 to May 2004. Analysis of variance of the total shell length of whelk landings to the fishery was conducted over spatial scales of fishing pot, fishing string and landings to vessels. Landings varied significantly in shell length at the spatial scale at which whelks are attracted to baited pots, but did not vary significantly over larger spatial scales. Depletion estimates of stock density from fisheries derived Catch per Unit Effort data and a mark re-capture experiment estimate 0. 134 - 0. 227 whelks per m 2. Two independent methods of age determination found similar growth logistics functions for B. undatum. Modal analysis of length frequency distribution of landings to the fishery estimated symptotic length, Leo = 151. 64 mm and Brody growth coefficient, K = 0. 04. Analysis of the striae in individual opercula, where each stria was found to represent annual growth, estimated Loo = 137. 73 mm and K = 0. 12. Common whelks in the region of the North West Irish whelk fishery grow slowly and are long-lived, with 19 opercula striae recorded in one individual. Onset of sexual maturity is late, and no sex-specific differences in size or age at maturity were determined in the present study. Males were found to achieve sexual maturity at 83. 30 ± 10. 77 mm, and 8. 9 - 11. 1 years of age, and females at 82. 62 ± 10. 68 mm and 8. 8 to 11. 1 years of age. Systematic observations of reproductive events, including histological changes to the female ovary and male testis, and changes in the size and mass of body components, suggest that breeding occurred between the autumn and winter months of October and December 2003. Biological aspects of B. undatum in the study region are compared with previous studies from other regions, and discussed in relation to sustainable management of the fishery...|$|E
