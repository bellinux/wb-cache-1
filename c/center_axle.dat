25|$|The ES44C4 (Evolution Series, 4400 HP, C-C wheel arrangement, 4 {{traction}} motors) {{was introduced}} in 2009. While similar to the ES44AC, the ES44C4 has two traction motors per truck, instead of the conventional three such as on the ES44AC. The <b>center</b> <b>axle</b> of each truck is unpowered, giving an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement. BNSF Railway is the launch customer for this model, ordering an initial batch of 25 units numbered 6600-6624. As of 2015, BNSF Railway currently rosters over 900 ES44C4 units. On January 30, 2014 Florida East Coast Railway announced that they would buy 24 ES44C4's, to be numbered 800-823, for heavy haul service and intermodal traffic. All were delivered {{by the end of}} 2014, in order to beat the EPA's deadline on exhaust-emissions standards for new-built Tier 3 locomotives.|$|E

50|$|E.550 {{had five}} axles {{connected}} to the two electric motors through an articulated coupling rod. The three <b>center</b> <b>axles</b> were rigidly mounted to the frame and the <b>center</b> <b>axle's</b> wheels were without flanges. The outer axles were mounted {{in a manner that}} allowed them to turn into curves. The wheels were small, and thus adapted to heavy freight or slow passenger services at low speed. The locomotive had two cabs, one {{at each end of the}} central compartment. The motors were asynchronous three-phase, which could be connected in series at low speed and in parallel at higher speeds. The connections were enabled through a tambour connector using a liquid-cooled rheostat. Feeding was provided by paired trolley poles at each end, each pair carrying two bow collectors for the two wires of the three phase system.|$|R

50|$|The G22U model found success {{among several}} buyers and were also built in {{different}} countries to suit the customers needs. The Yugoslav locomotives were equipped with a steam generator located in the high short hood. Both the Yugoslav Railways and Taiwan Railroad Administration purchased their G22Uâ€™s with a unique A-1-A running gear configuration. This did not alter the models designation as the <b>center</b> <b>axles</b> were not powered nor were A-1-A trucks widely produced at the time.|$|R

5000|$|Built in 1949, the opposed-piston 2-10-4 {{was one of}} {{a number}} of Soviet {{locomotive}} designs that was unsuccessful.

5000|$|A {{series of}} design studies {{carried out by}} Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in the 1950s used the second-generation Talgo design for their car {{suspension}}s. The suspension arms for each neighboring pair of cars were attached to a common bogie ("truck") between them, as opposed to having a pair of separate bogies for each car. The bogies rode the common curve between the two cars, centered by traction springs that <b>centered</b> the <b>axle</b> between adjoining car bodies.TurboTrain cars are 2+1/2 ft lower than conventional cars, to lower {{the center of gravity}} in relation to the swinging point {{at the top of the}} arms.

5000|$|The Comanche {{used the}} XJ Cherokee's [...] "Quadralink" [...] front suspension, {{with coil springs}} and upper/lower control arms on a solid axle. It was argued that the coil springs allowed for greater ride comfort and axle {{articulation}} during off-road excursions. A track bar (Panhard rod) is used to keep the <b>axle</b> <b>centered</b> under the truck. Modified versions of this same basic suspension system were later used on the 1993-2004 Grand Cherokee, 1997 and newer TJ Wranglers and 1994 and newer Dodge Rams.|$|R
50|$|The Dana 44 Front axle {{first saw}} {{use in the}} 1950s and still in use today. Dana 44 Front axles were known for {{utilizing}} locking hubs or a <b>center</b> <b>axle</b> disconnect system. However, a permanently locked-in Dana 44 is not uncommon. The Dana 44 has seen use in 1/4-, 1/2-, 3/4-, and 1-ton rated trucks. The Dana 44 was manufactured in kingpin and ball joint variations, as well as closed and open knuckle variations.|$|E
50|$|The Dodge Ram {{features}} {{a wide variety}} of axles. For the front axle of 4x4 Rams, a Dana 44 was used on all 1500 Rams and the early (light-duty) 2500 Rams. However, most of the 2500 and all 3500 Rams use Dana 60 front axles. The 1500 Rams and some early light duty 2500 Rams used a 9.25 Chrysler (Spicer) axle in the rear. A Dana 60 rear axle was used on heavy duty 2500 V8 Rams. A Dana 70 rear axle was used in 2500 Rams with a V10 or a Diesel/Automatic transmission combination. A Dana 80 rear axle was used on 2500 Rams with a manual transmission and V10/diesel engine combination. Every 3500 Ram was made with a Dana 80. The front drive axles in these Rams were unique in the fact they didn't feature Locking hubs, but featured a <b>Center</b> <b>axle</b> disconnect. The 2002 2500 and 3500 Rams saw the eventual phase out of the <b>Center</b> <b>axle</b> disconnect, in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in. Dodge continued to feature front axles like this for their 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 trucks until 2013 models.|$|E
50|$|A <b>center</b> <b>axle</b> {{disconnect}} {{system or}} CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|E
50|$|When these proved insufficiently {{stable for}} high speed service, the road ordered the 1200 class of 4-6-2 Pacifics, which were two {{cylinder}} simplex engines weighing 220000 lb and fitted with 69 in diameter coupled wheels on unusually long <b>axle</b> <b>centers.</b> Immediately upon their arrival on the property, their drive wheels were swapped with the 79 in diameter drivers off the earlier Prairie types, which became fast freight locomotives. These {{would wind up}} in branch line service, where they were very successful and ultimately outlasted the Pacifics.|$|R
2500|$|The power car, 9908 Silver Charger, was unique. It {{utilised}} {{a single}} new EMC 567 V-12 engine developing 1,000hp, {{rather than the}} pair used in the contemporary EMC E3. It had one Martin Blomberg-designed E-unit A1A passenger truck at the front, with powered outer <b>axles</b> and a <b>center</b> idler <b>axle,</b> and an unpowered trailing truck, giving it the unusual wheel arrangement of A1A-2. This made it mechanically half of an E3. The back half of the power car was a baggage area. [...] This made it similar to special power-baggage units built by EMD for the Colorado Springs section of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific [...] "Rocky Mountain Rocket", though the latter had a carbody and E-3/E-6 styling by EMD.

5000|$|Leigh made a {{minor change}} to the axle so that if a light is shone on the device, the <b>center</b> of the <b>axle</b> will thicken, restricting {{the motion of the}} ring. It only keeps the ring from moving, however, if it is at A. Over time, therefore, the rings will be bumped from B to A and get stuck there, {{creating}} an imbalance in the system. In his experiments, Leigh was able to take a pot of [...] "billions of these devices" [...] from 50:50 equilibrium to a 70:30 imbalance within a few minutes.|$|R
