5|$|At {{the end of}} July 2012, Libor Michálek {{accepted}} the Czech Pirate, Green, and Christian Democrat Party senatorial nominations for District 26. The Pirate Party was his primary affiliation due to its transparency and accountability platforms. His personal 12-point platform prioritized direct democracy, fair political party competition, and anti-corruption oversight efforts alongside social welfare reforms. In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent {{of the first round}} vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat. Another candidate, Karel Berka, challenged the decision, but the Czech Supreme Administrative Court found the claims unfounded. He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to national office, the 81-seat <b>Czech</b> <b>Senate.</b> His senatorial term is 2012–2018.|$|E

40|$|Creation of {{the second}} Chambers of Parliament in Poland and in the Czech Republic wasn’t the result of well-thought vision of these organs, but was made to deal with {{immediate}} problems. Their constitutional model is different. In Poland it’s term is connected with Sejm’s term whereas in the Czech Republic there is no connection between them. In Poland it lasts 4 years and in the Czech Republic 6 years and it can’t be dissolved. Moreover, the frame of <b>Czech’s</b> <b>Senate</b> is renewed in 1 / 3 of it’s frame every 2 years, which makes it more representative. Candidates for senators besides the traditional requirements such as citizenship, full active capacity and full public rights, {{have to be at}} least: 30 years old in Poland and 40 in the Czech Republic at the day of poll. There are majority elections, but in Poland constituencies are plurinominal (from 2 to 4), whereas in the Republic of Czech uninominal. In Poland the candidate with the highest number of votes gets the mandate whereas in the Czech Republic there is the requirement of the absolute majority of votes which is why the second round takes place that often. Both Senates work permanently but the Czech one may be put on hold. In both countries the model of asimetrical bicameralism was introduced. Second Chambers take part mainly in the legislative procedure but the main role is being played by the first Chambers. The most important right of the <b>Senate</b> of the <b>Czech</b> Republic is the possibility to create (when the Chamber of Parlament is dissolved) the decree-law. The creative competences of both Chambers are very random and it’s hard to find any particular idea in it. Similar situation takes place when we discuss other rights even though there is not many of them. Generally speaking, Czech construction seems to let the Senate run it’s duties in a better way. Disconnection of the Chamber’s commision and temporary ability to renew the frame of Senate are these ideas which should be taken into account when discussing the reform {{of the second}} Chamber...|$|R

Doping programs that were successful at the previous World Championships in Sapporo continued with 78 EPO and 430 blood testing on athletes in the 1–15 February period prior to the 2009 championships. 450 pre-competition blood tests were conducted with the top four finishers plus two randomly selected athletes of each event, totalling 120 for the championships. These tests were conducted by the Czech National Anti-Doping Agency with assistance of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Testing costs for the program were CHF 1.5 million. As of 25 February, a total of 90,000 spectators had attended the championships. Prior to the championships, there was concern {{of the lack of}} snowfall during the championships.

40|$|Voting {{behavior}} in the elections to the higher chamber of the <b>Czech</b> parliament (the <b>Senate)</b> is a rather unexplored phenomenon. This probably results {{from a variety of}} substantive as well as methodological reasons. Yet, there are many unanswered theoretical questions and untested hypotheses pertaining precisely to this type of vote. Senate elections are highly personalized - there is one candidate nominated by each major party in a district, or there are independent candidates. However, we are rather uninformed if (and to what degree) candidate´s individual characteristics (age, gender, education and academic qualifications, place of residence) increase their odds of electoral success. I argue that many methodological obstacles in studying senate elections may be overcome by using a discrete-choice model (conditional logit model). I illustrate its application using data from a panel survey conducted before and after the first senate election in the post-socialist Czech republic in 1996. The analysis reveals that some individual characteristics of candidates do indeed increase their odds of obtaining votes net of party effects. Furthermore, I document that this "ideal candidate profile" differs across socio-demographic groups...|$|R
