5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as <b>cumulonimbus,</b> when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into <b>cumulonimbus</b> storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over {{a body of}} water. Some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a <b>cumulonimbus</b> cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E

50|$|A {{flanking}} {{line is a}} line {{of smaller}} <b>cumulonimbi</b> or cumulus that form in the warm rising air pulled in by the main updraft. Due to convergence and lifting along this line, landspouts sometimes occur on the outflow boundary of this region.|$|R
5|$|Cirrus Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower stratosphere. They are dense and opaque, not allowing {{the light of the}} sun or moon to pass through. They are more common on the anvils of <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mature}} {{stage of a}} thunderstorm, the warmed air {{continues}} to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called <b>cumulonimbus</b> incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Individual cirrus cloud {{formations}} can be {{the remnants}} of anvil clouds formed by thunderstorms. In the dissipating stage of a <b>cumulonimbus</b> cloud, when the normal column rising up to the anvil has evaporated or dissipated, the mat of cirrus in the anvil {{is all that is}} left.|$|E

500|$|The Global Weather Center's Cyclone Weather Center of the United States Air Force (USAF) {{initiated}} [...] "Mediterranean Cyclone Advisories" [...] on the cyclone at six-hour intervals {{starting at}} 1800UTC on 27January, until 0600UTC {{on the following}} day. Convection was most intense in the eastern sector of the cyclone as it drifted east-northeastward. On infrared satellite imagery, the eye itself was [...] in diameter, contracting to just [...] one day prior to making landfall. The cyclone passed by Malta, Italy, and Greece before dissipating several days later in the extreme eastern Mediterranean. Observations related to the cyclone, however, were inadequate, and although the system maintained numerous tropical characteristics, it is possible it was merely a compact but powerful extratropical cyclone exhibiting a clear eye, spiral banding, towering <b>cumulonimbi,</b> and high surface winds along the eyewall.|$|R
5|$|A tornado is a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{that is in}} contact with both {{the surface of the}} earth and a <b>cumulonimbus</b> cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a collequial term in America, or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low-pressure circulation.|$|E
5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., <b>cumulonimbus</b> or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or <b>cumulonimbus,</b> and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.|$|E
40|$|During October 12 - 15, 1965, the {{southern}} part of Florida received an unusually heavy and prolonged rainstorm. Although the conventional isobaric analyses did not reveal any obvious pre-existing disturbance which would bc expected to produce such a result, isentropic charts suggest that intense convection was being initiated and sustained by an organized lift of conditionally unstable air to saturation. Accompanying the heavy rainfall was the formation in the lower troposphere during the 14 th of a tropical depression which is thought to have been of convective origin. i 1.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review {{observational}} and modeling studies of cloud venting {{by a wide}} variety of cloud types ranging from ordinary cumuli, to ordinary <b>cumulonimbi,</b> mesoscale convective systems and tropical and extratropical cyclones. We have used explicit cloud-resolving simulations with RAMS to illustrate the nature of the process of venting of boundary layer air by several cloud system types and to provide quantitative estimates of the transport rates for different storms. In order to help global modelers prioritize their efforts in developing and refining cloud transport parameteriza-tion schemes, we have also attempted to make global estimates of the contributions of the various storm types to venting of boundary layer air. We find that on a global-annual basis, the extratropical cyclone has the highest boundary layer mass flux of all cloud venting systems, followed by the general class of MCS’s (excluding MCC’s), ordinary thunderstorms, tropical cyclones, and MCC’s. We estimate an annual flux of 4. 95 X lOI 9 kg of boundary layer air by these cloud systems, which represents a venting of the entire boundary layer about 90 times a year. 1...|$|R

5|$|Waterspouts {{have similar}} {{characteristics}} as tornadoes, {{characterized by a}} spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that form over bodies of water, connecting to large <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds. Waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes, or more specifically, non-supercelled tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water. These spiralling columns of air are frequently developed within tropical areas close to the equator, but are less common within areas of high latitude.|$|E
5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more favorable for thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E
5|$|In early July, {{widespread}} {{showers and}} thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific underneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July9, a single <b>cumulonimbus</b> cloud west of Wake Island became {{associated with the}} TUTT and quickly organized. By July11, the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W. Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320km (200mi) east of the Northern Mariana Islands. The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone; and second, it became tropical while situated underneath a cold-core low.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of two small mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) in northeastern Colorado is investigated via dual-Doppler radar analysis. The first system developed from several initially isolated <b>cumulonimbi,</b> which gradually coalesced into a minimal MCS with relatively little stratiform precipitation. The second system de-veloped more rapidly along an axis of convection and generated {{a more extensive}} and persistent stratiform echo and MCS cloud shield. In both systems, the volumetric precipitation rate exhibited an early meso-b-scale convective cycle (a maximum and subsequent minimum), followed by reintensification into a modest mature stage. This sequence {{is similar to that}} noted previously in the developing stage of larger MCSs by McAnelly and Cotton. They speculated that the early meso-b convective cycle is a characteristic feature of development in many MCSs that is dynamically linked to a rather abrupt transition toward mature stage structure. This study presents kinematic evidence in support of this hypothesis for these cases, as derived from dual-Doppler radar analyses over several-hour periods. Mature stage MCS characteristics such as deepened low- to midlevel convergence and mesoscale descent developed fairly rapidly, about 1 h after the early meso-b convective maximum. The dynamic linkage between the meso-b convective cycle and evolution toward mature structure is examine...|$|R
50|$|Initial wind speeds {{within the}} young medicane were {{generally}} low, with sustained winds of merely 28 to 46 km/h, {{with the highest}} recorded value associated with the disturbance being 63 km/h at 0000 UTC on 16 January, slightly below the threshold for tropical storm on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Its structure now consisted of a distinct eye encircled by counterclockwise-rotating <b>cumulonimbi</b> with cloud top temperatures colder than -50 C, evidencing deep convection and a regular feature observed in most tropical cyclones. At 1200 UTC on 16 January, a ship recorded winds blowing east-southeast of about 50 kn south-southwest about 50 km north-northeast of the cyclone's center. Intense convection continued to follow the entire path of the system as it traversed the Mediterranean, and the cyclone made landfall in northern Libya at approximately 1800 UTC on 17 January, rapidly weakening after coming ashore. As it moved inland, a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1012 mbar (29.89 inHg) was recorded, accompanied by wind speeds of 93 km/h as it slowed down after passing through the Gulf of Sidra.

40|$|Cloud {{information}} from UV/VIS/NIR spectrometers aboard spacecraft platforms is highly valuable {{for the construction}} of cloud property climatologies, since it is complementary to the information retrieved using IR spectrometers, imagers and active sensors (cloud radars and lidars). Clouds, when present, are the main modulators of the radiation transport across the atmosphere. They are very diverse in terms of composition (ice, liquid water), thickness (thin cirri to thick <b>cumulonimbi),</b> variability (homogeneous stratocumuli to inhomogeneous cumuli), altitude, etc. Consequently, the modeling of the cloud-radiation insteraction {{is one of the most}} challenging tasks in the atmospheric science. The distance that photons travel across the atmosphere before being captured by a spaceborne instrument can be greatly affected by clouds. Absorption by atmospheric molecules is not only proportional to the molecular number density but also to the photon path legth. Therefore, the effects of clouds on the photon path legth is of particular interest in the atmospheric remote sensing. During the retrieval processing, changes in the absorption bands within the spectra are analyzed. These changes can be linked to variations in the molecular number density but also to variations in the photon path legth. Therefore, precise cloud information to correct for variations in the photon path length is mandatory for the accurate retrieval of atmospheric trace gases. The ROCINN algorithm retrieves cloud top height (pressure), cloud optical depth and cloud albedo rom measurements in and around the oxygen A-band (760 nm) taking as input the cloud fraction computed with the OCRA algorithm (a color space approach based on broadband reflectances). This paper presents the latest version of the ROCINN algorithm as implemented to process Sentinel- 5 p, Sentinel- 4 and Sentinel- 5 data. There are two variants of the ROCINN algorithm: one that treats clouds as reflecting boundaries (CRB)) (i. e. Lambertian equivalent reflectors) and a second one that treats louds as scattering layers (CAL). The ROCINN-CRB algorithm has been successfully used operationally for GOME/ERS- 2 and GOME- 2 /MetOp-A and -B instruments since over one decade. The CAL algorithm treats clouds in a more realistic way and provides cloud properties closer to reality. ROCINN V 3. 0 in the CRB and CAL variants have been included into the latest UPAS operational processor and is the baseline algorithm for the generation of cloud products from the atmospheric Sentinels. In this work, we present and analyze preliminary ROCINN cloud properties from S 5 P/TROPOMI, in addition to those from GOME- 2 on both MetOp-A and Metop-B. A quantitative comparison with independent cloud products, e. g. from VIIRS on NASA/Suomi-NPP, from AVHRR on MetOp and MODIS on NASA-EOS/Terra is forseen...|$|R
5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate the cloud shape. Cirrus is {{indicated}} by a couple hooks, cumulus are indicated by a mound shape, with <b>cumulonimbus</b> indicated with an upside down trapezoid {{on top of the}} cumulus symbol to indicate its anvil. When {{there is more than one}} cloud type present per level, the cloud type with the highest priority is included. Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether or not a weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the <b>cumulonimbus</b> cloud in a {{thunderstorm}} grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} tornadoes include the {{multiple}} vortex tornado, landspout and waterspout. Waterspouts {{are characterized by}} a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or <b>cumulonimbus</b> cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, fire whirls, and steam devil.|$|E
5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a <b>cumulonimbus.</b> They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{major cause}} of rain {{production}} is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as <b>cumulonimbus</b> (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall {{along the sides of}} mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Gordon, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Goring, was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage and loss {{of life in the}} Philippines and Southern China in July 1989. Originating from a single <b>cumulonimbus</b> cloud on July9, Gordon developed into a tropical depression near the Northern Mariana Islands and quickly intensified as it tracked west-southwestward. On July13, the storm attained typhoon status and subsequently underwent a period of rapid intensification. By July15, the storm attained its peak strength as a Category5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260km/h (160mph). After striking the northern Philippines, Gordon moved through the South China Sea and slowly weakened. On July18, the storm made landfall in southern China and was last noted the following day as it dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and <b>cumulonimbus)</b> or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Later on June18, {{forecast}} models {{indicated that}} the system might rapidly degenerate prior to landfall. However, the NHC continued to forecast that the depression would attain tropical storm-status before landfall. Shortly after, the depression became increasingly disorganized as convection separated {{from the center of}} circulation due to increasing wind shear. Stable air ahead of the system inhibited the possibility of rapid development as warm waters supported intensification. By the morning of June19, the center of circulation was situated along the southern edge of deep convection, indicating that the depression was beginning to degenerate. Despite this, the NHC continued to anticipate intensification prior to landfall. Embedded within an easterly flow ahead of a mid-level trough, the storm turned towards the north-northeast and accelerated slightly. At 11:00am PDT (1800UTC), the depression reached its peak intensity with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1003mbar (hPa; 29.62inHg). Operationally, the depression was considered to be slightly stronger, having a minimum pressure of 1001mbar (hPa; 29.56inHg). Later that day, the depression began to degenerate into an open trough as it was situated underneath cirrus clouds instead of <b>cumulonimbus</b> clouds. Visible satellite imagery showed that the depression became increasingly ill-defined and the NHC estimated that the depression degenerated into a trough of low pressure near the Islas Marías during the afternoon of June19. The remnants of the depression were monitored by the United States Naval Research Laboratory for several more hours until the system moved inland over Sinaloa.|$|E
