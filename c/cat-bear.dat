5|$|The {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens), {{also called the}} lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red <b>cat-bear,</b> is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a {{waddling}} gait due to its shorter front legs; it is {{roughly the size of}} a domestic cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{introduction}} of Buddhism in Japan, which prohibited the killing of animals, the Japanese compromised by devising different strategies in hunting bears. Some, such as {{the inhabitants of the}} Kiso area in the Nagano Prefecture, prohibited the practise altogether, while others developed rituals in order to placate the spirits of killed bears. In some Japanese hunting communities, black bears lacking the white chest mark are considered sacred. In the Akita Prefecture, bears lacking the mark were known by matagi huntsmen as minaguro (all black) or munaguro (black chested), and were also considered messengers of yama no kami. If such a bear was shot, the huntsman would offer it to yama no kami, and give up hunting from that time on. Similar beliefs were held in Nagano, where the completely black bears were termed nekoguma or <b>cat-bear.</b> Matagi communities believed that killing a bear in the mountains would result in a bad storm, which was linked to the belief that bear spirits could affect weather. The matagi would generally hunt bears in spring or from late autumn to early winter, before they hibernated. In mountain regions, bears were hunted by driving them upland to a waiting hunter who would shoot it. Bear hunting expeditions were preceded by rituals, and could last up to two weeks. After killing the bear, the matagi would pray for the bear's soul. Bear hunts in Japan are often termed kuma taiji, meaning [...] "bear conquest". The word taiji itself is often used in Japanese folklore to describe the slaying of monsters and demons.|$|E

50|$|The {{red panda}} (Latin: Ailurus fulgens), {{also known as}} lesser panda or red <b>cat-bear,</b> is a small {{arboreal}} mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China that has been classified as Vulnerable by IUCN as its wild population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals. The population continues to decline and is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression, although red pandas are protected by national laws in their range countries. The Mannheim sports teams have elected the red panda for their favorite athletics mascot to make {{the problem of the}} declining population of this mammal more visible; in addition, the red panda is one of the visitor magnets at the Heidelberg Zoo which is the next larger zoo to Mannheim.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{black bears}} are only legally hunted for sport in Japan and Russia. In Russia, 75-100 black bears are legally {{harvested}} annually, though 500 {{a year are}} reportedly harvested illegally. Russian sport hunting of black bears became legalised in 2004. According to a 2008 article written in The Sun, Russia's Slavic Hunting Club offers four day trips with four guaranteed black bear kills for the sum of £16,000. The article indicated that clients receiving permits for black bear hunts included people from Britain, the United States, Germany, Spain, Poland and Finland.After the introduction of Buddhism in Japan, which prohibited the killing of animals, the Japanese compromised by devising different strategies in hunting bears.

40|$|The {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens), also called red <b>cat-bear</b> or lesser panda is a {{threatened}} species due to human {{destruction of the}} environment the panda is living in. The red panda is the only species in the family Ailuridae, since they can neither {{be in the same}} family as bears or raccoons, but they do belong in the same superfamily as the raccoon. They are classified as carnivores but their diet mainly consists of bamboo. The red panda lives in the foot of the Himalayas in subtropical and temperate forests. They live on an altitude of around 3000 meters close to water and can often be found in winter green trees. The red panda is a solitary animal outside the breeding season but they can live in family groups and in pairs. They can communicate with different kind of sound signals that could sound like birds singing, whistles and high pitch screams. They also have aggressive sounds like growling, hissing and snorting. The panda also communicates by scent marking. They do not spend much time on social behaviours as play, all grooming or aggressive behaviours. The aim {{of this study was to}} see how the red pandas utilise their enclosure, what kind of social behaviour they perform and also if the two of them are connected. To investigate this an ethological study was conducted on three red pandas at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna, Sweden. Enclosure utilisation was studied with scan sampling with an interval of 1 minute and social behaviour with behaviour observation where every social behaviour was noted. Both methods were used at the same time during four hours a day for ten days during 14 - 15 April. The pandas in this study spend most of their time in trees and especially one tree, a tree which at the time of the study had no leafs. The second most used tree was a pine tree which hade pine needles and it was a surprise the pandas did not prefer that tree. They did not perform much social behaviours and the behaviour performed most was scent marking. At two occasions the pandas interacted with each other by body contact and made aggressive sound signals toward each other. It is not possible to see any connection between enclosure utilisation and social behaviour. But it is possible to see a tendency that the social behaviour occurs in trees, which is probably due to the pandas spending so much of their time in in the trees...|$|E
