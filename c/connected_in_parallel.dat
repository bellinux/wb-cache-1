5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write the data from the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E
5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E

25|$|The {{electrode}} layers are wound slightly {{offset from}} each other, {{so that the}} edges of the electrodes can be contacted using a face contacting method “schoopage” at the collateral end faces of the winding. This internal connection is ultimately made by multiple point-shaped contacts {{at the edge of the}} electrode, and can be modeled as a large number of individual capacitors all <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> The many individual resistance (ESR) and inductance (ESL) losses are <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel,</b> so that these total undesirable parasitic losses are minimized.|$|E

25|$|Small or {{low voltage}} {{electrolytic}} capacitors may be safely <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> Large sizes capacitors, especially large sizes and high voltage types should be individually protected against sudden discharge {{of the whole}} bank due to a failed capacitor.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of ceramic multilayer capacitors with mostly alternating layers results in single capacitors <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> This configuration increases capacitance and decreases all losses and parasitic inductances.

50|$|In mechanics, {{two or more}} springs {{are said}} to be in series when they are <b>connected</b> end-to-end, and <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> when they are <b>connected</b> side-by-side; <b>in</b> both cases, so as to act as a single spring.|$|R

25|$|Ceramic {{and film}} {{capacitors}} are {{already out of}} their smaller capacitance values suitable for higher frequencies up to several 100nbsp&MHz. They also have significantly lower parasitic inductance, making them suitable for higher frequency applications, due to their construction with end-surface contacting of the electrodes.

25|$|At 9:15am on 14 February 2007, a {{passenger}} train broke down {{when one of}} the voltage transformers mounted on the train (EMU SP1900) roof exploded. It was suspected that the overheated transformer caused its insulating oil to vaporise, thus causing the explosion.

40|$|Abstract—To {{improve the}} {{dynamics}} {{response of the}} vehicle passive suspension, a two-terminal mass is suggested to <b>connect</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> with the suspension strut. Three performance criteria, tire grip, ride comfort and suspension deflection, are taken into consideration to optimize the suspension parameters. However, the three criteria are conflicting and non-commensurable. For this reason, the Chebyshev goal programming method is applied {{to find the best}} tradeoff among the three objectives. A simulation case is presented to describe the multi-objective optimization procedure. For comparison, the Chebyshev method is also employed to optimize the design of a conventional passive suspension. The effectiveness of the proposed design method has been clearly demonstrated by the result. It is also shown that the suspension with a two-terminal mass <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> has better performance in terms of the three objectives.

25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and parallel circuits or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel,</b> though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (maximum power point trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|E
25|$|A key {{advantage}} of every film capacitor's internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes {{on both ends}} of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths very short. The design behaves like a large number of individual capacitors <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel,</b> thus reducing the internal ohmic losses (ESR) and ESL. The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in low ohmic losses and a low parasitic inductance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E
25|$|After cutting, the binder is burnt {{out of the}} stack. This is {{followed}} by sintering at temperatures between 1,200 and 1,450°C producing the final, mainly crystalline, structure.

Through the metallization, the ends and the inner electrodes are <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> and the capacitor gets its terminals. Finally a 100% measuring of the electrical values will be done and the taping for automated processing in a manufacturing device are performed.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of determination of constants characterising dynamical properties of textiles under compression. Proposed model of a textile specimen is composed of a serially connected three elements: a third degree nonlinear spring, a third degree nonlinear spring <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> a <b>parallel</b> manner to a linear damper and p-th degree nonlinear spring <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> a <b>parallel</b> manner to a linear damper. The model is characterised by the following properties. For small contraction the elastic force is so small that mainly the damper resists the motion. When the contraction becomes large enough a large force is required to overcome the nonlinear elasticity and the spring becomes almost rigid. In this case the motion is maintained mainly due to another serially connected elements. Differential equations describing behaviour of a textile specimen placed at a test set-up are derived and solved. The results are presented graphically. It is found that the electromagnet driving force depends on tested specimen properties and it cannot be assumed a priori...|$|R
30|$|CLM {{does not}} take into account the {{influence}} of distribution grid parameters. Many modeling practices have shown that induction motors have good ability to represent synthesis load, but the ability to describe the reactive power in the transient process after disturbances is poor. Therefore, a dynamic reactive power compensation device is proposed to <b>connect</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> with the static load [27]. Reference [28] points out that the structure of generalized load model including energy storage system needs to increase the size of the energy storage system on the virtual bus of the synthesis load model. Large numbers of energy storage system can be regarded as the dynamic load with negative power. A generalized synthesis load model with the VRB energy storage system is established in this paper, which takes into account the influence of distribution network parameters and reactive power compensation equipment.|$|R
