40|$|Assessing {{the extent}} to which agents or firms face capital-market {{imperfections}} and quantity restrictions on credit is crucial for measuring intertemporal tradeoffs in consumption or the cost of capital for investment. In contrast to standard price-clearing, "full-information" models of loan markets, in models of credit allocation where information is imperfect (which we describe as "information-intensive"). "the interest rate" need not reflect the shadow price of <b>credit</b> in financial <b>intermediation.</b> <b>Credit</b> rationing to some borrowers is likely. In actual markets, many loan contracts are offered, both "full-information" and "information intensive. " Our focus in this paper is on firm heterogeneity in credit markets; we analyze mechanisms by which credit markets sort borrowers in the presence of differing degrees of asymmetric information; we emphasize the potential for credit rationing in equilibrium and the response of credit allocation to borrower-specific shocks. Our approach suggests that external finance will be differentially available to entrepreneurs [...] holding constant their project opportunities [...] according to their internal net worth position. That is, there is an important link for many firms between internal finance and investment spending. We develop a simple general equilibrium model of credit allocation, in which different loan contracts are offered to different types of borrowers. The extent to which different borrowers can obtain credit depends on the distribution of internal finance, aggregate net worth levels, and whether projects are observable. While credit restrictions to some classes of borrowers are a feature of a multiple-contract equilibrium, the severity can vary substantially in response to financial disturbances. We consider shocks to borrowers' net worth. Credit restrictions may occur in response to a deterioration of net-worth positions., A "credit collapse," in which no loans are offered to certain types of borrowers is possible. Investment and financing decisions are not, in general independent. We discuss implications for tax policy and for public policy toward financial institutions. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} four decades we {{witnessed}} to fundamental changes in financial techniques and financial regulation that {{paved the way for the}} development of innovative financial instruments and the establishment of non-bank financial entities. This wave of financial innovation allowed non-bank financial institutions to compete with traditional banks in performing bank-like activities at low costs and in offering a broad range of high-yield investment opportunities. Such changes have gradually transformed the “originate-to-hold" banking model into a “originate-to-distribute" model based on a securitized <b>credit</b> <b>intermediation</b> process that relies upon: securitization techniques; securities financing transactions; mutual funds industry. The securitized <b>credit</b> <b>intermediation</b> process is the backbone of the modern forms of non-bank financial intermediation that “ [...] . take(s) place in an environment where prudential regulatory standards and supervisory oversight are either not applied or are applied to a materially lesser or different degree than is the case for regular banks engaged in similar activities" (Financial Stability Board) simply known as the shadow banking system.

The 1980 s witnessed the greatest crisis in U. S. commercial banking since the Great Depression. Faced with both increased competition from open market sources of <b>credit</b> and nonbank <b>intermediation</b> and a series of adverse shocks to loan portfolios, banks experienced shrinking profits and a growing likelihood of failure. Indeed, the failure rate for banks jumped from an average of 2 per year in the 1970 s to roughly 130 per year in the period between 1982 and 1991. Accompanying the increase in the failure rate was a rise in the number of banks in financial distress. By the end of 1992, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) listed 863 banks with combined assets of $ 464 billion as problem institutions (FDIC 1993, p. 7).

We use a loan-level dataset of Austrian banks to study the characteristics as well as the major driving forces of direct {{cross-border lending}} in CESEE and the CIS. Direct cross-border lending to nonbanks by Austrian banks expanded rapidly over the last few years; the bulk of loans is extended to corporate customers and is denominated in a foreign currency, with the euro taking a prominent position. By means of a series of univariate analyses, we provide support for the relevance of geographic proximity – small and mediumsized banks mainly lend to neighboring countries. Banks’ direct lending also seems to follow nonfinancial FDI by Austrian corporates to CESEE and the CIS. We furthermore analyze the interdependencies between direct (i. e. by Austrian headquarters) and indirect (i. e. by local subsidiaries) cross-border lending and find support for a complementary effect between the two.

However, despite not many academics, legislators and regulators even agree on what "shadow banking" is, this latter does not refer exclusively to the functions of <b>credit</b> <b>intermediation</b> and maturity transformation. This concept also refers to the creation of assets such as digital media of exchange which are designed under the influence of Friedrich Hayek and the Austrian School of Economics. This lack of a uniform definition of "shadow banking" has limited our regulatory efforts on key issues like the private money creation, a source of vulnerability in the financial system that, paradoxically, at the same time could result in an opportunity to renovate European institutions, heirs of the tradition of the Wisselbank and the Bank of England which, during the seventeenth century, faced monetary innovations and led the European monetary revolution that originated the current monetary and regulatory practices implemented around the world...|$|E

Of specific interest is the role of <b>credit</b> <b>intermediation</b> in a crisis and how it is influenced by reforms. I consider three key characteristics of the recent financial crisis that are potentially relevant for policy analysis: First, the crisis was triggered in the financial sector; second, there were spillovers from the financial to the real sector due to credit rationing; third, governments actively intervened in the credit market during the crisis. I construct two dynamic general equilibrium models with financial frictions to address these issues [...] a closed economy model and a monetary union model. I show that permanent structural reforms have positive effects on aggregate output in both the long and the short run. They affect the capital market positively and stimulate <b>credit</b> <b>intermediation.</b> Contrariwise, reforms that are either implemented temporarily or announced to be implemented in the future have negative consequences for output in the short run. Moreover, reforms that are implemented in one country of a currency union have positive short-run effects on both the reforming country and its foreign counterpart. My results also hold if the central bank is constrained by a lower interest rate bound. I also show that reforms have a qualitatively similar impact as a direct intervention in the credit market.

40|$|The years {{leading up}} to the "great recession" were a time of rapid {{innovation}} in the financial industry. This period also saw a fall in interest rates, and a boom in liquidity that accompanied the boom in real activity, especially investment. In this paper we argue that these were not unrelated phenomena. The adoption of new financial products and practices led to a fall in the expected costs of intermediation which in turn engendered the flood of liquidity in the financial sector, lowered interest rate spreads and facilitated the boom in economic activity. When the events of 2007 - 2009 led to a re-evaluation of the effectiveness of these new products, agents revised their expectations regarding the actual efficiency gains available to the financial sector and this led to a withdrawal of liquidity from the financial system, a reversal in interest rates and a bust in real activity. We treat the efficiency of the financial sector as an exogenous process and study the impact of "news shocks" regarding this process. Following the expectations driven business cycle literature, we model the boom and bust cycle in terms of an expected future efficiency gain which is eventually not realized. The build up in liquidity and economic activity in expectation of these efficiency gains is then abruptly reversed when agent's hopes are dashed. The model generates counter-cyclical movements in the spread between lending rates and the risk-free rate which are driven purely by expectations, {{even in the absence of}} any exogenous movement in intermediation costs. externalities; expectations-driven business cycles, <b>intermediation</b> shocks, <b>credit</b> shocks, financial <b>intermediation,</b> financial innovation, news shocks, business cycles. ...|$|R
