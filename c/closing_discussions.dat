60|$|In {{those days}} there existed a dining club called--there was some lost {{allusion to the}} {{exorcism}} of party feeling in its title--the Pentagram Circle. It included Bailey and Dayton and myself, Sir Herbert Thorns, Lord Charles Kindling, Minns the poet, Gerbault the big railway man, Lord Gane, fresh from the settlement of Framboya, and Rumbold, who later became Home Secretary and left us. We were men of all parties and very various experiences, and our object was to discuss {{the welfare of the}} Empire in a disinterested spirit. We dined monthly at the Mermaid in Westminster, and {{for a couple of years}} we kept up an average attendance of ten out of fourteen. The dinner-time was given up to desultory conversation, and it is odd how warm and good the social atmosphere of that little gathering became as time went on; then over the dessert, so soon as the waiters had swept away the crumbs and ceased to fret us, one of us would open with perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes' exposition of some specially prepared question, and after him we would deliver ourselves in turn, each for three or four minutes. When every one present had spoken once talk became general again, and it was rare we emerged upon Hendon Street before midnight. Sometimes, as my house was conveniently near, a knot of men would come home with me and go on talking and smoking in my dining-room until two or three. We had Fred Neal, that wild Irish journalist, among us towards the end, and his stupendous flow of words materially prolonged our <b>closing</b> <b>discussions</b> and made our continuance impossible.|$|E
40|$|Unlike usual {{approaches}} to military expenditures that concentrate on foreign affairs, this paper analyzes a strategic structure for a dictatorial government to plan military expenditures concenrrating on domestic af-fairs. Then we find two dilemmas: The dictatorial government may spend less on military equipment {{if they have}} some destructive devices and then citizens may have relatively larger disposable incomes in exchange for mil-itary oppressions; and the dictatorial government increases military ex-penditures as their economy grows to sap revolutionary interests. Based on these results, I also make some <b>closing</b> <b>discussions.</b> ˚I am grateful to Peter Morgan for insightful comments through discussions. ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{concluding}} chapter {{we offer}} some {{reflections on the}} conduct of our research that we believe have relevance across most qualitative studies that involve young people, particularly young people from diverse social and cultural groups. In {{the case of the}} Life Activity Project and related studies, we also needed to attend to the added sensitivity associated with researching young people’s meanings of health and, inevitably, their feelings and thoughts about their bodies and body weight. What follows are some stories, dilemmas and reflections ‘from the field’. The contributors to the book share issues around: recruiting participants to the research process and maintaining participants’ involvement; developing respectful relationships; and, the dilemmas of researching Others and representing the their voices. These reflections come from fieldnotes, thesis manuscripts and contributors’ input into our <b>closing</b> <b>discussions</b> on methodological issues.

40|$|A US National Science Foundation-funded {{workshop}} occurred 17 – 19 May 2013 at the University of Oklahoma {{to stimulate}} research using continental scientific drilling to explore earth's sedimentary, paleobiological and biogeochemical record. Participants submitted 3 -page "pre-proposals" to highlight projects that envisioned using drill-core studies to address scientific issues in paleobiology, paleoclimatology, stratigraphy and biogeochemistry, {{and to identify}} locations where key questions can best be addressed. The workshop was also intended to encourage US scientists {{to take advantage of}} the exceptional capacity of unweathered, continuous core records to answer important questions in the history of earth's sedimentary, biogeochemical and paleobiologic systems. Introductory talks on drilling and coring methods, plus best practices in core handling and curation, opened the workshop to enable all to understand the opportunities and challenges presented by scientific drilling. Participants worked in thematic breakout sessions to consider questions to be addressed using drill cores related to glacial–interglacial and icehouse–greenhouse transitions, records of evolutionary events and extinctions, records of major biogeochemical events in the oceans, reorganization of earth's atmosphere, Lagerstätte and exceptional fossil biota, records of vegetation–landscape change, and special sampling requirements, contamination, and coring tool concerns for paleobiology, geochemistry, geochronology, and stratigraphy–sedimentology studies. <b>Closing</b> <b>discussions</b> at the workshop focused on the role drilling can play in studying overarching science questions about the evolution of the earth system. The key theme, holding the most impact in terms of societal relevance, is understanding how climate transitions have driven biotic change, and the role of pristine, stratigraphically continuous cores in advancing our understanding of this linkage. Scientific drilling, and particularly drilling applied to continental targets, provides unique opportunities to obtain continuous and unaltered material for increasingly sophisticated analyses, tapping the entire geologic record (extending through the Archean), and probing the full dynamic range of climate change and its impact on biotic history...|$|E
