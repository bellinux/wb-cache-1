In 1946, American banker John C. Biggins of the Flatbush National Bank of Brooklyn invented the first bank-issued credit card.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{government}} debt increases {{as a result}} of government spending, trade deficits, and unpaid credit, and decreases from tax or other receipts, both of which fluctuate {{during the course of a}} fiscal year. In practice, Treasury securities are not issued or redeemed on a day-by-day basis, and may also be issued or redeemed as part of the federal government's macroeconomic monetary management operations. The aggregate, gross amount that Treasury <b>can</b> <b>borrow</b> is limited by the United States debt ceiling.|$|E

The Constitution also grants Congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds, and this power of the purse is one of Congress's primary checks on the executive branch.

25|$|In addition, the IMF negotiates {{conditions}} on lending and loans under their policy of conditionality, {{which was established}} in the 1950s. Low-income countries <b>can</b> <b>borrow</b> on concessional terms, which means there is a period of time with no interest rates, through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Nonconcessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The IMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs.|$|E
500|$|The book often quotes and {{alludes to}} Walden, {{although}} Dillard does not explicitly state {{her interest in}} Thoreau's work. [...] Critic Donna Mendelson notes that Thoreau's [...] "presence is so potent in her book that Dillard <b>can</b> <b>borrow</b> from [...] both straightforwardly and also humorously." [...] Although the two works are often compared, Pilgrim does not comment upon the social world as Walden does; rather, it is completely rooted in observations of the natural world. [...] Unlike Thoreau, Dillard does not make connections between the history of social and natural aspects, nor does she believe in an ordered universe. Whereas Thoreau refers to the machine-like universe, in which the creator is akin to a master watchmaker, Dillard recognizes the imperfection of creation, in which [...] "something is everywhere and always amiss".|$|E

When {{the rest of}} the office thinks so as well, they must {{decide whether or not to}} tell Angela. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons—not everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam does not think it is anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans—first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not have room to invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she <b>can</b> <b>borrow</b> the plans for the dream wedding Pam never got to have, before mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls. Pam is sorely tempted to spill the beans about Robert's sexuality, but ends up smiling sweetly and wishing Angela [...] "a very happy wedding".|$|E

2500|$|A {{credit card}} is a payment card issued to users ({{cardholder}}s) {{to enable the}} cardholder to pay a merchant {{for goods and services}} based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts so paid plus the other agreed charges. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder <b>can</b> <b>borrow</b> money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance. [...] In other words, credit cards combine payment services with extensions of credit. [...] Complex fee structures in the credit card industry may limit customers' ability to comparison shop, help ensure that the industry is not price-competitive and help maximize industry profits. [...] Because of this, legislatures have regulated credit card fees.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} example {{describes the}} short sale of a security. To profit from {{a decrease in the}} price of a security, a short seller <b>can</b> <b>borrow</b> the security and sell it expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future. [...] When the seller decides that the time is right (or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys equivalent securities and returns them to the lender. [...] The process relies {{on the fact that the}} securities (or the other assets being sold short) are fungible; the term [...] "borrowing" [...] is therefore used in the sense of borrowing cash, where different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender (as opposed to borrowing a car, where the same car must be returned).|$|E
