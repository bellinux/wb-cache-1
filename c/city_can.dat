5|$|The {{complexity}} of an appropriation {{depends upon the}} city council's preferences; real-world appropriations can list hundreds of line item amounts. An appropriation is the legal authority for spending given by the city council to the various agencies of the city government. In the example above, the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> {{spend as much as}} $34 million, but smaller appropriation limits have also been established for individual programs and departments.|$|E
5|$|The {{name of the}} <b>city</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced}} to Mer, an ancient storm deity of {{northern}} Mesopotamia and Syria who was considered the patron deity of the city, Georges Dossin noted that {{the name of the}} city was spelled identically like the name of the storm god and concluded that Mari was named after him.|$|E
5|$|A <b>city</b> <b>can</b> {{be created}} from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has}} a {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Davenport {{has several}} neighborhoods {{dating back to}} the 1840s. The {{original}} city plot was around current day Ripley and 5th Streets, where Antoine Le Claire had built his house. The <b>city</b> <b>can</b> be divided into five areas: downtown, central, east end, near north and northwest, and west end. Many architectural designs are found throughout the city including Victorian, Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, and others. Many of the original neighborhoods were inhabited by German settlers.|$|E
5|$|Denver {{lies within}} the semi-arid, {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification BSk). It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest {{amount of precipitation}} spread throughout the year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, {{at the foot of}} the Rocky Mountains, Denver, like all cities along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, is subject to sudden changes in weather. Contrary to the popular belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> actually expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly cloudy days, and 120 cloudy days each year.|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} in the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back to}} the second half of the eighteenth century, when the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. As a patron of the arts and sciences, Branicki encouraged numerous artists and scientists to settle in Białystok to take advantage of Branicki's patronage. In 1745 Branicki established Poland's first military college, the School of Civil and Military Engineering, in the city.|$|E

5|$|In a 1997 {{restaurant}} listing {{published by}} the English-language daily The Jakarta Post, which largely caters to expatriates and middle class Indonesians, at least 80 locations within the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> be considered Chinese out of the 10-page list. Additionally, major hotels generally operate one or two Chinese restaurants, and many more {{can be found in}} large shopping centers. Upscale Chinese restaurants in Jakarta, where the urban character of the ethnic Chinese is well established, can be found serving delicacies such as shark fin soup and bird's nest soup. Food considered to have healing properties, including ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine, are in high demand.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} {{is based}} on a fairly dense network of tram and bus routes operated by a municipal company, supplemented by a number of private minibus operators. Local trains connect some of the suburbs. The bulk of the city's historic area {{has been turned into a}} pedestrian zone with rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages; however, the tramlines run within a three-block radius (pictured). The historic means of transportation in the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> be examined at the Museum of Municipal Engineering in the Kazimierz district, with many old trams, cars and buses.|$|E
5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in late fall, early winter, and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake <b>City</b> <b>can</b> be attributed to the lake effect.|$|E

5|$|Fallout 3 {{takes place}} in the year 2277, and within the region that covers most of the ruined city of Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and parts of Maryland. The game's {{landscape}} includes war-ravaged variants of numerous real-life landmarks such as the White House, the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Arlington National Cemetery and the Washington Monument, with a small number of settlements dotted around the Capital Wastelands that consist of descendants of survivors from the Great War, including one that surrounds an unexploded bomb, another consisting primarily of ghoul inhabitants, and another formed within the hulking remains of an aircraft carrier. While the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> be explored, much of the interior zones are cut off by giant rubble over many of the roads leading in, meaning that access can only be achieved by using the city's former underground metro tunnels (loosely based on the real-life Washington Metro).|$|E
5|$|Space {{and life}} in the new capital were {{strictly}} regimented: residential areas were separated from the markets, and the military was given its own cantonments, separated from the ordinary populace and each {{the home of a}} specific ethnic contingent of the army (e.g. the Turks, Faraghina, Maghariba and Shakiriyya regiments). The city was dominated by its mosques (most famous among which is the Great Mosque of Samarra built by Caliph al-Mutawakkil in 848–852) and palaces, built in grand style by both the caliphs and their senior commanders, who were given extensive properties to develop. Unlike Baghdad, however, the new capital was an entirely artificial creation. Poorly sited in terms of water supply and river communications, its existence was determined solely by the presence of the caliphal court, and when the capital returned to Baghdad, sixty years later, Samarra was rapidly abandoned. Due to this fact, the ruins of the Abbasid capital are still present on site, and the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> be mapped with great accuracy by modern archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E

5|$|The {{streets in}} Yarralumla are named after Australian {{governors}} and botanists. Most {{of the older}} streets in the suburb are laid out on an approximately rectangular grid with some curved sections, while the more hilly eastern end of the suburb, including the embassy district, is set out with contour-guided roads. Major roads in Yarralumla include Banks Street, Novar Street and Hopetoun Circuit in a north-south direction and Schlich Street, Loftus Street and Weston Street running east-west. Being a dormitory suburb, there are no major through roads. Access {{to the rest of}} the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> be made from Adelaide Avenue, Commonwealth Avenue, Lady Denman Drive and Cotter Road, all of which run along the borders of the suburb. From these roads, entry to the suburb can be gained by turning into roads such as Coronation Drive, Hopetoun Circuit and Novar Street.|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{industry}} in Enugu, {{managed by the}} Enugu State Tourism Board (ESTB), is small; however, the state government recognises a variety of historic and recreational sites. These sites include places like the Udi Hills, from which the majority of Enugu <b>city</b> <b>can</b> be viewed. The Polo amusement park is a funfair that is among {{the first generation of}} public parks in the city; other parks in the city include the Murtala Muhammed Park. Enugu's former coal mines, Onyeama and Okpara, are open to public visits. Some other spots include: The Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Sculptural Garden and Art Gallery, the Eastern Region Parliamentary Building, the Old Government Lodge, and Enugu Golf course. Enugu Zoo is another attraction in the city. It is divided into the botanical garden and the zoological section. A National Museum is located near Enugu at its north, although it receives few visitors. It is managed by National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM). Other galleries include the Bona Gallery.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson, and consists of shots of the duo around London. At {{the beginning of the}} video, noises from the <b>city</b> <b>can</b> be heard, a camera passes Lowe on the street, and focuses on two vintage dolls in a shop window. Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city's different sub-cultures; the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe, who walk through an empty Wentworth Street in Petticoat Lane Market. They stand in front of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind.|$|E
