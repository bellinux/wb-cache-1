50|$|These {{names were}} used for storms that formed in the east Pacific Ocean this season. It is the same list used in the 1968 season. No names were retired, so this list was used again in the 1976 season.The central Pacific used names and numbers from the west Pacific's typhoon list. Two names—June and Ruby—were required. Of the eleven {{hurricane}} seasons from 1970-81 where <b>central</b> Pacific <b>cyclones</b> were named using the west Pacific list, {{this is the first}} and only one to use multiple names.|$|R
5|$|The first storm {{formed on}} June 1 {{and the final}} storm crossed into the western Pacific on December 6, thus ending the season. There were 24 {{cyclones}} in both the eastern and central Pacific, including 5 unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific; 8 peaked at tropical storm intensity, while 10 reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category3 intensity or higher on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, including <b>central</b> Pacific <b>cyclones</b> Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the Western Pacific.|$|R
50|$|The 2006 <b>Central</b> Pacific <b>cyclone,</b> {{also known}} as 91C.INVEST or Storm 91C, was an unusual weather event of 2006. Forming on October 30, from a {{mid-latitude}} cyclone in the north Pacific mid-latitudes, it moved over waters warmer than normal. The system acquired some features more typical of subtropical or even tropical cyclones. However, as it neared western North America it fell apart. Moisture from its remains then caused substantial rainfall in British Columbia. The exact status and nature of this weather event is unknown, with meteorologists and weather agencies having differing opinions.|$|R

50|$|I. The Gauthier Cyclone {{formed on}} 3 May well {{southeast}} of the Big Island and moved west-northwestward. It passed {{to the south of}} Hawaii, crossed the date line, and turned to the northeast. The storm dissipated in the Bering Sea on 10 May. This extremely rare May <b>central</b> Pacific tropical <b>cyclone</b> occurred during the normally storm-free month of May.|$|R
50|$|An {{organized}} {{region of}} convection within the Intertropical Convergence Zone {{developed into a}} tropical depression at 03:00 UTC on July 5 while located roughly 700 mi (1,125 km) south-southeast of Johnston Atoll, becoming the farthest-south-forming <b>central</b> Pacific tropical <b>cyclone</b> since 1992's Tropical Storm Hali. Steered westward, the depression failed to intensify due to its quick forward motion despite a seemingly favorable environment, and it quickly dissipated at 00:00 UTC on July 6.|$|R
5|$|The 1997 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was fairly active, {{due to the}} strong El Niño that was occurring at the time. El Niño causes wind shear to be reduced and water temperatures to increase, resulting in conditions more conductive for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific. There were 24 cyclones in total, including five unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific (east of 140°W). Of these, eight peaked at tropical storm intensity, while ten reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, including <b>central</b> Pacific <b>cyclones</b> Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the western Pacific. The first hurricane {{of the year was}} Hurricane Dolores, and the first major hurricane was Hurricane Enrique. Most months during the year had several storms, but no records were set for storms in any particular month.|$|R
500|$|This {{island state}} {{frequently}} sees rainfall from {{the remains of}} former eastern and <b>central</b> Pacific tropical <b>cyclones.</b> However, despite Hawaii's location in the subtropics, direct impacts by tropical cyclones are infrequent due to the protective influence of the Central Pacific Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT), which normally dissipates systems approaching Hawaii.

5000|$|Hurricane Iniki ( [...] Hawaiian: iniki meaning [...] "strong and {{piercing}} wind") was {{the most}} powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. state of Hawaii in recorded history. Forming on September 5, 1992, during the strong 1990-95 El Niño, Iniki was one of eleven <b>Central</b> Pacific tropical <b>cyclones</b> during that season. It attained tropical storm status on September 8 and further intensified into a hurricane the next day. After turning north, Iniki struck the island of Kauai on September 11 at peak intensity; it had winds of 145 mph and reached Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. It was the first hurricane to hit the state since Hurricane Iwa in the 1982 season, and the first major hurricane since Hurricane Dot in 1959. Iniki dissipated on September 13 about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska.|$|R
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of a <b>central</b> Pacific <b>cyclone,</b> {{characterized}} by a 48 -h interval of rapid fluctuation in its intensity, is examined. The cyclone of interest underwent a period of explosive cyclogenesis from 1200 UTC 4 November to 1200 UTC 5 November 1986, followed 12 h later by a period of unusually rapid decay. Output from a numerical simulation of this event, run using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU–NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM 5), is used to perform a piecewise potential vorticity (PV) inversion in order to diagnose the {{life cycle of}} this unusual cyclone. The analysis reveals that the presence of lower-tropospheric frontogenetic forcing in an environment char-acterized by reduced static stability (as measured by high values of the K index) produced a burst of heavy precipitation during the development stage of the cyclone’s life cycle. The associated latent heat release produced a substantial diabatic PV anomaly in the middle troposphere that was, in turn, responsible {{for the majority of the}} lower-tropospheric height falls associated with the explosive cyclogenesis. Subsequent height rises during the rapid cyclolysis stage resulted from the northward migration of the surface cyclone into a perturbation geopotential ridge associated with a negative tropopause-level PV anomaly. This feature devel-oped rapidly in response to the southeastward migration of a preexisting, upstream negative PV anomaly an...|$|R
50|$|On August 21, the NHC {{noted that}} {{an area of}} low {{pressure}} could form well south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California over subsequent days. An area of disturbed weather developed a few hours later, slowly organizing into a tropical depression by 21:00 UTC on August 26. With an impressive spiral band and improved inner core, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Madeline six hours later. Steered northwestward into the <b>central</b> Pacific, the <b>cyclone</b> initially struggled with moderate wind shear; however, an eye feature developed within the storm's central dense overcast by 09:00 UTC on August 29, prompting an upgrade to hurricane intensity. Madeline began a period of rapid intensification thereafter, and with a cloud-filled eye surrounded by a ring of deep convection, was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane by 21:00 UTC before ultimately peaking as a 130 mph (215 km/h) Category 4 hurricane early the next day.|$|R

5000|$|The 2016 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} time since 2011 in which no tropical cyclones occurred in May, and the first time since 2007 that no named storms formed in the month of June. It was another active season that produced a total of 22 named storms, 13 hurricanes and six major hurricanes. Although the season was very active, it was not as active as the previous two seasons, featuring sporadic periods of inactivity, particularly at the beginning and {{towards the end of the}} season. It officially started on May 15 in the East Pacific Ocean, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they both ended on November 30.

40|$|Copyright Â© 2011 American Geophysical UnionThe {{perennial}} (September) Arctic sea {{ice cover}} exhibits large interannual variability, with changes of {{over a million}} square kilometers {{from one year to}} the next. Here we explore the role of changes in Arctic cyclone activity, and related factors, in driving these pronounced year-to-year changes in perennial sea ice cover. Strong relationships are revealed between the September sea ice changes and the number of cyclones in the preceding late spring and early summer. In particular, fewer <b>cyclones</b> over the <b>central</b> Arctic Ocean during the months of May, June, and July appear to favor a low sea ice area {{at the end of the}} melt season. Years with large losses of sea ice are characterized by abnormal cyclone distributions and tracks: they lack the normal maximum in cyclone activity over the central Arctic Ocean, and cyclones that track from Eurasia into the central Arctic are largely absent. Fewer storms are associated with above-average mean sea level pressure, strengthened anticyclonic winds, an intensification of the transpolar drift stream, and reduced cloud cover, all of which favor ice melt. It is also shown that a strengthening of the <b>central</b> Arctic <b>cyclone</b> maximum helps preserve the ice cover, although the association is weaker than that between low cyclone activity and reduced sea ice. The results suggest that changes in cyclone occurrence during late spring and early summer have preconditioning effects on the sea ice cover and exert a strong influence on the amount of sea ice that survives the melt season...|$|R
5|$|After {{changing}} {{little in}} intensity {{for much of}} 6 November, Gay strengthened as the ridge to its north intensified and the previous restrictions to its outflow diminished. The storm moved due west through a small fetch of warmer waters, fueling the process of intensification over the next 42hours. Based on estimates provided {{through the use of}} the Dvorak technique, the JTWC assessed Gay to have attained its peak intensity as a Category5-equivalent cyclone with winds of 260km/h (160mph) early on November8. Around this time, the IMD estimated that the storm had three-minute sustained winds of 240km/h (145mph), classifying Gay as a modern-day Super Cyclonic Storm. Additionally, the agency estimated the <b>cyclone's</b> <b>central</b> pressure to have decreased to 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Around 1800UTC, Gay made landfall over a sparsely populated area near Kavali, India, in Andhra Pradesh. Upon coming ashore, the storm's eye was about 20km (12mi) wide, with gale-force winds within 95km (60mi) of the center. Now over land, Gay no longer had access to warm waters, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm less than 12hours after landfall. The storm continued to deteriorate while moving across India, before it completely dissipated over Maharashtra on 10 November.|$|R

Although {{little is known}} about the storm's genesis because of sparse reports and infrequent weather satellite images, the disturbance is thought to have organised into a tropical low on 19 December as it tracked slowly southwestward into the Coral Sea. According to the Bureau of Meteorology's (BoM) Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Brisbane, the system reached tropical cyclone status around 06:00 UTC on 20 December, less than [...] southwest of Honiara.

40|$|Numerous late Holocene {{records of}} {{tropical}} cyclones {{have been collected}} from tropical northern Australia. They are {{in the form of}} multiple shore parallel sedimentary ridges deposited over the past 6, 000 years and an 800 year long annual resolution oxygen isotope record from a calcium carbonate cave stalagmite. The sedimentary ridges are composed of coral fragments, or shell and sand or pure sand. Numerical models relating surge height and tropical <b>cyclone</b> <b>central</b> pressure were used to determine the intensity of the tropical cyclone responsible for deposition of the ridges at each site. The results suggest that in the majority of cases these features were deposited by very high magnitude events. The results suggest that extrapolation from short instrumental and historical records, which is the method commonly used to assess risk from this hazard, substantially underestimate the risk from this hazard. This is confirmed for the Cairns region by the 800 year long high resolution isotope record which suggests that tropical cyclone activity in northeast Queensland has been in a phase of quiescence since before European settlement of the region in approximately AD 1870. Comparisons between the short and long-term records suggest that non-stationarity may be an inherent feature of the long-term natural variability of tropical cyclones in this region...|$|R
50|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed on September 1 {{just north of}} South America. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming a hurricane before hitting the Leeward Islands on September 2.

It made landfall, on the Florida peninsula, soon afterwards and began moving slowly north before drifting back offshore where it strengthened. On the morning of September 10 it began moving east and made landfall north of Tampa with maximum sustained winds of 105 mi/h km/h. The center passed over St. Augustine on September 11. When it reached the western Atlantic it became a hurricane again and caused several ships to be wrecked along the north-east coast of Florida, between Cape Canaveral and Amelia Island.

But, southerly shear, introduced by a large upper-level trough, caused Lana to become slightly disorganized on July 31. Despite this, Lana reached its peak intensity of 65 mph early on August 1, and slowly weakened to become a very disorganized, yet still fairly strong tropical storm, maintaining maximum winds of 50 mph {{for the next couple of}} days.
