5|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, {{curvilinear}} perspective {{found its way into}} paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a <b>convex</b> <b>mirror</b> with reflections {{of the people in the}} scene, while Parmigianino's Self-portrait in a <b>Convex</b> <b>Mirror,</b> c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.|$|E
25|$|A concave-convex cavity has one <b>convex</b> <b>mirror</b> with a {{negative}} radius of curvature.

25|$|Depictions of {{the five}} {{traditional}} senses as allegory became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among Dutch and Flemish Baroque painters. A typical example is Gérard de Lairesse's Allegory of the Five Senses (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a <b>convex</b> <b>mirror,</b> hearing is the cupid-like boy with a triangle, smell {{is represented by the}} girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and touch is represented by the woman holding the bird.|$|E

40|$|<b>Convex</b> {{rearview}} <b>mirrors</b> {{are currently}} prohibited in the U. S. {{as original equipment}} on passenger cars except for the exterior, passenger-side position. One of the primary reasons for this restriction is a concern that <b>convex</b> <b>mirrors</b> may cause drivers to overestimate the distances to following vehicles and therefore make unsafe maneuvers. There is {{a considerable amount of}} empirical evidence that <b>convex</b> <b>mirrors</b> do cause overestimation, but the effect is not theoretically well understood. No currently available model successfully predicts the magnitude of the distance overestimation. However, plausible theoretical considerations can be used to generate a previously untested prediction that, even if only qualitatively accurate, would be of practical significance: Eye-to-mirror distance should have a substantial effect on the magnitude of overestimation caused by <b>convex</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Specifically, longer eye-to-mirror distances (as are typical for passenger-side mirrors) should lead to more overestimation than shorter distances (as are typical for driver-side mirrors). This prediction was tested in a field experiment in which flat and <b>convex</b> <b>mirrors</b> were used on a car in both the driver-side and passenger-side exterior rearview mirror positions. Longer eye-to-mirror distance did lead to greater overestimation, although—as in previous studies—in both mirror positions the degree of overestimation was less than predicted by quantitative modeling. These results suggest that, to the extent that overestimation of distances to following vehicles is a concern for the use of <b>convex</b> rearview <b>mirrors,</b> that concern is less strong for the driver-side exterior position (which is relatively near to the driver’s eyes) than for passenger-side exterior position (which is relatively far from the driver’s eyes) ...|$|R
50|$|A concave mirror, or {{converging}} mirror, has a {{reflecting surface}} that bulges inward (away from the incident light). Concave mirrors reflect light inward to one focal point.They {{are used to}} focus light. Unlike <b>convex</b> <b>mirrors,</b> concave mirrors show different image types depending on {{the distance between the}} object and the mirror.|$|R
25|$|A {{diverging}} lens (one that is thicker {{at the edges}} than the middle) or a <b>convex</b> <b>mirror</b> forms a virtual image. Such an image is so reduced in size {{when compared to the}} original object. A converging lens (one that is thicker in the middle than at the edges) or a concave mirror is also capable of producing a virtual image if the object is within the focal length. Such an image will be magnified. In contrast, an object placed in front of a converging lens or concave mirror at a position beyond the focal length produces a real image. Such an image may be magnified or reduced depending on the position of the object.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The <b>convex</b> <b>mirror</b> at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands.|$|E

50|$|Diverging (negative) {{lenses and}} <b>convex</b> <b>mirrors</b> do not focus a {{collimated}} beam to a point. Instead, {{the focus is}} the point from which the light appears to be emanating, after it travels through the lens or reflects from the <b>mirror.</b> A <b>convex</b> parabolic <b>mirror</b> will reflect a beam of collimated light to make it appear as if it were radiating from the focal point, or conversely, reflect rays directed toward the focus as a collimated beam. A <b>convex</b> elliptical <b>mirror</b> will reflect light directed towards one focus as if it were radiating from the other focus, both of which are behind the <b>mirror.</b> A <b>convex</b> hyperbolic <b>mirror</b> will reflect rays emanating from the focal point {{in front of the mirror}} as if they were emanating from the focal point behind the mirror. Conversely, it can focus rays directed at the focal point that is behind the mirror towards the focal point that is in front of the mirror as in a Cassegrain telescope.|$|R
500|$|Escher's work is inescapably mathematical. This {{has caused}} a {{disconnect}} between his full-on popular fame {{and the lack of}} esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques is respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. Movements such as conceptual art have to a degree reversed the art world's attitude to intellectuality and lyricism, but this did not rehabilitate Escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public. Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes: Parmigianino (1503–1540) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 Self-portrait in a <b>Convex</b> <b>Mirror,</b> depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while William Hogarth's 1754 Satire on False Perspective, foreshadows Escher's playful exploration of errors in perspective. Another early artistic forerunner is Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–1778), whose dark [...] "fantastical" [...] prints such as The Drawbridge in his Carceri ("Prisons") sequence depict perspectives into complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures. Only with 20th century movements such as Cubism, De Stijl, Dadaism and Surrealism did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints. However, while Escher had much in common with, for example, Magritte's surrealism, he did not make contact with any of these movements.|$|E

2500|$|Parabolic mirrors were {{described}} and studied in classical antiquity by the mathematician Diocles {{in his work}} On Burning Mirrors. Ptolemy conducted a number of experiments with curved polished iron mirrors, and discussed plane, convex spherical, and concave spherical mirrors in his Optics. [...] Parabolic mirrors were also described by the physicist Ibn Sahl in the 10th century, and Ibn al-Haytham discussed concave and convex mirrors in both cylindrical and spherical geometries, carried {{out a number of}} experiments with mirrors, and solved the problem of finding the point on a <b>convex</b> <b>mirror</b> at which a ray coming from one point is reflected to another point. By the 11th century, clear glass mirrors were being produced in Moorish Spain.|$|E
2500|$|The small medallions {{set into}} {{the frame of the}} <b>convex</b> <b>mirror</b> {{at the back of the}} room show tiny scenes from the Passion of Christ and may {{represent}} God's promise of salvation for the figures reflected on the mirror's convex surface. Furthering the Memorial theory, all the scenes on the wife's side are of Christ's death and resurrection. Those on the husband's side concern Christ's life. The mirror itself may represent the eye of God observing the vows of the wedding. [...] A spotless mirror was also an established symbol of Mary, referring to the Holy Virgin's immaculate conception and purity. The mirror reflects two figures in the doorway, one of whom may be the painter himself. [...] In Panofsky's controversial view, the figures are shown to prove that the two witnesses required to make a wedding legal were present, and Van Eyck's signature on the wall acts as some form of actual documentation of an event at which he was himself present.|$|E

There seems to be no need to use smaller values for the radius of the mirror than 1000 mm.

There are indications that the position of about 20 ° out of the line of sight straight ahead might be optimal. Whether this also holds for <b>convex</b> <b>mirrors</b> is not investigated. An experiment is described in which a driver must decide whether he can overtake a car in front of him, while a car behind him is approaching. This is done with several speeds of the car behind and with different curvatures of the side mirrors. Especially if the radius of curvature is not less than 1200 mm, no serious effects on driver behavior is observed. The instrumented car used in the studies is briefly described.
