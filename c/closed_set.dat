5|$|As a {{complete}} normed space, Hilbert spaces are by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a <b>closed</b> <b>set</b> in {{a complete}} metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced in February 2006 {{in central}} Mumbai. Art direction was handled by Aradhana Seth, and the costumes {{were designed by}} Aki Narula. Akhtar chose K. U. Mohanan to handle the cinematography after having been impressed by his work in documentaries and commercials. This was Mohanan's first Hindi film as a film cinematographer. To give an authentic feel to the film, scenes were shot on a <b>closed</b> <b>set</b> in actual chawls in real locations. The film was also shot at Film City and Yash Raj Studios. Some filming was done in Paris in March over a three-day schedule.|$|E
5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach spaces {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a <b>closed</b> <b>set.</b> In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E

5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a <b>closed</b> <b>set,</b> there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} Turkey in March 2012, with filming {{reported}} to be continuing until 6 May. Production was expected to take three months in the country. Adana stands in for the outskirts of Istanbul in the film. A group of Turkish teenagers infiltrated a <b>closed</b> <b>set</b> in a railway sidings in Adana to film rehearsals of a fight scene {{on top of a}} train before being caught by security. The train scene depicted in trailers showed the Varda Viaduct outside Adana. Bond stunt double Andy Lister dived backwards off the 300-foot drop for the scene. A crane was set up on a train carriage to hold a safety line. Parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Grand Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—were closed for filming in April. Store owners in the affected areas were reportedly allowed to open their shops, but were not allowed to conduct business, instead being paid TRY750 ($418) per day as compensation. Production faced criticism for allegedly damaging buildings while filming a motorcycle chase across rooftops in the city. Michael G. Wilson denied these claims, pointing out that the film crew had removed sections of rooftops before filming began and replaced them with replicas {{for the duration of the}} shoot; when filming finished, the original rooftops would be restored. The production team negotiated with 613 part owners of the Calis Beach in Fethiye, to film along the coastline.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} was {{for most of}} the filming a <b>closed</b> <b>set,</b> with great measures taken to maintain the secrecy of the plot. Scripts were numbered and lists kept of who received each copy. The press was told nothing about the story and only a few production stills were allowed to be published. During construction one young visitor to a soundstage stole a copy of blueprints for the bridge set and sold duplicates of them to any fans who would pay him $75; Paramount reported the matter to the FBI, who turned the case over to the Los Angeles Police Department. The police arrested, convicted, and fined the culprit $750; it was later discovered that the stolen plans were not the final copies. Visitor's badges were created to keep track of guests, and due to the limited number were constantly checked out; among the visitors included friends of the cast and crew, the press, fan leaders, and actors such as Clint Eastwood, Tony Curtis, Robin Williams, and Mel Brooks. Security swept cars leaving the lots for stolen items; even the principal actors were not spared from this inconvenience.|$|E

50|$|In {{some cases}} it is more {{convenient}} to use a base for the <b>closed</b> <b>sets</b> rather than the open ones.

This topology will be the finest completely regular topology on X coarser than the original one.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this paper, we {{continue}} {{the study of}} generalized <b>closed</b> <b>sets</b> in a topological space. In particular, we study the question when some classes of generalized <b>closed</b> <b>sets</b> coincide. A new class of spaces, the class of sg-submaximal spaces, is also introduced. Characterizations of extremally disconnected spaces and sg-submaximal spaces are established via various kinds of generalized <b>closed</b> <b>sets.</b> 1. I~vTR~DUCTI~N During {{the last few years}} the study of generalized <b>closed</b> <b>sets</b> has found consid-erable interest among general topologists. One reason is these objects are natural generalizations of <b>closed</b> <b>sets.</b> More importantly, generalized <b>closed</b> <b>sets</b> suggest some new separation axioms which {{have been found to be}} very useful in the study of certain objects of digital topology, for example, the digital line (see e. g. [S]). In [5], Dontchev summarized in a diagram the fundamental relationships between the various types of generalized <b>closed</b> <b>sets.</b> Concerning this diagram, he also posed two questions which have been answered by Cao, Ganster and Reilly in [4]. In the present paper, we take another look at Dontchev’s diagram. In doing so, we are able to characterize extremally disconnected spaces via generalized <b>closed</b> <b>sets.</b> Moreover, we introduce the notion of sg-submaximal spaces and investigate this class of spaces in terms of the Hewitt decomposition of a topological space. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classi&ation. 54 A 05, 54 F 65, 54 GO 5.
