40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} work {{it has been}} shown that FEA {{software}} like ANSYS may play an important role in predicting cast defect before the actual casting. Transient thermal analysis and Couple-Field analysis in ANSYS can predict temperature distribution and thermal stress distribution in the casting after solidification very accurately. This fact has been proved by validating a transient thermal analysis which has been published in a reputed journal. After validating the thermal analysis, work has been extended to Couple-Field Analysis for thermal stress and shrinkage. After doing Couple-field analysis on sand mold, few modifications have been simulated and tested whether they are better than the configuration considered in the base paper. As first modification sand has been replaced by mullite and it has been seen that the mold shrinkage is less but the <b>cast</b> <b>shrinkage</b> is more.

Modifying and designing the feeding system {{has become more}} convenient {{with the help of}} the casting software, InteCAST. A common method of designing a feeding system is to first design the initial systems, run simulations with casting software, analyze the feedback, and then redesign.

The term shrinkage cracks, however, encompasses a broad suite of sedimentary structures having various origins. Shrinkage cracks can form {{not only at}} the sediment-air interface by desiccation processes but also at the sediment-water interface or substratally by synaeresis processes. Shrinkage cracks are induced in muddy sediments by variations in the salinity of the depositing medium, sediment compaction, and temperature in the case of some desiccation mudcracks. Crack morphology is influenced by the interplay of numerous factors, such as sedimem composition, bed thickness, and bed surface configuration. Factors controlling desiccation mudcracks also include the rate of initial drying, total exposure time, depth of the groundwater table, and direction of surface drainage. Unfortunately, because of the complex interplay of these factors, no single feature of any shrinkage crack is necessarily useful in differentiating between a desiccation or synaeresis origin. Confidence in interpreting subaerial exposure from shrinkage cracks, therefore, depends on finding other associated sedimentary structures diagnostic of exposure...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} is to put forward a proposal to divide the internal shrinkage defects into the dimensional levels according to defects of certain size and shape. The paper presents the terminology {{used to describe the}} internal shrinkage defects in the casting and shows its flaws. These include the lack of well-defined threshold size values and shape of defects. It is shown that in describing defects their sizes and shape are defined qualitatively rather than quantitatively. And it is noted that division of defects into pores and shells is based on the morphological characters. The paper notes that a distinct difference between defects is necessary because of different methods of their elimination from the casting body. The paper presents an overview of control methods to determine the defects of the shrinkage nature in castings. These are methods of destructive and non-destructive testing, such as Xrays, tomography, and metallography. The paper also shows advantages and disadvantages of the considered methods of control. Based on the control method capacities it offers to divide the shrinkage defects into the three dimensional levels. To estimate the shape of defects the paper suggests a new option, that is a shape criterion. By the example of the typical defects of each dimensional level are defined the threshold values of the shape criterion. The paper discusses the basic techniques to estimate the porosity and offers a relationship between the defects of different dimensional levels and a porosity score and percent. It shows that the transition from a dimensional level to another one is in line with not only increasing pore size, but also with a significant deterioration of the mechanical properties of castings. The main conclusions are as follows: 1. At present, there is no single unambiguous classification of <b>casting</b> <b>shrinkage</b> defects in the technical literature. 2. As follows from the analysis of the classifications of shrinkage defects, their control and estimation methods that there are three dimensional levels proposed, with each one corresponding to defects of a certain size and shape and methods of their control. 3.

The name “high {{strength}} brass ” {{is given}} to the wrought and cast alloys indicating their particular virtue of high strength, which can be achieved by additions of Al, Fe, Mn and Sn. Forgings made from copper base alloys offer a number of advantages over products made by other processes.

In this study, we investigated the microstructures and mechanical properties of high strength brass made by semi solid forging and compared them with those of conventionally forged product and gravity die <b>casting.</b> No <b>shrinkage</b> or gas hole was found in semi solid forgings. Fine equiaxed crystals developed at the center of semi solid forgings, while grains in the corner of semi solid forgings were elongated perpendicular to the pressure direction. The grains of semi solid forgings were smaller than those of conventional forgings and gravity die castings.

40|$|Significant {{efforts have}} been made by {{materials}} scientists and metallurgists to understand the underlying physics involved in solidification of aluminum alloys to predict a variety of <b>casting</b> defects. <b>Shrinkage</b> porosity {{is one of the most}} important types of casting defects. Addressing porosity has been a formidable challenge due to many contributing (and interacting) phenomena responsible for its formation and growth. Shrinkage porosity occurs by nucleation and growth phenomena. Very few previous models for shrinkage prediction consider the pore formation based on a nucleation and growth basis. Several models that can predict micro shrinkage in castings were revised in detail. The main purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive model which can predict micro-shrinkage pores that are forming during solidification of A 356 castings. The model utilizes a stochastic approach and takes into consideration the Niyama criterion as well as the nucleation potential for formation of pores. Therefore, it can predict the random nature of pore formation during casting solidification. Correlations between the predictions and the pore amount were developed. For this model, literature validation was provided for an A 356 alloy plate casting. Further validation was performed for a bar geometry cast in a silica sand mold.

Analytical studies were also performed using both theoretical and finite element analysis to evaluate the influence of several parameters on transverse cracking. The researchers determined that span type, concrete strength, and girder type were the most important design factors influencing transverse cracking. Material properties such as cement content, cement composition, early-age elastic modulus, creep, aggregate type, heat of hydration, and drying shrinkage also influenced deck cracking. Researchers conducted a field investigation of 72 bridge decks in Minnesota. The researchers determined that the most related design factors to transverse cracking were longitudinal restraint, deck thickness, and top transverse bar size. The material factors that affect transverse cracking the most were cement content, aggregate type and quantity, and air content. Researchers in Minnesota performed a parametric study considering bridges with steel and prestressed concrete girders. Among variables considered for steel girder bridges were end conditions, girder stiffness, locations of cross frames, girder splices, supplemental reinforcing bars, shrinkage properties, concrete modulus of elasticity, and temperature differential due to heat of hydration.
