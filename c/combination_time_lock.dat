40|$|Evaluation of {{automated}} sample preparation, retention <b>time</b> <b>locked</b> gas chromatography-mass spectrometry {{and data}} analysis methods for the metabolomic study of Arabidopsis speciesIn this paper, automated sample preparation, retention <b>time</b> <b>locked</b> gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and data analysis methods for the metabolomics study were evaluated. A miniaturized and automated derivatisation method using sequential oximation and silylation {{was applied to}} a polar extract of 4 types (2 types x 2 ages) of Arabidopsis thaliana, a popular model organism often used in plant sciences and genetics. Automation of the derivatisation process offers excellent repeatability, and the time between sample preparation and analysis was short and constant, reducing artifact formation. Retention <b>time</b> <b>locked</b> (RTL) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used, resulting in reproducible retention times and GC-MS profiles. Two approaches were used for data analysis. XCMS followed by principal component analysis (approach 1) and AMDIS deconvolution combined with a commercially available program (Mass Profiler Professional) followed by principal component analysis (approach 2) were compared. Several features that were up- or down-regulated in the different types were detected. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>Time</b> Action <b>Lock</b> is a {{state of}} a Real-time system at which neither time can {{progress}} nor an action can occur. <b>Time</b> Action <b>Locks</b> are often seen as signs of errors in the model or inconsistencies in the specification. As a result, finding out and resolving <b>Time</b> Action <b>Locks</b> is a major task for the designers of Real-time systems. Verification is one of the methods of discovering deadlocks. However, due to state explosion, the verification of deadlock freeness is computationally expensive. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a computationally cheap testing method for Timed Automata models and pointing out any source of possible <b>Time</b> Action <b>Locks</b> to the designer. We have implemented the approach presented in the paper, which is based on the geometry of Timed Automata, via a Testing Tool called TALC (<b>Time</b> Action <b>Lock</b> Checker). TALC, which is used in the conjunction with the model checker UP-PAAL, tests the UPPAAL model and provides feedback to the designer. We have illustrated our method by applying TALC to a model of a simple communication protocol...|$|R
50|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>time</b> is {{the time}} between {{the release of the}} sear and the {{ignition}} of the cartridge. A lengthy <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> gives time for the shooter to drift off target, and so it is advantageous to minimize the <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> and reduce the window for error. Reductions in <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> are generally performed by lightening parts that move as part of the firing operation, such as the hammer and firing pin or striker, shortening to distance parts that move as part of the firing operation have to cover, and using a more powerful spring. Further reductions in <b>lock</b> <b>time,</b> to near zero levels, can be achieved with electrical primers.|$|R

Responses evoked by rewarding trains of stimulus pulses fell into five categories.

Two TTL neurons were collision tested, and both showed colli-sion, suggesting that self-stimulation of the VTA may involve antidromic, and thus direct, activation of a substantial num-ber of NAS axons.
