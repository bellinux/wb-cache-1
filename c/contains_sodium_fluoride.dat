50|$|Fluoride salts {{are often}} added to {{municipal}} drinking water (as well as certain food products in some countries) {{for the purposes}} of maintaining dental health. The fluoride enhances the strength of teeth by the formation of fluorapatite, a naturally occurring component of tooth enamel.

40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the influence of fluoride in certain mouthwashes on the risk of corrosion through galvanic coupling of orthodontic wires and brackets. Two titanium alloy wires, nickel-titanium (NiTi) and copper-nickel-titanium (CuNiTi), and the three most commonly used brackets, titanium (Ti), iron-chromium-nickel (FeCrNi) and cobalt-chromium (CoCr), were tested in a reference solution of FusayamaMeyer artificial saliva and in two commercially available fluoride (250 ppm) mouthwashes, Elmex® and Meridol®. Corrosion resistance was assessed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-MS), analysis of released metal ions, and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) study of the metal surfaces after immersion of different wire-bracket pairs in the test solutions. The study was completed by an electrochemical analysis. Meridol® mouthwash, which contains stannous fluoride, was the solution in which the NiTi wires coupled with the different brackets showed the highest corrosion risk, while in Elmex® mouthwash, which <b>contains</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> the CuNiTi wires presented the highest corrosion risk. Such corrosion has two consequences: deterioration in mechanical performance of the wire-bracket system, which would negatively affect the final aesthetic result, and the risk of local allergic reactions caused by released Ni ions. The results suggest that mouthwashes should be prescribed according to the orthodontic materials used. A new type of mouthwash for use during orthodontic therapy could be an interesting development in this field...|$|E
40|$|In vitro pH cycling {{studies are}} useful tools for the anticaries {{assessment}} of toothpastes. A pH cycling {{study was conducted}} to compare the anticaries potential of a new multipurpose whitening toothpaste containing sodium fluoride (NaF-anticaries agent), soluble pyrophosphate (tartar control source) and a modified silica abrasive (enhanced cleaning potential) to a clinically proven NaF/pyrophosphate/silica toothpaste. Crowns of human molars (10 teeth/group) were subjected to 14 days of alternating demineralization (6 hr, pH 4. 5, Ca/P/acetate) and remineralization (17 hr, pH 7, Ca/P) with dentifrice treatment (1 : 3 slurry in DDW) 2 x daily for 1 minute each (before and after the demineralization period). Dentifrice formulations compared were: a) a clinically proven tartar control toothpaste (Crest Tartar Control Toothpaste- 1100 ppm F (NaF), 3. 3 % soluble pyrophosphate, silica abrasive); b) Crest MultiCare Whitening Toothpaste (1100 ppm F (NaF), 3. 3 % soluble pyrophosphate, modified silica abrasive); and c) placebo (< 1 ppm F, silica abrasive). Enamel crowns were assessed by cross-sectional microhardness, and mineral loss was calculated (Delta Z, vol. % min x micrometers). Mean Delta Z ± SD values were: a) 250 ± 243; b) 408 ± 268; c) 2098 ± 684, with a=b<c (p< 0. 05). These data support the protective nature of these fluoride/pyrophosphate containing formulations against the progression of carious lesions. Under the conditions of this model system, modification to the abrasive system provides the same level of anticaries efficacy as the clinically proven formula.

Methods In each phase, 12 volunteers wore appliances containing 4 enamel specimens, which were {{submitted to a}} 5 -day erosion-remineralization phase that consisted of 2 h of salivary pellicle formation with the appliance in situ, followed by 2 min extra-oral immersion in 1 % citric acid (pH 2. 4), 6 x/day, with 90 min of exposure to saliva in situ between the challenges. Treatment with the test solutions was performed extra-orally for 2 [*]min, 2 x/day. At {{the end of the}} experiment, surface loss (SL, in μm) was evaluated by optical profilometry. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey tests (α = 0. 05). The surface of additional specimens was evaluated by x-ray diffraction after treatments (n = 3). Results C (mean SL ± standard-deviation: 5. 97 ± 1. 70) and F (5. 36 ± 1. 59) showed the highest SL, with no significant difference between them (p > 0. 05). F + Sn (2. 68 ± 1. 62) and F + Sn + LPP (2. 10 ± 0. 95) did not differ from each other (p > 0. 05), but presented lower SL than the other groups (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{has described}} the salivary pellicle as an 'uneven, knotted structure'. This study describes a novel soft-layer model of salivary pellicles, based on measured electrophoretic mobilities {{and the influence of}} dentifrices and a chlorhexidine mouthwash on the parameters of the model. The enamel surface was found to possess a high number of fixed, negative charges (zN = - 62 mM) and to be electrophoretically hard (1 /lambda = 0. 6 nm), i. e. impenetrable to fluid flow. Adsorption of a salivary pellicle resulted in a fourfold reduction in the surface fixed charge density (zN = - 15 mM) along with an increase in electrophoretic softness (1 /lambda = 2. 3 nm). Exposure of pellicles to various dentifrices <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> as an active component and sodium lauryl sulfate as a detergent had little effect on the surface fixed charge densities (varying between - 15 and - 30 mM, depending on the dentifrice involved) and electrophoretic softnesses (varying between 2. 3 and 3. 4 nm). Exposure of pellicles to a dentifrice <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> and hexametaphosphate as an additional detergent yielded soft (8. 0 nm) pellicles, penetrable to fluid flow, with few fixed, negative charges (1 mM). This is opposite to the effects of chlorhexidine, which created an electrophoretically hard pellicle (1. 7 nm). This soft-layer electro-kinetic model quantitatively shows that the degree to which pellicles are penetrable to fluid flow differs upon exposure to dentifrices, with relevance for plaque formation, de- and remineralization and staining processes.

50|$|Earlier workers {{suggested}} {{the use of}} calcium fluoride; now <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> is the preferred compound. Fluoride ions inhibit the rapid progression of disease. In the otosclerotic ear, there occurs formation of hydroxylapatite crystals which lead to stapes (or other) fixation. The administration of fluoride replaces the hydroxyl radical with fluoride leading {{to the formation of}} fluorapatite crystals. Hence, the progression of disease is considerably slowed down and active disease process is arrested.This treatment cannot reverse conductive hearing loss, but may slow the progression of both the conductive and sensorineural components of the disease process. Otofluor, <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> is one treatment. Recently, some success has been claimed with a second such treatment, bisphosphonate medications that inhibit bone destruction. However, these early reports are based on non-randomized case studies that do not meet standards of clinical trials. There are numerous side-effects to both pharmaceutical treatments, including occasional stomach upset, allergic itching, and increased joint pains which can lead to arthritis. In the worst case, bisphosphonates may lead to osteonecrosis of the auditory canal itself. Finally, neither approach has been proven to be beneficial after the commonly preferred method of surgery has been undertaken.|$|R

Materials and methods: Bovine enamel slabs were subjected to a pH cycling model after 2 weeks of immersion in a demineralisation buffer, to produce subsurface enamel lesions. The pH cycling regime ran for 28 days. Enamel subsurface lesion images were taken using a Quantitative Light-Induced Fluorescence (QLF) system under controlled conditions at baseline and endpoint of the experiment. All ﬂuorescence images were examined with analysing software (QA 2 version 1. 16; Inspektor Research Systems). Results: For the different F compounds, significant (p < 0. 05) remineralising potential was observed for the NaF, SnF and MFP groups in descending order. Lesion remineralisation for the AmF and F-free groups was not significant. As for the different fluoride concentrations, all fluoride concentrations showed significant (p < 0. 05) remineralisation potential when compared to the 0 ppm F control group, but no significance was found between groups. Conclusions: From the results of phase A of this in vitro study, it was concluded that: A statistically significant remineralisation of enamel subsurface lesions in comparison with the baseline was found in all groups except the AmF group. Furthermore, NaF toothpaste had the highest remineralising potential on artificial subsurface carious lesions in vitro, followed by SnF then MFP, while AmF was less than the F-free toothpaste.

Ob- jectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the differences of remineralizing properties on initial caries lesion between dentrifices containing fluoride and dentrifices containing nanohydroxyapatite in daily use. Materials & Methods: 56 demineralized specimens prepared from bovine incisors were divided into four groups of 14 specimen each. Each specimen group was treated twice daily with one of the four different remineralizing agents used (1 : remineralization solution/positive control; 2 : slurry consisting of remineralization solution and a fluoride-free toothpaste ("Salviagalen fluoridfrei") /negative control; 3 : slurry consisting of remineralization solution and a toothpaste ("BioRepair") containing nanohydroxyapatite; 4 : slurry consisting of remineralization solution and a toothpaste ("ColgateTotal") <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>fluorides)</b> for either two or three weeks. Additionally, the specimens underwent a pH-cycling for 21 days, and were stored alternately in demineralizing and remineralizing solutions. Subsequently, thin sections (100 μm) were prepared from each specimen for further investigations. Differences in mineral loss (∆ZD) and lesion depth (∆LtD) were evaluated using transversal micro-radiography. Results: Only the fluoride containing product showed remineralizing properties on initial caries lesion, indicating a remineralization of the whole lesion already after two weeks of treatment (p < 0, 05; ANOVA, Bonferroni), whereas nanohydroxyapatite showed no remineralization of the lesion during the same period. Even a more significant remineralization of the whole lesion could be observed for the fluoridated toothpaste after three weeks. However, lesion depths were not reduced at all. Conclusion: Fluoride remineralizes the whole initial caries lesion, whereas nanohydroxyap- atite does not promote remineralization at all. Daily use of nHA is not an alternative option to the regular use of fluoride with regard to remineralization of initial enamel lesions. Fluoride is still a "gold standard" for remineralizaion of initial enamel lesion...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Stannous {{fluoride}} (SnF) {{has been}} suggested as a dental erosion-preventive agent. The aim of this single-centre, randomized, double-blind, in situ study was to evaluate the effect of toothpastes with SnF {{in the prevention of}} erosive enamel wear. Methods: A combined split-mouth (extra-oral water or toothpaste brushing) and crossover (type of toothpaste) set-up was used. Twelve volunteers wore palatal appliances containing human enamel samples. Three toothpastes were used, in three consecutive runs, in randomized order: two toothpastes containing SnF (coded M and PE) and one toothpaste <b>containing</b> only <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> (coded C). On day 1 of each run the appliances were worn for pellicle formation. On days 2 - 5 the samples were also brushed twice with a toothpaste-water slurry or only water (control). Erosion took place on days 2 - 5 extra-orally 3 times a day (5 min) in a citric acid solution (pH 2. 3). Enamel wear depth was quantified by optical profilometry. The effect of toothpastes was tested using General Linear Modeling. Results: Average erosive wear depth of control samples was 23 mu m. Both SnF toothpastes significantly reduced erosive wear: M by 34 % (SD 39 %) and PE by 26 % (SD 25 %). The control toothpaste reduced erosive wear non-significantly by 7 % (SD 20 %). Both SnF-containing toothpastes significantly reduced erosive wear compared to the <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> toothpaste. Conclusion: We conclude that SnF-containing toothpastes are able to reduce erosive tooth wear in situ. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R
5000|$|Fluoride {{varnishes}} {{were developed}} late 1960s and early 1970s {{and since then}} they have been used both as a preventative agent in public health programs and as a specific treatment for patients at risk of caries by the 1980s, mostly in European countries. Fluoride varnishes were developed primarily to overcome their shortcoming which is to prolong the contact time between fluoride and tooth surfaces. Furthermore, {{when compared to other}} existing topical fluoride the advantages of fluoride varnishes application are being a quick and easy procedure for the clinicians, reduced discomfort for the receiving patients, and greater acceptability by the patients. Fluoride varnishes are a concentrated topical <b>fluoride</b> <b>containing</b> 5% <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> (NaF) except the fulour protector. There are many types of fluoride varnishes and among them the popular brands are Duraphat and Fluor Protector. Currently, the anti-caries effect fluoride varnishes are backed up by Cochrane systematic reviews, 2002 which was updated in 2013 included 22 trials with 12,455 children aged 1-15 years old.

40|$|The paper {{aimed at}} the {{evaluation}} of the batch electrodialysis (ED) run in the course of treatment and desalination of various aqueous mixtures <b>containing</b> both mineral (<b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> <b>sodium</b> chloride) and organic substances (dyes or humic acids). The commercial ED stack (PCCell Bed) equipped with standard anion-exchange and cation-exchange membranes or monovalent selective anion-exchange membranes was used. The ED experiments were performed at a constant current density (1. 56 or 1. 72 mA/cm 2). The mechanism of ion migration as well as membrane deposition for variable solution composition and various membrane types was analyzed The calculated mass balance and electrical energy demand for each ED run were helpful in evaluating the membrane fouling intensity. It was found that the presence of organic substances in the treated solution had a minor impact on energy consumption, but rather strongly affected chloride flux. The extent of organics deposition was significantly lower for monovalent selective anion-exchange membranes than for classic anion-exchange membranes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Aseptic {{loosening}} is {{the most}} common single cause for revisions in major joint arthroplasties worldwide. Different theories for aseptic loosening have been discussed during the last two decades. There is a need for improving fixation in both cemented and uncemented implants. Aims: To investigate if wear particles alone can induce aseptic loosening in a stable joint implant and if <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> loaded bone cement improves fixation of implants in rabbits with or without oestrogen defiency. Material, Methods and Results: The Miller-Galante I (MG I) prosthesis was designed to achieve permanent stability through bone ingrowth into a titanium fiber mesh. Thirty-five knees in 30 patients with MG I knee replacements have been followed clinically and radiologically with a mean follow-up of 12 years. Twenty knees were revised. Light microscopical histomorphometrical investigations of tissue integration were performed on the revised components. Patello-femoral problems, especially avulsion of the polyethylene from the metal backed patella and in some cases severe metallosis have been the main reasons for revision. Substantial wear debris was exposed to the interfacial tissues. Despite this the fixation of the components has been excellent {{with a high degree of}} osseous ingrowth displayed at histological analysis. The used rabbit model was a weight bearing, articulating prosthetic joint repeatedly injected with submicron particles of Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight-Polyethylene (UHMWPE) produced in a hip simulator. Twelve lop-eared rabbits were included in the study. Histomorphometrical investigations demonstrated no statistically significant differences between rabbits receiving UHMWPE particles (test) and those that received saline (control). The Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight-Polyethylene debris did not induce any significant osteolysis, indicating that an osseointegrated implant with a sealed interface may not be affected by UHMWPE debris nor progress to aseptic loosening. We investigated if addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> to poly-metylmetacrylate (Cemex®) could improve fixation to bone. Nine mature lop-eared rabbits were included in the study. A femoral prosthesis was inserted in both knees to resurface the femuropatellar articulation. The same type of Cemex® bone cement with and without NaF was used on both sides. Two screw shaped implants machined from cured rods of test and control cement were also inserted bilaterally into the proximal tibia. Qualitative and quantitative histomorphometrical studies of the bone tissue surrounding the cement in the femur and of the the intact implants revealed similar results regardless if NaF had been added or not. The removal torque necessary to loosen the implants from the bone bed did not significantly differ between the two cements. Our findings indicate that addition of NaF has little effect on implant stability and bone remodelling in healthy rabbits in the short-term perspective. Finally, we investigated bone integration of threaded implants made of cured polymethylmethacrylate <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> or commercially pure titanium (c. p. ti.) grade 1 in normal and oestrogen deficient New Zealand white rabbits. Nine rabbits had been ovariectomized through laparoscopy and nine served as controls. Four weeks after the ovariectomy two threaded implants made of cured bone cement with or without <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> addition were inserted in each tibia and one threaded c. p. ti grade 1 implant was inserted in each patello-femoral joint. Measurement of the peak removal torque necessary to loosen the implants and light microscopical histomorphometrical investigations of tissue integration were performed. In the ovariectomized rabbits addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> to the cement resulted in an increased area of bone in the threads (p= 0. 04). In the non ovariectomized rabbits no significant differences were found between test and control implants. The removal torque was lower in the ovariectomized rabbits compared to the non-ovariectomized rabbits when comparing implants with <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> addition (p= 0. 02). The bone tissue response and the removal torque of the titanium implants were not influenced by ovariectomy in these rabbits. Conclusions: Aseptic loosening could not be demonstrated despite high loads of debris indicating that wear particles alone do not cause aseptic loosening and that additional factors are needed. A stable osseointegrated implant in rabbits had high resistance to endotoxin free submicron UHMWPE wear particles and such particles were not able to cause aseptic loosening alone. <b>Sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> addition to commercially available bone cement may improve bone formation around the cement, although this was only demonstrated in ovariectomised rabbits...|$|R
40|$|Research and {{clinical}} evidence indicate that most forms of plaque associated periodontal disease start as inflammatory lesions of the gingiva which if left untreated, may progress and eventually involve and compromise the entire periodontal attachment apparatus {{of the affected}} teeth.

30|$|The {{current study}} focused on two {{preventive}} agents Clinpro and ICON. Clinpro is a fluoridated varnish <b>containing</b> 5 % <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride.</b> Fluoride {{was found to be}} effective in reducing the development of white spot lesions associated with fixed orthodontic treatment [[16],[24]]. Also, ICON resin infiltration was found to decrease the dissolution of enamel and so limit the appearance of white spot lesions [[25]]. When is the proper timing to apply these materials to get the best result of decreasing the white spot lesions around the orthodontic brackets is a worthwhile question. These preventive agents could be applied after bonding the orthodontic brackets, but this may not be easy all the times especially where there are severely crowded or partially erupted teeth. The other option is to apply these materials before bonding the orthodontic brackets, but these preventive agents could {{have an effect on the}} shear bond strength and/or the amount of adhesive left on the teeth after debonding of the orthodontic brackets upon treatment completion.|$|R
