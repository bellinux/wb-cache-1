40|$|To {{implement}} {{steel bridge}} maintenance, especially that related to fatigue damage, {{it is important}} to monitor bridge deformations under traffic conditions. Bridges deform and rotate differently under traffic load conditions because their structures differ in terms of length and flexibility. Such monitoring enables the identification of the cause of stress concentrations that cause fatigue damage and the proposal of appropriate countermeasures. However, although bridge deformation monitoring requires observations of bridge angle response as well as the bridge displacement response, measuring the rotation angle response of a bridge subject to traffic loads is difficult. Theoretically, the rotation angle response can be calculated by integrating the angular velocity, but for field measurements of actual in-service bridges, estimating the necessary boundary conditions would be difficult due to traffic-induced vibration. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a method for determining the rotation angle response of an in-service bridge from its angular velocity, as measured by a inertial measurement unit (IMU). To verify our proposed method, field measurements were conducted using nine micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) IMUs and two <b>contact</b> displacement <b>gauges.</b> The results showed that our proposed method provided high accuracy when compared to the reference responses calculated by the <b>contact</b> displacement <b>gauges...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{thickness}} of water film {{is an important}} parameter {{in the field of}} chemical industry. Water film is formed by the flowing water, which flows through a narrow channel. So it is difficult to use <b>contact</b> <b>gauges</b> to measure the water film because it’s flowing so fast that if it is touched, the thickness will be changed. A low-cost and high precision non-contact measurement method—capacitive sensor is used as the sensor of the {{thickness of}} water film, virtual instrument is used to analyze the measurement state. In contrast to the conventional stand-alone instruments, a PC based virtual instrument for the measurement of water film is proposed in this paper. Based on on-line measurement theory, real time voltages should be collected to PC. These voltages will be computed by formulas in Labview and the real time data of thickness will be plotted on the screen. If bad signal got, it will give error alarm. The method of the measurement of water film can save a lot of fees of research and applications, and be easy to apply in other measurement and control fields. The basic principle and working process of capacitive micrometer, denoise method, the method of capacitive calibration, virtual instrument data acquisition system and on-line measurement of water film, will be further discussed in this paper...|$|R

The {{provision}} of a reliable railway system is necessary since the railway {{system is a}} transportation mode that communities depend on for freight and passenger purposes. Cost-effective maintenance methods {{are one of the}} traits of a reliable railway system. One of the major causes of accidents in the US railroad system is derailment. Derailment is the incident where the train wheels leave the rails and wheel climb is one of the common wheel climb reasons. Turnouts notably are one of the track areas where a significant number of derailments occurs. ☐ This research focuses on the evaluation of newly developed inspection gauges to reduce derailments at turnouts. As part of the review of the evaluated gauges, IDEA S- 23 project, which is a Transportation Research Board project and a master thesis, was reviewed. Four gauges that were developed in this project are considered in this thesis. The four gauges are as follows: 1. Chipped point gauge 2. AAR 1 B wheel <b>contact</b> <b>gauge</b> 3. Severely worn wheel profile gauge 4. Gage-face wear angle gauge. ☐ In this study, a discussion of the causes of derailments in general and wheel climb specifically is presented. This study used a methodology that has been proposed by a previous study 1, where data taken from an Automated Switch Inspection Vehicle (ASIV) were utilized to overlay switch point profiles with wheels to determine critical points at turnouts. This method is used in this thesis to overlay the evaluated gauges with the switch point profile and then compare the results in terms of Lateral force (L) /Vertical force (V). ☐ As part of the evaluation, four gauges were {{selected on the basis of}} the results of IDEA S- 23 as grounds for the field validation process. The field validation was completed as part of the IDEA S- 28 project and this thesis. The discussion of the field evaluation process and the analysis made on the data obtained from the field evaluation are presented in this thesis. This thesis introduces two types of analysis, namely, agreement analysis and decision tree analysis, which are based on the data mining technique. As a result, the evaluation of the proposed gauges in terms of L/V and based on the IDEA S- 28 analysis is presented. ☐ Moreover, the recommendation and modification of the gauges are presented.

40|$|In bridge maintenance, {{particularly}} with regard to fatigue damage in steel bridges, it is important to determine the displacement response of the entire bridge under a live load {{as well as that of}} each member. Knowing the displacement response enables the identification of dynamic deformations that can cause stresses and ultimately lead to damage and thus also allows the undertaking of appropriate countermeasures. In theory, the displacement response can be calculated from the double integration of the measured acceleration. However, data measured by an accelerometer include measurement errors caused by the limitations of the analog-to-digital conversion process and sensor noise. These errors distort the double integration results. Furthermore, as bridges in service are constantly vibrating because of passing vehicles, estimating the boundary conditions for the numerical integration is difficult. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method for determining the displacement of a bridge in service from its acceleration based on its free vibration. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, field measurements were conducted using nine different accelerometers.

40|$|Wear {{transitions}} in the wheel–rail contact are of increasing interest since the general trend in railway traffic is toward increased velocities and axle loads. Curving {{increases the risk}} of flanging, causing the contact to change from an almost pure rolling wheel tread–rail head contact to more of a sliding wheel flange–rail <b>gauge</b> <b>contact</b> on the high rail in curves. Under wheel flange–rail <b>gauge</b> <b>contact</b> conditions, wear transitions to severe or catastrophic wear will occur if the contact is improperly lubricated. Such a transition is the most undesirable transition in the wheel–rail contact, as it represents a very expensive operating condition for railway companies. The contact conditions responsible for this transition are very severe as regards sliding velocity and contact pressure, and thus place high demands on both the lubricant and the wheel and rail materials. The focus of this thesis is on the transitions between different wear regimes in a wheel–rail contact. Wear is discussed both in traditional tribological terms {{and in terms of the}} categories used in the railway business, namely mild, severe and catastrophic wear. Most of the work was experimental and was performed at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Department of Machine Design. The effects of contact pressure, sliding velocity, and type of lubricant have been investigated, producing results that resemble those of other studies presented in the literature. The absence of research relating to the wheel flange–rail <b>gauge</b> <b>contact</b> is addressed, and it is concluded that a lubricant film must be present on rails in curves to prevent severe or catastrophic wear. The formulation of this lubricant can further increase its wear- and seizure-preventing properties. To obtain a deeper understanding of wear transitions, methods such as airborne particle measurement and electron microscopy have been used. Paper A presents the test methodology used to detect seizure and discusses the wear-reducing influence of free carbon in highly loaded contacts. Paper B presents the testing of seizure-initiating conditions for a range of environmentally adapted lubricants applied to wheel and rail materials; a transient pin-on-disc test methodology was used for the testing. Paper C presents the use of pin-on-disc methodology to study the wear-reducing effects of a wide range of lubricants. The best performing lubricant was a mineral oil containing EP and AW additives. Paper D relates wear rates and transitions to airborne particles generated by an experimentally simulated wheel–rail contact. The airborne particles generated varied in size distribution and amount with wear rate and mechanism.

To <b>gauge</b> the performance of the presented design, the training database was prepared using five volunteers. The accuracy of the current version on the prepared dataset was found to be up to 99. 3 % for target user. The solution combines electronics, e-textile technology, sensor technology, embedded system and machine learning techniques to build a low cost wearable glove that is scrupulous, elegant and portable...|$|R
40|$|Electronic Speckle-Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) is classically used in high {{resolution}} measurements of deformation, but ESPI {{can also be}} used for contouring of surfaces even with discontinuities. Furthermore, measurements of both shape and deformation had been carried-out. It has been shown that performing both measurements is necessary to obtain the actual strain information at the specimen topography, and the development of such techniques was presented as an alternative to other strain measurement methods, among who wire resistance strain gauges is the most popular one. But, despite of its reliability and popularity, the strain gauges technique has some disadvantages. Its set-up is very timeconsuming: in order to assure tight <b>contact</b> between <b>gauge</b> and measured surface, one has to take care about the specimen surface cleanness and roughness and the gluing step takes hours; mounting the electric circuit also requests for time and work due to the small voltage signs, demanding high se nsible signal amplifiers and bridge-circuit units able to perform compensation of temperature variation and protection from noise. Beside that once the given strain information results from the integration over the whole area covered by the gauges, this technique gives no lateral resolution. In opposition to this latter problem, optical techniques are able to provide deformation information in a matrix of some thousand points over the measured area, even including sensitivity in the out-of-plane direction. Therefore, ESPI deformation testing is currently state-of-the-art. But only in the case of plane specimen the correct strain distributions can be directly determined. Otherwise, the contour of the surface has to be taken into consideration. So, an ESPI sensor prototype able to perform such deformation and contouring measurements with easy to handle set-up was developed. In order to achieve detailed information about the reliability of the ESPI strain/stress sensor, several tests hav e been performed. For its large acceptance and common know-how, the technique of strain gauges was chosen as the comparison pattern in this task. Beside a short introduction to the principle of optical strain/stress measurements, this paper will also describe the results of the work performed in quantitative comparison of several technical applications using both techniques, strain gauges and the ESPI sensor...|$|R
