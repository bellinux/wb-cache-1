The decrease in refractive index in turn causes faster-than-c propagation of femtosecond pulses. The measurement also shows unequivocally the exist of coherent amplification of electromagnetic pulses in semiconductors at room temperature, the coherence being strongly enhanced by interactions of the light with coherent transient gratings locked to carrier gratings.

Instantaneous {{consumption}} {{models are}} designed to provide an accurate description of fuel consumption by relating the instantaneous rate of consumption with the vehicle acceleration, speed and the engine dynamics. In principle, instantaneous consumption models allow users to calculate the fuel consumption for any profile of vehicle operation. Some kind of models that take into account only driving dynamics {{can be used to}} describe the variability of consumption. The procedure used by this type of models is to establish reference matrices (related to specific time intervals) that for each combination of speed and acceleration determine the rate of fuel consumption. This paper Describes the design of a mobile application for the estimation of consumption, and user behavior, that applies models of instantaneous consumption. A preliminary experimental survey has been the carried out to obtain a large data base related to the acquisition of cinematic and engine parameters to allow the development of the mobile application.

The exceptional maser properties together with the nuclear activity indicate that the line radiation originates in the circumnuclear environment close to the central engine. The environment for producing maser emission in our Galaxy fulfills some unique requirements that will be compared with those of the extra-galactic Megamaser emission. Using very-long-baseline-interferometry, the observational data show that the radio and the molecular line emission structure reveal a rather more complex picture of the circumnuclear environment where the masers occur. At such scale-sizes the individual Megamaser galaxies display diverse maser- and nuclear properties, which all contribute to the understanding of the molecular environment in active nuclei...|$|R

We present {{numerical}} model calculations for an especially interesting <b>class</b> <b>of</b> Hα <b>emission</b> line profiles from Be star disks, those with asymmetric shape and long-term variability (so-called class 2 profiles). As an underlying {{model for the}} disk we investigate the hypothesis of Okazaki (1991) that these profiles are caused by a distortion of a quasi-Keplerian disk. The distortion has {{the form of a}} one-armed global disk oscillation (density and velocity wave). The radiation transfer in the disk is calculated with an improved version of the spatially implicit 3 D radiative transfer code of Hummel (1994). The resulting sets <b>of</b> Hα <b>emission</b> line profiles reproduce well the observed structures <b>of</b> fully-resolved <b>class</b> 2 Hα emission lines, like double peaks and winebottle-type shoulders. For high inclinations, shell-type profiles result. It is shown that the full variety of observed profile shapes is caused by the interaction of kinematical and non-coherent scattering broadening. While this result has already been found by Hummel (1994) for the symmetric (class 1) Hα profiles, it is proven here for the second major profile class as well. The comparison between observed and theoretical emission shows that the model of global disk oscillations is in full agreement with the observed shapes and the cyclic long-term variability <b>of</b> <b>class</b> 2 profiles...|$|R
40|$|Phase-resolved high {{resolution}} optical spectroscopy has revealed narrow N III and He II emission {{lines from the}} soft X-ray transient Aquila X- 1 during its 2004 outburst that move {{as a function of}} the orbit consistent with the phasing of the donor star. Under the assumption that these lines come from the irradiated side of the donor star, we can constrain its K_ 2 velocity to > 247 +/- 8 km/s, and derive a mass function of f(M_ 1) > 1. 23 +/- 0. 12 M_sun. Estimates for the rotational broadening based on the emission components suggest a possible massive neutron star of > 1. 6 M_sun (at 95 % confidence). However, an updated ephemeris and additional {{high resolution}} spectroscopy of Aql X- 1 during a future outburst are warranted in order to confirm that the narrow lines indeed originate on the donor star surface, and reliably characterise the system parameters of this important X-ray binary. Spectra taken during the end of the outburst show that the morphology <b>of</b> the <b>emission</b> lines changed dramatically. No donor star signature was present anymore, while the presence <b>of</b> narrow low-velocity <b>emission</b> lines became clear, making Aql X- 1 a member of the slowly growing <b>class</b> <b>of</b> low-velocity <b>emission</b> line sources.
