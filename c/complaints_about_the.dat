5|$|A {{supply of}} 929 M249 SAWs was issued to {{personnel}} from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners {{who were involved}} in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E
5|$|Best {{remembered the}} Indra {{as being a}} {{depressing}} place that {{was filled with a}} few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller, a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 Grosse Freiheit. After the closure of the Indra because of <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> noise, the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller, starting on 4 October 1960.|$|E

5|$|Camberwell Green, at the {{junction}} of Camberwell Road and Camberwell Church Street, was the traditional site of Camberwell Fair, an annual fair held every August. Following <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> noise and high crime levels generated by the fair, a group of residents bought the fairground in 1855, converting it into the park which remains today.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of the MPC has {{centred on}} its {{predominant}} focus on inflation {{to the detriment}} of growth and employment, although that criticism may have been mitigated by the March 2013 revisions to the committee's remit. There have also been <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reluctance of lenders to pass on rate changes, and {{about the extent to which}} the introduction and management of QE have risked politicising the committee.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the show, {{which was}} hosted by Rupert Everett, {{returned}} to the New York City but at Bryant Park instead of the Plaza. That year, the show made its broadcast debut on ABC, drawing millions of viewers {{as well as some}} middle-brow controversy; the Federal Communications Commission received many <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> broadcast every year. The show has continued to be broadcast on network television every year since.|$|E

5|$|Since 1955, Molde {{had been}} playing their home games at Molde idrettspark (at the time called Molde stadion), a municipal-owned multi-use venue. A new stadium was {{proposed}} to be located at the waterfront at Reknes. There were many local protests, including <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> size of the structure. Construction of the land fillings and preparation of the construction site started in March 1997, before final approval had been granted by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} route {{ran from}} Chiswick to Southgate, and {{was open to}} traffic by the 1930s. Although it mostly ran on new-build road, a section east of Southgate ran on existing streets.

5|$|Batman Forevers tone is {{significantly}} different from the previous installments, becoming more family-friendly since Warner Bros. believed that the previous Batman film, Batman Returns (1992), failed to outgross its predecessor due to parent <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film's violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic book of the Dick Sprang era, as well as the 1960s television series. Keaton chose not to reprise the role due to Burton stepping down as director. William Baldwin and Ethan Hawke were initially considered for Keaton's replacement before Kilmer joined the cast.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Roeper {{gave the}} film a C- {{and called the}} film [...] "a huge disappointment". His main <b>complaint</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film was its running time {{and most of the}} {{unnecessary}} supporting characters.|$|R

5|$|During {{the rule}} of Grand Master Perellos, the Order was {{amassing}} great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted to take hold of the Order's hospital. This hospital was a privileged place and nobody could be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de Bocage, who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached Grand Master Perellos, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> incident.|$|E
5|$|Following release, {{there were}} several <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game crashing, having a vague user interface, and lacking any save system.

An updated version was released on January 28, 2013 under the name, Street Fighter X Mega Man V2.

5|$|In February 2010 Christine Pratt, {{founder of}} the National Bullying Helpline said that the {{helpline}} had taken calls from Downing Street staff, although she later stated that the calls did not refer to Brown himself. This led to the resignations {{of three of the}} charity's patrons; Cary Cooper, Ann Widdecombe and Sarah Cawood. The Charity Commission later said that it had received over 160 <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> helpline's handling of the situation. The helpline service was voluntarily suspended; it resumed two days later.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, {{due in large part to}} the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Ali's {{successor}} was Hamad bin Thuwaini, {{who became}} sultan in 1893. Hamad maintained {{a close relationship}} with the British, but there was dissent among his subjects over the increasing British control over the country, the British-led army and the abolition of the valuable slave trade. In order to control this dissent, the British authorities authorised the sultan to raise a Zanzibari palace bodyguard of 1,000 men, but these troops were soon involved in clashes with the British-led police. <b>Complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bodyguards' activities were also received from the European residents in Zanzibar Town.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 {{added to a}} litany of <b>complaints</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> state's first constitution. Some {{believed that it was}} undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.|$|E
