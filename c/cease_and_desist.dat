5|$|In February 2008, a <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> {{was given}} to a writer at CC2K.us after they posted an advance script review for the film. The Latino Review also posted an advance review. At the time CC2K.us {{received}} their <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> order, questions were raised why Latino Review's largely positive script review was allowed to stay posted while CC2K was being forced by Fox Searchlight to remove their mainly negative coverage. Although Latino Review was later asked to remove their review, numerous other websites and blogs published their own critiques of the script.|$|E

5|$|In September 2008, Apple sent a <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> {{letter to}} the Victoria School of Business and Technology in Saanich, British Columbia, {{claiming}} the school's logo infringed Apple's trademark rights and that the school's logo falsely suggested Apple had authorized the school's activities. The logo in question featured the outline of an apple and a leaf, although the design incorporated a mountain, had three bumps {{on top of the}} apple instead of the two used by Apple, and had no bite out of the apple, unlike Apple's logo. In April 2011, the school reported it had settled its 3-year dispute with Apple, was launching a new logo under a new name, Q College, and was expanding its operations.

The company did not obtain subscribers' information directly from ISPs, but relied on ISPs to forward such emails to their subscribers. Sing vowed that Odex would rely on weekly reports generated by BayTSP to continue its anti-piracy drive, and that it would again resort to legal action if downloaders or their ISPs did not respond acceptably.|$|E

In February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through Google Checkout.

5|$|In August 2005, CP+B and Burger King {{became the}} target of lawyers of the band Slipknot, who alleged the mask-wearing rooster rockers were a blatant copy of the band's style. The band claimed that CP+B had {{approached}} Slipknot's record company, Roadrunner Records, with an offer to appear in another commercial for Burger King. The band declined {{on the grounds that}} they did not want to be associated with a burger chain and they felt that the Coq Roq advertisements were deliberately co-opting the band's signature look and style in order to influence its fans to purchase the chain's products. The band issued a <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> letter to CP+B and BK requesting the advertisements be pulled. When the two parties declined, the band sued for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, hip-hop artist Daz Dillinger {{issued a}} <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> letter to Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive for {{allegedly}} using {{two of his}} songs without authorisation. American television personality Karen Gravano of the reality television programme Mob Wives filed suit against Rockstar Games in February 2014 in allegation that a character in the game is based on her likeness and story and was depicted without her consent. Rockstar filed to dismiss Gravano's lawsuit in April, and stated that the allegations are foreclosed by the First Amendment. In July, actress Lindsay Lohan also filed a lawsuit, claiming elements in the game, including the Lacey Jonas character, were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission. Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes. In 2016, both lawsuits were dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Officials {{proposed}} dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, {{which would}} allow bikes to be rented without being tethered to docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but {{had been told to}} <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. By the end of the month, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could still lock its own wheels based on whether the customer had paid. Meanwhile, Spin—a viable competitor to Citi Bike with lower per-half-hour pricing—was still looking to get a permit to start operations in New York City.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett {{dismissed}} {{seven of}} the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that the judge would reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid {{because there was no}} change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.|$|E

The company sent <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> letters to Nintendo's licensees, {{all of which}} agreed to pay royalties to Universal except Milton Bradley and Ralston Purina. Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo, Co., Ltd. was heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Judge Robert W. Sweet. Over seven days, Universal's counsel, the New York firm Townley & Updike, argued that the names King Kong and Donkey Kong were easily confused and that {{the plot of the}} game was an infringement on that of the films. Nintendo's counsel, John Kirby, countered that Universal had themselves argued in a previous case that King Kongs scenario and characters were in the public domain. Judge Sweet ruled in Nintendo's favor, awarding the company Universal's profits from Tiger's game ($56,689.41), damages and attorney's fees.|$|E

5|$|Crimson Echoes {{features}} all the playable {{characters of}} the original game, and is set {{five years after the}} events of Chrono Trigger. Crono and Marle are junior regents of the Kingdom of Guardia; Lucca continues her scientific endeavors. The three struggle to ease tensions with Porre, which has modernized its military and seeks to end Guardia's economic hegemony. Frog lives in 605A.D., restored to his human form, though this was not implemented before the <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> letter. Magus searches for Schala in the still-frozen 11,995B.C., and feuds with Dalton, obsessed with finding artifacts from the lost Kingdom of Zeal. Ayla dwells in 64,999,995B.C., and has given birth to her tribe's successor. Robo assists the Guru of Time Belthasar, who has established a clandestine temporal research facility named Chronopolis in 2305A.D. Belthasar claims it will be a guardian of time to ensure a threat such as Lavos will never arise. He nonetheless harbors darker wishes to leave a grand legacy in history, and is almost recklessly pragmatic. He fixes the Epoch during the story's course, which returns as the Neo-Epoch (akin to its design in Chrono Cross).|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{following}} this, the bad blood {{between the two}} sides intensified, {{so much so that the}} new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay–per–view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Bevin's {{administration}} sent a <b>cease</b> <b>and</b> <b>desist</b> {{letter to}} Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky ordering {{it to stop}} performing abortions at its clinic in Louisville {{because it did not}} have the required license. The clinic claimed it had been given permission to perform the procedures by Beshear's inspector general just prior to Bevin taking office, but nonetheless halted the procedures on January 28. Bevin filed suit against Planned Parenthood in February, claiming it had illegally performed 23 abortions without a license; the suit said Planned Parenthood's licensure application was deficient because it did not include agreements with a hospital and ambulance service to transport and care for patients in case of complications, as required by state law, and that Beshear's inspector general was wrong in instructing the organization to begin performing abortions before the license was approved. Planned Parenthood countered that, before the license could be finalized, the abortion facility would have to be subjected to an unannounced inspection, requiring that abortions were already being performed there. In March, the University of Louisville Hospital announced that it had backed out of a transfer agreement with Planned Parenthood, saying it had been pressured to do so and felt that its state funding was in jeopardy by continuing in the agreement. A spokesman for Bevin denied that the pressure had come from anyone in the administration.|$|E
