60|$|Mrs Gaff {{promptly}} {{locked the}} door {{with an air of}} thorough determination, put the key in her bosom, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> thereon tightly.|$|E
60|$|Belle stood quite still till he had finished. She {{had assumed}} her {{favourite}} attitude and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> behind her back, and her sweet childish face was calm and very white.|$|E
60|$|She {{pushed the}} tangled {{hair from her}} forehead, {{mechanically}} readjusting her cumbersome garments, then she stepped close up to the young Spaniard; she <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> over her breast and looked him boldly in the eyes.|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} girl raised herself; {{now that the}} pallid, masklike despair of the last month was broken, she seemed on fire, and her face had a wild look. She withdrew herself from Leila's touch, and, <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> tightly across <b>her</b> chest, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if I am a {{trouble to}} you, be it so. Be {{it as you}} wish," [...] and she {{leaned back against the}} wall of the rock, and <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> upon <b>her</b> breast looked away from him and fixed her eyes upon the sharp granite peaks of Canigou.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the blonde}} {{character}} from I Dream of Jeannie (portrayed by Barbara Eden), the animated Jeannie was a ponytailed redhead. Jeannie could use her magical powers by <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and whipping <b>her</b> ponytail instead of blinking her eyes. On September 22, 1973, Jeannie and Babu made one guest appearance on The New Scooby-Doo Movies. Four years later, Babu alone appeared on Laff-A-Lympics.|$|R
60|$|Miggs, hearing this, let her {{end of the}} box fall {{heavily to}} the floor, gave a very loud sniff, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> screwed down {{the corners of her}} mouth, and cried, in an {{ascending}} scale, 'Ho, good gracious!' three distinct times.|$|E
6000|$|To {{my great}} dismay, the {{housekeeper}} took even a more gloomy view than Morgan of the approaching event. When I had explained all the circumstances to her, she carefully {{put down her}} basket, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and said to me in slow, deliberate, mysterious tones: ...|$|E
60|$|Petite maman {{smoothed}} out her apron, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> before her, and looked the sergeant quite {{straight in the}} face. Rosette's eyes were full of tears, but she {{showed no signs of}} fear either, although her shoulder--where one of the gendarmes had seized it so roughly--was terribly painful.|$|E
5000|$|In {{countries}} {{other than}} Scotland the hands are often crossed {{from the beginning}} of the song at variance with Scottish custom. The Scottish practice was demonstrated by the Queen at the Millennium Dome celebrations for the year 2000. The English press berated her for not [...] "properly" [...] <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> unaware that she was correctly following the Scottish tradition.|$|R
60|$|Giving him a {{friendly}} shake of the hand, Mrs. Bagnet draws {{a long breath}} after her walk and sits down to enjoy a rest. Having a faculty, matured {{on the tops of}} baggage-waggons and in other such positions, of resting easily anywhere, she perches on a rough bench, unties her bonnet-strings, pushes back <b>her</b> bonnet, <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and looks perfectly comfortable.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{even smaller}} panels each depict a female figure with a halo on a plain golden background, with {{cypresses}} {{on either side}} of them, symbolising the Garden of Eden. According to their inscriptions they represent the Virtues of [...] "η αλιθηα" [...] (ἡ ἀλήθεια, Sincerity) and [...] "η ταινοσις" [...] (ἡ ταπείνωσις, Humility). Sincerity holds a cross in one hand and points to her mouth, while Humility <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> over <b>her</b> chest.|$|R
6000|$|She {{said it in}} a quick {{involuntary}} way, {{but half}} playfully, and not more petulantly or disagreeably than a favourite child might have done, who laughed next moment. Tattycoram set her full red lips together, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> upon her bosom. 'Did you wish to know, sir,' she said, looking at Mr Meagles, 'what Miss Wade wrote to me about?' ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} flush on her firm square face, {{a momentary}} stillness in her restless hands, {{which seemed to}} betoken a coming outburst of anger that might throw her off her guard. But no--she mastered the rising irritation, {{leaned back in her}} chair, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> on her broad bosom, and with a smile of grim sarcasm on her thick lips, looked at me as steadily as ever.|$|E
6000|$|She {{laid her}} cigar aside like Amelius, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> over her bosom, {{and looked at}} him, with the first {{softening}} gleam of tenderness {{that he had seen}} in her face. [...] "My friend," [...] she said, [...] "yours will be a sad life--I pity you. The world will wound that sensitive heart of yours; the world will trample on that generous nature. One of these days, perhaps, you will be a wretch like me. No more of that. Get up; I have something to show you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Karen Olivo as Cassie Reynolds (season 2): A lawyer Harry hires {{soon after}} {{expanding}} the law firm. It was revealed in [...] "Insanity" [...] that when Cassie {{was in high}} school, a man opened fire on campus and killed her best friend. She formerly worked in the DA's office with Roseanna Remmick. Highly strung and prone to <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> when she's in an argument, she is still {{shown to be a}} gifted lawyer. Often employed by Harry to [...] "flash some leg" [...] at people causing her difficulties.|$|R
6000|$|LADY (letting {{her hands}} fall [...] ). Tear them from me--by force! (As he glares {{at her like}} a tiger about to spring, she <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> on <b>her</b> breast in the {{attitude}} of a martyr. The gesture and pose instantly awaken his theatrical instinct: he forgets his rage in the desire to show her that in acting, too, she has met her match. He keeps her a moment in suspense; then suddenly clears up his countenance; puts his hands behind him with provoking coolness; looks at her {{up and down a}} couple of times; takes a pinch of snuff; wipes his fingers carefully and puts up his handkerchief, her heroic pose becoming more and more ridiculous all the time.) ...|$|R
5000|$|His father's will {{stipulates}} {{that he is}} to marry a woman, [...] "perfect in mind and body," [...] who has been selected for him. She will reveal herself to him when the time comes, and he will know her by the sign of thee double <b>cross</b> on <b>her</b> <b>arm.</b> If anyone else marries her, then that person will inherit the Hale fortune.|$|R
6000|$|He seemed however to be uneasy and restless, and he moaned now {{and then}} as if in pain. Mary Erskine stood leaning over him for some time, with a countenance filled with anxiety and concern. She then turned away, saying to herself, [...] "If Albert {{is going to be}} sick and to die, what will become of me?" [...] She kneeled down upon the floor {{at the foot of the}} bed, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> before her, laid them down very quietly upon the counterpane, and {{reclined}} her forehead upon them. She remained in that position for some time without speaking a word.|$|E
60|$|She {{determined}} {{to go and see}} Mary Erskine after dinner, again, as the visit would at least be a token of kindness and sympathy, even if it should do no other good. She arrived at the house about the middle of the afternoon. She found Mary Erskine busily at work, putting the house in order, and rectifying the many derangements which sickness and death always occasion. Mary Erskine received Mrs. Bell at first with a cheerful smile, and seemed, to all appearance, as contented and happy as usual. The sight of Mrs. Bell, however, recalled forcibly to her mind her irremediable loss, and overwhelmed her heart, again, with bitter grief. She went to the window, where her little work-table had been placed, and throwing herself down in a chair before it, she <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> upon the table, laid her forehead down upon them in an attitude of despair, and burst into tears.|$|E

Once, I {{participated in}} a development education work-shop. 'The facilitator asked us, a group often, to list some ofour "favourite " development issues. The issue ofmigra-tion and intolerance was chosen from this list as the topic for the next exercise, which required us {{to think of a}} motion or phrase related to those issues. We were told to repeat it over and over, with the goal of building a "machine " of intolerance or tolerance. A woman began the exercise by letting out an enormous sigh, while slam-ming shut an imaginary file.

6000|$|There was Miss Nan, to be sure, tugging along a {{very large}} band-box tied up in linen bag. Very hot and dusty and tired did she look, but marched stoutly along, and came puffing up to the steps, where she dropped her load {{with a sigh of}} relief, and sat down upon it, {{observed}} as she <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> tired <b>arms,</b> ...|$|R
25|$|A woman's legs {{can remain}} flat or raised toward her chest, or {{wrapped around the}} {{penetrating}} partner at various heights: {{at the back of}} the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the Wiener Auster or Viennese oyster. In the higher leg positions the woman's legs may need some support, which may be achieved by crossing the ankles behind the partner or resting on his shoulders. She may also hold them with <b>her</b> hands or <b>cross</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> around them at the knees. Some are flexible enough to cross the legs behind their heads. Alternatively, her partner may hold her legs up. Separating straight legs carry the risk of muscle pull of thigh muscles. The laying by the partner on raised legs puts excessive pressure on the woman's back.|$|R
60|$|Beatrice did {{not quite}} see it all; but she saw enough of it to know that Mary was to be pitied; so, instead of scolding her friend for being <b>cross,</b> she threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> round <b>her</b> and kissed her affectionately.|$|R
5000|$|The nuns bound {{her hands}} and feet and locked her in her room while they celebrated the Ascension of Jesus. A few days later, they chained <b>her</b> to a <b>cross</b> with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{stretched}} and they carried her into the church. Her wrists and her forehead were anointed with holy oil and she was kept in the church for three days. They put a towel into her mouth to stop her from cursing and they prayed to cast out the Devil as they wet her lips with holy water.|$|R
50|$|Tekakwitha is {{featured}} in four national shrines in the United States: the National Shrine of Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha in Fonda, New York; the National Shrine of the North American Martyrs in Auriesville, New York; the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.; and The National Shrine of the Cross in the Woods, an open-air sanctuary in Indian River, Michigan. The {{design of the}} latter shrine was inspired by Kateri's habit of placing small wooden crosses throughout the woods. One statue on the grounds shows <b>her</b> cradling a <b>cross</b> in <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> surrounded by turtles.|$|R
50|$|The {{police found}} Lady Ashton lying face down diagonally across the {{concrete}} floor of the small bin alcove. There was {{a pool of blood}} around her head. The pantyhose were strung so tightly around her neck that it cut through the skin. Her bare legs were <b>crossed</b> and <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> were placed by her sides. She had a thin trickle of blood running out of her mouth. At this point, the police concluded they were facing a serial killer. To date all three victims were wealthy elderly women, from the same suburb, and were all assaulted or killed in the same manner before being robbed of their handbags.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Blossoms" by Morre, depicting a woman draped in cloth, [s. d. ]. The woman stands in full figure at center, wrapped in a lightly-colored sheet. She <b>crosses</b> both of <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> across <b>her</b> chest, holding the hands behind her right ear. Her flaxen hair seems to be bound back with a darkly-colored bonnet of some kind. She is barefoot. A wall of flowers can be seen behind her...|$|R
60|$|The Bird of Paradise curtsied {{as if she}} shrunk {{under the}} {{overwhelming}} greeting, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> breast with <b>arms</b> that gleamed like moonbeams and hands that glittered like stars. This gave time to the cognoscenti to remark her costume, which was ravishing, {{and to try to}} see her feet; but they were too small. At last Lord Squib announced that he had discovered them by a new glass, and described them as a couple of diamond-claws most exquisitely finished.|$|R
5000|$|The central figure, the woman, is popularly {{associated}} with Māra the ancient Latvian goddess of motherhood, fertility, and earth. The <b>cross</b> in <b>her</b> outstretched <b>arm</b> symbolizes the deep importance of Catholicism to Latgalian culture. The words [...] "Vienoti Latvijai" [...] beneath the statue (meaning [...] "United for Latvia") designates {{the decision to}} reunite {{with the rest of}} Latvia during the Republic's formation in 1918, even though Latgale had been politically separated from the rest of Latvia for 300 years.|$|R
60|$|Turning {{to go out}} {{he heard}} a thud somewhere in the house. To open the door, he had first to lift the curtain; he did so with his face over his shoulder. The merest trickle of light, coming through the keyhole {{and one or two}} cracks, was enough for his eyes to see her plainly, all black, down on her knees, with <b>her</b> head and <b>arms</b> flung on the foot of the bed--all black in the desolation of a {{mourning}} sinner. What was this? A suspicion that there were everywhere more things than he could understand <b>crossed</b> Heyst's mind. <b>Her</b> <b>arm,</b> detached from the bed, motioned him away. He obeyed, and went out, full of disquiet.|$|R
25|$|With Anna in chains, Ingrid asks Anna {{to recall}} {{the tale of a}} king who lost his only daughter, and as a result, used a mirror to cast a spell on his whole kingdom, making them see only the worst qualities in those around them, leading them to kill each other. Ingrid uses a small shard of the mirror to cast the same spell, the Spell of Shattered Sight, on Anna, {{resulting}} in Anna becoming negative and resentful against Elsa for deserting her during their childhood. Elsa suspects a spell has been cast on her sister when Anna comes to the dining room carrying the urn and saying only negative things about her. Ingrid demands that Elsa freeze Anna to prevent her from trapping Elsa inside of the urn; however, Elsa refuses to hurt <b>her</b> sister, <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> to hold in her magic. Still under the spell, Anna traps Elsa inside the urn, even as Elsa tells her that no matter what she does, she will always love her. Anna realizes too late what she has done when Ingrid takes the urn from her, and Kristoff arrives to stop Ingrid. Unfortunately, Elsa's entrapment was not Ingrid's original plan, and in her anger, she uses her powers to freeze Anna, Kristoff, and the entire Kingdom of Arendelle. Rumplestiltskin appears in the dining room, finding Ingrid practicing her Rock Troll magic, pulling memories from Elsa, still inside the urn, over to a rock in her other hand. Rumplestiltskin asks her to give him the Sorcerer's Hat box; when she refuses, he magically takes and hides the urn and Anna's necklace, saying he will return them only in exchange for the box.|$|R

50|$|When Isabella goes {{to visit}} her mother, Maria, in the asylum, she finds that her mother speaks in {{different}} accents and has paintings all over the walls. Maria then soils herself while screaming a weird language. She has inverted <b>crosses</b> carved into <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and <b>her</b> bottom lip. Maria tells Isabella that killing a child is against God's will. Isabella tells David and Ben that she had an abortion years ago {{and her mother had}} no way of knowing that—another sign that showed possible possession. As the crew prepares to perform an exorcism/analysis on Maria, David worries about losing his job, since the Church does not authorize exorcisms without undeniable proof that the patient is indeed possessed. During the procedure, Maria mentions knowing what Ben did in the past.|$|R
