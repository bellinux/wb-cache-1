The Smoking Man arrives soon after with Gibson, who tells him that the alien is no longer there. At the nuclear power plant, the alien kills another person, but Mulder and Scully are denied access by Spender and Fowley. Upon returning to their car they find Gibson inside, who has escaped from The Smoking Man. Later that night, Fowley tells Mulder she was offered the X-Files and is protecting his interest. Mulder leaves Gibson with Scully and heads off with her. Mulder and Fowley believe the alien is seeking heat, {{which is why it}} is in the nuclear power plant.

40|$|Abstract. Catastrophic {{failure is}} often {{associated}} with a large temperature rise. This situation may lead to a drastic deterioration in material strength where a cooling system is important for a smooth system plant operation to prevent catastrophic failure to its equipments, parts or processes. In this study, a part of a failed closed recirculation system water <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> in a steel manufacturing plant in Malaysia has been investigated for detailed failure analysis. A steam leakage of a water <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> with a closed recirculation system operation made of ASTM A 106 /A (Carbon Steel Pipes for high temp service) was detected. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the evidence related to the water <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> leakage and to investigate the cause of failure. Detailed investigation was carried out by visual inspection, optical microscopy and hardness testing. With the evidence obtained, due to presence of water scale and prolonged overheating, decarburization had occurred. During decarburization, it was found that carbon elements from inner surface tube had depleted through the outer tube surface. The accumulation of carbon elements on the outer tube surface appears to show significantly higher brittle zone in the outer tube and with the presence of tensile stress developed from operating thermal cycle which subsequently resulted in crack. It can be concluded that the water <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> leakage was due to thermal fatigue...|$|R

2500|$|Cubic {{zirconia}} or CZ (ZrO2; zirconium dioxide—not to {{be confused}} with zircon, a zirconium silicate) quickly dominated the diamond simulant market following its introduction in 1976, and it remains the most gemologically and economically important simulant. CZ had been synthesized since 1930 but only in ceramic form: the growth of single-crystal CZ would require an approach radically different from those used for previous simulants due to zirconium's extremely high melting point (2750nbsp&°C), unsustainable by any crucible. The solution found involved a network of water-filled copper pipes and radio-frequency induction heating coils; the latter to heat the zirconium feed powder, and the former to cool the exterior and maintain a retaining [...] "skin" [...] under 1 millimeter thick.

A two-phase version of the RNG k-&# 949; turbulence model was used for the liquid and gas, respectively. Comparisons of computational results with experimental data are done. The results show that the gas gathers along the outer wall of the <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> and rises. The higher turbulent kinetic energy of gas and liquid, the larger bubble and the higher interfacial area concentration exist mainly near the exit and outer wall of the <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe.</b> The existence of a separator inserter is very helpful to strengthen the turbulence between gas and liquid; this can reduce the bubble diameter and increase the interfacial area effectively...|$|R
