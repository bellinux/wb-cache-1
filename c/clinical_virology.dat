5000|$|The viruses of {{vertebrates}} are informally {{distinguished between}} those that primarily cause infections {{of humans and}} those that infect other animals. The two fields of study are called medical (or <b>clinical)</b> <b>virology</b> and veterinary virology respectively. Although not the first viruses to be discovered and characterised, those that cause infections of humans are the most studied. Different viruses can infect all the organs and tissues {{of the body and}} the outcomes range from mild or no symptoms, to life-threatening diseases. Humans cannot be infected by plant or insect viruses, but they are susceptible to infections with viruses from other vertebrates. These are called viral zoonoses or zoonotic infections.

Animal toxicity studies support this observation in humans, with primates demonstrating the greatest margin of safety." [...] A mild flushing reaction has occurred in about 15% of patients, and more rarely reported side effects include chills, fever, malaise, leukopenia, neutropenia and leukocytosis. Some of these side effects may be attributed to a temporary Herxheimer reaction in response to pathogen die off.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of metagenomics {{into the field}} of virology has facilitated the exploration of viral communities in various natural habitats.

This review considers the current state of viral metagenomics, based on examples from Korean viral metagenomic studies-i. e., rice paddy soil, fermented foods, human gut, seawater, and the near-surface atmosphere. Viral metagenomics has become widespread due to various methodological developments, and much attention has been focused on studies that consider the intrinsic role of viruses that interact with their hosts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this review was to {{summarize}} the epidemiology, <b>clinical</b> pictures, and <b>virology</b> of enterovirus 71 (EV 71) infection. An epidemiological study in Taiwan revealed that the reported incidence of mild cases of hand-foot-mouth disease/herpangina (HFMD/HA) varied from year to year; seasonal variations in incidence were observed, with an incidence peak observed during the summer season. The study also showed that different enteroviruses co-circulate in the community, and seroepidemiological studies suggest that children aged less than 4 years old are most susceptible, while over 50 % {{of the rest of}} the population is immune. The emergence of the EV 71 epidemic in the Asia Pacific region has been associated with the circulation of three genetic lineages (genotype B 3, B 4, C 2) that appear to be undergoing rapid evolutionary changes. EV 71 infection has emerged as an important public problem, causing serious clinical illness and, potentially, death in young children. Vaccine development is recommended for the prevention of EV 71 infection in the future...|$|R
