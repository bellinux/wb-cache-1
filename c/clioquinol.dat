50|$|<b>Clioquinol</b> (iodochlorhydroxyquin) is an {{antifungal}} {{drug and}} antiprotozoal drug. It is neurotoxic in large doses.

5000|$|The {{chelating}} {{activities of}} nitroxoline {{have also been}} used in an anticancer setting.

[...] It also demonstrated an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production over controls, especially when Cu2+ was added. The ROS levels reached over 350% of the controls with addition of CuCl2. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity production was markedly decreased with addition of ZnCl2, indicating, based on this model, that nitroxoline is not a zinc chelator. Because the zinc chelating action of <b>clioquinol</b> has been associated with subacute myelo-optic neuropathy, the use of nitroxoline as a cytotoxic drug in the treatment of cancers should not exhibit neurotoxic effects in humans, and in vivo trials on tumour xenografts in mice have not yielded any negative neurodegenerative effects.|$|E

5000|$|Clioquinol's {{use as an}} {{antiprotozoal}} drug {{has been}} restricted or discontinued in some countries due to an event in Japan where over 10,000 people developed subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) between 1957 and 1970. The drug was used widely in many countries {{before and after the}} SMON event without similar reports. [...] As yet, no explanation exists as to why it produced this reaction, and some researchers have questioned whether <b>clioquinol</b> was the causative agent in the disease, noting that the drug had been used for 20 years prior to the epidemic without incident, and that the SMON cases began to reduce in number prior to the discontinuation of the drug. [...] Theories suggested have included improper dosing, the permitted use of the drug for extended periods of time, and dosing which did not consider the smaller average stature of Japanese; however a dose dependant relationship between SMON development and <b>clioquinol</b> use was never found, suggesting the interaction of another compound. Researchers have also suggested the SMON epidemic could have been due to a viral infection with an Inoue-Melnick virus.|$|E

50|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that normal prostate cells have high zinc content through ZIP1 mediated uptake, and have low respiration (OXPHOS ATP generation is diverted to citrate export for sperm energetics).

50|$|Chelation therapy, which {{involves}} {{the removal of}} heavy metals from the body, {{has also been shown}} to be beneficial in lowering amyloid plaque levels. This is because Aβ aggregation is somewhat dependent on the metal ions copper and zinc.

The expression of the ZnT3 is significantly lower in Alzheimer’s patients compared to healthy patients. Mice without ZnT3 were found to have much higher plaque formation. Further promoting this concept, Aβ deposition was impeded in APP transgenic mice treated with the antibiotic <b>clioquinol,</b> a known copper/zinc chelator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Clioquinol,</b> a metal-binding compound, {{has been}} shown to have anticancer {{activity}} in in vitro and in vivo model systems. This study investigated the effects of <b>clioquinol</b> on cyclin D 1 gene expression in breast cancer cells. Treatment with <b>clioquinol</b> significantly reduced cyclin D 1 protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner, effects being more pronounced in the presence of zinc. <b>Clioquinol</b> reduced cyclin D 1 mRNA contents in cells that had been pre-treated with actinomycin D, indicating that this compound alters cyclin D 1 mRNA stability, an event associated with post-transcriptional regulation. Using a cyclin D 1 3 ’-UTR reporter construct (CCND 1 - 3 ’-UTR), we confirmed that this 3 ’-UTR mediates the inhibitory action of <b>clioquinol,</b> likely through miR- 302 C.

40|$|BACKGROUND: 5 -chloro- 7 -iodo- 8 -hydroxyquinoline (<b>clioquinol)</b> {{was used}} {{clinically}} {{three decades ago}} as an oral antiparasitic agent and to increase intestinal absorption of zinc in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica, a genetic disorder of zinc absorption. Use of <b>clioquinol</b> was epidemiologically linked to subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON), characterized by peripheral neuropathy and blindness, which affected 10, 000 patients in Japan. Discontinuation of oral <b>clioquinol</b> use led to elimination of SMON, however, the mechanism of how <b>clioquinol</b> induces neurotoxicity is unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the effect of clioquinol-metal chelates on neural crest-derived melanoma cells. The effect of <b>clioquinol</b> chelates on cells was further studied by electron microscopy and by a mitochondrial potential-sensitive fluorescent dye. RESULTS: Of the ions tested, only clioquinol-zinc chelate demonstrated cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity of clioquinol-zinc chelate was extremely rapid, suggesting that its primary effect was on the mitochondria. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that clioquinol-zinc chelate caused mitochondrial damage. This finding was further confirmed by the observation that clioquinol-zinc chelate caused a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that <b>clioquinol,</b> {{in the presence of}} zinc, is converted to a potent mitochondrial toxin. The phenomenon of <b>clioquinol</b> mediated toxicity appears to be specific to zinc and is not seen with other metals tested. Since <b>clioquinol</b> has been shown to cause increased systemic absorption of zinc in humans, it is likely that clioquinol-zinc chelate was present in appreciable levels in patients with SMON and may be the ultimate causative toxin of SMON...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of <b>clioquinol</b> {{for the treatment of}} cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched on 20 May 2005 using the terms <b>clioquinol</b> and PBT 1. The Register contains records from major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly. The Internet was searched using the term: <b>clioquinol</b> PBT 1 Alzheimer*. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials in which treatment with <b>clioquinol</b> was administered to participants with Alzheimer's disease in parallel group comparison with placebo are included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers (RM, LJ) independently assessed the quality of trials according to the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. The primary outcome measures of interest were cognitive function (as measured by psychometric tests) and global impression. The secondary outcome measures of interest were in the following areas: quality of life, functional performance, effect on carer, safety and adverse effects, and death. MAIN RESULTS: There was one included trial of <b>clioquinol</b> compared with placebo in 36 patients. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is not clear from the trial that <b>clioquinol</b> shows any positive clinical result on patients with AD. The two statistically significant positive results were seen for the more severely affected subgroup of patients. This effect was not maintained at the 36 week end-point. The sample size was small. Details of randomisation procedure or blinding were not reported. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential for <b>clioquinol</b> as a treatment of AD.

40|$|Abstract Background Entamoeba spp. is {{a common}} {{infectious}} and zoonotic protozoa in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and humans. This parasite can affect the health status of macaques as the infection can cause severe diarrhoea. Therefore, in some cases, treatment can be mandatory. Metronidazole {{is the most common}} treatment for Entamoeba spp. in veterinary medicine. The administration of metronidazole in drinking water was not successful due to low fluid intake attributed to unacceptable taste. Therefore another anti amoebic medicine, <b>clioquinol</b> administered via drinking water, is tested in rhesus monkeys. Experimental design The normal daily water intake of 16 macaques (8 males and 8 females) over a 27 -day period was determined. Secondly, it was investigated whether the addition of <b>clioquinol</b> dispersed in gel influenced the daily fluid intake. Furthermore, it was determined if the rhesus monkeys drank enough medicated fluid to receive a dose of 20 mg/kg/day <b>clioquinol.</b> Therefore, a cross-over study was designed in which macaques were given water, medicated fluid and non medicated fluid. Results The mean water uptake was 78. 8 ml/kg. <b>Clioquinol</b> addition resulted in a statistically significant decrease of 15. 7 ml/kg in fluid intake. The mean intake of the non-medicated fluid compared with water intake did not significantly differ. The mean intake of <b>clioquinol</b> for five days was 22. 4 mg/kg in 16 rhesus monkeys. Conclusions This study shows {{that it was possible to}} administer <b>clioquinol</b> in gel to rhesus monkeys in the desired dose...|$|E
40|$|Five {{personal}} {{observations of}} an acute amnestic episode in younger individuals after intake of <b>clioquinol</b> are described together with three observations {{from the medical}} literature.

The clinical aspect closely resembled classical transient global amnesia but the episode after <b>clioquinol</b> lasted longer (24 hours to three days) and {{a more or less}} extensive retrograde amnesia persisted permanently. In one patient after three tablets of Mexase a <b>clioquinol</b> concentration of 12 microgram/ml in plasma was found 24 hours after the specified dose, which is an unexpectedly high concentration compared to those reported as late as 24 hours after a single equal dose of Mexase or any other clioquinol-containing preparation.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated hydroxyquinolines reported from outside Japan. In 80 cases insufficient information {{was available for}} adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of <b>clioquinol</b> could be excluded. Of the remainder, a relationship to <b>clioquinol</b> was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases. In six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of <b>clioquinol</b> over a short period. The most common manifestation, observed in 15 further cases, was isolated optic atrophy. This was most frequently found in children, {{many of whom had}} received <b>clioquinol</b> as treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica. In the remaining cases, a combination of myelopathy, visual disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifestation. Isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy, or these manifestations occurring together, were infrequent. The onset of all manifestations (except toxic encephalopathy) was usually subacute, with subsequent partial recovery. Older subjects tended to display more side effects.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dientamoeba fragilis {{infection}} in children is common, and its incidence has increased since {{the introduction of}} more sensitive molecular techniques. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment. Current medical practice in the Netherlands is to treat symptomatic children with <b>clioquinol</b> or metronidazole. This study attempts to obtain {{more information about the}} clinical picture of D. fragilis {{infection in}} children and to evaluate responses to both antiparasitic drugs. METHODS: Children < 18 years of age with a positive stool polymerase chain reaction test for D. fragilis infection were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical data and effectiveness of treatment were analyzed by examining patient's hospital records from the Medical Centre Leeuwarden by repeated analysis of stool samples by the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Friesland. RESULTS: We analyzed 238 patients with an average age of 8. 5 years (± 4. 2 years). Most patients were symptomatic (95. 8 %) and presented with abdominal pain (72. 7 %), loose stools (32. 8 %) and hard stools (24. 8 %). Coinfection with other gastrointestinal pathogens was present in 29 patients (12. 2 %). A higher incidence of infection was found in the winter. <b>Clioquinol</b> had a higher clinical success rate than metronidazole (74. 7 % versus 55. 2 %, P = 0. 047). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that <b>clioquinol</b> could be more effective than metronidazole in alleviating symptoms of D. fragilis infection in children, but double-blind prospective placebo-controlled studies should be performed before final conclusions can be made...|$|E
