5|$|The {{classical}} {{texts of}} Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice {{the virtue of}} Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.|$|E
5|$|After {{his arrest}} Biko {{was held in}} custody in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape for several days, during which he was interrogated. During his {{interrogation}} he was severely beaten {{by some of the}} policemen questioning him. He suffered severe injuries, including his brain, and died soon after on 12 September 1977. News of his death spread quickly, and became a symbol of the abuses perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his other}} powers, the {{governor}} can {{call out the}} state defense force (the Indiana Guard Reserve) or the Indiana National Guard in times of emergency or disaster. The governor is also charged with the enforcement of all the state's laws and the Indiana Code through the Indiana State Police.

50|$|A {{habitual}} offender or career criminal is <b>a</b> person <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>crime</b> who was previously <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime(s).</b> Various state and jurisdictions may have laws targeting {{habitual offender}}s, and specifically providing for enhanced or exemplary punishments or other sanctions.

5|$|Only a {{week after}} being {{appointed}} by Harrison, Crittenden was dispatched to New York to mediate tensions with Great Britain over {{the sinking of the}} steamboat Caroline by a group of Canadian militia, who were attempting to suppress a rebellion in Canada. In this diplomatic endeavor, Crittenden was acting separately from his official duties as attorney general. He spoke with New York Governor William H. Seward and secured his promise to pardon Alexander McLeod, who had seized and burned the Caroline, if he were <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> in New York. Ultimately, McLeod was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} role {{is played by}} the charity trustees, defined in Section 97 of the 1993 Act as those persons having the general control {{and management of the}} administration of charities. As mentioned, charitable trustees have significantly more freedom to act than normal trustees, but the 1993 Act has put restrictions on who may be a charitable trustee. Section 72 excludes people <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> involving dishonesty, bankrupts, people previously removed from charity trusteeship, and people struck off as directors of companies. Those trustees appointed have many duties when administering the trust, including informing the Commission of changes to the charity or its dissolution, registering the charity and keeping proper accounts and records, to be submitted annually to the Commission.|$|E
5|$|Petrosino {{received}} anonymous {{letters from}} Neapolitans in New York that confirmed Alfano's {{presence in the}} city, where he allegedly had given a banquet to several local Camorra members in a Grand Street restaurant. On April 17, 1907, Petrosino and his agents raided the apartment at 108 Mulberry Street where Alfano was living and arrested him. The arrest caused a sensation in Naples. He had been <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> involving moral turpitude in Italy and {{was turned over to}} the Federal authorities. Within three days he was expelled and put on a ship to Le Havre in France, where he was picked up by the Italian police. He was put behind bars in Naples. According to some sources, Alfano was the man behind Petrosino's murder in Palermo on March 12, 1909, which has since been attributed to the Sicilian Mafia, and to Vito Cascioferro in particular.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} CODIS database was to build upon the sex offender registry through the DNA collection of convicted sex offenders. Over time, that has expanded. Currently, all 50 states collect DNA from those convicted of felonies. A number of states also collect samples from juveniles {{as well as those}} who are arrested, but not yet <b>convicted,</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> The collection of arrestee samples raised constitutional issues, specifically the Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure. It was argued that the collection of DNA from those that were not <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> without an explicit order to collect, was considered a warrantless search and therefore unlawful. In 2013, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Maryland v. King that the collection of DNA from those arrested for a crime, but not yet convicted, is part of the police booking procedure and therefore a reasonable collection.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{security}} forces {{have the authority}} to conduct internal investigations into alleged abuses and to fire individuals who have allegedly committed a human rights violation. The federal government can also file complaints with the federal courts; provincial governments may do the same for provincial {{security forces}}. Members of security forces <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> were subject to stiff penalties. In 2008, authorities in Buenos Aires Province removed more than 700 police officers for corruption and other offenses.|$|E
25|$|The {{demography}} of the UAE {{is extremely}} diverse. In 2010, the UAE's population {{was estimated to}} be 8,264,070, of whom only 13% were UAE nationals or Emiratis, while {{the majority of the population}} were expatriates. The country's net migration rate stands at 21.71, the world's highest. Under Article 8 of UAE Federal Law no. 17, an expatriate can apply for UAE citizenship after residing in the country for 20 years, providing that person has never been <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> and can speak fluent Arabic.|$|E
25|$|This {{interpretation}} was {{upheld by}} the Supreme Court of Canada in 2012 in Sriskandarajah v. United States of America. The application of extradition laws to try individuals in countries where constitutional standards are lower or sentences higher remains a controversial practice, and {{was used by the}} Canadian government against Holocaust revisionist Ernst Zundel, alleged war criminal Michael Seifert, and marijuana seed vendor Marc Emery, none of whom were <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> in Canada. Canadian courts have demonstrated an ongoing lack of willingness to apply constitutional remedies in such cases.|$|E

The guard used his phone to record a video of Obama and refused to comply with a request to stop. The guard had been arrested multiple times in the past, but had never been <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
25|$|Truscott's {{case was}} the focus of {{considerable}} public attention. In early 1966, Isabel LeBourdais argued in The Trial of Steven Truscott that Truscott had been <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> he did not commit, rekindling public debate and interest in the case. On April 26, 1966, the Government of Canada referred the Truscott case to the Supreme Court of Canada. Five days of evidence were heard by the Supreme Court of Canada in October 1966, followed by submissions in January 1967. That evidence included the testimony of Truscott, who had not testified at the 1959 trial. British pathologist Professor Keith Simpson was invited by the Canadian government to review the forensic evidence.|$|E
25|$|During the Qing dynasty, {{criminal}} justice {{was based on}} extremely detailed Great Qing Legal Code. One element of the traditional Chinese {{criminal justice}} system {{is the notion that}} criminal law has a moral purpose, one of which is to get the convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of torture, in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All capital offenses were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the emperor.|$|E

25|$|Before this {{landmark}} case, pre-trial involuntary {{commitment of}} incompetent individuals often meant lengthy or even lifetime confinement in a maximum security institution with little concern for treatment. This was true {{even though they}} were neither tried for or <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> In this case, the Court for the first time put limits on the length of time an incompetent person may be confined. However, the Court offers only general guidelines and by 1994, twenty years after the case, 32 states still had not enacted periodic judicial review of incompetent detainees. Many states still allowed a detention period that exceeded that maximum sentence that person would have received if convicted.|$|E
25|$|One {{significant}} change {{that resulted from}} the new laws was {{the definition of the}} term aggravated felony. Being <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> that is categorized as an aggravated felony results in mandatory detention and deportation. The new definition of aggravated felony includes crimes such as shoplifting, which would be a misdemeanor in many states. The new laws have categorized a much wider range of crimes as aggravated felonies. The effect of this has been a large increase in permanent residents facing mandatory deportation from the United States without the opportunity to plea for relief. The 1996 deportation laws have received a lot of criticism for their curtailing of residents' rights.|$|E
25|$|A related {{concept is}} that under American jurisprudence, {{different}} standards of proof are required in {{civil and criminal}} proceedings. Normally, to be <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> the defendant {{must have had a}} specific mens rea, or guilty mental state. For criminal violations of the income tax law, this generally means that the prohibited conduct (whether failure to file, failure to pay, or engaging in some affirmative act to evade the tax), must have been accompanied by an intentional violation of a legal duty of which the defendant was aware. By contrast, to establish civil liability to pay the tax, no mens rea {{on the part of the}} defendant is required to be proven.|$|E
