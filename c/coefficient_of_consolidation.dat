Many researches focused on liquefaction after the earthquakes have revealed that liquefaction occurs mostly in silty soils. Empirical relationships between normalized cone penetration resistance (qc 1 N), cyclic resistance ratio (CRR), magnitude of earthquake (Mw), and silt content (FC), derived from field observations, are currently used for liquefaction potential assessment of loose saturated sands and silty sands. However, the effects of fine content on liquefaction resistance and penetration resistance are not defined clearly in these researches. For this reason, it is aimed to investigate the effects of fine content on consolidation characteristics and the effects of <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> on liquefaction resistance and cone penetration resistance. In this study, a number of field and laboratory studies were carried out to investigate the existing relationships. According to the results of experimental studies, first, the effects of the fines content on <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and drainage characteristics of soils for different soil density ranges are examined and it is established that, both the fines content and the relative density effect the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> of the sands and silty sands. Second, the changes in cone penetration resistance are investigated for different range of fines content and the relative density which have significant influence on <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation.</b> It has been realized that the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> indicates a significant influence on the measured penetration resistance during penetration of the CPT cone to the soil having different relative density, and it is figured out that for stiff-dense to medium dense soil, the decrease of normalized cone resistance is observed due to the change in drainage characteristics of fines or <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation.</b> On the other hand, for loose soils only the relative density indicates a significant influence on the measured CPT penetration resistance around the probe. Finally, the contribution of the relative density on the liquefaction resistance of soils is observed at different fines content and compared with the available method in the literature...|$|E

This thesis describes the onedimensional consolidation tests done to compute the changes of compressibility and justify the suitable amount of additives used. Crushed glass, shredded carpet fibres, fly ash, and shredded high density polyethylene plastic which are classified as recyle and reused materials were added into Kuantan clay soil and then mixed with Portland cement to study and evaluate the Kuantan clay in term of compressibility. In this thesis, the values of <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and compression index soils were done using a One-dimensional consolidation test. The analysis of the test was performed semiautomatically using One-dimensional consolidation program from ELE International. After analysis by the system, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and compression index of the samples obtained were employed as parameter to find the compressibility of Kuantan clay soil. From the results conducted, analysis of using fly ash blend is more conservative reading in <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> indicated better rate of consolidation. Still, soil sample added with crushed glass mixed with Portland cement performed better decrement in compression index indicated better performance in compressibility.

Maintenance dredging is carried out regularly in many major Australian ports and in several cases the dredged mud is pumped ashore into containment paddocks at high water contents.

A step-tapered blade has been developed to overcome this hurdle, by measuring horizontal soil pressures using pneumatically operated cell sensors on four thicknesses of blades, and extrapolating the results to zero thickness to obtain the in situ stress in soil;The pneumatic stepped blade was successfully designed and field tested, and is commercially available. A modified version was made to operate electronically. The electric blade used in this dissertation consists of two steps corresponding to the thinnest steps of pneumatic stepped blade. Each step is equipped with two electronic transducers, one to measure the lateral total soil pressure and the other for soil pore water pressure. By connecting the two-stepped blade to a portable data processor, these two pressures can be measured simultaneously and their decays over time can be monitored;The trends in soil pressure with time from the stepped blade data indicate the pressure measurement and de-airing system are properly designed, but not perfected. The main problem that remains to be solved is to effectively and permanently waterproof the stress transducers. Results from comparison between lateral stresses and K[subscript] o values from both pneumatic and electric blade show that data obtained from both stepped blades are equivalent and reproducible, and the data reflect the variations in the known soil profile at the testing site;Based on the pressure dissipation relationships, a tentative method for estimating the rate <b>of</b> soil <b>consolidation</b> is proposed.

Typically the quantity is determined either from laboratory oedometer tests (generally then referred to as cv) or from field dissipation tests using a piezocone or piezoball penetrometer (generally then referred to as ch).

40|$|For Barren's {{degree of}} consolidation, U-r, versus the time factor, T-r, {{relationship}} for soils undergoing consolidation with radial drainage for the equal vertical strain condition, a simple method {{has been developed}} to determine {{the value of the}} <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> with radial drainage c(r). Theoretical log(10) (d(e) (2) /t) versus U-r curves where d(e) is the diameter of influence and r is the real time for the different known value of c(r) have been generated. A method has been developed wherein both the theoretical and experimental behaviors of soils undergoing consolidation with radial drainage can be simultaneously compared and studied on the same plot. The experimental log(10) (d(e) (2) /t) versus U-r curves have been compared with the theoretical curves. Effects of initial compression, secondary compression, and duration of load increment are studied. Simple procedures are presented for calculating the values of c(r) using the experimental log(10) (d(e) (2) /t) versus U-r curves. A comparative study of the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and the coefficient of permeability between the cases of vertical and radial drainage has been done...|$|E
40|$|Vane {{shear test}} data {{obtained}} {{by a number of}} researchers show that the excess pore pressures generated within the soil surrounding the vane by vane insertion and rotation and their effects on the measured vane shear strength have been misinterpreted for many years. The accepted model developed by Blight of field vane testing and the accepted criteria for determining undrained and fully drained vane shear strengths are based on this misinterpretation. Consequently, estimates that are based on this model of the degree of drainage that has been attained at the time the vane shear strength is measured may be significantly in error, and the measured undrained shear strengths may be unconservative. A revision of Blight 2 ̆ 7 s approximate theory of field vane testing is presented which is consistent with the available experimental data. Revised practical criteria for determining the undrained and fully drained shear strengths are also presented, and a simple revision of current standard vane shear test methods is proposed which would eliminate, for all but those soils with very high <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation,</b> the possibility that estimates of the undrained vane shear strength may be unconservative...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} a full-scale test embankment constructed on soft Bangkok clay with prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) {{at the site of the}} new Bangkok International Airport in Thailand. The embankment was square in plan with a maximum height of 4. 2 m, 3 H: 1 V side slopes, and base dimensions of 40 m by 40 m. The piezometric level with depth is characterized by negative drawdown starting at around 8 - 10 m depth caused by excessive withdrawal of groundwater. Instrumentation was provided to monitor both horizontal and vertical movements of the test embankment. The measured increases in undrained shear strengths with depth are in agreement with the values calculated from the SHANSEP technique. The secondary compression ratio, Calpha, was 0. 018, or within the normal values for marine clays. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> horizontal <b>consolidation</b> measured in the field, Ch(field), was higher for soil at 4 and 10 m depths than for the weakest soil at 6 m depth. The back-calculated Ch(field) values range from 3 to 8 m 2 /year, and the ratio of Ch(field) to Ch(lab) ranges from 4 to 5, where Ch(lab) is the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> horizontal <b>consolidation</b> measured in the laboratory. The degree <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> estimated from the pore-pressure dissipation measurements agreed with those obtained from settlement measurements. The water-content reductions from field measurements were also in good agreement with the values computed from the consolidation settlements. The full-scale study confirmed that the magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> settlements increased with the corresponding decrease of PVD spacing at a particular time period. Lastly, the results of the full-scale study have proven the effectiveness of PVDs for the improvement of soft Bangkok clay.
