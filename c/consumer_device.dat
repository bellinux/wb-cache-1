By this time, text-only user interfaces with sparse graphics gave way to comparatively graphics-rich icons on screen. However, keyboards remain central to human-computer interaction to the present, even as mobile personal computing devices such as smartphones and tablets adapt the keyboard as an optional virtual, touchscreen-based means of data entry.|$|E

At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, Qualcomm introduced the first of the Snapdragon 800 series and renamed prior models as the 200, 400 and 600 series. Several new iterations have been introduced since, such as the Snapdragon 805, 810, 615 and 410. Qualcomm re-branded its modem products under the Snapdragon name in December 2014.|$|E

40|$|The Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) {{specification}} {{defines a}} service-oriented framework {{for use in}} residential gateways. In this context, the OSGi framework acts as a gateway from the Internet to <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> attached to the residence's home-area network. Service providers use the gateway to deliver products and services to end-users, such as home security or health care monitoring. As more powerful <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> are introduced, the devices themselves become mechanisms for delivering services to the framework. This level of sophistication results in complex applications {{and the need for}} sophisticated mechanisms to simplify creating them. This paper introduces Beanome, a lightweight layer implemented on top of the OSGi framework, that implements a simple component model and framework for creating OSGi applications. Beanome is not a component model for <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> per se, but is a component model for the OSGi framework, which itself is used to create applications that access and provide user-level and management-level interfaces to <b>consumer</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Consumer</b> <b>devices</b> are {{changing}} from functional hardware to access points for networked services. Following this change the manufacturers must update their development strategies {{in order to}} gain the new market. The update of the development strategies includes considerations regarding low cost products (devices plus software infrastructure and end-user applications), flexible and dynamic devices and addressing the needs of service provision. One promising way to address these concerns is the provision of customisable service platforms that are reliable and, from the user's point of view, secure. For the next generation of <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> this means software architectures based on components will be used. The discussion below analyses these forces from the device manufacturer's viewpoint, focusing on security and reliability in component based software infrastructures for <b>consumer</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
