Combustion of acetone {{solutions}} of AgI {{and various}} chemical solubilizers and additives {{is used to}} generate ice nucleus aerosols for weather modification research, development and field use Nucleus chemical compositions have varied from AgI itself to 2 AgI-NaI, and 2 AgI-KI, to Ag(C 1) I and to Ag(C 1) I-x NaCI (where x has varied from 0. 125 to 5), over Combustion of pyrotechnics to produce nucleus aerosols containing AgI is also widely used. Silver iodide and silver <b>chloroiodide</b> "contact " nuclei {{have been the most}} often employed. More recent developments have led to the generation of Ag(C 1) I nucleants containing soluble salts, which function by rapid condensation-freezing mechanisms, rather than the cloud droplet "contact " mechanism. These research and development efforts over a 50 years period have led {{to a better understanding of}} the relationships between ice nucleus compositions, activities, and the rates and mechanisms of ice crystal formation. Ice nucleus aerosols of optimunt utility for field applications are now possible of generation...|$|E
