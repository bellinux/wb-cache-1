The insurer was expected to cover the difference in value between the credit default swap contracts it had sold to Goldman Sachs, however {{the head of the}} unit at AIG disagreed with the valuation that Goldman presented. According to a memo published by Business Insider, witnesses wondered how PwC was signing off on the accounts for both AIG and Goldman Sachs, when they were using different valuation methods for the swaps contracts (and therefore booked different values for them in their accounts).|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of the environment and the prevention of the transboundary damage caused by pollution have become the common interest and responsibility of the international community. In order to effectively prevent the transboundary movement of harmful wastes and make up for the limitations of traditional theories, it is essential to redefine traditional State responsibilities to adapt to the trends of environmental protection and the development of international laws. By using the "Principle of Relative Sovereignty" as a base, this can be achieved by introducing strict liability, complementing State liability, establishing the undertakers of State responsibilities and undertaking <b>collateral</b> <b>obligations.</b> In recent years, in order to escape the high costs involved in the disposal of harmful wastes some developed countries adopted the method of transboundary movement of waste to ease their financial burden. It is predicted that the smuggling of harmful wastes will become a continuous developing industry. Consequently, resolving the issue of the transboundary movement of harmful wastes has become a matter of international importance. 14 page(s...|$|R
2500|$|Mortgages on Trump's major properties—including Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street, and the Trump National Doral golf course—each {{fall into}} the [...] "above $50 million" [...] range, the highest {{reportable}} category on FEC filings, with Trump paying interest rates ranging from 4% to 7.125%. Mortgages on those three properties were separately reported as $100 million, $160 million, and $125 million in 2013. Trump is a leaseholder, not owner, of the land beneath 40 Wall Street. Other outstanding Trump mortgages and debts are pegged to current market interest rates. A 2012 report from Trump's accounting firm estimated $451.7 million in debt and other <b>collateral</b> <b>obligations.</b> Filings in 2015 disclosed debt of $504 million, according to Fortune magazine. Bloomberg documented debt of at least $605 million in 2016.

The crisis was propagated around the world because of poor risk management such as agency problems in the securitization market, poor rating and pricing standards, rating agency incentives, lack of market transparency, the search for higher yields by top decision makers and the failure of regulators and central banks to understand the implications of the changing environment.

What is most striking however is not so much that current easy credit conditions permit the marketing of synthetic CDOs and similar "risky" products, but that financial instruments with potentially systemic importance have not received the same level of attention from legislators and supervisors as Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) and systemically important financial infrastructure, or markets.

40|$|Robert Alexy’s 2013 Natural Law Lecture, {{published}} in vol. 58 of the American Journal of Jurisprudence, presents law as having two dimensions, ideal and real, {{and thus a}} dual nature, to be elucidated by a conceptual analysis distinguishing between the observer’s and the participant’s perspective. It argues on this basis for a “non-positivist” theory of law that is “inclusive” in that it classifies some unjust laws as laws, but not all (and is thus not “super-inclusive”); it rejects the “exclusive non-positivism” that would treat every injustice in a law’s making or content as excluding it from the class of valid laws. Gustav Radbruch’s famous post-War formula [...] extreme injustice invalidates law [...] adopted in the jurisprudence of Germany’s higher courts, is thus to be defended as expressing the inclusive non-positivism that articulates the best concept of law that can be constructed and defended as expedient. Alexy’s 2013 article classifies the theory in Natural Law and Natural Rights as super-inclusive, but sees hopeful signs of inclusive non-positivism in some recent writings of its author. The present article, which is {{published in}} Am. J. Juris. 59 (2014), argues that Natural Law and Natural Rights defends, in a sense, all three “non-positivist” positions, each in its proper place as a truth about unjust law: it is (from an observer’s perspective) a fact; it is (from a participant’s perspective) deprived by any significant injustice of law’s generic and presumptive status (legal-moral validity) {{as a reason for}} action; and it is (from the perspective of particular participants in their circumstances) sometimes, despite its injustice and legal-moral invalidity, a source (by virtue of both the foregoing truths taken with other moral responsibilities and needs) of <b>collateral</b> <b>obligations</b> the extent of which is likely, often, to track, approximately, the results of applying the Radbruch formula. The article argues against Alexy’s theoretical procedures both of conceptual analysis and of concept construction, regrets the “non-positivist/positivist” labeling, raises doubts about speaking of duality of dimensions and nature, and notes the significance of the 2013 article’s further thesis that any injustice in a law impairs (“qualifies”) its legal status...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the opaqueness of {{structured}} bonds, such as mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and <b>collateral</b> debt <b>obligations,</b> was one of the major causes of the recent financial crisis that started in late 2007. We analyse the evolving nature of information asymmetry inherent in various types of structured bonds by examining the U. S. insurers’ assets. We show that, prior to 2004, structured bonds were not associated with greater information asymmetry; however, holding more multi-class structured bonds, especially privately placed bonds, increased the information asymmetry when evaluating insurers’ assets post- 2004. The effect of information asymmetry was more significant with life insurers than with non-life insurers. In addition, by investigating the rating grades of such structured bonds, we find that the market views higher-grade, privately placed, multi-class structured bonds as having the highest information asymmetry among all types of structured bonds post 2004, an effect which is, again, more significant with life insurers. This result shows that structuring complexities and unreliable ratings make structured bonds more opaque than just securitisation itself...|$|R
40|$|Ambivalence in the {{regulatory}} definition of capital adequacy for credit risk has recently steered {{the financial services}} industry to <b>collateral</b> loan <b>obligations</b> (CLOs) as an important balance sheet management tool. CLOs represent a specialised form of Asset-Backed Securitisation (ABS), with investors acquiring a structured claim on the interest proceeds generated from a portfolio of bank loans {{in the form of}} tranches with different seniority. By way of modelling Merton-type risk-neutral asset returns of contingent claims on a multi-asset portfolio of corporate loans in a CLO transaction, we analyse the optimal design of loan securitisation from the perspective of credit risk in potential collateral default. We propose a pricing model that draws on a careful simulation of expected loan loss based on parametric bootstrapping through extreme value theory (EVT). The analysis illustrates the dichotomous effect of loss cascading, as the most junior tranche of CLO transactions exhibits a distinctly different default tolerance compared to the remaining tranches. By solving the puzzling question of properly pricing the risk premium for expected credit loss, we explain the rationale of first loss retention as credit risk cover on the basis of our simulation results for pricing purposes under the impact of asymmetric information...|$|R
40|$|Elements of {{the scheme}} In May, the German {{government}} has {{decided on the}} draft of a law for establishing so-called “Bad Banks ” (Bundesregierung 2009). The draft has the following core elements: 1. Banks (or financial holdings or their subsidiaries) may establish a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to which they can transfer structured assets – such as asset backed securities (ABS), <b>collateral</b> debt <b>obligations</b> (CDO) or collateralized loan obligations (CLO). These assets must have been acquired before Jan. 1, 2009. 2. In exchange, the transferring bank (from now on just “bank”) receives securities of the SPV which are guaranteed by the German state through the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (“SoFFin”). The bank pays a guarantee fee to SoFFin. 3. As a rule, the transfer of assets is {{made on the basis}} of 90 per cent of the book value in the bank’s balance sheet. 4. The bank has to supply information on the current time value of the asset, which has to be confirmed by an independent expert and by the banking supervisory authority. On the basis of this information and additional risk considerations, SoFFin determines a fundamenta...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Credit {{contagion}} {{arises when}} a company is in economic distress or if it defaults. The default of a company will have implications for any firm that is economically connected to this given company. The effect of the default, and thus {{the effect of the}} credit contagion, depends on which economic relation the defaulting company has with other firms. Default is an element of credit risk. Modeling credit risk is importaint {{when it comes to the}} modeling of derivative pricing, such as the prices of credit default swaps, (CDS), and <b>collateral</b> debt <b>obligations,</b> (CDO). These forms of derivatives have been largely talked about during the latest financial crisis since, among others, credit rating agencies (which evaluate the default probability of issuers of debt securities) failed to adequately account for large risks when rating these products. There are roughly two approaches to model credit risk; structural modeling and intensity based modeling. In the intensity based models (also known as reduced form models) default is typically described as a jump time of a jump process (for instance a Poisson process). This thesis is looking at one contagion model in discrete time and one in continuous time, where both are intensity based models. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{a sign of}} ambivalence in the {{regulatory}} definition of capital adequacy for credit risk {{and the quest for}} more efficient refinancing sources <b>collateral</b> loan <b>obligations</b> (CLOs) have become a prominent securitisation mechanism. This paper presents a loss-based asset pricing model for the valuation of constituent tranches within a CLO-style security design. The model specifically examines how tranche subordination translates securitised credit risk into investment risk of issued tranches as beneficial interests on a designated loan pool typically underlying a CLO transaction. We obtain a tranchespecific term structure from an intensity-based simulation of defaults under both robust statistical analysis and extreme value theory (EVT). Loss sharing between issuers and investors according to a simplified subordination mechanism allows issuers to decompose securitised credit risk exposures into a collection of default sensitive debt securities with divergent risk profiles and expected investor returns. Our estimation results suggest a dichotomous effect of loss cascading, with the default term structure of the most junior tranche of CLO transactions (“first loss position”) being distinctly {{different from that of the}} remaining, more senior “investor tranches”. The first loss position carries large expected loss (with high investor return) and low leverage, whereas all other tranches mainly suffer from loss volatility (unexpected loss). These findings might explain why issuers retain the most junior tranche as credit enhancement to attenuate asymmetric information between issuers and investors. At the same time, the issuer discretion in the configuration of loss subordination within particular security design might give rise to implicit investment risk in senior tranches in the event of systemic shocks.
