40|$|Abstract — In the {{practical}} power system, power plants {{are not at}} the same distance from the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> and their fuel costs are also different. Generally the power generation capacity {{is more than the}} total load demand and losses under normal operating conditions. Thus {{there is a need to}} find an effective real and reactive power scheduling to power plants to meet load demand as well as to minimize the operating cost. There are many Optimal Power Flow methods used to determine Optimal Dispatch of Power Generation and one such method is Newton method. This method is well-known in the area of Power Systems and provides a very powerful method because of its rapid convergence near the solution. This method will lead to an economic operation of the power plant and yields an economic dispatch of real power generation. As this is too slow, we proposed a soft computing based approach i. e. Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) for determining Optimal Dispatch of Power Generation. This method provides fast and accurate results compared with the above conventional method...|$|E
40|$|In {{the reality}} {{practical}} power system, power plants {{are not at}} the same distance from the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> and their fuel costs are different. Also, under normal operating condition the generation capacity {{is more than the}} total load demand and losses. Thus there is one main option for scheduling generation that is called optimal dispatch. Optimal dispatch of power generation is to find an effective real and reactive power scheduling to power plants to meet load demand as well as to minimize the operating cost. This cost function may present economic cost, system security and others but in this project, the analysis will limited to the economic dispatch of real power generation. This economic dispatch analysis has been studied by many researchers using different method. However this analysis is very difficult and takes much time to be done by hand calculations. The existence of this optimal dispatch of power generation software package will help the consumer to make this analysis done easier. This friendly software package will be a good medium for researcher to obtain optimal dispatch of power generation without really much effort on hand calculatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{was based on}} the hypothesis that the stochastic longitudinal profile of a flexible pavement by the stimulation of lorries' self-frequencies leads to irregular wheel load that causes an increase of amplitude in the area of self-frequency. Nine test sections of federal highways and provincial roads were identified as roads with pregnant corrugated deformation in their longitudinal profile. The highway assessment made in three measurement cycles contained the recording of longitudinal and transverse profiles, bearing capacity measurements and visual assessments. In addition core samples were taken and exploratory excavations had been made to characterise the different pavements. The comparative graphic evaluation of the unevenness of longitudinal profiles by a moving average of a length of 10 m with the bearing capacity longitudinal profiles {{as a result of the}} deflections in the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> leads to the following theses: Two of nine test sections showed tight relation between the unevenness longitudinal profile and the bearing capacity longitudinal profile. Comparing both profiles in one case there was a congenial in the other case a contrary development. Five of the remaining seven test sections showed that relationship too but in shorter terms; there were also congenial and contrary developments. The following attempts to prove the apparently particularly existing relations in some characteristics between the uneven and the bearing capacity longitudinal profiles in a mathematical way could not bring a satisfactory result. Due to the importance of the examined relationship for highway assessment and its analysis exploration should continue in a modified way. Therefore the exploration based on a wide range of test sections should contain nondestructive tests to examine the different layer thicknesses beside the highway assessment of unevenness and bearing capacity longitudinal profiles.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a series <b>of</b> cyclic plate <b>load</b> tests on a circular plate with diameter of 300 mm, supported on unreinforced and reinforced beds {{by one and}} two layers of geocell. The results show that, {{as the number of}} geocell layers increases, the loading surface settlement decreases due, in part, to better load spreading. The optimum depth of the uppermost geocell layer and of the geocell inter-layer spacing both were obtained 0. 2 times of plate diameter. Likewise, with {{increase in the number of}} geocell layers inside the foundation bed, the pressure transferred to depth, considerably decreases. For instance, at the end cycle of applied pressure of 800 kPa, the vertical stress transferred to a depth of 350 mm beneath the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> surface, is about 462. 8, 321. 9, 274. 3 kPa for unreinforced and reinforced bases with one and two layers of geocell, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{research}} is the horizontally balanced loading platform on soft suspension. Deviation from the horizontal direction of the platform can be caused by: - Displacement <b>of</b> the gravity <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> main unit <b>load</b> placed on it from the vertical axis of the platform; - Displacement <b>of</b> the mass <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> dispersed on the platform plane from its vertical axis; - Adding a load which gravity centre does not coincide with the gravity <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the main <b>load.</b> In specific cases the use of complex and expensive tracking systems of high accuracy to balance loading platforms horizontally can be justified, e. g. when mounting the optical measuring or observation systems on a platform. The aim is to assess the possibility to use the soft hydro-pneumatic suspension with a low power supply unit to provide horizontal balance of platform. The paper offers a soft hydro-pneumatic suspension design <b>of</b> the rectangular <b>loading</b> platform based on four differential hydraulic cylinders to be the supports for two diagonal beams of the platform. The head and rod ends of each pair of the beam hydro-cylinders are cross-pipe connected, and to compensate for {{a difference between the}} volumes of head and rod ends of cylinders because of their differentiality, there are hydraulic bag-type accumulators installed in the hydraulic suspension system. The research technique involves the development of a mathematical model <b>of</b> the <b>loading</b> platform hydro-pneumatic suspension followed by its approbation using numerical methods. The paper presents algorithms of engineering analysis of parameters and structural dimensions of hydraulic suspension components. In order to assess the adequacy of the developed mathematical model of a hydro-pneumatic suspension the paper studiesthe an effect of the following factors {{on the quality of the}} platform stabilization in the horizon:  initial volume values of the gas chamber of hydraulic accumulators;  pressure level of initial pressurization of hydraulic accumulators with nitrogen;  differentiality degree of the suspension cylinders;  value <b>of</b> the gravity <b>centre</b> displacement with respect to the vertical axis of platform;  additional <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> the platform by the load undisplaced with respect to the vertical axis of platform. In the context of calculating a hydro-pneumatic suspension <b>of</b> the platform <b>loading</b> diagonal beam <b>of</b> 2 m length, weighing 500 kg, with a <b>load</b> <b>of</b> 5, 000 kg was shown that at the greatest displacement <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> gravity <b>centre</b> to the edge of the beam a deviation of the beam relative to the horizon is one angular degree, at most. The work deals with creating the soft stabilized platform suspensions for stationary systems and mobile units. As a result, a developed mathematical model allows the following: - to show the theoretical possibility to create a soft hydro-pneumatic suspension <b>of</b> the <b>loading</b> platform based on four differential hydro-cylinders and four hydraulic accumulators to provide an acceptable accuracy <b>of</b> the <b>loading</b> platform balance in the horizon when the mass <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> placed on it is displaced with respect to the vertical axis of the platform; - to find that the initial stiffness of the hydro-pneumatic suspension, defined by parameters of its hydraulic system, has little effect on the quality of the platform balance in the horizon. </p...|$|R
40|$|In a {{practical}} power system, the power plants are not {{located at the}} same distance from the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> and their fuel costs are different. Also, under normal operating conditions, the generation capacity {{is more than the}} total load demand and losses. Thus, there are many options for scheduling generation. In an interconnected power system, the objective is to find the real and reactive power scheduling of each power plant {{in such a way as}} to minimize the operating cost. This means that the generator‟s real and reactive powers are allowed to vary within certain limits so as to meet a particular load demand with minimum fuel cost. This is called optimal power flow problem. In this project, ECONOMIC <b>LOAD</b> DISPATCH (ELD) <b>of</b> real power generation is considered. Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) is the scheduling of generators to minimize total operating cost of generator units subjected to equality constraint of power balance within the minimum and maximum operating limits of the generating units. In general by neglecting valve point loading effects, economic load dispatch can be solved either by lambda search or generation search (Pg) methods. In this project, valve point <b>loading</b> effects <b>of</b> the generating units are considered.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a methodology for designing slabs on grade for industrial floors {{where there is}} an eccentricity between the slab centroid and the gravity <b>centre</b> <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loaded</b> axle <b>of</b> forklift trucks travelling over the floor. An example was used for analysing how Portland Cement Association (PCA) and the Wire Reinforcement Institute (WRI) methods are inadequate for designing floors sublected to this condition. The new proposal for designing slabs on grade for industrial floors {{has been called the}} Camero method. An example of an industrial floor designed to be capable of sustaining an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>load</b> applications (or 50 -year life) was compared to the results of the Camero method and PCA and WRI’s simplified methods. Industrial floors should be capable of sustaining an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>load</b> applications (50 -year life) if designed with the Camero method; on the other hand, if designed using PCA and WRI methods they will only last one year (in this example the number <b>of</b> axle <b>load</b> applications in a 1 -year period was equal to the number of allowable repetitions) because {{they will not be able}} to sustain an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>load</b> applications.

40|$|Structural Number (SN) is a {{well-known}} pavement index methodology derived from the product of structural layer coefficients, layer thicknesses and environmental (and drainage) factors. Subsequently, the Adjusted Structural Number (SNP) included {{the influence of the}} subgrade on pavement strength. The Pavement Number (PN) was recently developed in South Africa as an index similar to the SNP. However, in the PN calculation Equivalent Long Term Stiffness (ELTS) values are derived from material class inputs in a knowledge-based system. An approach to calculate the Effective Pavement Number (PNeff), is proposed which utilises the full deflection bowl more effectively in the calculation. It uses the Shape Factor (F 1) to determine equivalent layer thickness (He) and FWD deflections at offset of 300 mm from the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>loading</b> to derive Surface Modulus (SM) inputs for calculating an ELTS value representing the total pavement structure, SMpav. The product of the He and SMpav thus provides a derived PNeff value. A large database of flexible pavements was used to successfully validate this approach. It is demonstrated that PNeff, thus derived from the utilisation of the full deflection bowl and without detailed information of pavement layer thicknesses can be used to complement initial or preliminary structural evaluation. It is illustrated how PNeff is used in a benchmark methodology with FWD surveys. The well established FWD deflection bowl structural benchmark analysis method can then further enhance this preliminary structural analysis with PNeff by assisting in a preliminary analysis and helping to determine origin of distress. Hereafter detailed structural analyses can follow with detailed material type and pavement layer information in a much more focussed fashion.

40|$|In this paper, {{following}} the research line proposed by Signorini (1925) and previously by Milankovicth (1910), a semi-analytical approach {{for the analysis}} of masonry walls - treated as horizontally multi-layered strata of no-tension material - is proposed in order to evaluate the stress distribution generated by applied loads. The main applications concern walls subjected only to vertical loads, although it is assumed that a constitutive friction relationship is guaranteed along the horizontal joints, in the presence of horizontal actions. The goal is to identify in the masonry wall the actual bearing sub-structures by defining at each vertical and horizontal level the transversal sections generated by the unilateral behaviour. The method proposed will allow identifying the partition of the wall into macro elements, which depend on the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> applied <b>loads,</b> and wall and bricks geometrical features.

50|$|Many analysts use {{simplified}} {{methods to}} calculate related parameters that are empirical in nature. The most common is maximum deflection under the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> plate (D0) which {{is related to}} empirical measures such as the Benkelman Beam deflection (after minor adjustment for differences in the two devices). Historically some used the radius of curvature (D0-D200) but this is out of favour now because {{it is clear that}} the steel <b>loading</b> plate <b>of</b> 300mm diameter affects the shape of the deflection bowl between the centre (D0) and the D200 sensor at 200mm. However this means that a lot of useful information about the shape of the deflected bowl is wasted. Horak and Emery have published indices that use this information: BLI=D0-D300 and gives an indication of the basecourse performance, MLI = D300-D600 and gives an indication of the subbase performance, and LLI=D600-D900 and gives an indication of subgrade performance. These and other similar indices are known as shape factors. The FWD data can also be very useful in helping the engineer divide the length of the pavement into homogeneous sections.|$|R

The scope of the study included the comparison of subgrade CBR predictions from the three deflection based models and the predictions were verified using the in-situ CBR values derived from Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) from eleven pavement test sites. The study shows that the three models over predict the subgrade CBR because the deflections recorded at sensor D 900 are consistently small. It is observed the impact load has little influence on the deflection at D 900 for pavements with asphalt layer less than 50 mm. The inherent non-linearity behaviour of the thin pavement structure is also the reason for the discrepancies in the predictions.

40|$|Skidder {{mobility}} during timber extraction {{is defined}} by: 1) basic dimensional {{features of the}} vehicle, 2) ability to overcome obstacles during movement, 3) traction performance and 4) environmental soundness. Traction performance depends on the ground conditions (soil bearing capacity) and the total effect of all forces on the vehicle. In downhill skidding, the skidder is under great influence of parallel component of forces, adhesion weight and longitudinal terrain slope, which combined result in negative traction force, torque and thrust force. When the horizontal component of rope force is equal to zero i. e. {{the moment when the}} weight <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> and resistance to traction are in equilibrium, the slope angle α is a function <b>of</b> <b>load</b> mass distribution factor and skidding resistance factor. This is a »turning point« that can be defined as a critical slope because the load starts to push the vehicle downhill, which results in negative horizontal component of rope force. Depending on skidder Ecotrac 120 V dimensional features, <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> gravity, <b>load</b> mass distribution factor, skidding resistance factor of previous research, five different loads were analyzed (1 to 5 tonnes) in order to define the critical slope angle for each of them. Critical slope for downhill skidding of 1 tonne timber is on longitudinal slope of – 26 %, for 2 tonne timber on – 30 %, 3 tonne timber on – 34 %, 4 timber on – 38 % and for 5 tonne timber on – 43 % of terrain longitudinal slope. Even though skidding bigger load increases vehicle mobility to even greater slope angles, the most important in downhill skidding, is to avoid blocking of the wheels, which will lead to a complete vehicle slippage and the driver must be constantly aware of that fact. The general recommendation should be that skidding small loads (1 to 3 tonnes) downhill is suitable for smaller longitudinal terrain slopes (up to maximum – 34 %), while the heavier the load, the further down the slope the skidder can go. The <b>load</b> <b>of</b> 5 tonnes »anchors« the skidder better and therefore it can go on terrain slopes up to – 43 %, during which less traction force is used (torque is used for braking) and skidder pulls the load by its own weight. It can be concluded that extending the operating range of skidder onto steeper slopes with heavier loads has the potential to decrease harvesting costs and increase productivity...|$|R
