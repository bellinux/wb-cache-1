The Boy Club continued until the end of 1988. From 1988 to 1992 many fun events were held at the I-Beam such as strip contests and appearances by gay porn stars such as Lou Cass. Beginning in 1988, there was a hip-hop dance club that appealed to the African Americans in the neighborhood. In 1989, the year rave dances first started in San Francisco, Wednesday night became Acid house Night at the I-Beam.|$|R
50|$|The cave-in {{problem was}} solved by {{the method of}} square set timbering invented by Philip Deidesheimer, a German mining {{engineer}} from San Francisco, who had been requested to survey the problem by {{the owners of the}} Ophir Mine. Previously, timber sets consisting of vertical members {{on either side of the}} diggings (ribs) capped by a third horizontal member to support the back (roof), creating a tunnel (drift). However, the Comstock ore bodies were not veins, but sporadic pockets too large for this method. Instead, as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a <b>cube</b> six <b>feet</b> on a side (ribs), front (face) or top (back), all at the same time. Thus, the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice. Often these voids (stopes) would be re-filled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete. By this method of building up squares of framed timbers, an ore body of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth. Deidesheimer was appointed to the Ophir as mine manager for his ingenious idea.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that most of the myths tested in this episode were confirmed, the MythBusters warned that not all viral videos are what they appear. They posted their version of the hoax Rubik's Cube viral videos online that showed Adam solving a Rubik's <b>Cube</b> with his <b>feet</b> while Jamie solved one blindfolded. In reality, they started with solved cubes and just {{manipulated}} them randomly. They then ran the footage backwards in order to give the illusion that they solved the puzzles. The illusion was partially achieved by having a crewmember walk backwards in the background so he would appear to walk normally in the final video.|$|R

Alternatively the painted ceiling {{and its surrounding}} decoration (including the presence of rats and snakes) {{can be interpreted as}} having a Masonic program, as dividers, set-squares, T-Squares and plumb lines were important Masonic symbols of morality. The putto to the left of ‘Architecture’ holds his finger to his lips suggesting silence or secrecy - a gesture mimicking the Egyptian child god of silence, Harpocrates. The idea that this room could have been used for initiation into Masonic mysteries is further supported by the proportions of this room as a perfect <b>cube</b> measuring 15x15x15 <b>feet</b> - the equivalent of 10 cubits by 10 cubits by 10 cubits, the stated dimensions of the Holy of Holies within Moses' Tabernacle according to the Bible.|$|R
40|$|The Landing and Impact Research Facility (LandIR) at NASA Langley Research Center is a 240 ft. high A-frame {{structure}} {{which is}} used for full-scale crash testing of aircraft and rotorcraft vehicles. Because the LandIR provides a unique capability to introduce impact velocities in the forward and vertical directions, it is also serving as the facility for landing tests on full-scale and sub-scale Orion spacecraft mass simulators. Recently, a three-dimensional photogrammetry system was acquired {{to assist with the}} gathering of vehicle flight data before, throughout and after the impact. This data provides the basis for the post-test analysis and data reduction. Experimental setups for pendulum swing tests on vehicles having both forward and vertical velocities can extend to 50 x 50 x 50 <b>foot</b> <b>cubes,</b> while weather, vehicle geometry, and other constraints make each experimental setup unique to each test. This paper will discuss the specific calibration techniques for large fields of views, camera and lens selection, data processing, as well as best practice techniques learned from using the large field of view photogrammetry on a multitude of crash and landing test scenarios unique to the LandIR...|$|R

A 4 <b>foot</b> <b>cube,</b> graphite moderating assembly was con­structed at the M. I. T. Rockefeller Van de Graaff accelerator. Using the pulsed neutron experimental installation, a neutron burst of 200 nsec width was injected {{into the center of the}} assembly. Prompt gamma radiation from a neutron resonance capture by an indicator foil in the moderator was measured with a 3 inch x 3 inch sodium iodide scintillation detector, as a function of time after the neu­tron pulse. The energy dependence of slowing down time was experimentally measured by using resonance absorber foils of cadmium, indium, and gold with isolated resonances of 0. 2, 1. 46 and 5. 0 eV respectively. By varying the distance of the foil from the source, the spatial dependence of slowing down time was also investigated. Comparisons are made with slowing down theory. The experimental results, together with their estimated uncertainties are tabulated. (Original abstract includes table of results unable to replicate here) [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

Phidias can niche {{himself into}} the corner of a pediment, and Raffaelle expatiate within the {{circumference}} of a clay platter; but Pugin is inexpressible in less than a cathedral? Let his ineffableness be assured of this, once for all, that no difficulty or restraint ever happened to a man of real power, but his power was the more manifested in the contending with, or conquering it; and that there is no field so small, no cranny so contracted, but that a great spirit can house and manifest itself therein. The thunder that smites the Alp into dust, can gather itself into the width of a golden wire.

St. George's was not high enough for want of money? But was it want of money that made you put that blunt, overloaded, laborious ogee door into the side of it? Was it for lack of funds that you sunk the tracery of the parapet in its clumsy zigzags? Was it in parsimony that you buried its paltry pinnacles in that eruption of diseased crockets? or in pecuniary embarrassment that you set up the belfry foolscaps, with the mimicry of dormer windows, which nobody can ever reach nor look out of?

40|$|As part of {{the seismic}} upgrade at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), it was {{necessary}} to provide horizontal support at the second floor level of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building. A steel strut connected these points to an anchor at the ground line. Two methods of anchoring the strut at the ground were considered in this initial study (AGRA, 1994). One solution was a 12 <b>foot</b> <b>cube</b> of concrete, equal in weight to the vertical upward force. That solution provided acceptable Demand/Capacity (D/C) ratios. The other method considered was a 4 foot diameter drilled caisson, 30 feet deep. The deflection at the second story support was too large, using this method, and second floor concrete members had D/C ratios greater than unity (overstressed). Using the cube as an anchor would cost in excess of $ 100, 000 more than the estimated cost for the caissons. The caisson design {{is the subject of this}} paper. Although neither of the authors are geotechnical engineers, the senior author has 30 years experience working with the volcanic tuff in the Los Alamos area. Whenever unusual situations arose, the senior author worked in concert with geotechnical firms to arrive at reasonable engineering solutions. In the case of lateral loading on caissons in volcanic tuff, there was a steep learning curve for both the authors and for their geotechnical counterparts to measure and apply the known properties of the volcanic tuff. In this paper the knowledge gained during the development of the initial report and that learned to date will be shared...|$|R

6000|$|... 1173. I carried these {{experiments}} on with air {{to a very}} great extent. I had a chamber built, being a <b>cube</b> of twelve <b>feet.</b> A slight cubical wooden frame was constructed, and copper wire passed along and across it in various directions, {{so as to make}} the sides a large net-work, and then all was covered in with paper, placed in close connexion with the wires, and supplied in every direction with bands of tin foil, that the whole might be brought into good metallic communication, and rendered a free conductor in every part. This chamber was insulated in the lecture-room of the Royal Institution; a glass tube about six feet in length was passed through its side, leaving about four feet within and two feet on the outside, and through this a wire passed from the large electrical machine (290.) to the air within. By working the machine, the air in this chamber could be brought into what is considered a highly electrified state (being, in fact, the same state as that of the air of a room in which a powerful machine is in operation), {{and at the same time}} the outside of the insulated cube was everywhere strongly charged. But putting the chamber in communication with the perfect discharging train described in a former series (292.), and working the machine so as to bring the air within to its utmost degree of charge if I quickly cut off the connexion with the machine, and at the same moment or instantly after insulated the cube, the air within had not the least power to communicate a further charge to it. If any portion of the air was electrified, as glass or other insulators may be charged (1171.), it was accompanied by a corresponding opposite action within the cube, the whole effect being merely a case of induction. Every attempt to charge air bodily and independently with the least portion of either electricity failed.|$|R
