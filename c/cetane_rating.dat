25|$|One {{study found}} that during {{atomization}} biodiesel and its blends produced droplets were greater in diameter than the droplets produced by traditional petrodiesel. The smaller droplets were attributed to the lower viscosity and surface tension of traditional petrol. It was found that droplets at {{the periphery of the}} spray pattern were larger in diameter than the droplets at the center this was attributed to the faster pressure drop {{at the edge of the}} spray pattern; there was a proportional relationship between the droplet size and the distance from the injector tip. It was found that B100 had the greatest spray penetration, this was attributed to the greater density of B100. Having a greater droplet size can lead to; inefficiencies in the combustion, increased emissions, and decreased horse power. In another study it was found that there is a short injection delay when injecting biodiesel. This injection delay was attributed to the greater viscosity of Biodiesel. It was noted that the higher viscosity and the greater <b>cetane</b> <b>rating</b> of biodiesel over traditional petrodiesel lead to poor atomization, as well as mixture penetration with air during the ignition delay period. Another study noted that this ignition delay may aid in a decrease of NOx emission.|$|E
50|$|The fuel is {{slightly}} less dense than regular diesel so, per volume, the unit energy is actually lower than regular diesel. This is offset, as the fuel tends to ignite more readily (and thus {{has a higher}} <b>cetane</b> <b>rating)</b> than regular diesel, and a side benefit {{of this is that}} it tends to produce less soot during combustion.|$|E
50|$|Biodiesel {{is similar}} to diesel, but has {{differences}} akin to those between petrol and ethanol. For instance, biodiesel has a higher <b>cetane</b> <b>rating</b> (45-60 compared to 45-50 for crude-oil-derived diesel) and it acts as a cleaning agent {{to get rid of}} dirt and deposits. It has been argued that it only becomes economically feasible above oil prices of $80 (£40 or €60 as of late February, 2007) per barrel. This does however depend on locality, economic situation, government stance on biodiesel {{and a host of other}} factors- and it has been proven to be viable at much lower costs in some countries. Also, it yields about 10% less energy than ordinary diesel. Analogous to the use of higher compression ratios used for engines burning higher octane alcohols and petrol in spark-ignition engines, taking advantage of biodiesel's high <b>cetane</b> <b>rating</b> can potentially overcome the energy deficit compared to ordinary Number 2 diesel.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} times' fatty acid methyl ester popularly called as {{biodiesel}} {{has become more}} prominent alternate fuel {{for compression ignition engines}} based on a single fuel concept. Since, use of neat biodiesel on a large scale is raising certain difficulties and is being adopted in a blended form with petro-diesel fuel and B 20 blend has become standardized. However, the HC and NOx emissions of B 20 are still on the higher side. Present work aims at experimental evaluation of a single cylinder water-cooled diesel engine by adopting various proportions of ethanol and diethyl ether blends in order to improve performance and emission characteristics of B 20 blend. Besides employing different amounts of ethanol and diethyl ether, simultaneous influence of injector nozzle hole size and fuel injection pressure are also investigated to arrive at an optimum configuration. Brake specific fuel consumption and hydrocarbon emissions values are lower with B 20 and DEE 5 whereas B 20 with DEE 15 yielded lower NOx emissions. It is observed that addition of oxygenates have improved the combustion process and lower emissions are obtained.

40|$|The use {{of ethanol}} blend with diesel fuel in a {{compression}} ignition engine has some potential on exhaust black smoke reduction. However, lower energy content of ethanol and lower <b>cetane</b> <b>rating</b> of the blend tend to increase ignition delay and reduce engine efficiency.

In this study, this investigation had the object, to get more knowledge on the characteristics of an OEM high-speed Light Duty IDI Diesel engine operating with diesohol. Comparative analysis of engine performance and fuel consumption characteristics, such as torque and power output, fuel and energy consumption, operating pressures and temperatures, combustion chamber pressures between engine fuelled with diesohol and diesel are reported in this paper. Measurements of the cylinder pressures were taken in the engine operating points according to ECE R 49 (13 mode test), all other measurements were carried out in the whole engine operating range. In particular, the experimental investigation has performed a careful analysis of heat release, which has made it possible to give more precise comparative information about the combustion process. 1...|$|E
40|$|The ternary phase {{behaviour}} of the n-heptane-l-propanol-water {{system was}} studied and {{compared with the}} theoretical prediction based on the UNIQUAC model for non-electrolyte solutions. The results showed that this model adequately approximated experimental studies. The excess enthalpies and excess volumes for several binary mixtures were determined. The excess enthalpies were measured using a LKB flow microcalorimeter and the excess -volumes determined using a PAAR densitometer. The study showed that no significant enthalpy or volume changes occurred when petrol/n-heptane were mixed with alcohols. Ternary phase diagrams, including tie lines have been determined {{for a number of}} petrol-alcohol-water systems (including the Sasol blend of alcohols). The tie line results show that the concentration of water in the water-rich layer is strongly dependent on the type of alcohol used. The Sasol alcohol blended with petrol resulted in a high water concentration in the water-rich layer which forms on phase separation. This is believed to contribute significantly to the corrosion problems experienced by motorists using the Sasol blended fuel on the Witwatersrand. The effect of temperature on several of these blends was included in the study. Diesel-alcohol blends and the co-solvent properties of ethyl acetate investigated. Ethyl acetate ensures miscibility at low concentrations for diesel-ethanol blends. Octyl nitrate and two cetane improvers from AECI were assessed in terms of their ability to restore <b>cetane</b> <b>rating</b> of blended diesel fuel to that of pure diesel fuel.

40|$|Having low {{aromatic}} compounds, high <b>cetane</b> <b>rating,</b> higher {{heat of combustion}} {{and almost}} zero sulphur content, a new paraffinic fuel (NPF), developed by Oroboros AB Sweden, was believed to receive attention as a new alternative fuel. Therefore, further investigation and combustion analyses were conducted in a research single-cylinder diesel engine, where detailed thermodynamic analyses were performed by Burst to File high frequency signal sampling code and by the Dragon software, revealing the real thermochemistry history. The aim {{of this investigation was}} an effort to reduce the pollution levels in Santiago de Chile by introducing this new paraffinic fuel (NPF). Experimental results have shown that the NPF fuel has a significant impact not only on the emission levels, but also on other energetic parameters of the engine such as ignition delay, cylinder peak pressure, heat release gradient, indicated efficiency etc. It is observed that NPF fuels have shorter ignition delay and longer combustion duration when compared with those obtained when the engine runs on standard Chilean fuel (SCF) at the same operating point. As shown by the evaluated rate of heat release in the premixed zone, the fraction of premixed combustion is larger for CSF fuel than for NPF fuel. This is an indication for smooth engine running, lower combustion rate, and lower NOx formation. As a complement to this, in-cylinder processes with lower peak pressure and earlier location are more favourable when the engine runs on NPF. It may be stated that NPF, which is a selected optimised C chain-length variation mixture [2], [3], [4], can be used in unmodified compression ignition engines with significant reduction of regulated emission (NOx, HC, CO, CO 2), soot, fuel consumption and smoother thermodynamic characteristics. Therefore, the NPF might be considered as a strong competitive alternative fuel...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Fischer Tropsch (F-T) diesel fuel is a high quality fuel, and therefore it has received attention as a low emission alternative fuel. Having low aromatic compounds, high <b>cetane</b> <b>rating</b> and almost zero sulfur content, the F-T diesel fuel shows advantages over conventional diesel fuel. However, in order to generalize such deductions and to fill the confirmation gaps, further investigation and combustion analysis have to be conducted. The aim of this investigation was to reveal and analyze the effects of the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) fuels on a research diesel engine performance. Since the engine performance is closely related to in-cylinder processes, a detailed thermodynamic analysis is performed by Burst to File high frequency sampling code and by the Dragon software, revealing the real thermochemistry history. This program has been tested on thousands of measured points and is today regularly used while analyzing test results from the single cylinder diesel engine. Experimental results have shown that F-T fuels have a remarkable impact not only on the emissions levels, but also on other energetic parameters of the engine. Heat release analysis (evaluated according to the “Dragon” software program and acquisition from “Burst to File” PC based sampling system) have shown that ignition delay, cylinder peak pressure, heat release gradient and indicated efficiency are affected as well. As F-T fuels have some other combustion characteristics than conventional diesel fuels, the most expected effect would be observed on emission levels, particularly on NOx and soot formation. However, it was observed that other emissions such as HC and CO were remarkably affected as well. Also, a combination of the different F-T fuels mixture would lead to a better engine performance and lower emission levels. Therefore, different mixtures of the F-T fuels characterized by C chain-length variation were tested and their results were compared with those obtained from conventional fuel (MK 1). The selected optimized F-T fuels mixture was further tested at 13 mode ECE test cycle and is considered as a good competitive alternative diesel fuel...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{two-stage}} hydrotreating of bitumen-derived {{light gas}} oil (LGO) from Athabasca oil sands was studied. The {{objective was to}} catalytically upgrade the LGO by reducing the aromatics content and enhancing the cetane content via inter-stage removal of hydrogen sulfide. The impact of hydrogen sulfide inhibition on aromatics hydrogenation (HDA), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodesulfirization (HDS) activities was investigated. Experiments {{for this study were}} carried out in a trickle-bed reactor loaded with commercial NiMo/Al 2 O 3 and lab-prepared NiW/Al 2 O 3 in the stage I and stage II reactors, respectively. Temperature was varied from 350 to 390 oC at the optimum LHSV and pressure conditions of 0. 6 h- 1 and 11. 0 MPa, respectively. The results from two-stage process showed significant improvement in HDA, <b>cetane</b> <b>rating</b> and HDS activities compared to the single-stage process after the inter-stage removal of hydrogen sulfide. Hence, the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the reaction retarded both the HDA and HDS processes in the single-stage operation. Negligible hydrogen sulfide inhibition was however, observed in the HDN process. Prior to the two-stage hydrotreating study, single-stage hydrotreating reactions were carried out over commercial NiMo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst to determine the optimum operating conditions for maximizing hydrogenation of aromatics. A statistical approach via the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique was used to develop regression models for predicting the conversion of aromatics, sulfur and nitrogen in the LGO feed. Experiments were performed at the following operating conditions: temperature (340 - 390 oC); pressure (6. 9 - 12. 4 MPa) and liquid hourly space velocity, LHSV (0. 5 - 2. 0 h- 1). Hydrogen-to-oil ratio was maintained constant at 550 ml/ml. The results showed that the two-level interaction between temperature and pressure was the only significant interaction parameter affecting HDA while interaction between temperature and LHSV was the most important parameter affecting both HDS and HDN activities. A maximum 63 % HDA was obtained at 379 oC, 11. 0 MPa and 0. 6 h- 1. Experiments with NiW/Al 2 O 3 were also performed in a single-stage reactor with LGO blend feedstock by varying temperature from 340 - 390 oC at the optimum pressure and space velocity of 11. 0 MPa and 0. 6 h- 1, respectively. The following order of ease of hydrogenation was observed: poly- > di- >> monoaromatics. The order of ease of hydrogenation in other LGO feedstocks (atmospheric light gas oil, ALGO; hydrocrack light gas oil, HLGO; and vacuum light gas oil, VLGO) was studied and found to follow the order: VLGO > ALHO > HLGO. Studies on mild hydrocracking (MHC) in the gas oil feedstocks showed a net increase in gasoline with a corresponding decrease in diesel with increasing temperature. Both the single and two-stage HDA and HDS kinetics were modeled using Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate equations. These models predicted the experimental data with reasonable accuracy. The degree of conversion of the gas oil fractions in ALGO, HLGO and VLGO via mild hydrocracking was best described by a pseudo-first order kinetic model based on a parallel conversion scheme...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) simulationsof diesel engine combustion of unconventional fuels. The fuels are: A diesel/gasoline blend, di-methyltetrahydrofurane (2 -MTHF), a blend of 2 -MTHF and di-n-butylether (DnBE), n-octane, DnBE, and n-octanol. Experimental data from two different diesel engine test benches are available for comparison and validation of the simulations. Good results regarding pressure traces, heat release rates, and pollutant emissions are obtained. Fuel property effects are analyzed individually and detailed insights into the interdependencies of fuel molecular structure and combustion behavior are gained. Simulations are perfomed using the Representative Interactive Flamelet (RIF) model, which has been applied in many studies modeling compression ignitionin internal combustion engines. By the use of detailed chemical reaction mechanisms, the RIF model inherently accounts for low and high temperature auto-ignition, heat release, and pollutant formation. For simulation of the novel fuels in this study, the modeling approaches had to be adapted and assumptions had to be reassessed. To validate the spray representation and to set the model parameters of the liquid breakup model, simulations of a spray vessel experiment using several fuels are performed and compared to the respective experimental data. The first fuel to be analyzed by simulation and experiment is a diesel/gasoline blend. Here, the experimental aim {{is to reduce the}} ignitability of the fuel to enable longer premixing duration and thus low temperature combustion. This presents a step towards tailoring a fuel’s properties to the requirementsof the combustion system. A surrogate fuel blend is used to describe there action chemistry of the diesel/gasoline blend, which is a common modeling approach for complex liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The surrogate composition is chosen to match several kinetic properties of the fuel blend. Increased emissions of carbon monoxide and rather high emissions of nitrogen oxides are observed experimentally. The simulations show where these originate, how this is related to the modified fuel properties, and how the emissions could possibly be reduced. The next two fuels in this study are neat di-methyltetrahydrofurane (2 -MTHF) and a blend of 2 -MTHF and di-n-butylether (DnBE). As biofuel candidates, these fuels have a very promising performance in the diesel engine experiments. Their reaction chemistry is described by a surrogate mixture, which represents a new aspect to a reaction chemistry surrogate. Here, not a mixture of hundreds or thousands of hydrocarbons is modeled by a reducedset of fuels, like for the diesel/gasoline blend above, but one single and one dual component fuel with only roughly known reaction chemistry are modeled by a well defined mixture of fuel components. The methodology to define this mixture is described in detail. Comparisons with diesel engine experiments and homogeneous reactor experiments confirm the approach and the methodology to define the surrogate composition, and demonstrate that the approach allows for insights into the pollutant formation processes in the engine. The final set of fuels in this study are three n-C 8 fuels, namely n-octane, DnBE, and n-octanol. These fuels feature very similar molecular structures, but very different spray formation, ignition, and combustion properties. As such, they present an example to understand the influence of small changes in molecular structure on the combustion behavior. For the simulations oft hese fuels, detailed reaction mechanisms are used. Results are analyzed to investigate the effects of mixture formation, fuel stoichiometry, and reaction chemistry individually. Pollutant emissions are found to be mainly dependent on the time available for premixing of the charge, as reflected by the cetaneratings of the fuels. The substantially lower <b>cetane</b> <b>rating</b> of n-octanol compared to n-octane is explained by analysis of engine simulations and homogeneous reactor calculations. These fuels have similar ignition delay times in homogeneous reactor experiments, but quite different ignition behavior in engine relevant conditions. This is shown to be a strong effect of the fuel’s stoichiometries, rather than being related to the very different spray properties of the fuels...|$|E
