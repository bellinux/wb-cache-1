When considering TC alone, grant support for knowledge and capacity building products increased by 30 % in 2010, demonstrating the Bank's renewed commitment to help borrowing countries further these goals. TC grants were fully incorporated into nearly all country programming exercises, thus more closely aligning with Country Strategy goals...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Universal {{coverage}} {{of health care}} is now receiving substantial worldwide and national attention, but debate continues on the best mix of <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> especially to protect people outside the formal employment sector. Crucial issues are the equity implications of different <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and patterns of service use. We report a whole-system analysis [...] integrating {{both public and private}} sectors [...] of the equity of health-system financing and service use in Ghana, South Africa, and Tanzania. METHODS We used primary and secondary data to calculate the progressivity of each health-care <b>financing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> catastrophic spending on health care, and the distribution of health-care benefits. We collected qualitative data to inform interpretation. FINDINGS Overall health-care financing was progressive in all three countries, as were direct taxes. Indirect taxes were regressive in South Africa but progressive in Ghana and Tanzania. Out-of-pocket payments were regressive in all three countries. Health-insurance contributions by those outside the formal sector were regressive in both Ghana and Tanzania. The overall distribution of service benefits in all three countries favoured richer people, although the burden of illness was greater for lower-income groups. Access to needed, appropriate services was the biggest challenge to universal coverage in all three countries. INTERPRETATION Analyses of the equity of financing and service use provide guidance on which <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to expand, and especially raise questions over the appropriate <b>financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the health care of people outside the formal sector. Physical and financial barriers to service access must be addressed if universal coverage is to become a reality. FUNDING European Union and International Development Research Centre...|$|R

AUTHOR: Lenka Hrubčíková DEPARTMENT: Centre of School Management SUPERVISOR: RNDr. Jana Marková ABSTRACT: My final thesis deals with methods of budget making for projects co-financed from ESF and other sources. It deals with description and categorization of individual grant programmes, methods of project management, categorization of costs depending on grant supplier. It warns against {{the most common}} mistakes in financing and carrying out projects. In the experimental part I {{try to find out}} how receiving grants influences attractiveness of the school and its economic situation and in which ways has <b>grant</b> <b>financing</b> been beneficial for schools. The aim of my thesis is to serve as a handbook for grant applicants and to give an overview of different possibilities of <b>grant</b> <b>financing</b> for secondary schools. The method used to write my thesis was mainly collecting information from various resources and from a questionnaire survey. My conclusion is that although the <b>grant</b> <b>financing</b> does not significantly improve the school finances and attractiveness, the schools should still apply for grants, because they provide important experience and better material equipment.

40|$|This {{comparative}} study concerning public superior education system finance {{has been accomplished}} in order to highlight the main public superior education system <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used in a few European countries considering a financing future model projection, {{able to make the}} public financing allocation for superior educational system more and more efficient. In the past, in Europe, the <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> had been involving negotiations between the public or private superior education institutions on the allocated funds, their calculation on the real costs supported by institutions and grants awarded, divided on budgetary categories. Nowadays, the public superior educational system <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> had suffered important kind of changes, if we consider the granted sums calculation formulas, as well as the measures for correlation of public financing quantum with the financed university performance. Each financing model presents strong points as well as weak ones, as there isn’t any perfect financing model which can be adapted to any country, because the choosing of the model usually implies a compromise between the different objectives that have to be reached by the higher education. Owed to public superior educational system financing system analysis from a few European countries (Romania, Great Britain, France, Denmark,), we may conclude that a perfect adaptable financing system for each European country doesn’t exist; the adaptability degree of these mechanisms depends on a different factors number, of a historic, social, legal, political and economical nature.

30|$|Issues in the <b>financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{appear to}} have arisen in another {{innovative}} initiative of this type. German private hospital group Asklepios recently worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to create a nurse migration partnership with Tunisia called the TaPIG Project. Groups of Tunisian students arrived in Hamburg in late 2012 and early 2013 for six months of German language and culture training (paid by the Foreign Affairs Ministry) {{to be followed by}} three years of apprenticeship training in nursing, paid by Asklepios. The <b>financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> involved an additional component of a student loan to cover other expenses of the students, such as room and board during the language and culture training. Complications with those loans {{appear to have}} led to suspension of new entries in the the TaPIG Project {{at the time of this}} writing (though Asklepios intends to continue the training of previous entrants). The TaPIG experience suggests that the precise <b>financing</b> <b>mechanism</b> may be critical to progress in arrangements of this genre.|$|R

Trained personnel were perceived to have inadequate skills. It was concluded that the average downtime was long compared to recommended durations. WPCs appeared functional while the <b>financing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were found to be poor for effective maintenance of boreholes.
