This paper describes a novel CAD system for the Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) test via Indirect Immunofluorescence protocol on Human Epithelial Type 2 (HEp- 2) cells. While prior works have primarily focused on classifying cell images extracted from ANA specimen images, this work takes a further step by focussing on the specimen image classification problem itself. Our system is able to efficiently classify specimen images as well as producing meaningful descriptions of ANA pattern class which helps physicians to understand the differences between various ANA patterns. We achieve this goal by designing a specimen-level image descriptor that: (1) is highly discriminative; (2) has small descriptor length and (3) is semantically meaningful at the cell level. In our work, a specimen image descriptor is represented by its overall <b>cell</b> <b>attribute</b> descriptors. As such, we propose two max-margin based learning schemes to discover cell attributes whilst still maintaining the discrimination of the specimen image descriptor. Our learning schemes differ from the existing discriminative attribute learning approaches as they primarily focus on discovering image-level attributes. Comparative evaluations were undertaken to contrast the proposed approach to various state-of-the-art approaches on a novel HEp- 2 cell dataset which was specifically proposed for the specimen-level classification. Finally, we showcase the ability of the proposed approach to provide textual descriptions to explain ANA patterns. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} a stem cell {{subpopulation}} as understood from normal epithelial tissue or bone marrow function has been extended {{to our understanding of}} cancer tissue and is now the target of treatment efforts specifically directed to this subpopulation. In glioblastoma, as well as in other cancers, increased expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) has been found localized within a minority sub-population of tumor cells which demonstrate stem cell properties. A separate body of research associated increased expression of heat-shock protein- 90 (HSP 90) with stem <b>cell</b> <b>attributes.</b> We present here results from our initial immunohistochemistry study of human glioblastoma biopsy tissue where both ALDH and HSP 90 tended to be co-expressed in high amounts in the same minority of cells. Since 12 % of all cells in the six biopsies studied were ALDH positive and 17 % were HSP 90 positive, by chance alone 2 % would have been expected to be positive for both. In fact 7 % of all cells simultaneously expressed both markers-a significant difference (p = 0. 037). That two previously identified proteins associated with stem <b>cell</b> <b>attributes</b> tend to be co-expressed in the same individual glioblastoma cells might have clinical utility. Disulfiram, used to treat alcoholism for half-a century now, is a potent ALDH inhibitor and the old anti-viral drug ritonavir inhibits HSP 90.

40|$|Cardiac {{hypertrophy}} {{is recognized}} as an independent risk factor for cardiac failure. Efficient management of hypertensive heart disease requires identification of factors that can possibly mediate the transition from hypertrophy to failure. Resident cardiac stem cells have {{a prominent role in}} the maintenance of cardiac tissue homeostasis. Decline in the proportion of healthy cardiac stem cells (CSCs) can affect tissue regeneration. In pathological conditions, apart from natural aging, an adverse microenvironment can lead to decrease in efficiency of CSCs. A systematic analysis of cardiac stem cell characteristics in pathological conditions has not been reported so far. Therefore, this study was designed with the objective of examining the age associated variation in stem <b>cell</b> <b>attributes</b> of Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) in comparison with normotensive Wistar rat. Spontaneously hypertensive rat was used as the experimental model since the cardiac remodeling resembles the clinical course of hypertensive heart disease. CSCs were isolated from atrial explants. Stem <b>cell</b> <b>attributes</b> were assessed in 1 -week, 6, 12 and 18 -month-old male SHR, in comparison with age matched Wistar rats. In 1 -week-old pups, stem <b>cell</b> <b>attributes</b> of SHR and Wistar were comparable. Migration potential, proliferative capacity, TERT expression, telomerase activity and the proportion of c-kit+ cells decreased with age, both in SHR and Wistar. DNA damage and the proportion of senescent CSCs increased with age both in SHR and Wistar rats. Age associated increase was observed in the oxidative stress of stem cells, possibly mediated by the enhanced oxidative stress in the microenvironment. The changes were more pronounced in SHR, and as early as six months of age, there was significant decrease in efficiency of CSCs of SHR compared to Wistar. The density of healthy CSCs determined as a fraction of the differentiated cells was remarkably low in 18 -month-old SHR. Age associated decrease in functionally efficient CSCs was therefore accelerated in SHR. Considering the vital role of CSCs in the maintenance of a healthy myocardium, decrease in functionally efficient CSCs can be a precipitating factor in pathological cardiac remodeling. Elevated ROS levels in CSCs of SHR lends scope for speculation that decrease in efficiency of CSCs is mediated by oxidative stress; and that modulation of the microenvironment by therapeutic interventions can restore a healthy stem cell population and facilitate maintenance of cardiac homeostasis and prevent cardiac decompensation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{molecular}} {{characterizations of}} mammary stem cells (MaSC) have utilized fluorescence-activated cell sorting or in vitro cultivation of cells from enzymatically dissociated tissue to enrich for MaSC. These approaches {{result in the}} loss of all histological information pertaining to the in vivo locale of MaSC and progenitor cells. Instead, we used laser microdissection to excise putative progenitor cells and control cells from their in situ locations in cryosections and characterized the molecular properties of these cells. MaSC/progenitor cells were identified based on their ability to retain bromodeoxyuridine for an extended period. Results: We isolated four categories of cells from mammary epithelium of female calves: bromodeoxyuridine label retaining epithelial cells (LREC) from basal (LRECb) and embedded layers (LRECe), and epithelial control cells from basal and embedded layers. Enriched expression of genes in LRECb were associated with stem <b>cell</b> <b>attributes</b> and identified WNT, TGF-β and MAPK pathways of self renewal and proliferation. Genes expressed in LRECe revealed retention of some stem-like properties along with up-regulation of differentiation factors. Conclusions: Our data suggest that LREC in the basal epithelial layer are enriched for MaSC, as these cells showed increased expression of genes that reflect stem cell attributes; whereas LREC in suprabasal epithelial layers are enriched for more committed progenitor cells, expressing some genes that are associated with stem <b>cell</b> <b>attributes</b> along with those indicative of cell differentiation. Our results support the use of DNA-label retention to identify MaSC and also provide a molecular profile and novel candidate markers for these cells.

The analysis procedure was to identify each cell and track the maximum reflectivity, height of maximum reflectivity, storm top, storm base, hail and severe hail probability, cell-based Vertically Integrated Liquid (VIL) and core aspect ratio using WATADS Build 9. 0 cell trends information. One problem noted in the analysis phase was that the Storm Cell Identification and Tracking (SCIT) algorithm had a difficult time tracking the small cells associated with the Florida weather regimes. The analysis indicated numerous occasions when a cell track would end or an existing cell would be give a new ID in the middle of its life cycle. This investigation has found that most cells, which produce hail or microburst events, have discernable Cell Trends signatures. Forecasters should monitor the PUP's Cell Trends display for cells that show rapid (1 scan) changes in both the heights of maximum reflectivity and cell-based VIEL.
