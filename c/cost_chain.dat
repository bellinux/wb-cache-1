40|$|This {{study has}} been made {{with the purpose of}} trying to attain the {{competitiveness}} between container carriers and specialised reefers in offering door-door services for perishable cargo. In order to achieve a full scale picture of the investigated cost chains a number of different analyses and calculations have been performed regarding the door-door <b>cost</b> <b>chain.</b> Two key trades where the NLC group is currently operating have been chosen as basis for this comparison. Still, the intention in this {{study has been}} to find the general benefits/disadvantages regard the chosen mode of transportation, which can be applicable to any trade using a certain mode. A model has therefore been constructed based on earlier studies conducted within the NLC group, relevant shipping theory and new information gathered during interviews and questionnaires. This model computes a comparison between the shipper and carrier looking at the total door-door cost. An indication on the competition in the trade is hereby attained. However most importantly is that the comparison generates an overview of the economical conditions in the trade, i. e. are the trades theoretically making money. The results from this study show that there is a margin in most trades between the cost to produce the service, i. e. carrier cost and the shipper cost. This is only natural however the troubles come from comparing the margins between the container and specialised reefer vessel. These result shows that the container margin in certain trades is almost {{three times the size of}} the specialised reefers looking at competing trades. This does not only indicate bigger revenue but also makes for a buffer towards market fluctuations. Results from the study also show the importance in taking full control of the entire <b>cost</b> <b>chain</b> and not to be governed by strong importers controlling the end of the chain. This is especially true looking at pallets transported under deck where the haulage activity plays a critical scale of balance role, with the possibility of breaking the entire <b>cost</b> <b>chain.</b> A backhaul cost model has also been constructed in order to find the possible effects which backhaul can play on the total round voyage cost. These results show that all investigated backhaul cargo covers the additional cost for the backhaul operation, hence giving contribution to container and ship repositioning. However only live cargo shipped in operating 40 `RHC can pay the full cost for the round voyage. Looking at the general competitiveness between the different transport modes this study does not produce any final conclusions. A tendency can however be noticed towards container lines under the right circumstances tend to produce the door-door service at a lower cost compared to the specialised reefer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the article}} is to analyze the cost of fuel for a small-capacity {{woodchip}} boiler house as well as operation of a condenser and assess the decrease in cost if a flue gas condenser is installed. The article examines the <b>cost</b> <b>chain</b> of fuel: {{the price of the}} fuel itself, the hourly rate depending on capacity and specific cost per unit of produced energy. The object of study is the Ludza (Latvia) district heating system heat source – a boiler house with an 8 MW woodchip boiler fitted with a direct contact condenser. An analysis of the specific costs of the flue gas condenser shows that the condenser has a capacity threshold above which a savings of financial resources can be observed. As the capacity falls below the threshold, the condenser operates at a loss and its operation costs are greater than its income, which are determined by the woodchip savings. The analysis shows that during the nine months of the 2012 - 2013 heating season the condenser operated with an economic effect and also without this effect. The total assessment is provided by a cost-benefit balance assessment, which determines the specific pure gains obtained during the studied time period. Condenser disconnection in the case of low capacity is examined...|$|E

This work developed {{the concept of a}} hierarchical, inter-related, multi-level supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> architecture. Within this architecture, supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> can be expressed as a sum of only 5 supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> factors (material, labor, logistics, inventory holding, and overhead costs). The reduction {{of a large number of}} potential cost factors eases communication about total supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> within an organization. An interactive Excel VBA software was developed which allows the user to experimentally model changes to a specific supply chain design. The VBA program automatically recalculates the supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> based on the changes made.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop minimum cost supply strategies for willow to energy plants (two plant sizes: 0. 5 and 30 MWe, two energy conversion technologies: combustion and gasification). Time span between harvest and energy conversion varied from 1 to 12 months. For a realistic comparison, different supply chains were based on the same initial characteristics (i. e., moisture content 50 % wb at harvest) and final fuel specifications at the energy plant (moisture content 20 % wb, particle size chips or chunks). Cost calculations were based on the integral cost calculation method and were presented for all process steps. The main conclusion was that the time span between harvest and energy conversion and the size and conversion technology of the energy plant largely influence the design of the supply chain and consequently the supply costs. The fuel supply costs ranged from 17. 6 to 26. 1 ECU/t DM (where DM stands for oven dry matter) or 0. 010 to 0. 023 ECU/kWh. The cost reduction which could be achieved by choosing the minimum <b>cost</b> <b>chain</b> design could be as high as 45 % or 14. 4 ECU/t DM. Generally, the strategy of minimum costs for supply of fuel to an energy plant running all year round on willow was as follows: … for farmers who should supply their willow within 6 months after harvest: harvest as chips, forced drying at the farm and transport (if necessary); … for farmers who should supply their willow beyond 6 months after harvest: harvest as chunks or stems, natural drying near the willow field, transport (if necessary) and central chipping (if applicable) ...|$|E
40|$|Discrete {{controlled}} Markov chains with finite action {{space and}} bounded cost per stage are studied in this dissertation. The performance index function, the exponential average cost (EAC), models risk-sensitivity {{by means of}} an exponential (dis) utility function. First, for the finite state space model, the EAC corresponding to a fixed stationary (deterministic) policy is characterized in terms of the spectral radii of matrices associated to irreducible communicating classes of both recurrent and transient states. This result generalizes a well known theorem of Howard and Matheson, which treats the particular case in which the Markov <b>cost</b> <b>chain</b> has only one dosed class of states. Then, it is shown that under strong recurrence conditions, the risk-sensitive model approaches the risk-null model when the risk-sensitivity coefficient is small. However, it is proved and also illustrated by means of examples, that in general, fundamental differences arise between both models, e. g., the EAC may depend on the cost structure at the transient states. In particular, the behavior of the EAC for large risk-sensitivity is also analyzed. After showing that an exponential average optimality equation holds for the countable state space model, a proof of the existence of solutions to that equation for the finite model under a simultaneous Doeblin condition is provided, which is simpler than that given in recent work of Cavazos-Cadena and Fernandez-Gaucherand. The adverse impact of "large risk-sensitivity" on recently obtained conditions for the existence of solutions to an optimality inequality is illustrated {{by means of an}} example. Finally, a counterexample is included to show that, unlike previous results for finite models, a controlled Markov chain with infinite state space may not have ultimately stationary optimal policies in the risk-sensitive (exponential) discounted cost case, in general. Moreover, a simultaneous Doeblin condition is satisfied in our example, an assumption that enables the vanishing discount approach in the risk-null case, thus further suggesting that more restrictive conditions than those commonly used in the risk neutral context are needed to develop the mentioned approach for risk-sensitive criteria...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} mathematical modeling as a {{means to}} improve profitability. The research is focused on studying supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> drivers and their potential in regard to cost reduction in the automotive manufacturing industry, where the role of supply chain management is significant because of the capital intensive, fast paced, and high volume nature of the business. Hence, supportive tools for decision making are highly valuable. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop a total supply <b>chain</b> <b>costing</b> model that can be used to add value to business primarily in the automotive manufacturing sector. Despite its significance, surprisingly little research has been published on the subject of supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> in manufacturing in general, let alone modeling of supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> in the automotive manufacturing industry. Research into costing has been published in management accounting literature, but supply chain management is rarely represented. Simulation and optimization models have been developed, even in the automotive sector, but they are usually very case specific, and discuss mostly manufacturing or distribution related modeling problems. Therefore, this thesis aims to contribute to filling the research gap in modeling total supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> in automotive manufacturing by extending the knowledge of both modeling methods and supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> drivers in the automotive sector. This research is conducted as a case study of a Finnish automotive contract manufacturer, Valmet Automotive Inc., that expressed the need to develop a supply <b>chain</b> <b>costing</b> model to streamline its supply chain processes and generate cost savings through improved understanding and control of its supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> drivers. A literature review of the topic informs the theoretical basis for constructing the costing model. In addition to theory, the mechanics and mathematical formulas of the model are developed based on participant observations and informal interviews with supply chain professionals at the case company. Moreover, verification and validation of the costing model is carried out together with the case company's supply chain managers. The output of this thesis is a validated total supply <b>chain</b> <b>costing</b> model that was taken into use at the case company. Experimentation proved that the developed model can be used to add value to the case company's business in forms of <b>cost</b> saving, supply <b>chain</b> process streamlining and performance follow up. Moreover, supply chain managers can utilize the costing model as a strategic planning tool and as a supportive tool for decision making.

40|$|Background: The costs {{incurred}} {{in the provision}} of products and services across the supply chain are on the rise in many industries, including the mobile phone industry. Despite this, there is limited information in South Africa on the perceptions of supply <b>chain</b> players regarding <b>cost</b> reduction in the mobile phone industry. Furthermore, there is currently no framework for reducing supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> in the South African mobile phone industry. Aim: The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> in the South African mobile phone industry, and to develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Setting: This study explores supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> in four mobile phone companies operating in the South African mobile phone industry, of which three mobile network operators and one mobile retailing group. It uses semi-structured interview data collected in 2011. Method: This study adopted a qualitative case study design to understand supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> and develop a supply chain cost-reduction framework for the South African mobile phone industry. Eight semi-structured interviews with managers of mobile phone companies were conducted. The data were analysed with the help of Atlas. ti, using an adapted three-phased analytical framework as suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) and O’ Dwyer (2004). Results: The study found that consolidation of strategic relationships through collaboration and strategic alliances between MNOs and other supply chain players is one of the ways to drive costs down across the supply chain. Outsourcing of some of the support activities and retailers’ direct purchasing transactions from device manufacturers were also found to be other avenues for reducing supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> in the industry. Conclusion: The study suggests that mobile network operators (MNOs) need to consolidate their strategic relationships by increasing the share of the network infrastructure, and emphasising the need to strive for operational efficiencies. This combined effort should result in significant cost reductions across the supply chain. The findings of this study provided some avenues that managers of mobile-phone companies could consider to drive costs down supply chain-wide and service end-users at lower rates.

The service provided to the customer eventually gets enhanced once the efficient and effective management of inventory is carried out all through the supply chain.

Minimizing the total supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> is meant for minimizing holding and shortage cost in the entire supply chain. The minimization of the total supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> can only be achieved when optimization of the base stock level is carried out at each member of the supply chain.

Nevertheless, the costs of delivering specific products are poorly understood and ballpark estimates are often used to inadequately plan for the budgetary implications of supply chain expenses. The purpose of this research was to estimate the country level costs of the public sector supply chain for artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) from the central to the peripheral levels in Benin and Kenya. Methods A micro-costing approach was used and primary data on the various cost components of the supply chain was collected at the central, intermediate, and facility levels between September and November 2013. Information sources included central warehouse databases, health facility records, transport schedules, and expenditure reports. Data from document reviews and semi-structured interviews were used to identify cost inputs and estimate actual costs. Sampling was purposive to isolate key variables of interest. Survey guides were developed and administered electronically. Data were extracted into Microsoft Excel®, and the supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> per unit of ACT and RDT distributed by function and level of system was calculated. Results In Benin, supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> added USD 0. 2011 to the initial acquisition cost of ACT and USD 0. 3375 to RDTs (normalized to USD 1). In Kenya, they added USD 0. 2443 to the acquisition cost of ACT and USD 0. 1895 to RDTs (normalized to USD 1). Total supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> accounted for more than 30 % of the initial acquisition cost of the products in some cases and these costs were highly sensitive to product volumes. The major cost drivers were found to be labour, transport, and utilities with health facilities carrying the majority of the cost per unit of product. Conclusions Accurate cost estimates are needed to ensure adequate resources are available for supply chain activities. Product volumes should be considered when <b>costing</b> supply <b>chain</b> functions rather than dollar value. Further work is needed to develop extrapolative costing models that can be applied at country level without extensive micro-costing exercises.

ResultsIn Benin, supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> added USD 0. 2011 to the initial acquisition cost of ACT and USD 0. 3375 to RDTs (normalized to USD 1). In Kenya, they added USD 0. 2443 to the acquisition cost of ACT and USD 0. 1895 to RDTs (normalized to USD 1). Total supply <b>chain</b> <b>costs</b> accounted for more than 30 % of the initial acquisition cost of the products in some cases and these costs were highly sensitive to product volumes. The major cost drivers were found to be labour, transport, and utilities with health facilities carrying the majority of the cost per unit of product. Accurate cost estimates are needed to ensure adequate resources are available for supply chain activities. Product volumes should be considered when <b>costing</b> supply <b>chain</b> functions rather than dollar value. Further work is needed to develop extrapolative costing models that can be applied at country level without extensive micro-costing exercises. This will allow other countries to generate more accurate estimates in the future...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Today, {{inventory}} management {{is considered to}} be an important field in Supply chain management. Once the efficient and effective management of inventory is carried out throughout the supply chain, service provided to the customer ultimately gets enhanced. Hence, to ensure minimal cost for the supply chain, the determination of the level of inventory to be held at various levels in a supply chain is unavoidable. Minimizing the total supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> refers to the reduction of holding and shortage cost in the entire supply chain. Efficient {{inventory management}} is a complex process which entails the management of the inventory in the whole supply chain and getting the final solution as an optimal one. In other words, during the process of supply chain management, the stock level at each member of the supply chain should account to minimum total supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost.</b> The dynamic nature of the excess stock level and shortage level over all the periods is a serious issue when implementation was considered. In addition, consideration of multiple products leads to very complex inventory management process. The complexity of the problem increases when more distribution centers and agents were involved. Approach: In present research, the issues of inventory management had been focused and a novel approach based on genetic algorithm had been proposed in which the most probable excess stock level and shortage level required for inventory optimization in the supply chain is distinctively determined so as to achieve minimum total supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost.</b> Results: The analysis provided us with an inventory level that made a remarkable contribution towards the increase of supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost.</b> We predicted the optimal inventory levels in all the supply chain members with the aid of these levels. Conclusion: We concluded {{that it is possible to}} minimize the supply <b>chain</b> <b>cost</b> by maintaining the optimal stock levels that we predicted from the inventory analysis. This will make the inventory management further effective and efficient thereby enhancing the customer servicing levels...|$|R
