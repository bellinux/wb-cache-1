5000|$|A carfree <b>city</b> or <b>car</b> <b>free</b> <b>city</b> is a {{population}} center that relies primarily on public transport, walking, or cycling for transport within the urban area. Carfree cities greatly reduce petroleum dependency, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, automobile crashes, noise pollution, and traffic congestion. Some cities {{have one or}} more districts where motorized vehicles are prohibited, referred to as car-free zones. Many older cities in Europe, Asia, and Africa were founded centuries {{before the advent of}} the automobile, and some continue to have carfree areas in the oldest parts of the city -- especially in areas where it is impossible for cars to fit, e.g. in narrow alleys.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{talks about}} {{relationships}} between energy and urban planning, and so it’s {{a collection of}} theories and practices (mostly of them in progress) about local energy managment and instruments of urban planning. The treatment about “energy and settlements”, i. e. connections between energy systems and morphological and functional aspects of settlement, {{is essential to the}} sustainability goal, above all after the gradual process of administrative devolution, that has permitted possible conditions for energy and urban planning and in particular attentions to “conscientious” territorial development. According to that and because of lack in research and specific testing on it, this thesis wants to give a contribution to the study about opportunities of energy in urban planning, in term of physical and functional city’s transformation. The research, in particular, deals with different implications and meanings of energy in urban planning and so reviews various declinations of “energy and settlement” frame, focusing on Italian planning instruments because they represent a startup to change territorial transformation process and (partially) to define “Piano Energetico Urbano”, my own expression that synthesizes the particular process of energy integration (or just an approach) in the ordinary planning process. In particular, in the first part, the thesis talks about general connections between energy aspects and the territorial planning, emphasizing the gap and the unexpressed potentialities of two matters that don’t collide, to focus on the city, a common object of intervention. The second part of the thesis rebuilds the disciplinary background: it analyses the specific Anglophone literature, i. e. “urban sprawl vs. compact city” debate and the settlement and behavioural alternative model ones (New Urbanism, Smart Growth, <b>Car</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Cities,</b> Low Carbon Cities, Post Carbon Cities and Transitions Towns), and finally environmental and energy community politics, programmes and initiatives, that are the first promoter of stakeholders energy interest. The third part draws characteristics of the energy plan, first of all the main regulatory and methodological reference, Ln. 10 / 91, that has introduced the urban and energy plan (Piano Energetico Comunale, PEC) and the regional one (Piano Energetico Regionale, PER). After the analysis of some selected experiences (most of all from Emilia Romagna, because it has a specific regional energy and planning regulation), the thesis underlines how, through sustainability settlement and development strategies against energy and urban complexity, sectorial energy planning is under restyling. As conclusion, there is a general and explanatory frame about best practices, thanks to, it’s possible to define some up- and-coming themes of Piano Energetico Urbano, such as: territorial and conformable dimension (dimensione conforme), territorial partitions, directions of sectorial cancellations, and public and private relationships in energy and planning transformation process...|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to advance {{knowledge}} of the transformative potential of big data on city-based transport models. The central question guiding this paper is: how could big data transform smart city transport operations? In answering this question the authors present initial results from a Markov study. However the authors also suggest caution in the transformation potential of big data and highlight the risks of city and organizational adoption. A theoretical framework is presented together with an associated scenario which guides the development of a Markov model. Design/methodology/approach A model with several scenarios is developed to explore a theoretical framework focussed on matching the transport demands (of people and freight mobility) with city transport service provision using big data. This model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services. Findings This modelling study is an initial preliminary stage of the investigation in how big data could be used to redefine and enable new operational models. The study provides new understanding about load sharing and optimization in a smart city context. Basically the authors demonstrate how big data could be used to improve transport efficiency and lower externalities in a smart city. Further how improvement could take place by having a <b>car</b> <b>free</b> <b>city</b> environment, autonomous vehicles and shared resource capacity among providers. Research limitations/implications The research relied on a Markov model and the numerical solution of its steady state probabilities vector to illustrate the transformation of transport operations management (OM) in the future city context. More in depth analysis and more discrete modelling are clearly needed to assist in the implementation of big data initiatives and facilitate new innovations in OM. The work complements and extends that of Setia and Patel (2013), who theoretically link together information system design to operation absorptive capacity capabilities. Practical implications The study implies that transport operations would actually need to be re-organized so as to deal with lowering CO 2 footprint. The logistic aspects could be seen as a move from individual firms optimizing their own transportation supply to a shared collaborative load and resourced system. Such ideas are radical changes driven by, or leading to more decentralized rather than having centralized transport solutions (Caplice, 2013). Social implications The growth of cities and urban areas in the twenty-first century has put more pressure on resources and conditions of urban life. This paper is an initial first step in building theory, knowledge and critical understanding of the social implications being posed by the growth in cities and the role that big data and smart cities could play in developing a resilient and sustainable transport city system. Originality/value Despite the importance of OM to big data implementation, for both practitioners and researchers, we have yet to see a systematic analysis of its implementation and its absorptive capacity contribution to building capabilities, at either city system or organizational levels. As such the Markov model makes a preliminary contribution to the literature integrating big data capabilities with OM capabilities and the resulting improvements in system absorptive capacity...|$|R
