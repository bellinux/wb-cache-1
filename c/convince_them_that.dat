5|$|In August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune—who {{had never}} been {{particularly}} popular among his followers—tried to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> she should be their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen. Meanwhile, Fortune's parents relocated to the garden city of Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1922, and {{it was here that}} Fortune carried out what she deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, {{stressing}} their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
5|$|In the present, when Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange {{tries to}} <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Blonde planned {{to kill them}} and steal the {{diamonds}} for himself. Eddie kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint. Eddie points his own weapon at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.|$|E

5|$|The key to Ferdinand was {{the threat}} to Genoa. Intelligence {{intercepts}} showed that the Abwehr (German military intelligence) listed {{it as one of}} the main areas they expected an Allied attack. It was not possible to hide the buildup of naval and amphibious forces in the region, which were easily accessible to German aerial reconnaissance. German commanders identified both Genoa and southern France as the only logical targets, so the task for Allied double agents was to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the former was the true goal. The deception was maintained on the invasion date itself, with a tactical deception. The Dragoon fleet travelled on a course toward Genoa until late at night on 14 August, when they turned west toward their real target.|$|E
5|$|XXIBomber Command also {{conducted}} an intensive propaganda campaign alongside its firebombing raids. It {{has been estimated}} that B-29s dropped 10 million propaganda leaflets in May, 20 million in June and 30 million in July. The Japanese government implemented harsh penalties against civilians who kept copies of these leaflets. On the night of 27/28July, six B-29s dropped leaflets over 11 Japanese cities warning that they would be attacked in the future; this was intended to lower the morale of Japanese civilians and <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the United States was seeking to minimize civilian casualties. Six of these cities (Aomori, Ichinomiya, Tsu, Uji-Yamada Ōgaki and Uwajima) were attacked on 28July. No B-29s were lost in the raids on these cities, though six were damaged by attacks from between 40 and 50 fighters and another five were hit by anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|Banza was {{appointed}} {{minister of finance}} and minister of state in the new government. The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom Bokassa met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either {{was in danger of}} losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.|$|E

25|$|In late 1922, Valentino met George Ullman, who {{soon became}} Valentino's manager. Ullman {{previously}} {{had worked with}} Mineralava Beauty Clay Company, and <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Valentino would be perfect as a spokesman with his legions of female fans.|$|R
5000|$|Megson named {{themselves}} after Debbie's family dog, who at {{the time}} had just died. They had originally decided upon [...] "The Ghost of Meg", but their family and friends <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it sounded like a death-metal band.|$|R

25|$|By 1907, Eaton {{was busy}} {{acquiring}} key water rights and traveling to Washington {{to meet with}} advisers of Theodore Roosevelt to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{the water of the}} Owens River would do more good flowing from faucets in Los Angeles than it would if used on Owens Valley fields and orchards.|$|E
25|$|A Tennessee farmer {{would not}} take advice from an {{official}} {{in a suit and}} tie, so TVA officials had to find leaders in the communities and <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> crop rotation and the judicious application of fertilizers could restore soil fertility. Once they had convinced the leaders, the rest followed.|$|E
50|$|Eventually Soviet {{officials}} allowed Vlasova {{to speak}} with U.S. representatives in a mobile lounge that was brought up to the plane. She <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> she was not returning under coercion, and the plane took off with Vlasova on board.|$|R

25|$|During the Watergate scandal, Rabbi Greenwald {{contacted}} various Democratic Jewish {{members of}} Congress, including Elizabeth Holtzman, Bella Abzug and Arlen Specter {{to try to}} <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> impeaching the President would weaken the United States and, by extension, hurt Israel, which, {{in the wake of}} the Yom Kippur War needed the support of a strong United States. Although his entreaties did not work, as President Nixon was eventually forced to resign rather than face impeachment, he did earn a Presidential letter of thanks (see the letter at the bottom of this article). He died in his sleep while on vacation in Florida, on January 20, 2016.|$|E
25|$|The action {{takes place}} in Jerome's very untidy and {{neglected}} flat. Before the play begins, Jerome has arranged a meeting with wife Corinna and Mervyn Bickerdyke from the Department of Child Wellbeing, to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it will be appropriate for Geain {{to stay with him}} for long visits. Geain is also due to come to the meeting. To help to convince them, Jerome plans to hire an actress, Zoe Mill, from an escort agency, to pose as his fiancée. The first act takes place one week before the meeting as he interviews Zoe for the job. Before she arrives, Jerome activates his NAN 300F – a female android (or gynoid) whom he calls Nan. He treats Nan, who was originally designed to look after children, almost like a pet. Much of the play's humour originates from her idiosyncrasies as she collides with the furniture, blurts out unexpected remarks, and performs her tasks incompetently – such as serving a drink with the tumbler upside down.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1923, {{mandated}} by Foreign Affairs Minister Ion G. Duca of the PNL, {{he played a}} part in negotiations to restore contacts with the Russian government. He was in Paris, meeting with the Romanian communist Christian Rakovsky, who was the Soviet Ambassador to France. They discussed the litigious issue of Bessarabia, which the Bolsheviks still refused to recognize as part of Romania: Pântea was supposed to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the union had been a legitimate affair, and, according to Pântea, Rakovsky showed himself unusually receptive. With a delegation which included Constantin Langa-Rășcanu, Mircea Djuvara, Petru Cazacu and Anton Crihan, Pântea represented Romania in bilateral talks with a delegation from the Soviet Union, headed by diplomat Nikolay Krestinsky. These negotiations took place in Vienna during late March 1924. In conversation with Krestinsky, Pântea even transmitted the government's offer to renounce claims to the Romanian Treasure in Russia, in exchange for the Soviet recognition of the 1918 union.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, {{when the}} Church of England {{requested}} {{the right to}} pay a high-level visit to the Russian Orthodox Church, General Secretary Joseph Stalin met with its metropolitans. Though some historians say that Stalin needed the church to win the war, by that point the USSR had already survived Stalingrad and Kursk, gaining a superior position with its allies. Stalin took action {{on the eve of}} the Teheran Conference, wanting the ROC to impress the Anglican delegation and <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> there was no religious persecution. He hoped that this would sway British public opinion and cause them to press their government to support an early invasion of Normandy to divert Nazi efforts away from his front. The overall position of the Soviet government toward the church had become less aggressive on the eve of WWII. The polls showed that most of Soviet State citizens confessed to belonging to some faith (see League of Militant Atheists, section Disbandment) and some historians believe that Stalin wanted to exploit the unifying potential of the church in prospect of the coming war.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hours}} after Hades and Zelena return to Storybrooke, Zelena {{goes off to}} find the others and leaves the baby with Hades. While she is gone, King Arthur, who just escaped from the jail and is being tracked down by Mary Margaret, Merida and the dwarves, stumbles upon Hades, but he kills Arthur as he sees him as a threat. Zelena finds Regina and Robin Hood and tries to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Hades has changed his ways. Emma, David and Henry are reunited with Snow and Merida and explain the details of Hades' {{deception}} but Emma's vengeance against Hades is making her too emotional. Zelena and Hades {{are talking about the}} others not believing that he changed. Hades gets a weapon, known as the Olympian Crystal (Zeus's thunderbolt), which can kill anybody, even a god. He also suggests that they leave Storybrooke but Zelena is not so sure if she wants to. As Emma, Merida and David find Arthur's body at the Storybrooke Bridge, David tries to calm down a furious Emma, who's trying to protect Storybrooke from Hades' wrath.|$|E
25|$|Feeling {{discontent with}} Cotonang, in December 1960, {{many of its}} workers started to boycott work, {{demanding}} better working conditions and higher wages. The discontent was seized by infiltrated indoctrinators of the Congolese PSA (African Solidarity Party) to foment an uprising of the local peoples. At that time, the only Portuguese Army unit stationed in the region was the 3rd Special Caçadores Company (3ª CCE), tasked with the patrolling and protection of the border with the ex-Belgian Congo. Despite receiving complains from local whites who felt their security threatened, the Governor of the Malanje District, Júlio Monteiro - a mixed race Cape Verdean - did not authorized the 3ª CCE to act against the rebellious and also forbade the acquisition of self-defense weapons by the white population. From the 9th to 11 January 1961, the situation worsened, {{with the murder of}} a mixed race Cotonang foreman and with the surrounding of a 3ª CCE patrol by hundreds of rebellious. Finally, on 2 February, the clashes between the rebels and the security forces erupted, with the first shots being fired, causing 11 dead. By that time, the uprising had spread to the whole Malanje District and threatened to spread to the neighboring districts. The rebellious leaders took advantage of the superstition beliefs of most of their followers to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the bullets of the Portuguese military forces were made of water and so they could do them no harm. Probably because of this belief, the rebels, armed with machetes and canhangulos (home-made shotguns), attacked the military en masse, in the open field, without concern to protect themselves, falling under the fire of the troops.|$|E
50|$|He {{then joined}} the Afrikaners against the British. It was shortly after this {{that he is}} rumoured to have been {{captured}} by the Germans. He <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he was on their side and fought {{with them for a}} time in their East African Campaign.|$|R
50|$|In 1033 the Ghaznavids invaded Kerman, {{with the}} object of {{overrunning}} the Buyid states. However, the financial obligations imposed {{on the people of}} Kerman <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Buyid rule would be preferable. In the following year, Bahram ibn Mafinna expelled the Ghaznavids from the province.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer, and a {{quick look}} around <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> nobody {{had been in the}} place for several days if not weeks. Yet on a shelf in a rude locker were a number of stores--beans, coffee, a side of bacon, and several other things.|$|R
500|$|Swift {{believed}} that a preacher had to be understood, and states, [...] "For a divine hath {{nothing to say to}} the wisest congregation of any parish in this kingdom, which he may not express in a manner to be understood by the meanest among them." [...] He elaborates further when he says, [...] "The two principal branches of preaching, are first to tell the people what is their duty; and then to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it is so." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was still}} little urgency in the United States, which unlike Britain {{was not yet}} engaged in World War II, so Oliphant flew there in late August 1941, and spoke to American {{scientists}} including his friend Ernest Lawrence at the University of California. He not only managed to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> an atomic bomb was feasible, but inspired Lawrence to convert his [...] cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934. In turn, Lawrence brought in his friend and colleague Robert Oppenheimer to double-check the physics of the MAUD Committee report, which was discussed at {{a meeting at the}} General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, on 21 October 1941.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the subplot of Homer's {{parenting}} originated from a real fatherhood test executive producer Sam Simon found and brought to the Simpsons studio. Levine later commented on writing the episode, [...] "At the time David and I were writing this, my son, Matt, was about Bart's age. [...] So for me {{there was a certain}} amount of guilt associated, like 'Do I know my son's hobby? Do I know my son's best friend?' etc." [...] The scene in which Bart welds on his racer resulted in an argument between the staff of the show and the Fox network's censors. The censors were concerned that children would imitate Bart by misusing welding tools; however, the staff was able to <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> very few children have access to welding tools.|$|E
