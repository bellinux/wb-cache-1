5|$|The first {{election}} {{under the}} 1776 constitution {{took place in}} 1781, and the system would not change again until 1838. In the interim, {{a number of problems}} had cropped up in the appointment process, and the 1838 election saw the passage of a number of constitutional amendments that fundamentally changed how Senators were chosen. The electoral college was abolished, terms were lengthened to six years with rotating elections such that a third of the senate would be elected every two years, and a single Senator was chosen by direct election from each county and the City of Baltimore. The Senate no longer acted as the Governor's Council, although they would continue to confirm the Governor's appointments. Constitutional changes altered this new system slightly in 1851, when terms were shortened to four years, and 1864, when Baltimore City was given three Senate districts rather than one, but substantial change to the structure of the Senate did not <b>come</b> <b>again</b> until 1964.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{beginning}} of their second winter the Skraelings <b>come</b> <b>again</b> to trade. This time one of Karlsefni's men kills a Skraeling as he reaches for Norse weapons. The Skraelings run off. Karlsefni fears the natives will return, hostile and in larger numbers. He forms a plan for the coming battle. The Skraelings do <b>come</b> <b>again</b> and the Norsemen manage to fight them off. Karlsefni stays there {{for the remainder of the}} winter and returns to Greenland next spring. During their stay in Vinland, Karlsefni and Gudrid had the son Snorri.|$|E

25|$|In the Creature Stage, {{the player}} creates {{their own land}} {{creature}} intended to live on a single continent. If the player attempts to swim to another island, an unidentified monster eats the player, and the player is warned not to <b>come</b> <b>again.</b> The biosphere contains a variety of animal species which carnivorous and omnivorous creatures can hunt for food, and fruit-bearing plants intended for herbivores and omnivores. The player creature's Hunger becomes a measured stat {{as well as its}} Health in this stage; depletion of the Hunger meter results in Health depletion and eventual death of the player creature unless food is eaten.|$|E
25|$|In 1840, at age 12, {{her family}} became {{involved}} with the Millerite movement. As she attended William Miller's lectures, she felt guilty for her sins, and was filled with terror about being eternally lost. She describes herself as spending nights in tears and prayer, and being in this condition for several months. On June 26, 1842, she was baptized by John Hobart in Casco Bay in Portland, Maine, and eagerly awaited Jesus to <b>come</b> <b>again.</b> In her later years, she referred to this as the happiest time of her life. Her family's involvement with Millerism caused them to be disfellowshipped by the local Methodist church.|$|E

God heeded Manoah and sent the angel to the woman as she sat alone in the field. Manoah's wife ran and told Manoah, and he {{followed}} her to the angel, and asked him whether {{he was the one}} who had spoken to his wife, and he said that he was. Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they should do what he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to eat any product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the embassy}} cannot be doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But {{we are at a}} loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would <b>come</b> <b>again</b> and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E

500|$|Max Bemis {{was raised}} [...] "in a strong Jewish environment." [...] Many of Bemis' lyrics borrow from his Jewish roots, and contain {{elements}} of Jewish humor. [...] While most of band's earlier songs {{are free of}} any such inspiration, the songs of ...Is a Real Boy and In Defense of the Genre include references to Jewish heritage. [...] "Alive with the Glory of Love," [...] Say Anything's first single, has a main subject of a relationship affected by World War II and the Holocaust, based on Bemis's grandparents, [...] while [...] "Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too" [...] includes mentions of [...] "the old shul" [...] and a rabbi's teachings. [...] A strong example from In Defense comes from the lyrics of [...] "Died a Jew". The song includes several references to the Jewish people and its history along with mentions of [...] "the murder of God" [...] and Bemis' departures from kosher. [...] References to religion <b>come</b> <b>again</b> in [...] "Fed to Death" [...] on Say Anything, referring to a 'man from Nazareth' who would one day 'spring to life to smile and clear your name' but until then 'nail yourself upon the cross and hang your head in shame.' ...|$|E
500|$|One {{theme that}} was {{apparent}} in the show was the ongoing late-2000s recession. The early part of shows contained a [...] "recession pack" [...] consisting of [...] "Seeds" [...] (brought back from the 1980s), [...] "Johnny 99" [...] (elongated with incongruous train [...] "woo-whoo's"), and either [...] "Youngstown" [...] or [...] "The Ghost of Tom Joad" [...] (both featuring fiery guitar solos from Nils Lofgren). Encores began with a rendition of Stephen Foster's 1850s classic [...] "Hard Times <b>Come</b> <b>Again</b> No More" [...] – which provided {{one of the few}} featured spots for King and Mizelle, who otherwise played a lot of tambourine – and later included both of Springsteen's reunion-era encore epics of American struggle, survival and hope, [...] "Land of Hope and Dreams" [...] and [...] "American Land". [...] Van Zandt said that the emergence of the recession theme was in part why the concerts did not showcase the Working on a Dream album. [...] One regular moment of optimism, however, was the playing of [...] "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" [...] from The Rising, with Springsteen holding a microphone down to one or more young children {{in the front of the}} pit area to sing along to the chorus on.|$|E
500|$|Quatermass {{emerges from}} the car park to find the stadium empty. So many have now been {{harvested}} that the particles of dust in the air have turned the sky green. Kapp attempts to repair his equipment in order to contact the alien presence, but the Planet People destroy his efforts. They try {{to persuade him to}} join them but he refuses, convinced now that his family are dead. Quatermass, aided by Gurov, who has travelled to London from Moscow, assembles a team of scientists to find a solution. He deliberately selects old people for the task as they are immune to the effects of the alien force. Quatermass decides to set a trap. He plans to fake the presence of a large gathering of Planet People at Kapp's observatory and, when the force comes, to detonate a nuclear weapon. Quatermass does not believe this will be sufficient to destroy the alien machine but he hopes that it will damage it enough to make it go away. Kapp volunteers to stay behind with Quatermass to help detonate the bomb. The pair set up the trap and wait. Suddenly, Kickalong appears with a group of Planet People, including Quatermass' granddaughter, Hettie. Kapp tries to warn them away but is shot by Kickalong. The light appears, indicating that the alien force has arrived, but the shock of seeing his granddaughter among the Planet People causes Quatermass to suffer a heart attack. However, aided by Hettie, he is able to detonate the bomb. Later, according to Gurov, [...] "The message was taken. It has not <b>come</b> <b>again.</b> We pray it will never come again".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the urging}} of his supporters, Miller never {{announced}} an exact date for the expected Second Advent.
