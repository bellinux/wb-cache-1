50|$|Softness Imperception (SI) {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Florentine and colleagues to {{describe}} the inability to hear quiet sounds that are audible to normal listeners. This phenomenon is particularly common among people with <b>cochlear</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> When a person with SI hears a sound at threshold, it sounds louder than a sound at threshold would do for a normal listener. Therefore, people with hearing loss may find softer sounds more intrusive when fitted with hearing aids that simply amplify all soft sounds to threshold.|$|E
5000|$|The tone decay test (also {{known as}} the {{threshold}} tone decay test or TTDT) is used in audiology to detect and measure auditory fatigue. It was developed by Raymond Carhart in 1957. In people with normal hearing, a tone whose intensity is only slightly above their absolute threshold of hearing can be heard continuously for 60 seconds. The tone decay test produces {{a measure of the}} [...] "decibels of decay", i.e. the number of decibels above the patient's absolute threshold of hearing that are required for the tone to be heard for 60 seconds.

40|$|The lesion {{location}} (cochlear vs. retrocochlear) of {{sensorineural hearing}} loss may be differentiated with a diagnostic index (delta V), which is calculated from the wave V latency of the monaurally evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR), and from the pure-tone hearing threshold at 2 and 4 kHz.

40|$|Masked {{detection}} threshold {{for a short}} tone in noise improves as the tone’s onset is delayed from the masker’s onset. This improvement, known as “overshoot,” is maximal at mid-masker levels and is reduced by temporary and permanent <b>cochlear</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Computational modeling {{was used in the}} present study to evaluate proposed physiological mechanisms of overshoot, including classic firing rate adaptation and medial olivocochlear (MOC) feedback, for both normal hearing and <b>cochlear</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> conditions. These theories were tested using an established model of the auditory periphery and signal detection theory techniques. The influence of several analysis variables on predicted tone-pip detection in broadband noise was evaluated, including: auditory nerve fiber spontaneous-rate (SR) pooling, range of characteristic frequencies, number of synapses per characteristic frequency, analysis window duration, and detection rule. The results revealed that overshoot similar to perceptual data in terms of both magnitude and level dependence could be predicted when the effects of MOC efferent feedback were included in the auditory nerve model. Conversely, simulations without MOC feedback effects never produced overshoot despite the model’s ability to account for classic firing rate adaptation and dynamic range adaptation in auditory nerve responses. <b>Cochlear</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was predicted to reduce the size of overshoot only for model versions that included the effects of MOC efferent feedback. These findings suggest that overshoot in normal and hearing-impaired listeners is mediated by some form of dynamic range adaptation other than what is observed in the auditory nerve of anesthetized animals.

Implications of the width of the excursions in the Békésy tracking procedure, however, are not as simple as described in his classic book, Experiments in Hearing (von Békésy, 1960). The interpretations of his findings have created some misunderstandings in hearing science and audiology. This article reviews a large body of data on Békésy tracking and more recent threshold, discrimination, and loudness data in order to answer the following question: Is the width of the excursions a reliable indicator of cochlear pathology? In 1947, von Békésy described a new audiometer and claimed that this new audiometer permitted the testing of recruitment.

The hypothesis being tested was that listeners with cochlear loss would perform as well as normal-hearing listeners for all within-channel conditions but would exhibit relatively greater performance deficits in the across-channel conditions. A subsidiary aim was to determine whether, in normal-hearing listeners, the across-channel effects previously observed for minimal-duration standard gaps also existed for relatively long standard gaps. Two experiments were undertaken, one dealing with monaural conditions and one dealing with dichotic conditions. The monaural results indicated that across-frequency GDD was poorer than isofrequency GDD, even for the longer gap durations of 35 and 250 ms examined here. However, the results showed no effect of hearing loss on GDD. Rather, GDD appeared to be sensitive to listener age, with younger listeners showing better performance in both within-channel and across-channel conditions. In addition, both within-channel and across-channel performance was sensitive to the duration of the leading gap marker. Finally, the pattern of dichotic "across-ear" performance was similar, but not equivalent, to that of monaural across-frequency performance...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a {{degenerative}} disorder {{caused by}} mutations of the FXN gene. Sensorineural hearing loss {{is one of}} the clinical features of FRDA, and the majority of hearing-impaired patients have shown evidence of auditory neuropathy. OBJECTIVE: This study characterizes the cochlear receptor and auditory nerve potentials in a patient with FRDA who had the clinical profile of auditory neuropathy. The aim was to investigate the site of the lesion and the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the hearing dysfunction. METHODS: Using transtympanic electrocochleography, both receptor (cochlear microphonic, CM, and summating potential, SP) and auditory nerve potentials were recorded in response to trains of clicks with stimulation intensities from 60 to 120 dB SPL. The results were compared with recordings obtained from two groups of subjects, i. e. 20 normally hearing controls and 19 subjects with <b>cochlear</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> RESULTS: The results showed that the synchronized neural response seen in both normally hearing and hearing-impaired subjects was lacking in our patient, replaced by a prolonged, low-amplitude negative potential that decreased in both amplitude and duration for rapid stimulation rates, consistent with adaptation of neural sources. CMs were recorded with a normal amplitude, consistent with preserved outer hair cell function. SP peak latency was within normal limits, whereas SP amplitude was comparable with that of subjects with <b>cochlear</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> consistent with inner hair cell loss. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that underlying auditory neuropathy in FRDA is a disordered synchrony in auditory nerve fiber discharge, possibly resulting from auditory nerve fiber degeneration and inner hair cell loss...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, OTOG and OTOGL were {{identified}} as human deafness genes. Currently, only four families {{are known to have}} autosomal recessive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> based on mutations in these genes. Because the two genes code for proteins (otogelin and otogelin-like) that are strikingly similar in structure and localization in the inner ear, this study is focused on characterizing and comparing the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> caused by mutations in these genes. DESIGN: To evaluate this type of hearing, an extensive set of audiometric and vestibular examinations was performed in the 13 patients from four families. RESULTS: All families show a flat to downsloping configuration of the audiogram with mild to moderate sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Speech recognition scores remain good (> 90 %). <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is not significantly different in the four families and the psychophysical test results also do not differ among the families.

Primary goal of this research was to explore temporal processing and speech perception Skills in individuals who are exposed to occupational noise of more than 80 dBA and not yet incurred clinically significant threshold shifts. Contribution of temporal processing skills to speech perception in adverse listening situation was also evaluated. A total of 118 participants took part in this research. Participants comprised three groups of train drivers in the age range of 30 - 40 (n= 13), 41 50 (= 13), 41 - 50 (n = 9), and 51 - 60 (n = 6) years and their non-noise-exposed counterparts (n = 30 in each age group). Participants of all the groups including the train drivers had hearing sensitivity within 25 dB HL in the octave frequencies between 250 and 8 kHz. Temporal processing was evaluated using gap detection, modulation detection, and duration pattern tests. Speech recognition was tested in presence multi-talker babble at - 5 dB SNR. Differences between experimental and control groups were analyzed using ANOVA and independent sample t-tests. Results showed a trend of reduced temporal processing skills in individuals with noise exposure. These deficits were observed despite normal peripheral hearing sensitivity. Speech recognition scores in the presence of noise were also significantly poor in noise-exposed group. Furthermore, poor temporal processing skills partially accounted for the speech recognition difficulties exhibited by the noise-exposed individuals.

50|$|As with air-conduction stimuli, {{thresholds}} for bone-conduction stimuli {{should be}} obtained using tone burst stimuli Stapells is one researcher who {{reported on the}} accuracy of using tone bursts with BC ABR to estimate <b>cochlear</b> <b>hearing</b> sensitivity. Stapells and Ruben, in 1989, demonstrated bone-conduction tone burst ABRs in infants with conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Hatton, Janssen and Stapells (2012) present bone-conduction tone burst ABR results in infants with normal bone-conduction thresholds or sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> BC ABR methods are described in 2010 review chapter by Stapells.|$|R
40|$|Excessive {{exposure}} to noise damages the principal cochlear structures leading to hearing impairment. Inflammatory and immune responses are central mechanisms in cochlear defensive response to noise but, if unregulated, they contribute to inner ear damage and <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß) is a key regulator of both responses {{and high levels of}} this factor have been associated with <b>cochlear</b> injury in <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> animal models. To evaluate the potential of targeting TGF-ß as a therapeutic strategy for preventing or ameliorating noise-induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> we studied the auditory function, cochlear morphology, gene expression and oxidative stress markers in mice exposed to noise and treated with TGF-ß 1 peptidic inhibitors P 17 and P 144, just before or immediately after noise insult. Our results indicate that systemic administration of both peptides significantly improved both the evolution of hearing thresholds and the degenerative changes induced by noise-exposure in lateral wall structures. Moreover, treatments ameliorated the inflammatory state and redox balance. These therapeutic effects were dose-dependent and more effective if the TGF-ß 1 inhibitors were administered prior to inducing the injury. In conclusion, inhibition of TGF-ß 1 actions with antagonistic peptides represents a new, promising therapeutic strategy for the prevention and repair of noise-induced cochlear damage...|$|R
