50|$|LNG, or liquified natural gas, {{is natural}} gas {{that has been}} cooled {{to a point that}} it is a {{cryogenic}} liquid. In its liquid state, it is still more than 2 times as dense as <b>CNG.</b> <b>LNG</b> is dispensed from bulk storage tanks at LNG fuel stations at rates exceeding 20 DGE/min. Because of its cryogenic nature, it is stored in specially designed insulated tanks. Generally speaking, these tanks operate at fairly low pressures (about 70-150 psi) when compared to CNG. A vaporizer is mounted in the fuel system that turns the LNG into a gas (which may simply be considered low pressure CNG). When comparing building a commercial LNG station with a CNG station, utility infrastructure, capital cost, and electricity heavily favor <b>LNG</b> over <b>CNG.</b> There are existing LCNG stations (both <b>CNG</b> and <b>LNG),</b> where fuel is stored as LNG, then vaporized to CNG on-demand. LCNG stations require less capital cost than fast-fill CNG stations alone, but more than LNG stations.|$|R

50|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} is natural gas that has been cooled to {{a point at which}} it becomes a {{cryogenic}} liquid. In this liquid state, {{natural gas is}} more than 2 times as dense as highly compressed <b>CNG.</b> <b>LNG</b> fuel systems function on any vehicle capable of burning natural gas. Unlike CNG, which is stored at high pressure (typically 3000 or 3600 psi) and then regulated to a lower pressure that the engine can accept, LNG is stored at low pressure (50 to 150 psi) and simply vaporized by a heat exchanger before entering the fuel metering devices to the engine. Because of its high energy density compared to CNG, it is very suitable for those interested in long ranges while running on natural gas.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel concept of very efficient transportation engines for operation with <b>CNG,</b> <b>LNG</b> or LPG. The combustion system permits mixed diesel/gasoline-like operation changing the load by quantity of fuel injected and modulating the premixed and diffusion combustion phases for high fuel energy transfer to piston work. A {{waste heat recovery}} system (WHRS) is then recovering the intercooler and engine coolant energy plus the exhaust energy. The WHRS uses a power turbine on the exhaust and a steam turbine feed by a single loop turbo-steamer.

40|$|Compressed {{natural gas}} (CNG) and {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) vehicle and fueling infrastructure technologies are relatively well developed and there is negligible risk associated with technical feasibility uncertainties. Natural gas vehicles (NGVs) have been proven to be commercially viable, most definitely in other countries (there are over 5 million NGVs worldwide) and marginally in the U. S. (where there are about 130, 000 NGVs). Private companies are engaged in natural gas engine, vehicle, fueling station, and fuel supply businesses. However, some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have recently discontinued their natural gas engine and vehicle products. Natural gas use as a transportation fuel obviously displaces gasoline and diesel fuel consumption, and it also provides environmental benefits. For any credible set of assumptions, <b>CNG</b> and <b>LNG</b> use reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

40|$|Late in 1997, EPA {{announced}} new {{allowances for}} voluntary emission control programs. As a result, the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Clean Cities and other metro {{areas that have}} made an ongoing commitment to increasing participation by alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in local fleets {{have the opportunity to}} estimate the magnitude and obtain emission reduction credit for following through on that commitment. Unexpectedly large reductions in key ozone precursor emissions in key locations and times of the day can be achieved per vehicle-mile by selecting specific light duty AFV offerings from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in lieu of their gasoline-fueled counterparts. Additional benefit accrues from the fact that evaporative emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons (generated in the case of <b>CNG,</b> <b>LNG,</b> and LPG by closed fuel-system AFV technology) can be essentially negligible. Upstream emissions from fuel storage and distribution with the airshed of interest are also reduced. This paper provides a justification and outlines a method for including AFVs in the mix of strategies to achieve local and regional improvements in ozone air quality, and for quantifying emission reduction credits. At the time of submission of this paper, the method was still under review by the US EPA Office of Mobile Sources, pending mutually satisfactory resolution of several of its key points.

50|$|Existing {{gasoline-powered}} vehicles may {{be converted}} to run on <b>CNG</b> or <b>LNG,</b> and can be dedicated (running only on natural gas) or bi-fuel (running on either gasoline or natural gas).

Choosing GM's bi-fuel option sends the HD pickups with the 6.0L gasoline engine to IMPCO in Indiana to upfit the vehicle to run on CNG.

50|$|Despite its advantages, the use {{of natural}} gas {{vehicles}} faces several limitations, including fuel storage and infrastructure available for delivery and distribution at fueling stations. CNG must be stored in high pressure cylinders (3000psi to 3600psi operation pressure), and LNG must be stored in cryogenic cylinders (-260F to -200F). These cylinders take up more space than gasoline or diesel tanks that can be molded in intricate shapes to store more fuel and use less on-vehicle space. CNG tanks are usually located in the vehicle's trunk or pickup bed, reducing the space available for other cargo. This problem can be solved by installing the tanks under {{the body of the}} vehicle, or on the roof (typical for busses), leaving cargo areas free.

50|$|Landfill gas can be {{converted}} to high-Btu gas by reducing its carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen content. The high-Btu gas can be piped into existing natural gas pipelines or in the form of CNG (compressed natural gas) or LNG (liquid natural gas). <b>CNG</b> and <b>LNG</b> can be used on site to power hauling trucks or equipment or sold commercially. Three commonly used methods to extract the carbon dioxide from the gas are membrane separation, molecular sieve, and amine scrubbing. Oxygen and nitrogen are controlled by the proper design and operation of the landfill since the primary cause for oxygen or nitrogen in the gas is intrusion from outside into the landfill because of a difference in pressure. The high-Btu processing equipment can be expected to cost $2,600 to $4,300 per standard cubic foot per minute (scfm) of landfill gas. Annual costs range from $875,000 to $3.5 million to operate, maintain and provide electricity to. Costs depend on quality of the end product gas as well as the size of the project. The first landfill gas to LNG facility in the United States was the Frank R. Bowerman Landfill in Orange County, California. The same process is used for the conversion to CNG, but on a smaller scale. The CNG project at Puente Hills Landfill in Los Angeles has realized $1.40 per gallon of gasoline equivalent with the flow rate of 250 scfm. Cost per gallon equivalent reduces as the flow rate of gas increases. LNG can be produced through the liquidfication of CNG. However, the oxygen content needs to be reduced to be under 0.5% to avoid explosion concerns, the carbon dioxide content must be as close to zero as possible to avoid freezing problems encountered in the production, and nitrogen must be reduced enough to achieve at least 96% methane. A $20 million facility is estimated to achieve $0.65/gallon for a plant producing 15,000 gallons/day of LNG (3,000 scfm). Estimates are in 2007 dollars.|$|R

40|$|There are {{different}} ways to transport natural gas. One way is to cool it to a temperature of - 162 °C and transport it in liquefied form (LNG). This is both a well known and often used method in the shipping industry. It is also possible to compress the natural gas (CNG) and contain it in cylinders / bottles. The development of the latter has only recently begun, and for now, the only real option {{when it comes to}} transportation of gas at sea is LNG. Nevertheless, the concept of CNG is still very interesting because it has the capability of reaching stranded gas reservoirs. Whereas exploitation of these areas using vessels transporting LNG would be far too expensive, shipping companies have with the introduction of CNG developed a much more cost-effective and less time consuming method. CNG has been discussed within the shipping industry since the 1960 s, but it is recently that the technology has become sufficiently developed. It is only just now that one has obtained the means to finance the project and been able to make it profitable. Unfortunately, since CNG only exists in theory and on paper, the regulatory framework around the concept is not completely developed. In an attempt to explain the CNG concept, I will therefore look at not only the technical, but also the economical and legal aspects concerning the subject. In this paper I will show {{that there is a need}} for CNG and that it is a better economical alternative to the LNG system when it comes to transporting gas over shorter distances. I will also show that although well known international classification societies, such as Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), have developed their own CNG standards it does not mean that the concept is also covered by the mandatory international regulations produced by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). After analysing the legislations of several international maritime conventions and codes, I will demonstrate that there exists a definition problem in the different conventions and that CNG falls outside the scope of some of the most significant codes. I will firstly evoke the technical aspect of the concept by considering the need for this new type of innovation, before I look into the differences between <b>CNG</b> and <b>LNG</b> to verify the cost-effectiveness of the two methods of transportation. The Norwegian shipping company Knutsen OAS is currently developing a CNG vessel and it will therefore be used as an example to illustrate how the system works in practice. The papers fifth section examines if the international maritime classification societies have acknowledged the CNG concept and what the consequences of this is. I will then look at IMO in the attempt to answer the question if CNG is in compliance with the international conventions SOLAS and MARPOL, before I look into the problems of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods code (IMDG) and the more important International Gas Carrier code (IGC). This is important whereas to the survival of CNG. Finally I will also take into consideration the legal aspects of liability using the Harmful and Noxious Substances convention (HNS) ...|$|R
