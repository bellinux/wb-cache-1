25|$|In Europe {{there exists}} a type of asset-backed bond called a <b>covered</b> <b>bond,</b> {{commonly}} known by the German term Pfandbriefe. Covered bonds were first created in 19th-century Germany when Frankfurter Hypo began issuing mortgage covered bonds. The market has been regulated since {{the creation of a}} law governing the securities in Germany in 1900. The key difference between covered bonds and mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities is that banks that make loans and package them into covered bonds keep those loans on their books. This means that when a company with mortgage assets on its books issues the <b>covered</b> <b>bond,</b> its balance sheet grows, which would not occur if it issued an MBS, although it may still guarantee the securities payments.|$|E

40|$|<b>Covered</b> <b>bonds</b> are a {{specific}} example of senior secured debt. If the issuer of the bonds defaults {{the proceeds of}} the assets in the cover pool are used for their debt service. If in this situation the cover pool proceeds do not suffice for the debt service, the creditors of the bonds have recourse to the issuer's assets and their claims are pari passu with {{the claims of the}} creditors of senior unsecured debt. Historically, <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> have been very safe investments. During their more than two hundred years of existence, investors never suffered losses due to missed payments from <b>covered</b> <b>bonds.</b> From a risk management perspective, therefore modelling <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> losses is mainly of interest for estimating the impact that the asset encumbrance by the cover pool has on the loss characteristics of the issuer's senior unsecured debt. We explore one-period structural modelling approaches for <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> and senior unsecured debt losses with one and two asset value variables respectively. Obviously, two-assets models with separate values of the cover pool and the issuer's remaining portfolio allow for more realistic modelling. However, we demonstrate that exact calibration of such models may be impossible. We also investigate a one-asset model in which the riskiness of the cover pool is reflected by a risk-based adjustment of the encumbrance ratio of the issuer's assets.

40|$|The thesis {{tries to}} explain {{different}} nature of the dynamics during the upward and downward part of the last house price cycle in Spain, characterized by important rigidities. <b>Covered</b> <b>bonds</b> are introduced as an instrument which may accelerate a house price boom, while it may {{also serve as a}} source of correction to overvalued house prices in downturn. In a serious economic stress, lack of investment opportunities motivates investors to buy the <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> due to the strong guarantees provided, which may in turn help to revitalize the credit and housing markets. To address such regime shift, house price dynamics is modelled within a framework of mutually related house price, credit and business cycles using smooth transition vector autoregressive model.
