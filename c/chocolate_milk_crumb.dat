40|$|The {{proteins}} from milk play {{an important}} part in the structural properties of confectionery products. These properties will in turn influence texture and flavour. Electron microscopy techniques have been used to examine <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate,</b> caramel and fudge and to locate and characterise the milk proteins within their structures. Following scanning electron microscopy examination of the products at low temperature, thin sectioning and freeze-fracture were used to resolve the fine ultrastructure of casein and whey proteins. A <b>chocolate</b> prepared from <b>milk</b> <b>crumb</b> could be distinguished from one made with a dry milk powder {{on the basis of a}} more even distribution of protein and a high level of association between milk protein and other ingredients. Caramel was seen to be composed of an amorphous sugar support matrix containing numerous fat globules. Milk protein was found frequently associated with fat although the level of association depended on whether casein or whey protein was present. The development of crystal line sugar in fudge caused the milk protein to concentrate within the remaining amorphous sugar regions. Fat/protein associations were not as obvious as those observed in caramel...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a unique perspective}} to the milk market relative to previous studies. While there is rich literature on the various sectors of the milk market, a contribution to this literature was made by providing a specific econometric analysis of the Promised Land brand. Previous work conducted by Capps and Salin (2010) provided the foundation for this thesis. The purpose of this thesis was threefold: 1. Estimate household demand functions for Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> using Nielsen homescan data. The demand functions were estimated using a tobit model to estimate the conditional and unconditional own-price and cross-price effects of Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> 2. Assess the impacts of household demographic drivers of demand for Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> 3. Use the empirical results derived from the tobit model to identify substitutes and complements of Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> and provide a profile of households that purchase Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> The study concluded that households who purchased Promised Land white were insensitive {{to changes in the}} price of Promised Land white milk. The price of private label milk was the only cross-price that was significant in the quantity of Promised Land white milk purchased. The estimated elasticities showed that Promised Land white milk and private label white milk were substitutes. From the estimated elasticities, it was found that households that purchased Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> were largely insensitive to changes in the price of Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> It was also found that the prices of Nesquick, Oak Farms, and private label <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> had a significant effect on the quantity of Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> purchased. Of these significant prices, private label and Oak Farms <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> were substitutes for Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> The price of Nesquick <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> demonstrated a complementary relationship with Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk...</b>|$|R

40|$|Nutrition and {{recovery}} {{go hand in}} hand. After a resistance training workout, it is extremely important for athletes to rebuild and refuel their bodies with the proper nourishment to obtain maximal results. In doing so, they consume different recovery aids or ergogenic aids for gains in muscle mass, an aid in hydration, and a speedy recovery. Ergogenic aids can include many things (i. e., improved equipment, training program), {{but one of the}} most popular types of ergogenic aids is nutritional supplements such as protein, carbohydrates, creatine, and vitamins. A nutritional supplement that has recently grown in popularity is <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> Currently, no studies exist comparing the effects of fat-free <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> and 2 % <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> on muscular strength and body composition in collegiate softball players. The purpose of this study will be to determine the effects of fat-free and 2 % <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> ingestion on body composition and muscular strength following eight weeks of resistance training. In a randomized (matched according to strength and bodyweight), double blind experimental design, 18 female, collegiate softball players (18. 5 +_. 7 yrs; 65. 7 +_ 1. 8 inches; 156. 2 +_ 21. 6 lbs) ingested either fat-free <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> or 2 % <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> immediately after resistance exercise workouts for an 8 -week period. Dependent variables included body fat percentage, lean muscle mass, bench press 1 RM, and leg press 1 RM. Data was analyzed via a paired samples t-test (to detect difference across both groups over the 8 -week training period) and an independent samples t-test (to detect differences between the groups) using SPSS for Windows 15. 0. No statistically significant differences were found in bench press strength, leg press strength, body fat %, and lean body mass between the fat-free group and the 2 % <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> group. The major finding of this study is that there is no difference between fat-free <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> and 2 % <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> in regards to body fat percentage, lean body mass, bench press maximal strength, and leg press maximal strength following an eight week exercise program where the <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> was ingested immediately after each workout. However, there was a significant difference in both groups combined after the eight week training program. Therefore, from a practical sense, consumption of either fat-free <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> or 2 % <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> in conjunction with a periodized resistance training program does improve exercise performance in regards to maximal strength as well as improvements in body fat percentage and lean body mass...|$|R
40|$|Consumption of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> in the United States {{is growing}} as an {{alternative}} beverage to sports and energy drinks. Recent literature suggests that consumption of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> vis-?-vis sports and energy drinks is an effective recovery aid after prolonged workouts. In this light, knowledge of price sensitivity, substitutes/ complements and demographic profiling with respect to consumption of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> is important for manufacturers, retailers and advertisers of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> Using household-level purchase data for <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk,</b> energy drinks, and sports drinks and related demopraphic characteristics from the 2011 Nielsen Homescan data, we estimated three beverage demand models to show that <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> is a substitute for energy drinks in consumption. Sports drinks are complementary in consumption for energy drinks. Chocoate milk and energy drinks are complements for sports drinks in consumption. According to own-price elasticity of demand for three beverages, we find {{that all of them}} are between - 1 and 0 which means that they are price inelastic. The household size, age, education, race, region, the presence of children, gender of household heads are significant determinants of demand for <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> Household size, age, employment status, education, race, region, the presence of children in a household, gender of household heads significantly affect the demand of energy drinks. Significant demographic variables affecting the demand of sports drinks include household size, age, education, race, region, the presence of children, gender of household heads. It {{is important to note that}} data used in this work only capture at home purchase/consumption of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk,</b> energy drinks and sports drinks. As a result, household?s behavior with respect to away-from home consumption of these beverages is not captured in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Collegiate {{athletes are}} always looking for ways to improve their performance. Resistance {{training}} has been incorporated into most collegiate athletic programs for this very reason. In order to improve strength, lean body mass, and exercise performance, resistance exercise and timely protein ingestion must be followed. Incorporating protein ingestion into a resistance training routine has been shown to improve net protein balance. Milk protein is gaining popularity as an ergogenic aid. There has been growing interest in the potential use of bovine milk (cow’s milk) as an exercise beverage, especially during recovery from resistance training and endurance sports. No studies have been conducted comparing fat free <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> and low fat <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> on muscular strength and body composition in collegiate softball players. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate whether fat free <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> and low fat <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> ingested after resistance exercise improves common performance assessments of collegiate softball players. Specifically, the performance assessments were the vertical jump test, 20 -yard sprint, and the agility t-test. The participants were randomized according to strength and bodyweight, in a double blind experimental design. The 18 female, collegiate softball players (18. 5 ±. 7 yrs; 65. 7 ± 1. 8 inches; 156. 2 ± 21. 6 kg) ingested either fat free <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> or low fat <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> immediately after resistance exercise workouts for an 8 -week period. Dependent variables included vertical jump test, 20 -yard sprint test and agility t-test.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Dietary {{recommendations}} concerning <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> remain controversial {{since the}} effect of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> on the dental caries process is not clear. Cocoa with antibacterial and enamel-solubility-reducing properties may inhibit the formation of dental caries. Since <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> contains {{a significant amount of}} sucrose (about 5 percent) and some cocoa (1 percent), laboratory testing of the cariogenicity of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> seems valuable. The present study investigated whether or not under mouth simulation conditions <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> influenced the formation of dental caries compared to white milk. A control solution, four milk solutions and a milk solution with toothbrushing were tested over a 20 -week experimental period. A mouth-like environment was established by constructing a mouth simulating device. One-hundred- and-sixty-two-teeth were mounted in the mouth simulator in six groups of 27 teeth each. Two independent evaluators had certified the teeth to be caries-free and a computer program was used to ensure complete randomization of the teeth in groups. After initial sterilization by ethylene oxide, the teeth were inoculated with a mixture of a culture of Streptococcus mutans and saliva. Each group was exposed to one of the milk formulations for a 15 minute period twice daily. After each period, a sterile bacterial medium was dripped (8 to 12 mls/hr) over the teeth in the mouth-like environment. After 20 weeks the teeth were separated, coded, and re-evaluated for pit and fissure caries by the same two evaluators. A statistical analysis by Repeated t Tests indicated the presence of three levels of relative cariogenicity: the <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> group had the highest caries rate, the control group and the white milk group were intermediate and the <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> with brushing group showed a marked reduction in dental caries. The results of two other groups were invalidated. In summary, for pit and fissure dental caries under the conditions tested in the mouth simulating device, <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> exhibited a significant cariogenic potential relative to white milk, especially in the early incipient caries stage. It may be concluded from this study that in an individual with high dental caries susceptibility, it would seem unwise to recommend frequent ingestion of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk,</b> unless proper and immediate oral hygiene follows the ingestion...|$|R
