40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, {{one of the}} most serious problems encountered during cementing is the failure at the bonding interface. Many measures including casing-sand adhesion have been developed to improve <b>cementing</b> <b>bond</b> strength. However, due to the lack of detailed study of the technique, many questions remain. The primary goal of this study is to investigate the influence of casing-sand adhesion on <b>cementing</b> <b>bond</b> strength, and to optimize parameters. An orthogonal experiment and a supplementary experiment were conducted. The results indicated that casing-sand adhesion can improve the <b>cementing</b> <b>bond</b> strength. The priority orders of key factors are: sand grain size, sand coverage, adhesive curing temperature and adhesive curing time.

50|$|For cement, {{one thing}} to note {{is that there is}} no {{correlation}} between the shear and compressive strength. Another fact to note is that cement strength ranges between 1000 and 1800 psi, and for reservoir pressures > 1000 psi; this means that the pipe <b>cement</b> <b>bond</b> will fail first. This would lead to the development of micro-annuli along the pipe.|$|E

Molar bands are required to ensure brackets will stick. Bands are also utilized when dental fillings or other dental work make securing a bracket to a tooth infeasible.|$|E

50|$|On January 22, 2016 the Obama {{administration}} announced {{new regulations}} for emissions from {{oil and gas}} on federal lands to be regulated by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to decrease impacts made on global warming and climate change. This {{became known as the}} “BLM fracking rule”, and would take effect on March 31 extending into Federal, Indian, and Public lands. This rule would apply to more than 750 million areas of Federal and Indian lands and regulated chemical disclosure, well integrity, and flowback water management. This rule would require companies to identify the chemicals being used in hydraulic fracturing and their purpose. This requirement would only extend to chemicals used after, not before, fracking to protect company chemical mix recipes. But, not knowing the chemicals beforehand eliminates the government's ability to test the water for a baseline reading to know if the process is contaminating water sources or not. Well integrity is vital to ensure that oil, gas, and other fracking chemicals are not being leached into direct drinking water sources. The rule would require operators to submit a <b>cement</b> <b>bond</b> log to ensure that drinking water has been properly isolated from the water that will be used. Finally, the BLM requires companies to provide their estimated waste water totals along with a disposal plan. The fracking rule was met with critiques for not requiring more transparency from corporations on chemicals being used before drilling into wells.|$|E

In the report, BP was accused of nine faults. One was that it had not used a diagnostic tool to test the strength of the cement. Another was ignoring a pressure test that had failed. Still another was for not plugging the pipe with cement. The study did not, however, place the blame on any one of these events. Rather, it concluded that [...] "notwithstanding these inherent risks, the accident of April 20 was avoidable" [...] and that [...] "it resulted from clear mistakes made in the first instance by BP, Halliburton and Transocean, and by government officials who, relying too much on industry's assertions of the safety of their operations, failed to create and apply a program of regulatory oversight that would have properly minimized the risk of deepwater drilling."

30|$|Transducers {{that are}} widely applied in <b>cement</b> <b>bond</b> {{evaluation}} tools, such as <b>cement</b> <b>bond</b> logs and variable density logs, cannot radiate acoustic energy directionally {{because of the}} characteristics of monopole sources. A phased arc array transmitter, which is a novel transducer that differs from monopole and dipole transducers, is presented in this study. To simulate the acoustic field generated by a phased arc array in a fluid-filled cased borehole with different channelings, a 3 D finite-difference time-domain method is adopted. The acoustic field generated by a traditional monopole source is also simulated and compared with the field generated by the phased arc array transmitter. Numerical simulation results show that the phased arc array radiates energy directionally in a narrow angular range in the borehole, thereby compressing the acoustic energy into a narrow range in the casing pipe, the cement, and the formation. We present the analyses of first-arrival waveforms and the amplitudes of casing waves at different azimuthal angles for the two different sources. The results indicate that employing a directional source facilitates azimuthal identification and analysis of possible channeling behind the casing pipe.|$|E

In this region, over one million oil and gas wells have been drilled, and there is a perception that many areas are not suitable for geosequestration. The project focused on Michigan and Ohio as study areas. Records were obtained for over 280, 000 wells.

Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of <b>cement</b> <b>bonded</b> blue particle boards and cement fibre boards are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement fibre boards. Cement particle boards can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre boards are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber board is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|R
