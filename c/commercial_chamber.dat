40|$|Abstract Background A major {{stumbling}} block for researchers developing experimental models of mechanotransduction is {{the control of}} experimental variables, in particular the transmission of the mechanical forces at the cellular level. A previous evaluation of {{state of the art}} <b>commercial</b> perfusion <b>chambers</b> showed that flow regimes, applied to impart a defined mechanical stimulus to cells, are poorly controlled and that data from studies in which different chambers are utilized can not be compared, even if the target stress regimes are comparable. Methods This study provides a novel chamber design to provide both physiologically-based flow regimes, improvements in control of experimental variables, as well as ease of use compared to <b>commercial</b> <b>chambers.</b> This novel design achieves controlled stresses through five gasket designs and both single- and dual-flow regimes. Results The imparted shear stress within the gasket geometry is well controlled. Fifty percent of the entire area of the 10 × 21 mm universal gasket (Gasket I, designed to impart constant magnitude shear stresses {{in the center of the}} chamber where outcome measures are taken), is exposed to target stresses. In the 8 mm diameter circular area at the center of the chamber (where outcome measures are made), over 92 % of the area is exposed to the target stress (± 2. 5 %). In addition, other gasket geometries provide specific gradients of stress that vary with distance from the chamber inlet. Bench-top testing of the novel chamber prototype shows improvements, in the ease of use as well as in performance, compared to the other <b>commercial</b> <b>chambers.</b> The design of the chamber eliminates flow deviations due to leakage and bubbles and allows actual flow profiles to better conform with those predicted in computational models. Conclusion The novel flow chamber design provides predictable and well defined mechanical forces at the surface of a cell monolayer, showing improvement over previously tested <b>commercial</b> <b>chambers.</b> The predictability of the imparted stress improves both experiment repeatability as well as the accuracy of inter-study comparisons. Carefully controlling the stresses on cells is critical in effectively mimicking in vivo situations. Overall, the improved perfusion flow chamber provides the needed resolution, standardization and in vitro model analogous to in vivo conditions to make the step towards greater use in research and the opportunity to enter the diagnostic and therapeutic market. </p...|$|R

40|$|Epithelial Na+ {{transport}} {{as measured}} {{by a variety of}} techniques, including the short-circuit current technique, has been described to exhibit a “rundown” phenomenon. This phenomenon manifests as time-dependent decrease of current and resistance and precludes the ability to carry out prolonged experiments aimed at examining the regulation of this transport. We developed methods for prolonged stable recordings of epithelial Na+ transport using modifications of the short-circuit current technique and <b>commercial</b> Ussing-type <b>chambers.</b> We utilize the polarized MDCK cell line expressing the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) to describe these methods. Briefly, existing <b>commercial</b> <b>chambers</b> were modified to allow continuous flow of Ringer solution and precise control of such flow. Chamber manifolds and associated plumbing were modified to allow precise temperature clamp preventing temperature oscillations. Recording electrodes were modified to eliminate the use of KCl and prevent membrane depolarization from KCl leakage. Solutions utilized standard bicarbonate-based buffers, but all gasses were prehydrated to clamp buffer osmolarity. We demonstrate that these modifications result in measurements of current and resistance that are stable for at least 2 h. We further demonstrate that drifts in osmolarity similar to those obtained before prior to our modifications can lead to a decrease of current and resistance similar to those attributed to rundown...|$|R

40|$|Plant growth {{chambers}} produce controlled environments, {{which are}} crucial in making reproducible observations in experimental plant biology research. <b>Commercial</b> plant growth <b>chambers</b> can provide precise controls of environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and light cycle, and the capability via complex programming to regulate these environmental parameters. But they are expensive. The {{high cost of}} maintaining a controlled growth environment is often a limiting factor when determining experiment size and feasibility. To overcome the limitation of <b>commercial</b> growth <b>chambers,</b> we designed and constructed an inexpensive plant growth chamber with consumer products for a material cost of $ 2, 300. For a comparable growth space, a <b>commercial</b> plant growth <b>chamber</b> could cost $ 40, 000 or more. Our plant growth chamber had outside dimensions of 1. 5 m (W) x 1. 8 m (D) x 2 m (H), providing a total growth area of 4. 5 m 2 with 40 -cm high clearance. The dimensions of the growth area and height can be flexibly changed. Fluorescent lights with large reflectors provided a relatively spatially uniform photosynthetically active radiation intensity of 140 - 250 μmoles/m 2 /sec. A portable air conditioner provided an ample cooling capacity, and a cooling water mister acted as a powerful humidifier. Temperature, relative humidity, and light cycle inside the chamber were controlled via a z-wave home automation system, which allowed the environmental parameters to be monitored and programmed through the internet. In our setting, the temperature was tightly controlled: 22. 2 °C± 0. 8 °C. The one-hour average relative humidity was maintained at 75 %± 7 % with short spikes up to ± 15 %. Using the interaction between Arabidopsis {{and one of its}} bacterial pathogens as a test experimental system, we demonstrate that experimental results produced in our chamber were highly comparable to those obtained in a <b>commercial</b> growth <b>chamber.</b> In summary, our design of an inexpensive plant growth chamber will tremendously increase research opportunities in experimental plant biology...|$|R
