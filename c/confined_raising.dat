50|$|In {{the eastern}} part of the forest zone, because of the {{influence}} of Mount Cameroon, soils are often fertile and there are large areas of subsistence farming. Major crops include millet, yams and rice, whilst plantation agriculture is extensive on the best soils, producing chiefly cocoa. Further west, due to the ancient geology of the region, soils are much less fertile and farming becomes chiefly <b>confined</b> to the <b>raising</b> of perennial crops, with cocoa remaining pre-eminent. Forestry, however, has devastated much of the natural rainforest in countries such as CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Liberia, and farmers without land have been pushed onto land with soil very marginal for agriculture by population growth, which, despite frequent warfare, continues to be among the highest in the world.|$|R
60|$|As it {{appeared}} to me at one time improbable in a high degree that so complex a gesture as shrugging the shoulders, together with the accompanying movements, should be innate, I was anxious to ascertain whether the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman, who could not have learnt the habit by imitation, practised it. And I have heard, through Dr. Innes, from a lady who has lately had charge of her, that she does shrug her shoulders, turn in her elbows, and raise her eyebrows {{in the same manner}} as other people, and under the same circumstances. I was also anxious to learn whether this gesture was practised by the various races of man, especially by those who never have had much intercourse with Europeans. We shall see that they act in this manner; but it appears that the gesture is sometimes <b>confined</b> to merely <b>raising</b> or shrugging the shoulders, without the other movements.|$|R

The peasant, the hand, is at a discount. The Sierra Leonite is a peddler-born who aspires to be a trader, a merchant; or he looks to a learned profession, especially the law. The term 'gentleman-farmer' has no meaning for him. Of late years a forcing process has been tried, and a few plantations have been laid out, chiefly for the purpose, it would appear, of boasting and of vaunting the new-grown industry at home. Mr. Henry M. Stanley remarks [Footnote: Coomassie and Magdala, p. 8], 'In almost every street in Sierra Leone I heard the voice of praise and local prayer from the numerous aspirants to clerkships and civil service employ; but I am compelled to deny that I ever {{heard the sound of}} mallet and chisel, of mortar, pestle, and trowel, the ringing sound of hammer on anvil, or roar of forge, which, to my practical mind, would have had a far sweeter sound. There is virgin land in the neighbourhood of Sierra Leone yet untilled; there are buildings in the town yet unfinished; there are roads for commerce yet to be made; the trade of the African interior yet waits to be admitted into the capacious harbour of Sierra Leone for the enrichment of the fond nursing-mother of races who sits dreamily teaching her children how to cackle instead of how to work.' ...|$|R

The magnitude of absorption depends on the magnetic field distribution along the ray of the wave. The optical depth is pro-portional to square root of the on-axis electron temperature Te for rays along which the magnetic field strength is almost constant while the optical depth is proportional to Te for the rays that see a large magnetic field gradient.

40|$|Experiments on {{cold atom}} systems {{in which a}} lattice {{potential}} is ramped up on a <b>confined</b> cloud have <b>raised</b> intriguing questions about how the temperature varies along isentropic curves, and how these curves intersect features in the phase diagram. In this paper, we study the isentropic curves of two models of magnetic phase transitions- the classical Blume-Capel Model (BCM) and the Fermi Hubbard Model (FHM). Both Mean Field Theory (MFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods are used. The isentropic curves of the BCM generally run parallel to the phase boundary in the Ising regime of low vacancy density, but intersect the phase boundary when the magnetic transition is mainly driven by a proliferation of vacancies. Adiabatic heating occurs in {{moving away from the}} phase boundary. The isentropes of the half-filled FHM have a relatively simple structure, running parallel to the temperature axis in the paramagnetic phase, and then curving upwards as the antiferromagnetic transition occurs. However, in the doped case, where two magnetic phase boundaries are crossed, the isentrope topology is considerably more complex...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} found in {{previous}} studies that small amounts of adsorbed volatiles can {{have a profound effect on}} the internal friction quality-factor Q of rocks and other porous media. Pandit and Tozer (1970) have suggested that the laboratory-measured Q of volatile-free rocks should be similar to the in situ seismic Q values of near-surface lunar rocks which according to Latham et al. (1970) are in the range of 3000 - 5000. Observations of dramatic increases in Q with outgassing up to values approaching 2000 in the seismic frequency range confirm this supposition. Measurements under confining pressures with the sample encapsulated under hard vacuum are reported to aid in the interpretation of seismic data obtained below the lunar surface. It has been possible to achieve in the experiments Q values just under 2000 at about 1 kbar for a terrestrial analog of lunar basalt. It was found that a well-outgassed sample maintains a high Q whereas one exposed to moisture maintains a low Q as the <b>confining</b> pressure is <b>raised</b> to 2. 5 kbar. This result suggests that volatiles can indeed affect Q when cracks are partially closed and the high lunar seismic Q values reported are concomitant with very dry rock down to depths of at least 50 km...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Chalcogenide Phase-Change Materials (PCMs), such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys, {{are showing}} {{outstanding}} properties, {{which has led}} to their successful use {{for a long time in}} optical memories (DVDs) and, recently, in non-volatile resistive memories. The latter, known as Phase-Change Material memories or Phase-Change Random Access Memories (PCRAMs), are the most promising candidate among emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies to replace the current FLASH memories at CMOS technology nodes under 28 nm. Chalcogenide PCMs exhibit fast and reversible phase transformations between crystalline and amorphous states with very different transport and optical properties leading to a unique set of features for PCRAMs, such as fast programming, good cyclability, high scalability, multi-level storage capability and good data retention. Nevertheless, PCM memory technology has to overcome several challenges to definitively invade the NVM market. In this review paper we examine the main technological challenges that PCM memory technology must face and we illustrate how new memory architecture, innovative deposition methods and PCM composition optimization can contribute to further improvements of this technology. In particular, we examine how to lower the programming currents and increase data retention. Scaling down PCM memories for large scale integration means incorporation of the phase-change material into more and more <b>confined</b> structures and <b>raises</b> material science issues to understand interface and size effects on crystallization. Other material science issues are related to the stability and ageing of the amorphous state of phase-change materials. The stability of the amorphous phase, which determines data retention in memory devices, can be increased by doping the phase-change material. Ageing of the amorphous phase leads to a large increase of the resistivity with time (resistance drift), which has hindered up-to-now the development of ultra-high multilevel storage devices. A review of the current understanding of all these issues is provided from a material science point of view. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Farmers {{represent}} {{the largest group}} of Zlarin inhabitants. In an attempt to describe the patterns of their daily life, our research was directed at certain asp 2 Ì 7 ects of the so-called material culture under the headings of 2 Ì 7 habitation 2 Ì 7 (housing and eating) and 2 Ì 7 work 2 Ì 7 (farming and handicraft activities). 12 Ì 7 he aim was to establish typical developments and patterns of behaviour of Zlarin farmers between the mid-nineteenth and the mid-twentieth century. The material presented here comes from authentic statements made to the author by many Zlarinlans during her visit to the island and from her own observations. The chapter on housing discusses the prevailing building practices and describes typical forms of family housing. In addition to the architectural characteristics, the interior arrangement and furnishing are also described in considerable detail. The description includes not only the living quarters and domestic farm buildings, but also other farm buildings and structures in the village and outside. The characteristics of the two villages, Borovica and Zlarin, are dealt with {{only to the extent that}} they throw light on the patterns of life of the farmers. The dominant agricultural branches in Zlarin were olive and wine growing. Oil and wine were produced not only for the farmers 2 Ì 7 own needs but also for the market. Vegetables from family gardens and home-grown frnits were the staple food, while wheat and barley were grown only in small quantities. Livestock breeding was mainly <b>confined</b> to sheep <b>raising.</b> For each of these activities, the annual sequence of jobs is described, together with the tools and processing utensils. The first part of the chapter on eating patterns lists the main foodstuffs and describes how meals were prepared. The foodstuffs included cereals and their products, vegetables, fruits, wild-growing edible plants, fish, meat and related products, milk and dairy products, and eggs. The second part describes the meals eaten on weekdays (with seasonal variations), then on Sundays, on the occasion of important work in the field, In connection with folk customs and village feasts, on special occasions in life, and at the time of food shortage and famine. The chapter on handicraft activities deals only with those whose traces can still be followed. The most important such activity was the making of textile articles from domestically grown and processed wool. Two other activities are also discussed: the making of light leather sandals and wicker baskets. Finally, the author notes that the material culture of the Zlarin peasants in the period under review was a product of different earlier cultures integrated in a living and dynamic mechanism in which recent elements are found side by side with elements of paleo-Mediterranean, Illyrian, Slav, Venetian-Italian, and Dinaric provenance. In this context, the role of women in the Zlarin farming society is once again stressed...|$|R
40|$|A {{specimen}} of Opalinus clay from Mont Terri {{has been subjected}} to stress testing over a period of 532 days. Testing was undertaken by changing either (or both) of the axial and confining stresses in sharp steps followed by periods of between 4 and 82 days during which time the specimen was allowed to adjust to the new stress state. In this way, the drained consolidation, creep and rebound behaviour of an Opalinus clay specimen was examined. The test material was subjected to a maximum average effective stress of 38. 3 MPa. Volumetric strain data for both volume change and porewater displacement measurements indicate a small inflection in the standard geotechnical plot of void ratio against the logarithm of average effective stress at a value between 20 and 22 MPa. The negative slope of the consolidation curve (Î±) based on volume change measurements exhibits a general trend of increasing magnitude as effective stress rises. Even though the data do not exhibit the sharp increase in Î± indicative of classic virgin consolidation behaviour, it would appear that plastic yielding is occurring at an average effective stress below 20 MPa. Analysis of net porewater flow measurements suggest original interstitial fluid was not expelled from the specimen until average effective stress exceeded 20 MPa. Given the data available, an estimate for the preconsolidation stress in the region of 20 to 25 MPa seems reasonable. As effective stress rises the duration of the strain transients lengthen. As the induration state of the mudrock increases, strain traces are characterised by less well-defined transients, indicative of time-dependent plastic yielding at high effective stresses. The volumetric strain data for both volume change and porewater displacement shows similar transient behaviour. These results give an average principal strain ratio of 0. 252, suggesting the material is either mechanically anisotropic or behaving as a non-ideal elastic medium. Specific storage values derived from porewater displacement measurements show a general decreasing trend with increasing average effective stress and are in the range 1. 5 to 12. 5 Ã 10 - 6 m- 1. Data from volume change measurements are less sensitive to changes in effective stress and are in the range 1. 2 to 17. 5 Ã 10 - 6 m- 1. Elastic constants derived for undrained quantities are significantly higher than those for drained conditions by approximately one order of magnitude. Data suggests there is a transition in behaviour centred around an average effective stress of approximately 20 MPa. Analysis of creep curves can be broken down into three distinct responses. The Lemaitre model, as applied to Opalinus clay by Boidy (Boidy et al., 2002), was applied to the current test data. However the published model parameters failed to adequately fit the current data. Minor alteration of these parameters enabled modelling of the longer-term volumetric responses to be undertaken. The Lemaitre model did not predict the initial stage of creep very effectively. A much slower response time was seen in the current data, which was absent in the work by previous researchers. A power-law creep model was established. In general the fit was adequate for the volumetric strain observed, although these data exhibited some noise. In contrast, the fit of the axial strain data was not adequate and even the subdividing of the data into the individual creep stages failed to give an acceptable fit. A combination of power-law for the initial response and Lemaitre for the longer response may achieve a better prediction for this test stage. A numerical simulation was run using the 2 -dimensional coupled flow and deformation code STAFAN. Two phases of the testing were modelled separately. During Phase 1, the model was used in an attempt to fit the creep data. A reasonable fit was made to the first step axial strain data, but the extrapolation to later stages showed a progressive deviation from the data. In addition, the model made poor predictions for the radial strain and porewater flow data in all steps. These observations indicate that both the assumptions of linear elasticity and isotropic deformation are probably invalid for this specimen. During the second phase of testing, the axial and <b>confining</b> stresses were <b>raised</b> synchronously in a series of seven 4 MPa steps. In view {{of the results of the}} Phase 1 modelling, it was decided to treat each step of Phase 2 as a separate test and to use the model to parameterise the changing state of the specimen. Youngâs modulus was significantly lower than those derived from volume and porewater displacement measurements, which can be explained by the over prediction of radial strain due to the simple linear-elastic assumption in the STAFAN model. It has been shown that the linear elastic deformation model is not a good analogue for the behaviour of this specimen. There are clear indications of non-linear responses to stress changes in the data and it seems likely that some form of viscoelastic or viscoplastic model should be adopted. In addition, the axial and radial strain responses would seem to be anisotropic, bringing further complexity to the model that should be employed...|$|R
