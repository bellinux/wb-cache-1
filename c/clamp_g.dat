However, several GLUT-independent mechanisms have been postulated. To determine the contribution of GLUT blockade to protease inhibitor-mediated glucose dysregulation, the effects of ritonavir were investigated in mice lacking the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT 4 (G 4 KO). G 4 KO and control C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were administered ritonavir or vehicle {{at the start of}} an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic <b>clamps.</b> <b>G</b> 4 KO mice exhibited elevated fasting blood glucose compared with C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Ritonavir impaired glucose tolerance in control mice but did not exacerbate glucose intolerance in G 4 KO mice. Similarly, ritonavir reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity in control mice but not in G 4 KO mice. Serum insulin levels were reduced in vivo in ritonavir-treated mice. Ritonavir reduced serum leptin levels in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice but had no effect on serum adiponectin. No change in these adipokines was observed following ritonavir treatment of G 4 KO mice. These data confirm that a primary effect of ritonavir on peripheral glucose disposal is mediated through direct inhibition of GLUT 4 activity in vivo. The ability of GLUT 4 blockade to contribute to derangements in the other molecular pathways that influence insulin sensitivity remains to be determined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Developing {{efficient}} onsite {{damage detection}} and safety evaluation methods for glass curtain wall {{is still a}} challenging task. In this work, a simple approach to predict the failure and risk of falling down of curtain wall glass was developed through {{the relationship between the}} natural frequency changes and the declined reliability of the structures. Natural frequencies of the curtain wall glass under various clamping conditions were determined using dynamic tests. It was discovered that, with the decrease of the clamping force at the boundary of the glass specimen, the measured natural frequencies decreased linearly. Thus, the in-service capacity in edge <b>clamping</b> (e. <b>g.</b> boundary is loosed or failure of the supporting structure) of the curtain wall glass can be identified by its natural frequency changes. The expected lowest safety natural frequency of a curtain wall glass (given elastic parameters, shape and size) is given.

A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R

The present study was designed to evaluate the action of Con G on NMDA receptor-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and its modulation by glycine in cultured cortical neurons (13 - 19 days in vitro) using the whole-cell patch <b>clamp</b> technique. Con <b>G</b> inhibited NMDA receptormediated spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, the potency of Con G decreased as a function of time in culture.

Further, similar results were obtained with experiments on Con G-induced inhibition of NMDA-evoked whole cell currents. The present results indicate that glycine concentrations do not have a direct effect on Con G-induced inhibition of NMDA currents. In addition, age-dependency in the action of Con G on cortical neurons in vitro suggests that this model system would be useful in examining the effects of different agonists/antagonists on native synaptic NMDA receptors.

The increase in current amplitude was caused by an 8 - to 10 -mV negative shift in the voltage dependence of both activation and inactivation. The effects of G-protein activators were blocked by treatment with pertussis toxin or guanosine 5 '-[beta-thio]diphosphate (GDP[beta S]), a nonhydrolyzable GDP analog, but not by cholera toxin. GDP[beta S] (2 mM) alone had effects opposite those of GTP[gamma S], shifting Na(+) -channel gating 8 - 10 mV toward more-positive membrane potentials and suggesting that basal activation of G proteins {{in the absence of}} stimulation is sufficient to modulate Na+ channels. In CNaIIA- 1 cells, thrombin, which activates pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in CHO cells, caused a further negative shift in the voltage dependence of Na(+) -channel activation and inactivation beyond that observed with GTP alone. The results in CNaIIA- 1 cells indicate that the alpha subunit of the Na+ channel alone is sufficient to mediate G protein effects on gating. The modulation of Na+ channels via a G-protein-coupled pathway acting on Na(+) -channel alpha subunits may regulate electrical excitability through integration of different G-protein-coupled synaptic inputs...|$|R

Detergent (CHAPS) and boiled G beta gamma preparation could not activate the KACh channel. G beta gamma suspended by Lubrol PX instead of CHAPS also activated the channel. Even when G beta gamma was pretreated in Mg(2 +) -free EDTA internal solution containing GDP analogues (24 - 48 h) to inactivate possibly contaminating G i alpha *'s, the G beta gamma activated the channel. Furthermore, G beta gamma preincubated with excessive GDP-bound G o alpha did not activate the channel. These results indicate that G beta gamma itself, but neither the detergent CHAPS nor contaminating G i alpha *, activates the KACh channel. Three different kinds of G i alpha * at 10 pM- 10 nM could weakly activate the KACh channel. However, they were effective only in 40 of 124 patches (32. 2 %) and their maximal channel activation was approximately 20 % of that induced by GTP-gamma S or G beta gamma. Thus, G i alpha * activation of the KACh channel may not be significant. On the other hand, G i alpha *'s effectively activated the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) in the ventricular cell membrane when the KATP channel was maintained phosphorylated by the internal solution containing 100 microM Mg.

G i alpha *'s also activated the phosphorylated KATP channel in the atrial cell membrane, but did not affect the background KACh channel. G beta gamma subsequently applied to the same patch caused prominent KACh channel activation.

Cells with the dnaN 5 allele are temperature sensitive for growth due to a defect in DNA replication at 49 °C, and they show an increase in mutation frequency caused by a partial defect in MMR at permissive temperatures.

We isolated three intragenic suppressors of dnaN 5 that restored growth at the nonpermissive temperature while maintaining an increase in mutation frequency.

Of these, S 181 G and E 346 K are located near the hydrophobic cleft of the β clamp, a common site occupied by proteins that bind the β clamp. Using several methods, we show that the increase in mutation frequency resulting from each dnaN allele is linked to a defect in MMR. Moreover, we found that S 181 G and E 346 K allowed growth at elevated temperatures and did not have an appreciable effect on mutation frequency when separated from G 73 R.

40|$|Background Policies for {{timing of}} cord {{clamping}} vary, with early cord clamping generally {{carried out in}} the first 60 seconds after birth, whereas later cord clamping usually involves clamping the umbilical cord more than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation has ceased. The benefits and potential harms of each policy are debated. Objectives To determine the effects of early cord clamping compared with late cord clamping after birth on maternal and neonatal outcomes Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 February 2013). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing early and late cord clamping. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Main results We included 15 trials involving a total of 3911 women and infant pairs. We judged the trials to have an overall moderate risk of bias. Maternal outcomes: No studies in this review reported on maternal death or on severe maternal morbidity. There {{were no significant differences between}} early versus late cord clamping groups for the primary outcome of severe postpartum haemorrhage (risk ratio (RR) 1. 04, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 65 to 1. 65; five trials with data for 2066 women with a late clamping event rate (LCER) of ˜ 3. 5 %, I 2 0 %) or for postpartum haemorrhage of 500 mL or more (RR 1. 17 95 % CI 0. 94 to 1. 44; five trials, 2260 women with a LCER of ˜ 12 %, I 2 0 %). There were no significant differences between subgroups depending on the use of uterotonic drugs. Mean blood loss was reported in only two trials with data for 1345 women, with no significant differences seen between groups; or for maternal haemoglobin values (mean difference (MD) - 0. 12 g/dL; 95 % CI - 0. 30 to 0. 06, I 2 0 %) at 24 to 72 hours after the birth in three trials. Neonatal outcomes: There were no significant differences between early and late clamping for the primary outcome of neonatal mortality (RR 0. 37, 95 % CI 0. 04 to 3. 41, two trials, 381 infants with a LCER of ˜ 1 %), or for most other neonatal morbidity outcomes, such as Apgar score less than seven at five minutes or admission to the special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit. Mean birthweight was significantly higher in the late, compared with early, cord <b>clamping</b> (101 <b>g</b> increase 95 % CI 45 to 157, random-effects model, 12 trials, 3139 infants, I 2 62 %). Fewer infants in the early cord clamping group required phototherapy for jaundice than in the late cord clamping group (RR 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 41 to 0. 96, data from seven trials, 2324 infants with a LCER of 4. 36 %, I 2 0 %). Haemoglobin concentration in infants at 24 to 48 hours was significantly lower in the early cord clamping group (MD - 1. 49 g/dL, 95 % CI - 1. 78 to - 1. 21; 884 infants, I 2 59 %). This difference in haemoglobin concentration was not seen at subsequent assessments. However, improvement in iron stores appeared to persist, with infants in the early cord clamping over twice as likely to be iron deficient at three to six months compared with infants whose cord clamping was delayed (RR 2. 65 95 % CI 1. 04 to 6. 73, five trials, 1152 infants, I 2 82 %). In the only trial to report longer-term neurodevelopmental outcomes so far, no overall differences between early and late clamping were seen for Ages and Stages Questionnaire scores. Authors' conclusions A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants. Delayed cord clamping is likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available. McDonald SJ, Middleton P, Dowswell T, Morris P...|$|R
40|$|Mechanosensitive (MS) {{channels}} are those whose open probability (P open) changes {{in response to}} mechanical stimulation. Principally, {{there are two types}} of mechanical effects on the channel activity, stretch-activation and stretch-inactivation. Mechano-responses can be detected with patch-clamp recordings in cells from bacteria to human, indicating the ubiquitous distribution of MS channels. Mechanosensitivity has recently been shown to be associated with a variety of unrelated channel types, suggesting that susceptibility to membrane tension could be an inherent property of many integral membrane proteins. In this thesis, I tested the hypothesis that an arbitrarily chosen channel with no known mechanotransducer function could be mechanosusceptible under conditions when (1) studied by patch-clamp recordings and (2) heterologously expressed where the protective machinery of its native environment is absent. In order to test this hypothesis, a simple well characterized voltage-dependent K+ channel, Shaker-Inactivation-Removed (Shaker-IR) was expressed in Xenopus oocytes in which the endogenous MS channels were blocked by Gd 3 + (100 muM GdCl 3) to facilitate the observation of mechano-response of Shaker-IR. Characteristic conductance-voltage (G-V) curves were obtained for Shaker-IR by two-electrode voltage <b>clamp</b> recordings, although <b>Gd</b> 3 + shifted the voltage gating by 23 mV. Shaker-IR currents (ISh) were studied in cell-attached and inside-out excised patches with or without mechanical stimulations. In macropatches, various mechanical effects on Ish were recorded at different activation levels (i. e. at different membrane potentials). At the foot of the G-V curves where Popen was low, stretch-activation dominated the MS Shaker-IR channel activity. At the intermediate range of the curves, only minor stretch effects were detectable. At the top of the curves where Popen was high, sustained stretch frequently caused stretch-inactivation. In small patches, stretch-activation and stretch-inactivation were evident as single channel events. Single channel recordings revealed that at a given membrane potential, Popen changed steeply with the applied pressure, in a dose-dependent manner. As in macro-patch recordings, both stretch-activation and stretch-inactivation were induced in the same patch, depending on the pre-stretch Popen. Before reaching a conclusion that the observed mechanical effects were indicative of the mechanosusceptibility of a voltage-dependent channel, it was necessary to rule out the possibility that these effects might be caused by stretch-induced changes in membrane area or by "breakthrough currents" from the oocytes' endogenous MS channels. These possibilities were excluded by the following arguments: (1) Mechanical stimuli produced no apparent increase in capacitance of the patched-membrane, while the increase of the channel activity upon stretch was often one to two orders of magnitude. (2) Stretch-inactivation (not expected from increased area of the recording patch) occurred and could be observed in the same patch that showed stretch-activation. (3) Both the activation and inactivation could be elicited by either suction or blowing. (4) None of these responses were observed in no-Shaker-IR control oocytes. (5) The effects of mechanical stretch depended on the membrane potential, i. e. on the pre-stretch Popen of the Shaker-IR channel. In conclusion, membrane stretch can interfere with the voltage gating of Shaker-IR, consistent with the assumption that mechanosusceptibility may be an inherent property of many integral membrane proteins. Since mechanosusceptibility is easy to demonstrate, it might play a role in the physiology of cells by (a) modifying the activity of ion channels and (b) creating a need for mechanoprotection for channels when they are not used to monitor bilayer tension...|$|R
