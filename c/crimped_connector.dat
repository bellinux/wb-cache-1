50|$|Nichrome, a {{non-magnetic}} 80/20 alloy {{of nickel}} and chromium, {{is the most}} common resistance wire for heating purposes because it has a high resistivity and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures. When used as a heating element, resistance wire is usually wound into coils. One difficulty in using nichrome wire is that common tin-based electrical solder will not bond with it, so the connections to the electrical power must be made using other methods such as <b>crimp</b> <b>connectors</b> or screw terminals.|$|R

A tube-shaped <b>connector</b> with two <b>crimps</b> for splicing wires in-line is called a butt splice connector. Crimp-on connectors are attached by inserting the stripped end of a stranded wire into {{a portion of the}} connector, which is then mechanically deformed / compressed (crimped) tightly around the wire.

40|$|Background. Three European {{centers have}} {{recently}} reported dramatic {{failures of the}} STRATOS titanium system, approved in Europe and the United States since 2007 and meant for pectus repair, without detailed exploration of its causes. Methods. Failed implants (fractures or loosened <b>crimp</b> <b>connectors)</b> were surgically explanted from 12 patients and biopsies taken from surrounding discolored tissue. Detailed failure analysis was performed to find the cause of failures. Inductively coupled mass spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive radiograph spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} titanium and to visualize titanium wear debris in histologic sections. Results. Implants failed in all patients by fracture of connecting bar, fracture of lateral bar at reduced cross-section, loosening of <b>crimp</b> <b>connector,</b> or different combinations of these. All fracture surfaces were clean and smooth without any signs of plastic deformation. Failure already started at 10 months after implantation and continued for 2. 5 years. Biopsy of discolored tissue around the failures showed 0. 4 mg to 105 mg titanium per gram tissue, and close observation showed titanium wear debris. Conclusions. Combined tensile, compressive, bending, and torsional loading on the implant during each breathing cycle caused loosening and fatigue fractures, which led to failure. Excessive rubbing at the fracture and loosening site caused the release of large amounts of titanium in the surrounding tissue, which may lead to metallosis. Long and sharp pieces of failed implant in the cardiothoracic region is a grave danger to vital organs. All patients should be closely followed, and in our opinion, all implants should be removed. Serious reconsideration for clinical use of this implant is necessary. (C) 2017 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeon...|$|R

An embodiment of the device as a crimping tool comprises a compressing means, pulse-generating circuitry. at least one ultrasonic transmitting transducer, at least one ultrasonic receiving transducer, receiving circuitry, and a display.

5000|$|Although {{the gender}} of tubing and {{plumbing}} fittings is usually obvious, {{this may not be}} true of electrical connectors because of their more complex and varying constructions. Instead, connector gender is conventionalized and thus can be somewhat obscure to the uninitiated. For example, the female D-subminiature connector body projects outward from the mounting plane of the chassis, and this protrusion could be erroneously construed as male. Instead, the [...] "maleness" [...] of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of male pins, rather than by the protrusion of the connector, which is also true for many other pin-based connectors like XLR. The male/female distinction is more obvious with ring <b>crimp</b> lug <b>connectors</b> which are placed around a screw post, but again with spade or split ring <b>crimp</b> lug <b>connectors</b> the end alone is not obviously female.|$|R
40|$|Crimping is a {{mechanical}} joining technique to manufacture electrical connectors by squeezing the clip's crimp barrel onto the conductor. Primarily, crimped connections have to fulfill mechanical and electrical functions. The {{increasing number of}} electrical components in automobiles makes crimp connections very important parts, the reliability of which must be assured. Simulation of crimping process and operation is an efficient tool to optimize <b>crimped</b> <b>connectors</b> and {{to reduce the amount}} of expensive testing during development of new crimps. A three dimensional finite element model validated with crimp experiments is used to simulate the crimp process. Tensile tests on clip and wire material were performed to determine the parameters of the material models employed in the process simulations. The calculations lead to various process dependent results like crimp force, contact pressure and final stress state allowing to estimate the performance of the crimp connection. Thus, a significant reduction in cost and development time can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to quantitatively assess wire crimp connections is discussed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating through the junction of a <b>crimp</b> <b>connector</b> and wire is shown to correlate with the results of a destructive pull test, which previously has been used to assess crimp wire junction quality. Various crimp junction pathologies (missing wire strands, incorrect wire gauge, incomplete wire insertion in connector) are ultrasonically tested, and their results are correlated with pull tests. Results show that the ultrasonic measurement technique consistently (as evidenced with pull-testing data) predicts good crimps when ultrasonic transmission is above a certain threshold amplitude level. A physics-based model, solved by finite element analysis, describes the compressional ultrasonic wave propagation through the junction during the crimping process. This model is in agreement within 6 % of the ultrasonic measurements. A prototype instrument for applying the technique while wire crimps are installed is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Overhead and {{underground}} line {{work in the}} electric power industry is physically very strenuous and can expose workers to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), particularly in the upper extremity. Crimping compression connectors—such as sleeve connectors and lugs—and cutting cables {{are two of the}} most frequent tasks that line workers perform. Line workers at many utilities in the US <b>crimp</b> <b>connectors</b> and cut cable with long-handled manual tools. However, the actual magnitude of the forces applied to the handles of these tools is not known. The objectives of this laboratory study were to measure the forces applied to the handles of a manual press and a manual cutter in order to connect typical wire gauges and cut common cables, respectively. The handles of the manual press and cutter were attached to the drive cylinder and load cell of an Instrom Material Testing System, and peak forces exerted against the handles were measured. Results showed that the outer die of the manual press required about 50 % more handle force than <b>crimping</b> <b>connectors</b> with the inner die location. The peak handle forces required to cut aluminum conductor cable as large as 2 cm diameter exceeded 500 N and were about 200 N greater than the peak forces to compress connectors manually. When the peak force data were compared to strength capabilities reported in the literature, less than 1 % of the general population was found to have the maximum strength to manually make one crimp on a common overhead connector. Less than 1 % and approximately 50 % of the female and male general population, respectively, were found to have the maximum strength to manually cut a cable with a 2 cm diameter conductor. Handle force data from this study provide a biomechanical framework for explaining how the job demands of overhead and {{underground line}} workers could possibly cause MSDs. Relevance to industry Electric power utilities can review their work practices and tools in order to determine whether they can reduce the exposure of their workers to risk factors of MSDs, as well as reduce their cost of health care. Manufacturers of crimping and cutting tools can use the experimental approach in this study to measure the external forces required for their respective tools and then set quantitative force benchmarks to improve the design of their tools...|$|R
5000|$|This {{system is}} used to protect the car's {{lighting}} systems from potential damage if wiring in a trailer should malfunction. It is a tried and tested system in very wide use. Bypass systems are found both in [...] "universal" [...] (non vehicle-dedicated) systems and in dedicated and OEM systems. It works by taking a small current signal from the vehicle's lighting harness to trigger a relay and send a direct power supply to the towing socket. It does not communicate with the vehicle and will not activate any safety or convenience systems. It has the built-in advantage of isolating the trailer wiring {{from that of the}} towing vehicle and thus preventing overloading the vehicle's own lighting harness which may be minimal gauge cabling. The connection onto this harness will cause damage if solder or <b>crimp</b> <b>connectors</b> are used! However, by-pass systems should protect the car's electrical modules from damage should the wiring in a towed trailer malfunction. It is not advised for use in cars that depend on sensing the presence of a trailer to activate towing-related safety features within the car.(See Trailer Stability Programme).

Also, it is desirable to have a schedule so that simultaneous use of the same head on more than one machine is avoided.

40|$|International audienceBecause of the {{increasing}} size of electrical networks in automotives, the degradation of wires and connectors {{has become a major}} concern. As a matter of fact, severe system failures are often merely due to broken wires, bad <b>crimping</b> or degraded <b>connectors.</b> Furthermore, the difficulty to localize those kinds of defects using nowadays techniques generally leads to costly repair. Reflectometry is a well-known method used to monitor the health of lines and wired networks. Wiring networks can be affected with two types of faults: "soft ones" are created by the change of the impedance along the line due to different kinds of defects (insulation, radial crack, and degradation of connector [...] .) in the wire and "hard ones" which correspond to open and short circuits. For the first type of faults, the frequency-domain response of the faulty wiring presents a modification of the impedance, in the defect location. For that reason, this paper focuses on the application of the reflectometry technique to the broadband characterization of a vibration degraded Cu-Sn connector. Once the Sn plating is removed, the electrical properties of the contact interface are entirely modified. The results presented in this paper show that observing such kind of transition can be used as criteria for estimating the degradation level of the connector...|$|R
40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} considerations {{for the design}} of wiring for the Lunar Module. Included are a review of the choice of conductors and insulations, the wire splicing (i. e., crimping, and soldering), the wire connectors, and the fabrication of the wire harnesses. The problems in fabrication include the wires being the wrong length, the damage due to the sharp edges, the requried use of temproary protective covers and inadequate training. The problems in the wire harness installation include damge from sharp eges, work on adjacent harnesses, connector damage, and breaking wires. Engineering suggestions from the Apollo-era in reference to the conductors that are reviewed include: the use of plated conductors, and the use of alloys for stronger wiring. In refernce to insulation, the suggestions from Apollo era include the use of polymer tape-wrap wire insulation due to the light weight, however, other types of modern insulation might be more cost-effective. In reference to wire splices and terminal boards the suggestions from the Apollo Era include the use of crimp splices as superior to solder splices, joining multiple wire to a common point using modular plug-ins might be more reliable, but are heavier than <b>crimp</b> splicing. For <b>connectors,</b> the lessons from the Apollo era indicate that a rear environmental seal that does not require additional potting is preferred, and pins should be crimped or welded to the incoming wires and be removable {{from the rear of the}} connector...|$|R
40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic feed-thru connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or recessed contact pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact pin retention forces, contact <b>crimp</b> failures, unmated <b>connectors</b> and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged connector elastomeric seals and cryogenic connector failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact retention, plating issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, bent pins, contact crimp barrel cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related. A number of recommendations were identified for improving NASA connector selection processes and overall space connector reliability and performance...|$|R
