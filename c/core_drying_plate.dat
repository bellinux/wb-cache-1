50|$|Several years later, {{they were}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the quality of}} the <b>dry</b> <b>plates</b> that at the time were entering major use in the industry. They patented a machine for coating mass quantities of <b>dry</b> <b>plates,</b> and set up the Stanley <b>Dry</b> <b>Plate</b> Company in Watertown, Massachusetts (the company was later moved to Rochester, New York). By the 1890s, that business had over $1 million in annual sales. However, the brothers abandoned photography when they became interested in automobile development, and sold the <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> business to George Eastman of Eastman-Kodak for $500,000.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>plate,</b> {{also known}} as gelatin process, is an {{improved}} type of photographic plate. It was invented by Dr. Richard L. Maddox in 1871, and by 1879 it was so well introduced that the first <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> factory had been established. With much of the complex chemistry work centralized into a factory, the new process simplified the work of photographers, allowing them to expand their business.|$|R
50|$|The Collodion-Albumen {{process is}} one of the early <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> processes, invented by Joseph Sidebotham in 1861.|$|R
50|$|Nettleton {{used the}} wet plate process for his images. Also {{referred}} to as collodion process. The new process of the <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> was being used substantially {{by the general public}} in 1885. This new technique of photography had given Nettleton a tough time with his wet plate process and eventually he settled on retirement five years after it was generalised to the public. The <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> process was afflicting on Nettleton.|$|R

50|$|The {{advantages}} of the <b>dry</b> <b>plate</b> were obvious: photographers could use commercial <b>dry</b> <b>plates</b> off the shelf {{instead of having to}} prepare their own emulsions in a mobile darkroom. Negatives {{did not have to be}} developed immediately. Also, for the first time, cameras could be made small enough to be hand-held, or even concealed: further research created 'fast' exposure times, which led to 'snapshot' photography (and the 'Kodak' camera with roll film), ultimately paving the way for cinematography.|$|R

40|$|Existing {{methods used}} to {{quantify}} microsclerotia of Verticillium dahliae in soil are reviewed. Most quantification methods are soil-type dependent, but are useful for disease prediction within certain soils. The major factor determining the accuracy of <b>dry</b> <b>plating</b> methods {{is the amount of}} soil plated per Petri dish. Wet plating methods are less sensitive to higher amounts of soil, especially when the fraction smaller than 20 mum is removed by wet sieving. Despite general assumptions, wet plating methods do not have lower detection limits than <b>dry</b> <b>plating</b> methods. <b>Dry</b> <b>plating</b> methods are less variable at higher inoculum levels, but more variable at low inoculum levels. Bioassays are helpful tools in answering specific research questions, but are not convenient for large scale use. Molecular quantification techniques are promising, because they are not hampered by antagonistic effects, but data on their disease predictive abilities are still largely lacking. Suggestions are given for a better comparison of techniques, and some original results are presented to illustrate certain arguments...|$|R

50|$|Gelatin emulsions, as {{proposed}} by Maddox, were very sensitive to touch and mechanical frictionand were not much more sensitive to light than collodion emulsions. Charles Harper Bennett discovered a method of hardening the emulsion, making it more resistant to friction in 1873. In 1878, Bennett discovered that by prolonged heating, {{the sensitivity of the}} emulsion could be greatly increased. George Eastman developed a machine to coat plates in 1879 and opened the Eastman Film and <b>Dry</b> <b>Plate</b> Company, reducing the cost of photography. A competitor of Eastman in the development and manufacture of gelatin <b>dry</b> <b>plates</b> was the architectural photographer Albert Levy.|$|R
