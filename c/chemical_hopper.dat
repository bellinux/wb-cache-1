5000|$|The {{aircraft}} carriage {{is built}} from bolted aluminium tubing. Inflight steering is accomplished via foot pedals that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has foot-controlled nosewheel steering. The {{main landing gear}} incorporates spring rod suspension. The aircraft has a typical empty weight of 285 lb and a gross weight of 720 lb, giving a useful load of 435 lb. With full fuel of [...] the payload for the pilot and chemicals for application is 375 lb. A series of dry <b>chemical</b> <b>hoppers</b> and liquid <b>chemical</b> tanks of [...] were available and the chemicals were disbursed from booms protruding from {{either side of the}} cockpit at propeller hub height.|$|R
50|$|Developed with {{assistance}} from NASA, the University of Wichita and the University of Robbins, California, the aircraft was unusual {{in that it}} had a second engine mounted directly below its main powerplant, using this second motor to power a distribution system that used compressed air to carry dry <b>chemicals</b> from a <b>hopper</b> and blow them out of the trailing edges of its wings, over the flaps. Varying the power of this blower engine also provided lift control.|$|R

This task is designed to generate data base of the key properties of ashes collected from operating advanced particle filters and to relate these ash proeprties to the operation and performance of these filters. Activities including initial formatting of the data base and entry, modification of the permeability model, and initial design of a high-temperature test device for measuring uncompacted bulk porosity of ashe aggregates (indicator of relative cohesivity of the ash, filter cake porosity/permeability). <b>Chemical</b> analyses of <b>hopper</b> and filter cake ashes from Tidd showed that the consolidation degree could not be accounted for by condensation/adsorption from the flue gas; the mechanism is likely physical rearrangement of the ash particles...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model for}} stresses in a cohesive bulk solid in a vertical, cylindrical vessel has been developed, assuming a rotated, circular arc orientation of principal stresses, after Enstad [1995. On {{the theory of}} arching in mass flow <b>hoppers.</b> <b>Chemical</b> Engineering Science 30 (10), 1273 – 1283] and Li [1994. Mechanics of arching in a moving bed standpipe with interstitial gas flow. Powder Technology 78, 179 – 187]. The model assumes that principal stresses form a spherical dome surface within the vessel. At the wall, the surface makes a constant angle with the wall normal, necessitating a progression of arc centre up the vessel. An incremental element of upper and lower surfaces with vertical height δx at the wall has variable thickness with arc angle ε measured from the vessel centre. Positions within the vessel are located by height at which the arc cuts the vessel wall x, and arc angle ε. Rotational symmetry is assumed through azimuthal angle θ. This gives 3 principal stresses: σR; σε;σθ. Static vertical and horizontal force balances yielded two partial differential equations, and a third was obtained by assuming a known ratio between effective stresses and. These equations were integrated numerically to give stress surfaces in x–ε space. The model simulated variations {{in the state of}} stress across the arc surface, and in some conditions, this lead to large variations in stress between the wall and vessel centre. The model accurately predicted the minimum outlet radius required for flow of a cohesive bulk material. The presence of a vertical, co-axial rathole was modelled with minor geometrical modifications. The rathole was assumed to be an unconfined plane of principal stress where the radial stress, σR, acted vertically downwards and its value increased linearly with bed depth, contrary to Jenike's [1964. Storage and flow of solids, Bull. 123, University of Utah, USA] assumption of a limiting stress in deep beds. Conventional stability criteria (σR<=fc for stability), suggest that only shallow ratholes can exist. However, a modified yield criterion, allowing for the curvature of the rathole, enabled deep, stable ratholes to exist. Results show that the stability of deep ratholes depends upon the rathole radius and the vessel radius...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, John Weatherly formed the Weatherly Aviation Company, to convert 19 Fairchild M-62s into the Weatherly WM-62C {{agricultural}} aircraft. With this experience, Weatherly designed his own agricultural monoplane, the Weatherly Model 201. The Weatherly 201 is a cantilever low-wing monoplane, with a fixed tailwheel landing gear, and {{powered by a}} nose-mounted 450 hp (336 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial engine. Its fuselage is constructed of steel tube with aluminium panel covering, while the wings, which are unswept and have 6 degrees of dihedral, are of all metal (aluminium) construction. It has an enclosed cockpit for the pilot, and a glassfibre 270 gallon (1022 litre) <b>chemical</b> <b>hopper</b> in the forward fuselage. It was designed for crop dusting and liquid spraying, and was certified in 1967.|$|E
50|$|The Tsikada has a metal wing, {{rectangular}} in {{plan and}} with small downturned tips. The engines are mounted over the wing as close together as the propeller discs allow. They, and the wing centre section are supported over the fuselage {{by a short}} cabane; a single faired strut on each side braces the wing to the lower fuselage, assisted by a jury strut. The composite skinned fuselage has one or two rows of side by side seats, each {{with a pair of}} side windows in the doors, behind a single piece windscreen. There is a baggage compartment with a maximum load of 40 kg. Aft of the cabin the fuselage tapers, with an upswept underside, to a tall swept fin and balanced rudder. The rectangular tailplane, externally braced from above and carrying separate, unbalanced elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement, is mounted on the fin a little above the fuselage. The tricycle undercarriage has mainwheels on sprung cantilever legs and a steerable oleo sprung nose wheel. A <b>chemical</b> <b>hopper</b> with underwing spray bar and discharge chute from the central fuselage underside is an option.|$|E
50|$|An-2SKh (Sel'skoKhozyaistvennyy - {{agricultural}}) - The agricultural version optimised for crop-spraying and crop-dusting. A {{metal construction}} <b>chemical</b> <b>hopper</b> {{was installed in}} the cabin near the centre of gravity, feeding a spreader through a 300mm orifice. The original spreader was replaced in 1975 by a standardised RTSh-1 three channel spreader which increased distribution width from 18 - 22 m to 34 - 36 m. Liquid chemicals could be sprayed using an interchangeable system which delivered chemical to spraybars via a ram air turbine driven regulator pump to give coverage 30 m wide. Powdered or granulated chemicals were loaded through a hatch in {{the roof of the}} cabin and liquid chemical through a special connector on the port side of the fuselage. Early An-2SKh's were typically limited to a 6,000-hour life, as opposed to a normal life of 12,000hrs, due to the corrosive effects of the chemicals. The introduction of epoxy based corrosion protection systems partly alleviated the situation, allowing the agricultural An-2s to continue flying for much longer. Five An-2SKh aircraft were converted to firefighters, from 1954, by pressurising the hopper filled with water and/or retardant and ejecting it from a nozzle in place of the dusting/spraying equipment, single aircraft were allocated to Civil Air Directorates across the country but proved relatively ineffectual.|$|E
