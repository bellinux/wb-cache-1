5|$|Dhumavati's worship is {{performed}} in {{the night in a}} <b>cremation</b> ground, bare-bodied {{with the exception of a}} loincloth. The fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) is considered the special day to perform her puja (worship). The worshipper should observe a fast and remain silent for a whole day and night. They should also perform a homa ("fire sacrifice"), wearing wet clothes and a turban, repeating the goddess' mantra in a <b>cremation</b> ground, forest, or any lonely place.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 the <b>Cremation</b> Society of Great Britain {{bought an}} {{isolated}} {{piece of the}} LNC's Brookwood land and built Woking Crematorium on the site. The crematorium was completed in 1879 but Richard Cross, the Home Secretary, bowed to strong protests from local residents and threatened to prosecute if any cremations were conducted. As a consequence the crematorium was not used other than for the experimental incineration of livestock. The 1884 trial of William Price established that human <b>cremation</b> was not unlawful in England, and on 26March 1885 the first human <b>cremation</b> took place at Woking. Although the LNC was hostile {{to the idea of}} <b>cremation,</b> Woking Crematorium was the only operational crematorium in the country. Since the Necropolis Railway provided the easiest way to transport bodies and mourners from London to the Woking area, transport to and from Woking Crematorium soon began to provide a significant source of revenue for the LNC.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the crow, a carrier of death, in her iconography {{as well as her}} textual description of having crow-like features associate her with death and inauspiciousness. Another motif in her iconography linking her with death is the {{presence of}} a <b>cremation</b> ground and <b>cremation</b> pyres in the background. Her thousand name hymn says that she lives in the <b>cremation</b> ground, sits on a corpse, wears ashes, and blesses those who haunt the grounds. The Prapancasarasara-samgraha relates that she wears a dress taken from a corpse. Dhumavati is the embodiment of tamas guna, associated with ignorance and darkness. She likes meat and wine, both tamasic in nature. The Pranatosinitantra associates her with tamas, when classifying the mahavidyas based on guna.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent to the {{construction}} of the primary mound, 53 <b>cremations</b> wereinserted into the crest of it. None of the cremated remains were enclosedin vessels, but instead occurred in heaps 6-18 inches (15-45 centimetres)in diameter and 1-6 inches (2-15 centimetres) high. Because not all ofthe barrow was excavated, Mortimer considered it possible that there wereequally as many <b>cremations</b> preserved in the untouched part of the mound.The <b>cremations</b> were unaccompanied by artefacts except for three fragmentsof burnt bone pin.|$|R

500|$|The {{earliest}} government crematorium, {{situated at}} Mount Vernon, began operations in 1962 {{with only one}} funeral service hall and about four <b>cremations</b> a week.

5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by <b>cremation.</b> The dead person's son carries the corpse to the <b>cremation</b> ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are {{gathered}} in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. <b>Cremation</b> is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E
