25|$|Like {{many of the}} Carangidae, the African pompano is a {{deep and}} {{laterally}} compressed fish, with the deepest point of the body located between {{the origin of the}} dorsal and anal fins and having the head and tail tapering either side. The dorsal and ventral profiles are equally convex, with a major distinguishing feature of the adult being its more <b>curved</b> <b>head</b> compared to Alectis indicus more angular head profile. The species has four to seven visible spines in the first dorsal fin followed by a single spine and 18 to 20 soft rays in the second dorsal. The anal fin has two spines followed by 15 or 16 soft rays, while the pectoral fin is long and curved. The skin of the fish appears scaleless, but has minute, embedded scales scattered on the body. The lateral line has a strong and moderately long arch dorsally, with its posterior section having 12 to 30 scutes.|$|E
500|$|Emerson {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} other companies on knife-related projects as his own company grew. In some cases these collaborators had become his competition, such as Gerber Knives. In 2002 Emerson collaborated with Gerber Knives to create both companies' first automatic opening knife, the Gerber-Emerson Alliance. In that same year, Emerson collaborated with SureFire Flashlights by making an exclusive CQC-8 (Banana Knife) numbered and marked with the SureFire logo and sold with an identically numbered Emerson-marked Centurion C2 CombatLight. In 2005 Emerson collaborated with Andy Prisco, the CEO of the American Tomahawk Company, to produce the CQC-T Tomahawk. This tomahawk features a <b>curved</b> <b>head</b> machined from 4140 steel with a rear spike and a lightweight fiberglass handle. Although not made by Emerson, the tomahawk was designed by him. In 2007, Emerson announced a collaboration with custom knifemaker and knife thrower Bobby Branton.

50|$|A {{prostate}} massager is {{a device}} for massaging the prostate gland. The {{shape of a}} prostate massager {{is similar to a}} finger, since prostate massages are traditionally given digitally (for example, via fingering). They usually have a slightly <b>curved</b> <b>head</b> to effectively massage the prostate. Lubricant is necessary before inserting anything into the anus, so a lubricant is used. Caution should be exercised when a prostate massager is used because of the sensitivity of the prostate. Correct use involves a medium to light repetitive massage, or circular motion—the device being used to administer the massage should not thrust.|$|E

Gloucester {{was the end of the}} line until 1861, when the Rockport Railroad was built to extend the branch to Rockport station. Due to the new <b>curve</b> <b>heading</b> to Rockport, a new station was built to the west near Washington Street.

5000|$|Another iconic use of sledgehammers is {{for driving}} {{railroad}} spikes into wooden sleepers during rail construction. When the two {{ends of the}} Union Pacific railroad were joined at Promontory, Utah, Leland Stanford hammered a golden spike into a tie with a silver hammer. Sledges used to drive spikes for rails had curved heads that came down to a [...] "beak" [...] that was only about one inch across. The shape meant that drivers needed to be accurate, and spot where the spike hit was often not much larger than a dime. Anything larger would hit the plate or the tie. The <b>curved</b> <b>head</b> kept the handle away from the rail, as the spikes were driven with the rail between the spike and the driver. These are often called spike mauls.|$|E
50|$|Froes {{are similar}} in general form to axes, in that a froe is an L-shaped {{assembly}} of a blade head (typically steel) set at a right angle to a handle called a haft (traditionally wood). A froe {{can be thought of}} as an axe which is sharpened along the top of a long, narrow, rectangular head, instead of (as the axe is) at the end of a broad <b>curved</b> <b>head.</b> Some froes are made of a single piece of metal with no perpendicular haft. Instead, the handle is the unbeveled end of the blade which extends directly from the blade. These froes must be hammered through the entire piece of wood, as their lack of vertical haft makes it extremely difficult to lever the wood apart. A given froe can split a piece of wood no wider in its narrowest dimension than the length of the froe's blade; that is, when you place the froe, it must cross the surface of the wood completely.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring of the {{performance}} and condition of critical slurry handling equipment in the mining industry, over extended periods of time, has been limited by the reliability of instrumentation. Techniques such as real-time pump curve monitoring, commonly applied in other industries such as power generation, have rarely been used in mining.

The technique can be used with any flow measurement instrument; however an essential requirement for long-term monitoring is instrument repeatability and reliability which is difficult to obtain with invasive flow measurement instruments used in severe duty, abrasive slurry flows. For example, in the case of variable-speed centrifugal slurry pumps, standard measurements commonly available in most plants, (e. g. pressure, flow rate, density, pump speed) can be used to obtain a non-dimensional pump <b>curve</b> (Non-Dimensional <b>Head</b> vs. Non-Dimensional Flow) ...|$|R

50|$|Like {{many of the}} Carangidae, the African pompano is a {{deep and}} {{laterally}} compressed fish, with the deepest point of the body located between {{the origin of the}} dorsal and anal fins and having the head and tail tapering either side. The dorsal and ventral profiles are equally convex, with a major distinguishing feature of the adult being its more <b>curved</b> <b>head</b> compared to Alectis indicus more angular head profile. The species has four to seven visible spines in the first dorsal fin followed by a single spine and 18 to 20 soft rays in the second dorsal. The anal fin has two spines followed by 15 or 16 soft rays, while the pectoral fin is long and curved. The skin of the fish appears scaleless, but has minute, embedded scales scattered on the body. The lateral line has a strong and moderately long arch dorsally, with its posterior section having 12 to 30 scutes.The juveniles are distinctive due to their threadfin appearance of having trailing anal and dorsal fin filaments which recede with age. During maturation, the species also becomes more elongate and more like that of other genera of jacks. The body is a silvery-metallic blue to blue-green colour above, being darkest on the head and upper shoulders while the underside is more silvery. The juveniles have five chevron-shaped dark bars on their bodies, with a black blotch {{at the base of the}} third to sixth soft dorsal fin rays. The base of the filaments is a dark blue to black, with all other fins pale to hyaline in appearance.|$|E
40|$|We describe, for {{the first}} time, the {{spermatozoon}} ultrastructure of a dendrobatid frog, Epipedobates flavopictus. Mature spermatozoa of E. flavopictus are filiform, with a moderately <b>curved</b> <b>head</b> and a proportionally short tail. The acrosomal vesicle is a conical structure that covers the nucleus for a considerable distance. A homogeneous subacrosomal cone lies between the acrosome vesicle and the nucleus. The nucleus contains a nuclear space at its anterior end, and electron-lucent spaces and inclusions. No perforatorium is present. In the midpiece, the proximal centriole is housed inside a deep nuclear fossa. Mitochondria are scattered around the posterior end of the nucleus and inside the undulating membrane in the anterior portion of the tail. In transverse section the tail is formed by an U-shaped axial fiber connected to the axoneme through an axial sheath, which supports the undulating membrane. The juxta-axonemal fiber is absent. The spermatozoon of E. flavopictus has several characteristics not observed before in any anurans, such as a curved axial fiber, absence of a juxta-axonemal fiber, and presence of mitochondria in the typical undulating membrane. Our results endorse the view that, in anurans, the conical perforatorium and subacrosomal cone are homologous and that Dendrobatidae should be grouped within Bufonoidea rather than Ranoidea...|$|E
