Bovine corneas were firstly decellularized with Triton X- 100 and NH 4 OH and through short-term freezing process. Then cell count kit- 8 (CCK- 8) and flow cytometry {{were used to}} test the effects of VPA and VC on the proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of rabbit keratocytes. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging showed that cells were eliminated in the decellularized bovine corneas. The proliferation of cultured keratocytes was promoted by VPA and VC in the cell proliferation assay. VPA and VC moderately decreased the number of apoptotic cells and obviously promoted cell-cycle entrance of keratocytes. Rabbit keratocytes in plastic displayed spindle shape and rare interconnected with or without VPA and VC. Cells revealed dendritic morphology and reticular cellular connections when cultured on the carriers of decellularized corneas supplemented with VPA and VC even in the presence of 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS).

In this work, a solid dispersion of gliclazide with polyethylene glycol was prepared by the fusion method.

Analytical techniques of FT-IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry were used to characterize the drug in the physical mixtures and solid dispersions.

40|$|Polyglutamine (polyQ) {{diseases}} are inherited neurodegenerative disorders {{caused by the}} expansion of CAG codon repeats, which code for polyQ in the corresponding gene products. These {{diseases are}} associated with the presence of amyloid-like protein aggregates, induced by polyQ expansion. It has been suggested that the soluble aggregates rather than the mature fibrillar aggregates are the toxic species, and that the aggregation properties of polyQ can be strongly modulated by the surrounding protein context. To assess the importance of the protein <b>carrier</b> in polyQ <b>aggregation,</b> we have studied the misfolding pathway and the kinetics of aggregation of polyQ of lengths above (Q 41) and below (Q 22) the pathological threshold fused to the well-characterized protein carrier glutathione S-transferase (GST). This protein, chosen as a model system, is per se able to misfold and aggregate irreversibly, thus mimicking the behaviour of domains of naturally occurring polyQ proteins. We prove that, while it is generally accepted that the aggregation kinetics of polyQ depend on its length and are faster for longer polyQ tracts, the presence of GST alters the polyQ aggregation pathway and reverses this trend. Aggregation occurs through formation of a reservoir of soluble intermediates whose populations and kinetic stabilities increase with polyQ length. Our results provide a new model that explains the toxicity of expanded polyQ proteins, in which the interplay between polyQ regions and other aggregation-prone domains {{plays a key role in}} determining the aggregation pathway...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSC) {{are known to}} be a {{valuable}} cell source for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, one of the main limiting steps in their clinical use is the amplification step. MSC expansion on microcarriers has emerged during the last few years, fulfilling the lack of classical T-flasks expansion. Even if the therapeutic potential of MSC as aggregates has been recently highlighted, cell aggregation during expansion has to be avoided. Thus, MSC culture on microcarriers has still to be improved, notably concerning cell aggregation prevention. The aim {{of this study was to}} limit cell aggregation during MSC expansion on Cytodex- 1 (R), by evaluating the impact of several culture parameters. First, MSC cultures were performed at different agitation rates (0, 25, and 75 rpm) and different initial cell densities (25 and 50 x 10 (6) cell g(- 1) Cytodex- 1 (R)). Then, the MSC aggregates were put into contact with additional available surfaces (T-flask, fresh and used Cytodex- 1 (R)) at different times (before and after cell aggregation). The results showed that cell aggregation was partly induced by agitation and prevented in static cultures. Moreover, cell aggregation was dependent on cell density and correlated with a decrease in the total cell number. It was however shown that the aggregated organization could be dissociated when in contact with additional surfaces such as T-flasks or fresh Cytodex- 1 (R) <b>carriers.</b> Finally, cell <b>aggregation</b> could be successfully limited in spinner flask by adding fresh Cytodex- 1 (R) carriers before its onset. Those results indicated that MSC expansion on agitated Cytodex- 1 (R) microcarriers could be performed without cell aggregation, avoiding a decrease in total cell number...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{conductive}} adhesives (ECAs) containing silver filler and polyaniline co-filler {{were characterized}} for their electro-mechanical properties. Polyaniline is a conductive polymer {{and has a}} moderate conductivity in between those of the silver and epoxy. Incorporation of polyaniline (μm sized) in silver-epoxy facilitated the electrical conduction in ECAs and reduced the percolation threshold- a minimum volume of filler necessary to initiate the conduction. It also prevented the localization of charge <b>carriers</b> due to <b>aggregation</b> of silver filler particles. ‘Bridging effect’ was observed due to addition polyaniline in which the polyaniline enhanced the tunneling of electrons over the silver filler particles. We have investigated the polyaniline co-fillers as a promising alternative way to tune the mechanical and electrical properties of the ECAs and have provided {{a detailed analysis of}} the electro-mechanical properties of silver-epoxy (Ag-epoxy) and silver-polyaniline-epoxy (Ag-PANI-epoxy) system in both partially-cured/ viscoelastic and fully-cured states. Analysis of electro-mechanical properties of silver-epoxy and silver-polyaniline-epoxy also provided the insights into electrical contact resistance of ECAs under compressive force. Electro-mechanical properties of ECAs were measured ‘in-situ’ using micro-indentation technique. We also synthesized the electrically conductive and highly crystalline nanotubes of polyaniline by mini-emulsion polymerization of aniline. The motivation behind the synthesis of polyaniline was to propose a potential filler/co-filler for replacement of metallic filler in ECAs. Electrical conductivity of polyaniline nanotubes was tuned by in-situ doping using hydrochloric acid as a dopant. Increase in dopant caused the polyaniline crystallite to grow along (400) plane. Optical, structural, electrical and thermal properties of polyaniline nanotubes are reported with varying amount of dopant.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the best carrier technology for our β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation inhibitors by developing {{three types of}} liposomes (a) plain liposomes, (b) MAL-PEG liposomes, and finally the combination of retro-inverted peptide RI-OR 2 - TAT (Ac-rGffvlkGrrrrqrrkkrGyc-NH 2) attached {{onto the surface of}} MAL-PEG liposomes, creating Peptide Inhibitor Nanoparticles (PINPs) of three different sizes (50, 100 and 200 nm). In addition, these nanoliposomes (NLPs) (with particular focus on PINPs) were examined for their ability to affect Aβ aggregation, and to protect against Aβ cytotoxicity. Methods: The creation of NLPs was carried out by the use of a mini extruder, while the elution of PINPs from a size exclusion column was assessed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). The quantification of peptide bound to liposomes was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, while phospholipid content was quantified by Wako phospholipid assay. The effects of the different types of liposomes on Aβ toxicity and viability of SHSY- 5 Y neuronal cells were examined by MTS assay, whereas effects on Aβ aggregation were determined by Thioflavin-T (Th-T) assay. In addition, a cell penetration assay was carried out in order to examine the ability of liposomes to penetrate into neuroblastoma SHSY- 5 Y cells. Results: Low concentrations of PINPs 0. 1 μM inhibited Aβ aggregation and toxicity in vitro. MAL-PEG liposomes and PINPs were able to penetrate into neuroblastoma SHSY- 5 Y cells and were also more stable than simple liposomes. Stability means the ability of liposomes to keep their size and their shape stable for long time. In addition, the three types of liposomes were not toxic towards SHSY- 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. Cytotoxicity is the quality of being toxic to cells. So, none of the three types of our liposomes showed any negative effect on the viability towards SHSY- 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. Conclusion: NLPs are an ideal <b>carrier</b> for our <b>aggregation</b> inhibitors because they affect Aβ aggregation and toxicity at low doses, and according to other data generated by our group, can cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) ...|$|R
