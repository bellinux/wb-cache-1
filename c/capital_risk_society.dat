Human <b>capital</b> <b>risk</b> occurs when the organization operates below attainable operational excellence levels. [...] For example, if a firm could reasonably reduce errors and rework (the Process component of human capital) from 10,000 hours per annum to 2,000 hours with attainable technology, the difference of 8,000 hours is human <b>capital</b> <b>risk.</b> [...] When wage costs are applied to this difference (the 8,000 hours) it becomes possible to financially value human <b>capital</b> <b>risk</b> within an organizational perspective.|$|R

Encapsulating by the agency theory specifically, it can be inferred that corporate governance mechanisms have the potential to align the different interests between managers and owners.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} review and {{exploration}} of {{the parameters of the}} <b>risk</b> <b>society.</b> The primary focus is on the theoretical works of German sociologist Ulrich Beck and British sociologist Anthony Giddens, and in particular, their claim that we are living in a second, reflexive age of modernity, or <b>risk</b> <b>society,</b> characterized by an omnipresence of low probability—high consequence technological risks. The article concludes that the theorists of the <b>risk</b> <b>society</b> succeed in their goal of raising important questions for reflection and for future research. The <b>risk</b> <b>society</b> thesis succeeds in describing the emergence of a risk ethos, the development of a collective risk identity and the formation of communities united by an increasing vulnerability to risk. It draws attention to how the essentialist nature of risk has been transformed and how the origins and impact of risk have been reassessed. The theory points to a reconfiguration in the way risk is identified, evaluated, communicated and governed. The <b>risk</b> <b>society</b> expands the traditional concept of risk understood as the sum of the probability of an adverse event and the magnitude of the consequences, to include the subjective perception of risk, the inter-subjective communication of risk and the social experience of living in a risk environment. Finally, the theorists of the <b>risk</b> <b>society</b> succeed in iterating that it is not just health and the environment that are at risk, but in addition, the fundamental sociopolitical values of liberty, equality, justice, rights and democracy are now at risk. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT It {{is argued}} that {{in the wake of}} the {{increasing}} number and extent of industrially produced <b>risks,</b> modern <b>societies</b> are transforming into <b>risk</b> <b>societies</b> (Beck, 1992). The implication of <b>risk</b> for modern <b>society</b> is understood to render traditional institutions and instruments incapable of managing what essentially are the consequences of modernization. The acid mine drainage (AMD) currently decanting from an abandoned underground mine shaft on the West Rand of Gauteng is in many ways the epitome of the type of risks that define a <b>risk</b> <b>society.</b> Having engendered intense political debate due to the threat it poses to the environment and society and the uncertainty over how to manage it, the circumstance on the West Rand might be argued as representing a classic example of a <b>risk</b> <b>society.</b> Using an inductive research design, this study aims to examine the truth behind this statement and furthermore, to what degree a unique form of <b>risk</b> <b>society</b> might be emerging. Specifically, the concepts of organized irresponsibly and subpolitics are explored, as is the role of science. The findings suggest that on the one hand risk does have the predicted impact on institutional arrangements. However, due to certain unique factors within the South African context (e. g. weak state capacity and social inequality) it is evident that there is also potential for society to move deeper into a state of <b>risk</b> <b>society.</b> This is in contrast to the idea posited in Beck’s theory that many societies facing the circumstances of <b>risk</b> <b>society</b> will, over time and necessarily, adequately respond to the risks by becoming reflexive. Indeed, if this is to be the case however, the strengthening of current civil society engagement at the political level and a greater institutional willingness for change are seen as the essential ingredients for a more reflexive approach to the risk of AMD...|$|R

We observe the way multiple stakeholder decision-making plays out a number of <b>Risk</b> <b>Society</b> themes, including the emergence of ‘unbounded risk’ and of highly ‘individualised’ and ‘reflexive’ risk communities. Across several decades, the events of the HCB story support <b>Risk</b> <b>Society</b> predictions of legitimacy problems faced by corporations as they harness technoscientific support for innovation in their products and industrial processes without due recognition of social and environmental risk. Tensions involving identity, trust and access to expert knowledge advance our understanding of democratic ‘sub-political’ decision-making and ways of distributing environmental risk. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the simultaneous relationship between bank <b>capital</b> and <b>risk.</b> A model {{is set up}} which assumes that banks’ decisions regarding <b>capital</b> and <b>risk</b> are made endogenously in a dynamic pattern. A simultaneous equation system was estimated using an unbalanced panel of SEE banks from 2001 to 2009. A key result for the whole sample of banks {{is the relationship between}} regulatory (equity) <b>capital</b> and <b>risk</b> which is positive (negative). However, a positive two-way relationship between regulatory <b>capital</b> and <b>risk</b> was found only in less than-adequately capitalized banks, which also increased substantially their risk in 2009. Thus, banks’ decisions differentiate between equity <b>capital</b> and <b>risk</b> and regulatory <b>capital</b> and <b>risk.</b> A positive, significant and robust effect of liquidity on capital was identified. Both regulatory and equity capital exhibit procyclical behavior, whilst the relationship between risk and rate of growth of GDP is ambitious.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the stream of uncertain income from human capital has systematic effects on the demand for risky physical capital assets. If labor supply is inelastic and real wages are known with certainty, then a labor income tax will reduce holdings of the risky physical asset. However, if labor income fluctuates randomly, a labor income tax may actually raise demand for the asset if human <b>capital</b> <b>risk</b> and physical <b>capital</b> <b>risk</b> are positively correlated. The idiosyncratic risk and nontradability of human capital also have implications for optimal taxation. ...|$|R
