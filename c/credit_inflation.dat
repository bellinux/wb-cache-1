The amount of dollars out there that are greenbacks - actual cash - is [...] compared to the dollar value of credit instruments. So in my view the Fed is utterly powerless to prevent the ultimate deflation of the credit bubble. And some people say, “Well, they can print money.” Fine, that would just make the credit bubble collapse faster as soon as bond holders realize that’s what they were doing. There’s no way out of it. So that’s the argument....BOB: Well, the hyperinflation part is a pure guess based on politics. It has nothing to do with reading markets. I think the markets are telegraphing deflation, and I’m very confident about that. Hyperinflation to me is going to be the natural political response. I mean these people in Congress are so irresponsible - except to themselves and their families, of course. They always get reelected so they’re doing that correctly. I mean, it’s working for them as individuals but it’s not working for the country. Anyway, to save their own skins I think the most likely thing is that they will turn to the Treasury, whether they keep the Federal Reserve System or not, and say, “Let’s print, let’s get the machines going and print those greenbacks and spread them around.” ...|$|E

We show {{the link between the}} credit rationing, productivity and monetary policy, and study the distributional effects of monetary policy on the credit constraints, money holdings, and the ability to trade across agents. An agent’s productivity reflects his ability to replenish the money holdings and the ability to repay loans. We find that agents with low productivity consume less, produce more, and have less gains from trade in the good market. The cost of being excluded from the banking system is small for agents with low productivity, so banks offer less credit to agents with low productivity when credit rationing occurs. The monetary policy does not affect the effectiveness of credit arrangement in an equilibrium with unconstrained credit. In an equilibrium with constrained <b>credit,</b> <b>inflation</b> has different effects across heterogeneous agents.

40|$|Processed {{foods and}} {{beverages}} are {{often referred to}} as “value-added ” products. They are valued-added products because raw products like wheat and yeast, for example, are transformed into higher value products like bread and pastry products. Processing activities may be more minor {{as in the case of}} canned fruits and vegetables or quite extensive, as in combining nuts, sugar, cocoa, milk, and other ingredients to make candy bars. Live beef sales are a raw commodity, even though they are a “high-value” good since grains are fed to fatten beef. As beef moves further through the marketing channel and is sold as carcass beef, boxed beef, or shrink wrap in the grocery store, it becomes a processed food product. The majority of processed food sales are made from large and well-known brand companies (e. g., Kelloggs, Pillsbury, Frito Lay, and PepsiCo). Regional Importance of Sector A new era of food processing began for Sonora in the 1960 s with modernization of their food processing industry. Between 1955 and 1985, the total gross value of food processing production grew at a remarkable rate of 5. 8 percent annually. Growth was not entirely smooth though. Problems related to lack of <b>credit,</b> <b>inflation,</b> scarcity of raw materials, and lower productivity reduced growth in the mid- 1970 s and later. Sonora’s food processing industry comprised 7. 3 percent of their GSP in 1993 and employed 8. 3 percent of their labor force (INEGI). The food processing industry of Sonora includes meat processing, dairy products, cereal processing, bakery products, tortilla processing, cooking oils, cocoa and chocolate processing, animal food, and beverages. According to the number of establishments, jobs, and value-added activities from 1985 to 1993, sectors of Sonora’s food processing industry can be classed as either declining, stagnating, or growing. Industries that have followed a decreasing trend include baking and tortilla products (though growth was spurred some in 1993). Beef, dairy, cocoa, and chocolate products have been rather stagnant over this period. Beverage products, animal feed, cooking oil, and cereals have demonstrated more of an increasin...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamics of inflation and their effect on production, using the example of the Polish reconstruction process after World War I. In 1918, Poland had to be re-established as a state after 123 years of foreign rule as well as reconstructed due to severe destruction experienced during the war. Nevertheless, the reconstruction process was extremely rapid, and the thesis argues that it was inflation which provided the means to build up the state. Inflation redistributed wealth within the society and imposed a high savings quota on the economy. The printing press inflation carried the economy through to hyperinflation. The positive effects of the process already explain in part why inflation could last so long and why the economy went all the way through to hyperinflation. The thesis then argues that stabilisation was a political problem and was only achieved once the inflationary process ceased to create winners and losers. The positive business climate began to deteriorate when traders no longer used past inflation as an indicator for price setting, but instead used changes in the exchange rate. However, inflation reappeared shortly after fiscal reform, due to the inevitable credit requirements of Polish industry. Inflation had eroded savings and distorted the economy: this was the major short-coming of this peculiar way of mobilising the country's resources. Consequently, a <b>credit</b> <b>inflation</b> emerged still in 1924 as industry tried to adjust to market requirements in the post-inflationary crisis. Stabilisation was only finally achieved when the economy moved out of recession in 1926. Lastly, the thesis sheds new light on the generalisation about the European inflationary experiences of the 1920 s. It introduces a distinction between exogenously and endogenously imposed inflation, which suggests a more specific definition of the transition into hyperinflation {{as well as of the}} exact requirements for stabilisation. It also reduces these exceptional economic occurrences to reparations, on the one hand, and reconstruction, on the other...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the break}} {{up of the}} Czech-Slovak Federation on 31 December 1992, the Czech Republic {{has been at the}} {{forefront}} of the transition to a market economy. Key aims of the Czech Republic, and many other former centrally planned economies, are low inflation and a stable exchange rate, particularly for those who ultimately wish to enter the European Union (EU). The aggregate consumption function has been a key component of macro-models since Keynes and is especially important for growth in a transitional economy. Key economic variables will be used to explain the consumption function, e. g. real houshold income, interest rates on <b>credit,</b> <b>inflation</b> and real wealth. We expect a positive relationship between real consumption and the level of real income and wealth, with a negative relationship between the consumption and the rate of interest and inflation. The estimation approach we use is an error correction model. Given the nature of the Czech financial markets and institutions it is likely that consumption will not immediately reach the long-run equilibrium. Therefore the long-run relationship and short-run interactions which is the basis of the error correction model approach would appear to be the appropriate choice for an emerging economy. The data used in the study is monthly and runs from January 1993 to April 1995. All the required data are taken from the CNB, Financial Statistics Report. Given that the Czech Republic has been hit by a number of different shocks over the relatively short transition period, we will estimate the empirically based consumption functions starting from 1993. Due to the paucity of data we initially include only standard variables associated with the consumption function; real disposable income, interest rates and inflation. We do however test a number of variants, including using an alternative measure of income, namely real wage income. We also include the unemployment rate which would proxy liquidity constraints. Also if there is an increase in the probability of unemployment current liquidity, future liquidity or uncertainty - or all three - may lead to a reduction in current consumption. Although we are faced with a limited data set we do however find a number of interesting results. Of particular note for a transition economy, such as the Czech Republic, is the long-run relationship between real consumption and wage income, interest rates, inflation and the rate of unemployment. We take the change in unemployment to reflect changes in liquidity constraints and the level of unemployment to reflect precautionary saving. The results imply that these effects are present and statistically significant both in the short and long-run. Our results also indicate that the long-run income elasticity is affected by the inclusion of the unemployment term. ...|$|E

40|$|Indexation of <b>credit</b> to <b>inflation</b> (ex-post) is {{a unique}} legal {{practice}} in Iceland based on valorism theory on money vs. nominalism. Two rulings issued in 2014 by the EFTA Court try to clarify the legality and fairness of this particular price-variation clause under the European Economic Area consumer credit acquis. The study summarizes the rulings and analyses critically the interpretation provided by the court. It argues that the judgements defy the logic of non-contradiction since indexation of credit proves to be an impossible oxymoron under EU/EEA law. The results are confusing. On one hand, cost of credit and usury practices tend to fall {{outside the scope of}} European harmonisation (provided disclosure obligation of cost of credit and transparency ex-ante are respected). A fairness control is thus dependent on national and case circumstances to be assessed by domestic courts. On the other hand, European rules also impose with no derogations that the cost of indexation of <b>credit</b> to <b>inflation</b> is disclosed in a transparent way and calculated ex-ante. The paradox is there. Since indexation of credit operates ex-post on the basis of real inflation, it is impossible to disclose ex-ante in a transparent way. The findings of the study help to understand the situation of impasse in Iceland. Without a clear interpretation from the EFTA Court, the saga has continued at national level and will probably head for a second round of assessment at European level. ...|$|R
