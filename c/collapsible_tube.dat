60|$|The Slab is a {{piece of}} thick plate glass, of the same length and width as the handle to the roller, so they pack up easily together; its edges are ground to save the fingers and roller alike from being cut. (Porcelain takes the ink better than glass, but is not to be {{commonly}} found in the shops, of a convenient shape and size; a glazed tile makes a capital slab.) A <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube</b> of printer's ink, a few rags, and a phial of washing soda, complete the equipment (benzole may spoil india-rubber). When using the apparatus, spread a newspaper on the table to prevent accident, have other pieces of newspaper ready to clean the roller, and to remove any surplus of ink from it by the simple process of rolling it on the paper. Take care that the washing soda is in such a position that it cannot be upset and ruin the polish of the table. With these precautions, the apparatus may be used with cleanliness even in a drawing-room. The roller is of course laid on its back when not in use.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} linear {{stability}} of elastic <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> conveying fluid, when the equilibrium {{configuration of the}} tube is helical. A particular case of such tubes, commonly encountered in applications, is represented by quarter- or semi-circular tubular joints used at pipe's turning points. The stability theory for pipes with non-straight equilibrium configurations, especially for <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes,</b> allowing dynamical change of the cross-section, has been elusive as {{it is difficult to}} accurately develop the dynamic description via traditional methods. We develop a methodology for studying the three-dimensional dynamics of <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> based on the geometric variational approach. We show that the linear stability theory based on this approach allows for a complete treatment for arbitrary three-dimensional helical configurations of <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> by reduction to an equation with constant coefficients. We discuss new results on stability loss of straight tubes caused by the cross-sectional area change. Finally, we develop a numerical algorithm for computation of the linear stability using our theory and present the results of numerical studies for both straight and helical tubes.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{combined}} theoretical and computational analysis of three-dimensional unsteady finite-Reynolds-number flows in <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> whose walls perform prescribed high-frequency oscillations which resemble those typically observed in experiments with a Starling resistor. Following {{an analysis of}} the flow fields, we investigate the system’s overall energy budget and establish the critical Reynolds number, Recrit, at which the wall begins to extract energy from the flow. We conjecture that Recrit corresponds to the Reynolds number beyond which <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> are capable of performing sustained self-excited oscillations. Our computations suggest a simple functional relationship between Recrit and the system parameters, and we present a scaling argument to explain this observation. Finally, we demonstrate that, {{within the framework of the}} instability mechanism analysed here, self-excited oscillations of <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> are much more likely to develop from steady-state configurations in which the tube is buckled non-axisymmetrically, rather than from axisymmetric steady states, which is in agreement with experimental observations...|$|R

This control function of the veins is a passive one, and is as a result of their ability to collapse and inflate. Several experimental studies have been done on flexible tubing.

40|$|Viscous flow in elastic (<b>collapsible)</b> <b>tubes</b> is a large-displacement fluid-structure {{interaction}} problem frequently {{encountered in}} biomechanics. This paper presents a robust and rapidly converging procedure for {{the solution of}} the steady three-dimensional Stokes equations, coupled to the geometrically non-linear shell equations which describe the large deformations of the tube wall. The fluid and solid equations are coupled in a segregated method whose slow convergence is accelerated by an extrapolation procedure based on the scheme's asymptotic convergence behaviour. A displacement control technique is developed to handle the system's snap-through behaviour. Finally, results for the tube's post-buckling deformation and for the flow in the strongly collapsed tube are shown.

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{computer model}} has been developed to simulate fluid flow through a <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube.</b> The model {{is based on the}} immersed boundary method, which is designed to handle a flexible elastic boundary immersed in fluid. This internal boundary is both affected by and has an effect on the motion of the fluid. The setup for <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube</b> simulation involves a fiber-wound elastic tube subjected to an upstream pressure, a downstream pressure, and an external pressure. Partial collapse is observed when the external pressure exceeds the downstream pressure but is less than the upstream pressure. The geometry of the transiently collapsing tube is observed. Collapse is generally localized near the downstream end of the tube, however, under certain conditions, it is also possible for collapse to occur at multiple discrete locations separated by regions of open tubing...|$|E
