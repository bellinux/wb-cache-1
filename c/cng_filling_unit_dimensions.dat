The use of CNG in Bangladesh is increasing day by day due to the environmental benefits as well as economic benefits. The air quality has improved for the major cities and the air pollution has reduced in Dhaka city the capital of Bangladesh due to the use of CNG. In 1999 - 2000 the government of Bangladesh has decided to use CNG as a vehicular fuel and was controlled by the state and limited to a few number of cars with inadequate facilities but the CNG activities in Bangladesh has increased and it is very popular to the people. Now 582 <b>CNG</b> <b>filling</b> stations, 167 <b>CNG</b> conversions workshops are established and 193, 702 vehicles are using CNG as a vehicular fuel and lots of manpower are involved in this sector.

CSE blocks are manufactured with different <b>unit</b> <b>dimensions.</b> This research is focused on determination of effect of <b>unit</b> <b>dimensions</b> of CSE blocks on masonry construction. <b>Unit</b> <b>dimensions</b> basically affect on the compressive strength and cost of construction of masonry. Ratio of height to least horizontal dimension (H/W) is a governing factor of compressive strength.

Four different sizes of blocks with H/W ratio of less than 0. 6 were used for the test. Relationships between Characteristic compressive strength of masonry, unit strength, and H/W ratio and load deformation characteristics were developed. Studies were done to determine the cost of construction of each panel. Results show that strengths of all panels are adequate for load bearing construction. Wall strengths increases with the H/W ratio. Panels provide a sufficient warning before ultimate failure.
