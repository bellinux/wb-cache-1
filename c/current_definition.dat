5|$|The {{definition}} of the kilogram is undergoing a fundamental change—the <b>current</b> <b>definition</b> defines the kilogram as being {{the mass of the}} international prototype kilogram which is an artefact, not a constant of nature while the new definition relates it to the equivalent energy of a photon via the Planck constant.|$|E

5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their <b>current</b> <b>definition</b> of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. The committee was of the view that the Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water, as it overcame these difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the <b>current</b> <b>definition.</b> Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the <b>current</b> <b>definition</b> of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2003, Crocodilia/Crocodylia was a {{group that}} {{encompassed}} the modern-day animals (the crown group) {{as well as their}} more distant relatives now in the larger groups called Crocodylomorpha and Pseudosuchia. Under its <b>current</b> <b>definition</b> Crocodylia is restricted to only the most recent ancestor of today's modern-day crocodilians (alligators, crocodiles, and gharials). This distinction is more important for paleontologists studying crocodilian evolution. As such, the alternate spellings Crocodilia and Crocodylia are still used interchangeably in the neontological literature.|$|E
5|$|Research {{from the}} late 1990s {{indicated}} there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the <b>current</b> <b>definition</b> of RAD.

25|$|The metre was {{originally}} defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth {{of the distance}} from the equator to the North Pole. In 1799, it was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. In 1983, the <b>current</b> <b>definition</b> was adopted.|$|E

It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test.
