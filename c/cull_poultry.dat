40|$|Abstract Background Several highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (AI) outbreaks {{have been reported}} over the past decade. South Korea recently faced AI outbreaks whose economic impact {{was estimated to be}} 6. 3 billion dollars, equivalent to nearly 50 % of the profit generated by the poultry-related industries in 2008. In addition, AI is threatening to cause a human pandemic of potentially devastating proportions. Several studies show that a stochastic simulation model can be used to plan an efficient containment strategy on an emerging influenza. Efficient control of AI outbreaks based on such simulation studies could be an important strategy in minimizing its adverse economic and public health impacts. Methods We constructed a spatio-temporal multi-agent model of chickens and ducks in poultry farms in South Korea. The spatial domain, comprised of 76 (37. 5 km Ã— 37. 5 km) unit squares, approximated the size and scale of South Korea. In this spatial domain, we introduced 3, 039 poultry flocks (corresponding to 2, 231 flocks of chickens and 808 flocks of ducks) whose spatial distribution was proportional to the number of birds in each province. The model parameterizes the properties and dynamic behaviors of birds in poultry farms and quarantine plans and included infection probability, incubation period, interactions among birds, and quarantine region. Results We conducted sensitivity analysis for the different parameters in the model. Our study shows that the quarantine plan with well-chosen values of parameters is critical for minimize loss of poultry flocks in an AI outbreak. Specifically, the aggressive culling plan of infected poultry farms over 18. 75 km radius range is unlikely to be effective, resulting in higher fractions of unnecessarily <b>culled</b> <b>poultry</b> flocks and the weak culling plan is also unlikely to be effective, resulting in higher fractions of infected poultry flocks. Conclusions Our results show that a prepared response with targeted quarantine protocols would have a high probability of containing the disease. The containment plan with an aggressive culling plan is not necessarily efficient, causing a higher fraction of unnecessarily <b>culled</b> <b>poultry</b> farms. Instead, it is necessary to balance culling with other important factors involved in AI spreading. Better estimations for the containment of AI spreading with this model offer the potential to reduce the loss of poultry and minimize economic impact on the poultry industry. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Since February 2013, {{more than}} 400 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian {{influenza}} A H 7 N 9 infection {{have been reported}} in mainland China. Little is known of the dynamics of this novel virus in poultry and human populations, which is essential for developing effective long-term control strategies for this zoonosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of screening and <b>culling</b> of infected <b>poultry</b> on the evolution of the H 7 N 9 epidemic. Methods: A mathematical model for transmission dynamics of avian influenza A H 7 N 9 virus in human and poultry populations was constructed. Parameters in the model were estimated using publicly available nationwide surveillance data on animal and human infections. Results: By fitting a two-host model, it was shown that screening for H 7 N 9 in <b>poultry</b> and <b>culling</b> could effectively decrease the number of new human H 7 N 9 cases. Furthermore, the elimination of circulating H 7 N 9 virus is possible if an intensive, but technically feasible, <b>poultry</b> screening and <b>culling</b> policy is adopted. Conclusions: Screening and <b>culling</b> infected <b>poultry</b> is a critical measure for preventing human H 7 N 9 infections in the long term. This model may provide important insights for decision-making on a national intervention strategy for the long-term control of the H 7 N 9 virus epidemic...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHighly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) is often controlled through <b>culling</b> of <b>poultry.</b> Compensating farmers for culled chickens or ducks facilitates effective culling {{and control of}} HPAI. However, ensuing price shifts can create incentives that alter the disease dynamics of HPAI. Farmers control {{certain aspects of the}} dynamics by setting a farm size, implementing infection control measures, and determining the age at which poultry are sent to market. Their decisions can be influenced by the market price of poultry which can, in turn, be set by policy makers during an HPAI outbreak. Here, we integrate these economic considerations into an epidemiological model in which epidemiological parameters are determined by an outside agent (the farmer) to maximize profit from poultry sales. Our model exhibits a diversity of behaviors which are sensitive to (i) the ability to identify infected poultry, (ii) the average price of infected poultry, (iii) the basic reproductive number of avian influenza, (iv) the effect of culling on the market price of poultry, (v) the effect of market price on farm size, and (vi) the effect of poultry density on disease transmission. We find that under certain market and epidemiological conditions, culling can increase farm size and the total number of HPAI infections. Our model helps to inform the optimization of public health outcomes that best weigh the balance between public health risk and beneficial economic outcomes for farmers...|$|R

Augmented by a survey sent to individuals deeply involved in HPAI work in Cambodia, this study uses a qualitative research methodology consisting of mostly one-on-one semi-structured interviews across government, the private sector, and the non-governmental sector. Measures {{have been taken to}} cope with AI such as public awareness campaign â€˜Super Moanâ€™ and Pandemic Preparedness, border control over the movement of poultry with neighbouring countries, Vietnam and Thailand, <b>culling</b> of <b>poultry,</b> and case-based secret compensation. The study provides background to Cambodian political and modern history and sets the context of aid dependence and tourism, the livestock sector and poultry in particular. It then proceeds in three parts, from beginning, middle, to end on how HPAI evolved, providing a narrative timeline of the key policy moments/phases between the first outbreak and to date (December 2008). Three narratives are explored: (1) culling without compensation; (2) the shift to health; and (3) the role of poverty and livelihoods. The study then discusses three key themes that define the political economy of the policy process. These are: (a) Donors and NGOs; (b) Beyond Aid: Other Sources of Revenue and the Importance of Tourism; and (c) Media Spin.

5000|$|The global case {{fatality}} ratio looks only to {{the official}} tally of cases confirmed by the WHO. It takes no account of other cases, such as those appearing in press reports. Nor does it reflect any estimate of the global extent of mild, asymptomatic, or other cases which are undiagnosed, unreported by national governments to the WHO, or for any reason cannot be confirmed by the WHO. While the WHO's case count is clearly the most authoritative, these unavoidable limitations result in {{an unknown number of}} cases being omitted from it. The problem of overlooked but genuine cases is emphasized by occasional reports in which later serology reveals antibodies to the H5N1 infection in the blood of persons who were never known to have bird flu, and who then are confirmed by the WHO only retroactively as [...] "cases."

Now, {{two months after}} the first known human infections with the H 7 N 9 virus, the question is: which of the paths set by previous emerging influenza viruses will it follow? One predecessor, H 5 N 1, generated alarm owing to its high pathogenicity in humans. It {{has proved to be a}} tenacious adversary, remaining endemic in poultry across large parts of Asia, but thankfully it has not adapted to humans and person-to-person transmission remains rare. A second, H 7 N 7, caused a number of mostly mild human infections in the Netherlands in 2003, with some evidence of limited person-to-person spread, but extensive <b>poultry</b> <b>culling</b> controlled it. A third, the H 1 N 1 swine influenza virus that emerged in 2009, successfully adapted to humans and caused a pandemic. So will H 7 N 9 prove to be controllable? Will it remain entrenched in animals? Or will it, like the H 1 N 1 virus, stably adapt to humans and cause a pandemic? The fine line between foresight and alarmism can only be drawn in retrospect.

The contribution of different animal reservoirs to surface water contamination with Campylobacter is largely unknown. In the Netherlands, the massive <b>poultry</b> <b>culling</b> to control the 2003 avian influenza epidemic coincided with a 44 - 50 % reduction in human campylobacteriosis cases in the culling areas, suggesting substantial environment-mediated spread of poultry-borne Campylobacter. We inferred the origin of surface water Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains in Luxembourg and the Netherlands, as defined by multilocus sequence typing, by comparison to strains from poultry, pigs, ruminants, and wild birds, using the asymmetric island model for source attribution. Most Luxembourgish water strains were attributed to wild birds (61. 0 %), followed by poultry (18. 8 %), ruminants (15. 9 %), and pigs (4. 3 %); whereas the Dutch water strains were mainly attributed to poultry (51. 7 %), wild birds (37. 3 %), ruminants (9. 8 %), and pigs (1. 2 %). Attributions varied over seasons and surface water types, and geographical variation in the relative contribution of poultry correlated with the magnitude of poultry production at either the national or provincial level, suggesting that environmental dissemination of Campylobacter from poultry farms and slaughterhouses can be substantial in poultry-rich regions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Avian {{influenza}} (AI) {{has prompted}} widespread <b>poultry</b> <b>culls</b> and retail changes. Traditional live poultry sales can increase risk for AI virus transmission. Attitudes and risk perceptions regarding these sales influence policy. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to report Hong Kong risk perceptions and attitudes regarding live poultry sales and central slaughtering illustrating population reactions to inform policy. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 25 healthy Hong Kong adults completed grounded theory qualitative interviews regarding perceptions of live chicken sales and acceptability of central slaughtering. Taped interviews were transcribed and translated in to English and coded in parallel by the authors working independently, using grounded theory approaches. Findings - The paper finds that hygiene efforts reflected confusion between bacterial contamination and influenza. Hand-transmission was not recognized as a transmission pathway. Opposition to central slaughtering was based on concerns about loss of freshness, flavor, traditions and employment, and meat safety. However, opponents supported policy if it reduced infectious disease risk. Supporters emphasized improved food hygiene. There was considerable scope for further educational efforts. Opposition focused on losses rather than gains, consistent with theory. Supporters emphasized health benefits. AI transmission routes were confused, indicating need for clearer information about personal protective practices. Research limitations/ implications - The paper is a qualitative report and awaits confirmation using a quantitative exploration. The data identified a number of barriers to acceptance of a central slaughtering policy, many of which were based on incorrect or limited understanding. Education can help remedy this. Originality/value - The paper describes perceptions among Chinese people towards a public health initiative, revealing many objections are based on misunderstandings.

40|$|The {{epidemic}} of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) of the H 5 N 1 strain is causing major economic problems to affected countries, mostly in South-East Asia. The poultry industry {{is the most}} devastated, with major losses. This paper assesses the impact and cost of an {{epidemic of}} this nature on affected economies. The paper evaluates the economic impact from the poultry industry to the governments and even further to the international level, as the epidemic has no consideration of borders. With {{the world at the}} crossroads of a global pandemic, the economic impact will also be considerable at the international level. With the use of forecasting models the affects of the epidemic will be evaluated. The impact to affected countries economies are not just national based, for those with the endemic H 5 N 1 strain are socially burdened with sustaining or even intensifying resource-intensive activities and as a consequence are left with shouldering economic losses in order to safeguard international public health. This at a major level will require the cooperation of the international field, with increased global integration the financial responsibility will be left to the international countries, to make sure all is coherent. The paper in particular assesses the economic impact of the poultry industry for the affected countries. Within these countries the poultry industry is seen as a major sector and the consequence of this pandemic has been the death of poultry from the disease itself and the <b>culling</b> of <b>poultry</b> to stem its spread. Both these factor are leading to significant costs to the poultry industry and to the Governments of the affected countries in containing the epidemic. The increase in costs can be seen in terms of equipment, materials, transport and personnel, that are required to keep a control on the spread. The impact will be qualified by the assessment of GDP and modelling the losses of trade and Government expenditure in controlling the spread of the disease and subsidiaries that the government would have provided to farmers of diseased Livestock for compensation. The results of the impact will {{have a major impact on}} the development of the affected regions. The loss of a major source of income from the trade of poultry will have serious consequences on the balance of payments and Government Debt. The cooperation of the affected countries through information will help and lower the overall impact to each country. However the total impact will depend on the transfer of information between affected economies, and the period of time the epidemic will last and if H 5 N 1 begins to transfer to humans.

40|$|Diseases {{passed from}} animals to humans cause untold {{damage to the}} lives and {{livelihoods}} {{of people living in}} ACP countries. Livestock producers need more help installing better animal husbandry, veterinary and public health practices, to contain the threat and make the most of their animal resources. Humans and animals have been living side by side since livestock domestication began nearly 10, 000 years ago. But while this symbiosis undoubtedly brings benefits, close contacts between Man and livestock can also cause problems. While animals are a major source of protein, by-products and income for many households, they are also a source of disease, especially when Man and beast live in close proximity, and hygiene and veterinary procedures are inadequate. Most of the world s emerging diseases are of animal origin, and nearly all are zoonoses, the term given, in the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO), to those diseases which are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man. The highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 strain of avian influenza, currently sweeping through Asia, Africa and Europe, is perhaps the most dramatic illustration of the potential damage caused by zoonotic diseases. But in many ACP regions, other animal diseases have long taken a heavy toll on humans. To date, scientists have identified more than 200 zoonoses, the effects of which vary widely, from death or disability in humans to lower production rates in animals. The latter scenario, while clearly less tragic, is nevertheless a serious constraint to food security in many ACP countries. A number of zoonotic diseases are characterised by lower outputs of animal products, manure and traction power. Some zoonoses, such as avian influenza and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease, see Spore 94), have an impact on food safety. A secondary but important repercussion is the fear factor on consumers, together with trade barriers, as embargoes are put into force. A deadly virus As avian influenza continued what some say is its inexorable march through the world, health officials warned that local livestock-keeping practices in Africa could increase the risk of the virus mutating to become transmissible between humans. In Africa, as in other ACP regions, households often live in close contact with poultry in their homes and backyards. Once the virus has mutated to become transmittable between humans, there can be no going back, and millions of lives could be lost. There is no cure for the disease and no vaccine so far. At the time of going to press, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Niger Nigeria and Sudan had confirmed the H 5 N 1 avian flu strain, with two deaths confirmed in Egypt, but at an emergency meeting held in March in Gabon, one UN official warned that more countries were affected than had admitted. These are the only countries who dared announce their results, said WHO epidemiologist Andre Ndikuyeze. Unfortunately, others haven't been so brave. Porous borders, a flourishing informal chicken trade and inadequate veterinary services are acknowledged as key reasons for the spread. The poultry is everywhere and yet veterinary services are nowhere, said Dr Bonaventure Mtei, of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). In Nigeria, health workers are spreading the word about the risks, using leaflets, meetings and the media. But not everyone is receptive to the warnings. A major problem facing health and veterinary officials in some ACP countries is that not everyone believes that the threat is real. In several northern states of Nigeria, people are opposing mass culling, claiming it is a western plot. It s nonsense what people are saying about chickens, laughed Alhaja Sikiratu, in Lagos. When I was small, I ate chicken infected with cholera, and nothing happened to me! FAO is urging adequate compensation to encourage early reporting, but Nigerian poultry farmers, who are being paid 1, 000 CFA (1. 50) per bird, complain they only receive funds for <b>culled</b> <b>poultry,</b> not for those which have died from the disease. The economic effects have been quick to make themselves felt, as consumers in both North and South shun poultry and egg products. Trade experts have warned that dumping of poultry on ACP countries from Europe could drastically affect prices, as happened with beef after the BSE crisis. Rapid detection needed In the affected areas, initiatives are under way to halt the spread. Member states of the Economic Community of West African States have set up an observation network for the rapid detection of sick poultry. Out in the field our staff are alerting the public and collecting information, said Dr Mamadou KanÃ©, director of animal health in Mali. In other ACP regions, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is mapping a regional strategy to cope with the threat of H 5 N 1, which, it acknowledges, is bound to reach the region sooner or later. In March, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community launched the Pacific Regional Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Project, to provide animal surveillance and other responses. But while the spotlight focuses on avian flu, there are a whole host of other zoonoses which have a devastating effect on human health and livelihoods. Experts have warned that urgent action is needed {{to prevent the spread of}} a particularly virulent form of sleeping sickness transmitted by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense that has broken out in eastern Uganda. Infected cattle continue to be transported to outlying markets, raising fears of an epidemic. With Africa s pig population more than doubling over the past 30 years, there are concerns over growing incidences of neurocysticercosis, a parasitic disease of the central nervous system transmitted by pigs. Nearly 50, 000 people die of the tape worm disease each year, mainly in rural areas with poor pig management practices and inadequate meat inspection and sanitation. and timely intervention Cost-effective control measures already exist for several zoonotic diseases. But they are not always applied as zoonoses often rank low in terms of funding. As long ago as 1992, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication concluded that cysticercosis could be eradicated. Other problems facing ACP countries include difficulties in collecting accurate data. Often, surveillance systems lack uniformity and local staff may accept endemic diseases as the norm or fail to report potential zoonose outbreaks to avoid livestock trading bans. When outbreaks of diseases do occur, ACP countries need technical assistance for diagnosis, vaccination and slaughtering programmes. But preventative help is even more crucial. A recent FAO e-conference claimed that public health emergencies such as avian influenza were failures of prevention. The rise in livestock production seen in much of the South must be accompanied by access to credit, development of infrastructure and animal production and health services. Most important of all, farmers need access to information. FAO has set up four regional networks, offering advice on zoonotic disease, through e-conferences, discussions and newsletters. The International Network for Family Poultry Development encourages higher standards in small-scale poultry production through its electronic newsletter. A project developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency for surveillance of livestock disease in Africa uses ICTs to offer training of trainers, on the Internet and on CDs. Meanwhile, as states neighbouring Nigeria slapped a ban on poutry imports, the country was counting the cost to its poultry industry. Before, we always had a good crowd of customers, complained the owner of a Lagos fried chicken eatery. Look at my restaurant now: it s empty ! FAO and WHO have issued a five-point plan for consumers 1. No birds from flocks with disease should enter the food chain. 2. Do not eat raw poultry parts, including raw blood, or raw eggs. 3. Separate raw meat from cooked or ready-to-eat foods to avoid contamination. 4. Keep clean and wash your hands. 5. Thorough cooking of poultry meat will inactivate the virus. Either ensure that the poultry meat reaches 70 Â°Celsius at the centre of the product (piping hot) or that the meat is not pink in any part. Egg yolks should not be runny or liquid.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{magnitude of}} HPAI epidemics and the endemicy of H 5 N 1 ask for alternative strategies for prevention {{and control of}} HPAI next to measures like <b>culling</b> of infected <b>poultry</b> flocks, pre-emptive <b>culling,</b> and the imposement of movement restrictions. Such an alternative is offered by vaccination, which has been applied during some HPAI epidemics.

However, {{little is known about the}} effect of vaccination on transmission, which is crucial when an epidemic has to be controlled by vaccination. The main goal of this thesis was to gain insight in the transmission parameters of HPAI viruses in birds, and in the effect of vaccination on transmission. To this end, transmission experiments with different HPAI strains in unvaccinated and vaccinated birds of different species were performed. To better understand the origin of an HPAI outbreak from an LPAI outbreak, the transmission characteristics of genetically closely related HPAI and LPAI strains (A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/ 83) from the subtype H 5 N 2 were compared (Chapter 2). The LPAI and HPAI strains appear to differ quite substantially in their key epidemiological parameters, with the HPAI strain spreading more efficiently and having a longer infectious period. In Chapters 3 and 4 the effect of vaccination on transmission of an H 7 N 7 virus that caused a major epidemic in the Netherlands in 2003 was studied. It appears that the effect of vaccination on transmission depends on the bird species, the vaccine, and timing of vaccination relative to the moment of challenge. A single vaccination was able to sufficiently reduce transmission in chickens (Chapter 3), and in teals (Chapter 4), while in pheasants no significant reduction in transmission was observed (Chapter 4). In chickens a difference in the effect of vaccination on transmission was observed between two vaccines that differed in homology and HA content, and between the time points after vaccination (Chapter 3). Chapter 5 elaborates on this theme by focusing on the transmission dynamics of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus in Pekin ducks. The results show that a genetically distant vaccine is able to significantly reduce transmission, although the analyses did not allow us to conclude that transmission is reduced to the extent that no major outbreaks can occur. The results of Chapters 3 - 5, furthermore, have shown that silent transmission can occur in vaccinated birds. This implies that vaccination programs should be accompanied by monitoring based on a DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy. Therefore, in Chapter 6 three different DIVA tests were validated using sera that were obtained from the experiments in Chapter 3. The analyses show that two serological tests based on a heterologous neuraminidase have sensitivities and specificities of more than 0. 90 in detecting antibodies, while the sensitivity in detecting infection is substantially lower. The discrepancy between the sensitivity in detecting antibodies and in detecting infection can be explained by the finding that chickens with no virus excretion or only a short period of virus excretion after infection only have a low probability to develop antibodies...|$|R
