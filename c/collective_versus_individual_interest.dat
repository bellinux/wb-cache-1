40|$|Abstract. The {{response}} to a large-scale disaster, e. g. an earthquake or a terrorist incident, urges for low-cost policies that coordinate sequential decisions of multiple agents. Decisions range from collective (common good) to individual (self-interested) perspectives, intuitively shaping a two-layer decision model. However, current decision theoretic models are either purely collective or purely individual and seek optimal policies. We present a two-layer, <b>collective</b> <b>versus</b> <b>individual</b> (CvI) decision model and explore the tradeoff between cost reduction and loss of optimality while learning coordination skills. Experiments, in a partially observable domain, test our approach for learning a collective policy and results show near-optimal policies that exhibit coordinated behavior. ...|$|R

Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of monetary incentives (<b>collective</b> <b>versus</b> <b>individual)</b> set in order to promote participation. The results show that leader guidance and participatory incentives significantly raise cooperation and hold after controlling for a wide set of individual and group characteristics...|$|R

Here, drawing on interviews with 40 people living with cancer in Hyderabad, India, we focus on some specific components of their therapeutic journeys, including diagnostic and prognostic disclosure, <b>collective</b> <b>versus</b> <b>individual</b> decision making, the dynamics of medical authority, and the reception of cancer within their social milieu.

College students navigate the college culture keeping various elements of these sexual scripts in mind. Utilizing 1, 007 undergraduates, the researcher investigated the current relevance of traditional sexual scripts and the relationships between various levels of cultural sexual scripts (i. e., the <b>collective</b> <b>versus</b> <b>individual</b> perceptions of them) and their relation to reported sexual engagement. Researchers also explored factors that predict these relationships. Results suggested current sexual scripts still largely reflect traditional ones, depending on the sexual behavior being assessed. Individual perceptions of current sexual scripts more closely aligned with actual behavior than collective scripts. Lastly, participant age, sex, and agreeableness generally predicted relationships between levels of cultural sexual scripts as well as between scripts and actual behavior. These findings suggest programming promoting sexual health on campuses should more specifically target one 2 ̆ 7 s personal perceptions of cultural expectations rather than merely attempting to shift cultural expectations.

40|$|As {{the most}} {{valuable}} agricultural commodity in the U. S., beef is both an economic and cultural foundation of modern American agriculture. Uniting core perspectives from economic, environmental, and agri-food sociology, I examine ongoing transitions in the beef industry that illuminate the factors shaping {{the structure of the}} industry and their implications for different industry actors. Stemming heavily from the global value chains tradition, yet also drawing new connections the value chain literature and natural disasters and food regime research, I provide a close analysis of how the rise of private standards, extreme drought, and generational transition form a crucible of pressures reshaping the landscape of American agriculture. As a highly fragmented industry, the beef value chain provides an excellent opportunity to understand how exchanges between distinct segments of the chain—cow-calf producers, feedlots, processors, and retailers—are governed. My findings underscore the variation that exists within a particular value chain segment, and show that a single firm can participate in multiple governance arrangements simultaneously—even with the same exchange partner. The expansion of private standards within the beef industry influences these governance types but with uneven effects for producers depending {{on the nature of the}} standard (<b>collective</b> <b>versus</b> <b>individual),</b> and thus the degree to which the standard can 2 ̆ 2 lock 2 ̆ 2 upstream producers into particular relationships with particular buyers.

Intervencije u javnim prostorima Marijana Crtalića, Siniše Labrovića i Igora Grubića adresirale su tri lokaliteta – Sisak, Sinj i Zagreb – i tri spomeničke “cjeline” socijalizma u ovim prostorima. Njihovi projekti ukazuju na povezanost prošlosti i sadašnjosti, sjećanja i politike, kolektivnoga i individualnoga u tretiranju spomeničke baštine socijalizma. Njihove akcije evociranja kolektivnog odnosa prema socijalizmu postaju individualne prakse komentiranja kolektivne amnezije ukazujući na procese sjećanja kao aktivnosti kontekstualizirane individualnom odgovornošću, političkim aktivizmom i humanizmom. Remembrance {{is seen as}} {{the product}} of a {{community}} of people which resembles and evokes the most precious values of collective identity and communicates contingent needs of the present. In contrast to collective-memory-practices, this paper aims to explore individual practices of remembering performed by three Croatian artists. The paper explores performative projects of Marijan Crtalić – Project Target – where the socialist sculptural heritage gets to be reinterpreted by military teleologies; then Siniša Labrović, whose project restages partisan pieta vulnerability, and Igor Grubić and his project of redressing socialist sculptures. The projects point to the interconnectedness of past and present, memory and politics, <b>collective</b> <b>versus</b> <b>individual</b> via art. Acting as individuals, those artists have tangled the questions of how societies tend to renegotiate the meaning of art coming from the socialist past alongside the renegotiation of memory. Re-evoking socialism in their work, those three artists stand for individual interpellation of collective amnesia pointing to the process of remembrance as highly contextual practice placed in-between individual responsibility, political activism and humanism in general. By trying to re-animate or make sculptures re-personalize human figures, those art projects are meant to criticize, comment and envision the existing usage of cultural memory as well as to offer post-utopian insights on socialist and transitional utopia...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{aimed to explore}} peoples’ {{experiences}} of social and organisational justice, {{and in doing so}} asked three central questions. The first focused on whether there was a relationship between the different dimensions of justice, and the second on the commonalties and differences in peoples’ perceptions of justice. The third question looked at whether demographic variables, as markers of social identity, were predictive of such justice perceptions. The study was quantitative in nature, and made use of a non-experimental, partially exploratory, cross-sectional design. Four hundred and eight six employees of a large South African manufacturing organisation completed a self report questionnaire containing questions about a range of biographic, domestic, financial, employment, and religious information, as well as two measures of social and organisational justice perceptions. Once preliminary analyses were carried out to ensure the psychometric properties of the measuring instruments and explore the data set, two key statistical procedures were used to answer the research questions, namely a cluster analysis and a Chi Squared Automatic Interaction Detection or CHAID analysis. Results of these analyses provided some evidence to argue that justice perceptions in different contexts, while not strongly related, cannot be seen in isolation from another, and that a more integrative or reciprocal approach to understanding different justice perceptions needs to be adopted. Further, the results of the cluster analysis demonstrated that a range of key justice concerns differentiated groups from another, including <b>collective</b> <b>versus</b> <b>individual</b> concerns, personal <b>versus</b> impersonal events, as well as concerns related to the different types of relationships that exist. Finally, the CHAID analysis provided some indication of which demographic variables were the best determinants of social and organisational justice perceptions, {{and the ways in which}} demographic variables interacted with one another in relation to peoples’ experiences of justice...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{mobilise}} the concept of network sociality (Wittel 2001) {{as a framework for}} exploring how social entrepreneurs enact social entrepreneurship. Specifically, this thesis questions the tendency to interpret social entrepreneurs and their ability to achieve their altruistic aim of solving social problems only in terms of the successful application of business practices such as financial control, marketing, and strategising. Instead it is argued that critically deploying the concept of network sociality does two things. Firstly, it highlights the importance of also depicting and understanding the nature of the social processes (i. e., interactions with other stakeholders) which {{play a crucial role in}} the success of social entrepreneurial activity. Network sociality therefore helps to conceptualise the under researched activities which precede social change. Secondly, this thesis facilitates a move away from the dominant stance in the literature where the social entrepreneur is conceptualised in terms of either an individualist 'solitary hero' operating alone without the assistance of others (Nicholls 2010), or alternatively as a communally embedded actor operating in the context of strong ties of solidarity (Hjorth and Bjerke 2006; Hjorth 2013; Steyaert and Hjorth 2007). The aim of this thesis is to shed light on the social processes inherent in doing business in a social entrepreneurship context, by drawing on data derived from 33 semi-structured interviews with social entrepreneurs located in the south east of England. An abductive analysis (Van Maanen, Sørensen and Mitchell 2007; Tavory and Timmermans 2014) whereby the interview data is read through the five dimensions of the concept of network sociality - individualisation, ephemeral relations, information exchange, assimilation of play and work, and use of technology - facilitates a critique of the literature privileging outcomes at the expense of conceptualising the social actions that precede and facilitate these outcomes (826 Seymour, Richard 2012), as well as the prevailing dichotomy in the social entrepreneurship literature where the 'social' element is conceptualised largely in collectivist (Hjorth 2013; Steyaert and Hjorth 2007), philanthropic (Tan, Williams and Tan 2003; Tan, Williams and Tan 2005) terms while the 'entrepreneurship' element is conceptualised in largely individualist business terms (Dees, Emerson and Economy 2002). The analysis sheds light on social entrepreneurship beyond the distinction of <b>collective</b> <b>versus</b> <b>individual</b> (Nicholls 2010). Through the use of the concept of network sociality, the thesis rather makes visible how the social entrepreneur engages in several social activities while operating in an individualistic manner to achieve social/business aims within the context of impermanent relationships (113 Wittel, Andreas 2001). The thesis concludes that it is in researching and conceptualising what social entrepreneurs do, that we can better understand who social entrepreneurs are, in their missions to secure positive solutions to social problems...|$|R
40|$|The West African Ebola {{epidemic}} has set {{in motion}} a collective endeavour to conduct accelerated clinical trials, testing unproven but potentially lifesaving interventions {{in the course of a}} major public health crisis. This unprecedented effort was supported by the recommendations of an ad hoc ethics panel convened in August 2014 by the WHO. By considering why and on what conditions the exceptional circumstances of the Ebola epidemic justified the use of unproven interventions, the panel's recommendations have challenged conventional thinking about therapeutic development and clinical research ethics. At the same time, unanswered ethical questions have emerged, in particular: (i) the specification of exceptional circumstances, (ii) the specification of unproven interventions, (iii) the goals of interventional research in terms of <b>individual</b> <b>versus</b> <b>collective</b> <b>interests,</b> (iv) the place of adaptive trial designs and (v) the exact meaning of compassionate use with unapproved interventions.

40|$|Bibliography: p. 323 - 332. This study {{posits that}} the concept of the Other is central in modern Hebrew literature. It traces its {{beginnings}} in Jewish thought to the Bible, and connects the creation and Eden narratives to contemporary psychoanalytic thought on ego formation and the Other. It considers the importance of the figure of the talush to the focus on the Other in modern Hebrew literature and suggests that the conflicts of the <b>collective</b> <b>versus</b> the <b>individual</b> that are expressed {{in the early stages of}} the literature do not disappear as it moves into the present day, but are discernible in different guise and can be seen in the burden of group consciousness which besets Hebrew authors and vitiates their attempts to configure the unique. The feminized Other is seen as especially important in this regard because of the collective textual and thus social repression of women in the tradition. Its presentation is thus taken as a useful measure of the successful resolution of individual as opposed to group narration. The modern Hebrew texts analyzed, beginning with a poem by the late Haskhalah poet, Y. L. Gordon through D. Baron, M. Y. Berdichewski, A. Kahana-Carman, S. Y. Agnon, A Appelfeld and ending with a novel by the contemporary Israeli writer, D. Grossman, support this decision as the collective is subjugated only in Kahana-Carman's text where the feminine is fully realized. The thesis examines the ways the eight narratives grapple with the awareness of the Other, and focuses on the aspects, including body, war and language, that are highlighted variously in each text. The struggles of modern Hebrew writers are also viewed as part of the difficulties entailed in the denotative endeavors of writing itself which strives, towards the always elusive Other that predates ego-formation and thus individuality itself. It is proposed that this intensifies the tensions about the Other in modern Hebrew literature which derive from its specific cultural heritage...|$|R

This report deals with the theme of 'public support for road safety and road safety measures' in greater depth. It discusses the following questions: (1) What is meant by public support for policies; (2) How is public support for road safety measured; (3) What do policy makers and experts think {{about the role of}} public support in policy; and (4) which research opportunities are there to enlarge the knowledge of public support? Public support for road safety policy can be described as a positive valuation of road safety and of measures that evidently increase road safety. In order to determine the support for a particular measure, or how the support is developing, measuring tools are necessary. The measuring tool to be chosen is, among other things, dependent on the familiarity of the public with the measure.

This essay starts with the political background of the terms equableness and freedom of choice and the official governmental guidelines. Research from Bo Malmberg and Gabriel Sahlgren act {{as a framework for}} the whole essay as their theories are tested.

In conclusion the main problem is answered with a yes, the concern of a lowered equableness is justifiable.

This can be traced back to the political arena where opposite sides of the political ideologies gave equableness its own definition.

It facilitates research to learn what causes cancer to develop and, in many cases, lead to death. However, as concerns about privacy increase, cancer registration has come under question.

Thus, we argue that cancer registration would survive constitutional review, is compatible with the civil liberties protected by privacy rights in the U.
