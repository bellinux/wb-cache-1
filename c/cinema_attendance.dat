5|$|The venue {{became an}} adult cinema in the 1970s. The success of Deep Throat in 1972 {{was a turning}} point, leading to an {{increase}} in the number of adult film screenings at more than a dozen cinemas in Portland. However, the rise of video cassettes and cable television led to a decline in <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance,</b> and by the 2000s, the Maizels family had sold all of their properties except for the Oregon Theatre. Gayne Maizels still owns the theater, which continues to operate as the city's longest running pornographic cinema.|$|E
5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! is {{credited}} {{as being a}} defining moment in Hindi cinema's box office history, {{and the beginning of}} a revolution in the Indian film distribution system. When it was released, cinema was in decline in India due to improved cable television, home video, and film piracy. The film was originally released in {{only a small number of}} theatres that agreed to upgrade their facilities. Due to widespread demand for the film, many other theatres upgraded in order to get the film. Although ticket prices were raised, the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television. Also, the film's lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle-class family patrons that they could return to the theatre. This film, in addition to the following year's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, contributed to an increase in Indian <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> of 40% in just two years.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, South Korea's film {{industry}} {{was at a}} low point due to government censorship and underfunding. Because of the poor state of the local {{film industry}}, <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> in South Korea had dropped drastically since its high-point in the 1960s. Kim Ki-young, however, working independently in B-movie-like genre films, began to produce {{some of his most}} innovative and personal works at this time. Kim fully regained his auteurist spirit with Woman of Fire (1971), the second of his Housemaid trilogy. The use of color, particularly reds and blues to express the anxiety and desires of the film's characters, distinguished this film from the original Housemaids dark, shadowy black-and-white photography. For this film, Kim was named Best Director at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and actress Youn Yuh-jung was given Special Mention for Best Actress at the Festival de Cine de Sitges. Not only popular with the critics, Kim's independently produced films were box-office successes during this era in which most films were harmed through heavy governmental interference. In 1972 Kim's Insect Woman was the only film to sell more than 100,000 tickets in Seoul and won Kim the Best Director prize at the Baeksang Arts Awards in 1973.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1970s Kinekor {{embarked}} on a program of opening new cinemas across South Africa. However, due {{to the introduction of}} television in 1976, <b>cinema</b> <b>attendances</b> dropped. Because of this, the South African government then allowed Sanlam to merge its two theatres divisions, creating Ster-Kinekor.|$|R
50|$|By 1998, a {{new wave}} of {{multiplex}} cinemas had emerged to reverse the long decline in <b>cinema</b> <b>attendances,</b> and one of many traditional cinemas in Southend to close over a long period was the ABC.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{the growth in}} <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> of the {{preceding}} decade first stagnated and then went into freefall throughout the 1960s. By 1969 West German <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> at 172.2 million visits per year {{was less than a}} quarter of its 1956 post-war peak. As a consequence of this, numerous German production and distribution companies went out of business in the 1950s and 1960s and cinemas across the Federal Republic closed their doors; the number of screens in West Germany almost halved between the beginning and the end of the decade.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} {{the spread of}} {{videocassette}} recorders {{and the arrival of}} private TV channels such as RTL Television provided new competition for theatrical film distribution. <b>Cinema</b> <b>attendance,</b> having rallied slightly in the late 1970s after an all-time low of 115.1 million visits in 1976, dropped sharply again from the mid-1980s to end at just 101.6 million visits in 1989. However, the availability of a back catalogue of films on video also allowed for a different relationship between the viewer and an individual film, while private TV channels brought new money into the film industry and provided a launch pad from which new talent could later move into film.|$|E

25|$|Amidst {{the devastation}} of the Stunde Null year of 1945 <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> was unsurprisingly down to a {{fraction}} of its wartime heights, but already {{by the end of}} the decade it had reached levels that exceeded the pre-war period. For the first time in many years, German audiences had free access to cinema from around the world and in this period the films of Charlie Chaplin remained popular, as were melodramas from the United States. Nonetheless, the share of the film market for German films in this period and into the 1950s remained relatively large, taking up some 40 percent of the total market. American films took up around 30 percent of the market despite having around twice as many films in distribution as the German industry in the same time frame.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Dr. No {{received}} a mixed critical reception. Time called Bond a [...] "blithering bounder" [...] and [...] "a great big hairy marshmallow" [...] who [...] "almost always manages to seem slightly silly". Stanley Kauffmann in The New Republic {{said that he}} felt the film [...] "never decides whether it is suspense or suspense-spoof." [...] He also did not like Connery, or the Fleming novels. The Vatican condemned Dr. No describing it as [...] "a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex", whilst the Kremlin said that Bond was the personification of capitalist evil – both controversies helped increase {{public awareness of the}} film and greater <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance.</b> However Leonard Mosely in The Daily Express said that [...] "Dr No is fun all the way, and even the sex is harmless", whilst Penelope Gilliatt in The Observer said it was [...] "full of submerged self-parody". The Guardians critic called Dr. No [...] "crisp and well-tailored" [...] and [...] "a neat and gripping thriller." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, {{due to the}} low <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> Chytilová was {{approached}} {{by the government to}} begin directing films through one of the state run production companies, [...] At the same time the United States was assembling a 'Year of Women' Film Festival and contacted Chytilová to gain permission to screen Daisies as their opening film. [...] Chytilová informed the festival that the only non-censored prints of the film could be found in Paris and Brussels. She also informed the festival that her government would not allow her to attend the festival, nor were they allowing her to direct films. The festival then began to apply international pressure upon the Czechoslovakian government by petitioning on Chytilová’s behalf. In accordance with this international pressure Chytilová wrote a letter directly to President Gustáv Husák detailing her career and her personal beliefs in socialism. [...] Due {{to the success of the}} international pressure, and Chytilová’s personal appeal to President Husak, Chytilová began production of Hra o jablko (The Apple Game, 1976).

The majority of the films of this period set out to do no more than entertain the audience and had few pretensions to artistry or active engagement with social issues. The defining genre of the period was arguably the Heimatfilm ("homeland film"), in which morally simplistic tales of love and family were played out in a rural setting, often in the mountains of Bavaria, Austria or Switzerland. [...] In their day Heimatfilms were of little interest to more scholarly film critics, but in recent years they {{have been the subject of}} study in relation to what they say about the culture of West Germany in the years of the Wirtschaftswunder.
