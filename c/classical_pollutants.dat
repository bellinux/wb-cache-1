By using the structural macroeconometric E 3 ME model the authors compare two alternative green tax based policy frameworks in the Czech Republic. While the first imposes {{a tax on}} emissions of <b>classical</b> <b>pollutants</b> (particulates, sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, and volatile organic compounds), the second consists of carbon taxation intentionally set at the level equalizing environmental effect measured by externalities that are avoided as result of both reductions in emissions subject to taxation and ancillary effects. The authors also analyze impacts of revenue recycling. The comparison of economic impacts of both considered policy set ups indicates that policy aimed at the taxation of <b>classical</b> <b>pollutants</b> outperforms carbon policies in cases without revenue recycling. On the other hand, mainly due to significantly higher revenues from carbon taxation, when the revenues are recycled, a carbon taxation framework {{appears to be a}} better option. environmental taxation; structural models; macro-econometric model; E 3 ME...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a sample}} of my research on macroeconomic aspects of the transition process in the Central European countries. During my doctoral studies, I have been especially interested in two issues: (1) environmental regulation and policy and (2) macroeconomic convergence. The first paper The decomposition and econometric analysis of air emissions in a transition country: {{the case of the}} Czech Republic is from the field of environmental economics and is empirically oriented. It analyzes air emissions of four <b>classical</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the Czech Republic during the transition period. The next three papers are macroeconomic papers based on theoretical modeling. The paper Real Exchange Rate in Emerging Economies: The Role of Different Investment Margins (written jointly with Jiří Podpiera) inquires about the mechanism of the strong pace of the real exchange rate appreciation observed in Central European transition economies. The paper introduces a quality investment margin and shows that the margin is needed for replicating the observed pace of the real exchange rate appreciation. The paper basically compares the steady state of the model for various levels of development of a converging country. The next paper The Dynamics of Economic Convergence: The Role of Alternative Investment Decisions [...] ...|$|E

When average concentrations of the districts were assessed, it was observed that the concentrations are dependent on meteorological and topographical conditions, fuel usage and population characteristics...|$|R
30|$|This study {{aims for}} {{reporting}} on the determination of selected organic contaminants in moss samples from Germany taken {{within the framework of}} the 2015 European moss survey. In the European moss survey programme, since 1990, every 5  years, moss have been sampled at up to about 7300 sites in up to 36 countries, among them Germany. Within the European moss survey programme, sampling, chemical determination of heavy metals (since 1990), nitrogen (since 2005), as well as POP and POP-like substances (since 2010) in moss specimens, quality control and statistical evaluation were conducted according to a harmonized methodology [25]. In Germany, (persistent) organic pollutants in moss samples were to be determined for the first time within this programme in 2015. Therefore, this study aims for the determination of a wide range of organic pollutants to get insight of their extent of accumulation and distribution in moss from Germany. As some of these contaminants were also monitored in tree leaf samples within the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB), accumulation in moss should be compared to that in tree leaves. Among the target analytes of this study are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) including benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) as <b>classical</b> air <b>pollutant</b> with limit value of 1  ng m− 3 in ambient air (PM 10) [15], PCDD/F, PCB, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), PBDE as well as novel or emerging halogenated flame retardants (HFR) of different substance classes (Dechloranes, brominated aromates, brominated ethers, cyclic HFR). Overall, 120 target analytes were investigated.|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{taxes have}} {{direct impact on}} {{sustainable}} energy development as energy production and consumption is {{the major source of}} GHG and <b>classical</b> <b>pollutants</b> emissions. There are number of EU member states which are using environmental pollution taxes as the main economic instrument of atmospheric air pollution reduction. The energy sector is the main source of atmospheric pollution therefore environmental taxes should have direct impact on sustainable energy development as these taxes create incentives to reduce consumption of fossil fuels and to switch to renewables and cleaner fossil fuels such as natural gas. The comparative study of environmental taxes and indicators of sustainable energy sector development in Baltics and Czech Republic and Slovakia was performed to assess what role environmental taxes are playing in achieving sustainable energy development in selected new EU member states. Analysis of environmental taxes in three Baltic States and Czech Republic indicated quite different energy and pollution tax rates as well as quite large differences in the share of environmental tax revenues as percentages of GDP in these countries. Estonia distinguishes with the best results in greening environmental tax system {{and one of the best}} results in achieving sustainable energy development targets. Latvia has one of the lowest share of environmental taxes as percentage of GDP and has very high shares of renewables in electricity generation and in ﬁnal energy consumption however it is more related with favourable climate conditions and well developed hydro power plants...|$|E
40|$|In {{environmental}} epidemiology, {{exposure assessment}} {{is a central}} topic as its quality determines in large part the validity of a study. Further, it is used in risk assessment to quantify the impact of environmental risk factors. Usually in cross-sectional studies the air pollution measurements, performed at one fixed site monitoring station, are used to assign exposure levels to all study subjects living in the corresponding city. In order to prove the validity of this technique, spatial and temporal variability of air pollutants in the Basel area was systematically investigated. Based on these findings a risk assessment was performed to quantify the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risk {{that is associated with}} the occurring pollution levels in the cantons Basel-Stadt and Landschaft (Switzerland). During 1997 a broad palette of air pollutants was measured at six temporary sites using a mobile monitoring station changing location every two weeks. The six sites differed mainly with respect to the road traffic density and represented typical residential place in the city of Basel. It was measured particulate matter (PM 4, PM 10 and TSP), <b>classical</b> <b>pollutants</b> (NOx, SO 2, CO, O 3, black carbon) and 61 different compounds belonging to VOCs (volatile organic compounds), PAHs (polycyclic aromatic carbons) and nitro-PAHs, thereof many carcinogens. Additional, air pollutant data from further urban and rural monitoring stations {{as well as from the}} following year were taken into account in the data analysis. Concurrently performed reference measurements allowed a statistical analysis of the spatial variability of air pollutants at the six temporary sites. To quantify cancer risk from air pollution, two methodological approaches were performed. On the one hand cancer risk attributable to air pollution was quantified based on the indicator concept, taking PM 10 as a surrogate of the cancerogenicity of air pollution. This integrative approach was based purely on human epidemiological data. On the other hand unit risk factors were used to quantify the cancer risk with an analytical approach. Unit risk factors express the cancer risk of each single agent and have been traditionally applied in cancer risk assessment. They are based mainly on animal, partly also on human data. The analyses of the air pollutant measurements yielded generally a homogeneous distribution of PM 4, PM 10, and TSP in the city of Basel. With the exception of one site in a street canyon next to a traffic light, proximity to road traffic had only a weak tendency to inc rease the levels of PM. Mean PM 10 concentration at the six temporary sites with different traffic densities was in the range of less than ± 10...|$|E
40|$|Research {{focus in}} {{environmental}} pollution {{has recently been}} extended from more <b>classical</b> environmental <b>pollutants</b> such as PCBs or pesticides to pharmaceuticals and steroid hormones, which {{are designed to be}} biologically active and enter the environment primarily through regular domestic use. Consequently, it is important to monitor these substances concentrations in the effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and in the environment in order to evaluate their associated risks. Moreover, the study of the occurrence and fate of these compounds within the STP would aid in improving their removal. Therefore, in this thesis the occurrence of seven pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, fluoxetine, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin), two metabolites (norfloxacin, clofibric acid), one toxic degradation product (4 -isobutylacetophenone) and three steroid hormones (ethinylestradiol, estradiol, estrone) and their removal rates were investigated in a tertiary STP in the south of Sweden. Perspectives on sample preparation for the analysis of pharmaceuticals and steroid hormones in wastewater are presented. In this thesis, special attention is devoted toward the development of various sample preparation methodologies preceding the final separation and detection systems, liquid or gas chromatography coupled to DAD or MS. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is widely used to extract polar compounds such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Different SPE sorbents were compared showing that hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) polymer has a higher trapping capacity than ion-exchange sorbents, but lacks high selectivity leading to large matrix effects in LC-ESI-MS/MS. Furthermore a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based SPE was developed for non-steroidal antiinflamaroty drugs (NSAIDs) and clofibric acid extraction from wastewater resulting in no appreciable matrix effect. Membrane-based extraction techniques were as well evaluated for the extraction of steroid hormones, basic drugs and a toxic degradation product of ibuprofen. These methodologies had the advantage of simplicity, low cost and high enrichment factors. Finally these methods were applied to study the occurrence and removal rates of the target analytes at Kristianstad´s STP. Results showed that removal rates were above 90 %, except for diclofenac, clofibric acid, estrone and ofloxacin. For the first time 4 -isobutylacetophenone (4 -IBAP) has been monitored along a STP. Relatively high concentrations of 4 -IBAP were observed in the inlet of the STP, but since good removal rates were obtained during the biological step, as for many other drugs, it was not detected in the effluent...|$|R
40|$|EGU 2012 - 10224 Harbour and marina sediments {{represent}} particular environments, {{with high}} concentrations in organic carbon and pollutants. Over 50 million m 3 of marine sediments are dredged {{every year in}} French maritime and commercial ports, to maintain the water depth suitable for navigation, and the most part of them is discharged in deeper sea zones. The present study aimed to elucidate, using a range of complementary approaches, the influence of bacterial activity on arsenic speciation and mobility in marina sediments. Two sites were considered: L'Estaque, impacted by metallurgical activities and by the commercial port of Marseille, and St-Mandrié, less polluted, affected by <b>classical</b> chemical <b>pollutants</b> associated to professional and recreational boating. Arsenic concentration was noticeably higher in l'Estaque sediment (200 - 350 mg/kg) than in St-Mandrier sediment (15 - 50 mg/kg). In the solid phases, As(III) was the dominant species in L'Estaque sediment, whereas As(V) was the main form in St Mandrier sediment. At both sites, arsenic was the major trace element detected in interstitial water. Free sulfide and thio-arsenic complexes were detected in the interstitial water of l'Estaque sediment, suggesting a role of sulfate-reduction bacterial activity on arsenic solubility. Anaerobic microcosm experiments confirmed this hypothesis, as stimulation of sulfate-reduction induced a dramatic increase of arsenic concentration in the liquid phase, linked {{to the formation of}} soluble thio-arsenic complexes. Nevertheless, microcosms performed in aerobic conditions showed that bacterial activity globally decreased the transfer of arsenic from the sediment toward the overlying water. A red-brown fine layer developed at the sediment-water interface. Altogether, these results suggest that the sediment-water interface zone and the close transition area between aerobic and anaerobic conditions host intense biogeochemical reactions involving As, Fe and S species. These reactions most probably include dissolution of FeS (which confers to the muddy sediment its deep dark color), oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III), oxidation of As(III) to As(V), oxidation of S(-II) to S°, S(VI) and maybe other intermediate species, adsorption of As(V) onto fresh iron oxides. Bacterial activity tests applied to the crude sediments indicated that As(III) -oxidizing and As(V) -reducing micro-organisms have the potential to be active at both sites Detection of aoxB and arrA genes, respectively specific to As(III) -oxidation and respiratory As(V) -reduction, revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities able to contribute to As transformation in both St-Mandrier and l'Estaque marina sediments. As(III) -oxidizing bacteria probably contribute to the biogeochemical stabilization of arsenic, wherever electron acceptors are available. Whereas reducing conditions prevail in organic carbon-rich marina sediment, bacteria able to oxidize As(III) are present and can be rapidly active as soon as electron acceptors are available. The present study showed that arsenic, which inorganic forms As(III) and As(V) are particularly toxic, {{is one of the most}} mobile pollutants in polluted marina sediments. The biogeochemical reactions governing its mobility should thus be considered in the management of sediment dredging operations...|$|R
40|$|The Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic {{are part}} of the sub-Arctic region, a remote region far from {{industrial}} activity. In spite of this remoteness, the Islands are not a sanctuary: exposures and effects of environmental pollutants mar its natural beauty and wildlife. In the Arctic regions, fish, sea mammals and seabirds have shown to contain elevated levels of the <b>classical</b> persistent organic <b>pollutants</b> (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), as well as more recent POPs such as the polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Human populations living in the Arctic regions are usually highly dependent on seafood and seabirds as food sources, and diet becomes their major source of exposures to POPs. As reported in the 1980 ’s, residents of the Faroe Islands were shown to have high concentrations of organohalogen substances (OHS) in their breast milk. Long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) blubber and meat {{have been shown to be}} a major source of OHS exposure for some of the Faroe Islanders. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the sources and concentrations of some POPs and their metabolites for the Faroese population. First, human milk and serum from pregnant women (mothers) and children were analyzed for PBDEs, PCBs, and polychlorinated biphenylols (OH-PCB), the major PCB metabolites. Second, POPs were measured in seabirds, i. e. PCBs in fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and guillemots (Uria algae), and PBDEs in fulmars to search for other potential sources of POPs exposure. The results reinforce previous findings that part of the Faroe Island population is highly exposed to OHS. Median concentrations (430 ng/g lipid weight (l. w.) of CB- 153) in maternal serum (1994 - 95) are among the highest in the world. Serum concentrations of CB- 153 in children (age 7, samples collected in the early 2000 ’s) were approximately 90 % of those in the mothers, sampled 1994 - 95. Similarly high CB- 153 concentrations (380 ng/g l. w.) were measured in samples of mother’s milk, collected in 1999. The OH-PCB concentrations were also high in segments of the population, with 2. 9 ng/g fresh weight as the sum of five OH-PCBs. Except for 4 -OH-CB 107, concentrations of OH-PCBs were generally lower in children than in mothers. The ΣPBDE median concentrations in maternal serum and human milk (1999) are at the higher end of those reported in Europe, with levels of 9. 5 and 8. 2 ng/g l. w. respectively. ΣPBDE levels increase in human milk samples collected at three different time points (1987 - 1999), mainly due to increasing BDE- 153 concentrations. The range of serum ΣPBDE concentrations in mothers and children are similar, although the congener patterns show differences. BDE- 47 is the dominant congener in maternal serum, while BDE- 153 is the major congener in children. The differences seen in PBDE congener patterns may arise differences in dates of sampling (7 years) for the two populations, maternal serum sampled in 1994 - 95 and children serum sampled in 2000 - 01, rather than from differences in uptake/metabolism or in contemporary exposures. PCB concentrations in fulmars and pilot whales show similar ranges. In contrast, PBDE concentrations are 100 times higher in pilot whales than in fulmars. Consequently, Faroese may be especially exposed to PCBs via consumption of fulmars and fulmar eggs, while the exposure to PBDEs is less pronounced. Results from this thesis highlight the pronounced exposures to PCBs, OH-PCBs, and PBDEs among residents of the Faroe Islands, a remote region in the Northern Atlantic far away from industrial and urban sources of pollution...|$|R
