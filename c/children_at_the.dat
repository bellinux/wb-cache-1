5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was originally}} established in 1860 by Jews of German background. Its primary {{purpose was to}} create a Jewish cemetery, which it immediately did, on State Street. In November 1862 the congregation hired a Mr. Oberndorfer as cantor; its next goal was provide a Jewish education for the congregation's <b>children.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time Jackson had 15 Jewish families.|$|E

5|$|The writing {{staff of}} Saturday Night Live and Henson's team did share some qualities; each group formed a {{separate}} social clique and were independently opinionated and creative. They differed in age and lifestyleproducer Lorne Michaels was 31 {{years old in}} 1975, and Henson was nearly 40. Most of the writers were single and Henson was married with five <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E

Tracy, for example, {{attempts}} to telephone Robert to inform him that he's lost his mobile phone, and believes {{that she is a}} lesbian when she discovers her husband in women's clothing. They have a baby, who is seen or referred to occasionally. This reflects, as the writer observes, Moffat's inexperience of looking after <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E

5|$|At the Town Hall, Joan asks Mr Johnson (Colin Prockter) about {{applying}} for a flat in the new high-rise estate; she is told she is unlikely to get a tenancy, as preference {{will be given to}} those with young <b>children.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> Nag's Head, Freddie and Reg meet, and Reg invites him to his house to continue drinking.

5|$|BGSU {{currently}} {{is the home}} of Ohio's largest student-run philanthropy, Dance Marathon. BGSU's chapter {{is one of the largest}} and most active Dance Marathon organizations in the nation. BGSU Dance Marathon operates similar to other dance marathon events held nationwide at other college. The event is run entirely by college students and the proceeds go to local children's hospitals. Funds raised through BGSU's Dance Marathon benefit <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mercy Children's Hospital in Toledo via the Children's Miracle Network. 2011 marked the 16th year the BG has conducted the Dance Marathon. Since the event began, it has raised over $2.2 million for the Children's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his {{arguments}} against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E

5|$|Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram, is the {{principal}} {{of a high school}} named after his elder daughter Mahalakshmi. As a child, she went missing during a pilgrimage to the Godavari River pushkaram in Kakinada. Conditions at the school deteriorate due to mismanagement by Gopalam's nephew, A. K. Raju, an amateur detective. This is exacerbated when Panthulu, an ayurvedic doctor, teaches the children. Gopalam decides to replace them with a male and a female graduate (preferably a married couple) capable of training his younger daughter Sita in singing besides teaching <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school.|$|E

Toward {{the end of}} the show, Raël's liberal views on sex were critiqued by a priest, a social worker, and a psychologist. A former Raëlian named Jean Parraga believed that his wife and children were being held as prisoners and that Raël attempted to break up his family. He thought they were being treated like criminals in activities such as orgies and sacrifice involving <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Sensual Meditation camp. Parraga also had a criminal record as a drug dealer and car thief, and in August 1992, he attempted to shoot Raël.|$|E

5|$|In {{classical}} Athenian marriages, {{husband or}} wife could legally initiate a divorce. The woman's closest male relative (who {{would be her}} kyrios if she were not married) could also do so, apparently even against the couple's wishes. After divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman's livelihood would continue and she could remarry. If there were <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the divorce, they remained in their father's house and he remained responsible for their upbringing. If a woman committed adultery, her husband was legally required to divorce her. A married epikleros would be divorced so she could marry her nearest relative.|$|E

5|$|Lindenwood University traces {{its roots}} back to George Champlin Sibley, an early 19th-century American explorer, soldier, Indian agent, and politician, {{and his wife}} Mary Easton Sibley, an educator. In 1808, Acting Governor and friend Frederick Bates {{promoted}} Sibley {{to the position of}} chief factor at Fort Osage in western Missouri, near present-day Kansas City, Missouri. While at Fort Osage, Sibley immediately set to work creating relationships with the neighboring Osage tribes. He also Mary Easton, the daughter of Rufus Easton, a prominent St. Louis attorney and Missouri's second Attorney General. The couple were married in 1815.

5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and political life {{at the expense of the}} Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} {{the analogy of}} a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his <b>children</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that {{the message of the}} parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
