5|$|The {{casus belli}} {{have been stated}} as a Burmese attempt to expand their {{territory}} eastwards after a political crisis in Ayutthaya {{as well as an}} attempt to stop Siamese incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. The war, according to the Burmese, began in January 1547 when Siamese forces conquered the frontier town of Tavoy (Dawei). Later in the year, the Burmese forces led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein retook the Upper Tenasserim <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> to Tavoy. Next year, in October 1548, three Burmese armies led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung invaded Siam through the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces penetrated up to the capital city of Ayutthaya but could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. But the Burmese negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of two important Siamese nobles (the heir apparent Prince Ramesuan, and Prince Thammaracha of Phitsanulok) whom they had captured.|$|E

25|$|The war was inconclusive. While the Burmese regained {{control of}} the upper <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> to the Tavoy (Dawei), they had not {{eliminated}} the threat to their hold on the peripheral regions, which remained tenuous. They were forced to deal with Siamese-supported ethnic rebellions in the coast (1762, 1764) {{as well as in}} Lan Na (1761–1763). The Burmese would launch their next invasion in 1765, and topple the four-century-old Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767.|$|E

25|$|Some penny-farthing riders {{used only}} back {{pedalling}} and got off {{and walked down}} steep hills, but most also used a brake.

Putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes.|$|E
60|$|After this rough {{walking in}} the dark woods it was an {{agreeable}} change to glide down the rapid river in the canoe once more. This river, though still very swift, was almost perfectly smooth here, and showed a very visible declivity, a regularly inclined plane, for several miles, like a mirror set a little aslant, on which we <b>coasted</b> <b>down.</b> It was very exhilarating, and the perfection of traveling, the <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> this inclined mirror between two evergreen forests edged with lofty dead white pines, sometimes slanted half-way over the stream. I saw some monsters there, nearly destitute of branches, and scarcely diminishing in diameter for eighty or ninety feet.|$|R

While the Burmese now claimed the upper Tenasserim <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> to Tavoy, their hold of Lower Burma was still tenuous and especially in the southernmost Tenasserim coast it was largely nominal. Indeed, once Konbaung armies returned north in 1758 for their expeditions in Manipur and northern Shan States, the Mon of Lower Burma rose in rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Internal struggles {{over the}} control of the Ayutthayan (Siam) throne between the Suphannaphum Dynasty and the Uthong Dynasty culminated on 1546, after the death of king Chairacha. Chairacha's {{successor}} Yot Fa was killed in 1548, with conspirator Khun Chinnarat taking the throne. 42 days later Chinnarat was assassinated by nobles loyal to the Suphannaphum Dynasty, who installed Chairacha's relative as King Maha Chakkraphat. Tabinshwehti exploited the internal turmoil in Ayutthaya by instigating the first conflict between the two countries. The Burmese–Siamese War (1547–49) resulted in the Burmese capture of the Upper Tenasserim <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> to Tavoy, while Ayutthaya managed to protect the rest of its territory.|$|E

25|$|The {{county has}} a mixed economy. An {{important}} part of the economy is based on tourism: many visitors are attracted by the many beaches and the mountains. A significant part of the county lies within the Snowdonia National Park, which extends from the north <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> to the district of Merioneth in the south; it is much larger than Snowdonia proper. But tourism provides seasonal employment and thus {{there is a shortage of}} jobs in the winter. Another problem with tourism is the demand that it creates for second homes. This pushes house prices out of reach of local people, to the detriment of the position of the Welsh language in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{control of}} Tenasserim coast (present-day Mon State and Taninthayi Region in Myanmar) {{in the early}} 18th century was divided between Burma and Siam, with the Burmese {{controlling}} down to Tavoy (Dawei) and the Siamese controlling the rest. Throughout history, both kingdoms had claimed the entire coast--(the Siamese to Martaban, and the Burmese to Junkceylon), and control had changed hands several times. The Burmese Pagan Dynasty controlled the entire coast until 1287. Throughout 14th and 16th centuries, Siamese kingdoms (first Sukhothai, later Ayutthaya) controlled much of the coast, up to just south of present-day Mawlamyaing. In the mid-16th century, the Burmese under Toungoo kings Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung tried to regain the coast, first failing in 1548, and finally succeeding in 1564 when they conquered all of Siam for the first time. The Siamese revolted in 1584, and under their king Naresuan regained the lower coast by 1593 and the entire coast by 1594. The Burmese retook the upper <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> to Tavoy in 1615 but failed to recover the rest.|$|E

25|$|In {{the colonial}} era, before 1776, {{the west was}} of high {{priority}} for settlers and politicians. The American frontier began when Jamestown, Virginia was settled by the English in 1607. In {{the earliest days of}} European settlement of the Atlantic <b>coast,</b> <b>down</b> to about 1680, the frontier was essentially any part of the interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the Atlantic coast. English, French, Spanish and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different. Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada; these habitants settled in villages along the St. Lawrence River, building communities that remained stable for long stretches; they did not simply jump west the way the British did. Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and mid-west region they seldom settled down. French settlement was limited to a few very small villages such as Kaskaskia, Illinois as well as a larger settlement around New Orleans. Likewise, the Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River valley, followed by large grants of land to rich landowning patroons who brought in tenant farmers who created compact, permanent villages. They created a dense rural settlement in upstate New York, but they did not push westward.|$|E

He claimed that upon investigation he discovered that small nuts and screws had been dropped into the gearbox, which had smashed a gear. Rolls claimed that this [...] "was a common trick abroad" [...] but voiced surprise at it happening in an English race. There was further speculation of foul play when {{it was discovered that}} Arnott's Minerva had been tampered with; two spark plugs had been smashed and an air valve bent, causing his engine to overheat.
