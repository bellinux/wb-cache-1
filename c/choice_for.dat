5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> everyday use.

The red onion (called purple in some European countries) is a good <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E

40|$|A growing {{stream of}} {{research}} is investigating how <b>choices</b> people make <b>for</b> themselves are different from <b>choices</b> people make <b>for</b> others. In this paper, I propose that these choices vary according to regulatory focus, such that people who make <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> themselves are prevention focused, whereas people who make <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> others are promotion focused. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, in particular work on errors of omission and commission, I hypothesize that people who make <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> others experience {{a reversal of the}} choice overload effect. In 6 studies, including a field study, I found that people who make <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> themselves are less satisfied after selecting among many options compared to few options, yet, people who make <b>choices</b> <b>for</b> others are more satisfied after selecting among many options compared to few options. Implications and suggestions for other differences in self–other decision making are discussed...|$|R
