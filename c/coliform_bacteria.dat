The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place.

During the three months of spring and summer season in 2015 was performed in regular 14 - day's intervals of 6 milk sampling, always from two cows in large-capacity cow house and from two cows in family farm. In all of the samples was determined the total quantity of microorganism, enterococcus and <b>coliform</b> <b>bacterium</b> in two settings. Setting an overall quantity of microorganism gives the final quality of milk. The limit for fresh milk is, according to legislation, 100 000 KTJ/ml. This limit was not fulfilled by the first cow from the family farm in no case of all the settings. Overlimited CPM was found during the third setting by samples from family farm and large-capacity cow house by all of cows, too. In other cases of setting were samples suitable. Setting enterococcus. For these days cancelled norm was setting the same amount as by the <b>coliform</b> <b>bacterium,</b> i. e. 1000 KTJ/ml. The limit fulfilled samples from large-capacity cow house as well as the private farm in 4 of 6 settings. Setting a quantity of <b>coliform</b> <b>bacterium</b> points to faecal pollution. The norm CSN 57 0529 stated the limit of 1000 KTJ/ml for <b>coliform</b> <b>bacterium</b> in raw milk; now it is not valid and was not replaced with new one. If it is still valid, this limit would be fulfilled in case of samples from private farm in 3 cases, in two others would cross the limit slightly and in the last setting the contamination is well over the limit. The effect of cow housing was proved, there were differences between individual samplings from the same cow house.
