40|$|The {{genesis of}} new cells, {{especially}} of neurons, {{in the adult}} human brain is currently of great scientific interest. In order to measure neurogenesis in animals new born cells are labelled with specific markers such as BrdU; in brain sections these can later be analyzed and counted through the microscope. So far, the image analysis has been performed by hand. In this work, we present an algorithm to automatically segment the digital brain section picture into cell and noncell components, giving a count {{of the number of}} cells in the section. This is done by first training a so-called <b>cell</b> <b>classifier</b> with <b>cell</b> and non-cell patches in a supervised manner. This <b>cell</b> <b>classifier</b> can later be used in an arbitrary number of sections by scanning the section and choosing maxima of this <b>classifier</b> as <b>cell</b> center locations. For training, single- and multi-layer perceptrons were used. In preliminary experiments, we get good performance of the classifier...|$|R

We show how to use the confusion matrix to obtain an unbiased estimate of the desired proportions. We show that the mean square error of this estimate depends on a 'befuddlement matrix' derived from the confusion matrix, and how this, in turn, leads to a figure of merit for <b>cell</b> <b>classifiers.</b> Finally, we work out the two-class problem in detail and present examples to illustrate the theory...|$|R

40|$|Human Embryonic Stem Cells (HESCs) are {{promising}} {{for the treatment}} of many diseases and for toxicological testing. There is a great interest among biologists to automatically determine the number of various types of cells in a population of mixed morphologies. This study addresses quantification of non-dynamic blebbing single unattached human embryonic stem cells (NDBSU-HESCs) that are in suspension and do not show evidence of blebbing. Current image processing methods are inadequate for detecting these cells in real time.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} an algorithm {{to build}} a semisupervised learning framework for detecting cells. The cell candidates are represented as extremal regions drawn from a hierarchical image representation. Training a <b>classifier</b> for <b>cell</b> detection using supervised approaches relies on {{a large amount of}} training data, which requires a lot of effort and time. We propose a semisupervised approach to reduce this burden. The set of extremal regions is generated using a maximally stable extremal region (MSER) detector. A subset of nonoverlapping regions with high similarity to the cells of interest is selected. Using the tree built from the MSER detector, we develop a novel differentiable unsupervised loss term that enforces the nonoverlapping constraint with the learned function. Our algorithm requires very few examples of cells with simple dot annotations for training. The supervised and unsupervised losses are embedded in a Bayesian framework for probabilistic learning...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{algorithm}} to detect occlusion for visual tracking through learning with observation likelihoods. In our technique, target {{is divided into}} regular grid cells {{and the state of}} occlusion is determined for each <b>cell</b> using a <b>classifier.</b> Each <b>cell</b> in the target is associated with many small patches, and the patch likelihoods observed during tracking construct a feature vector, which is used for classification. Since the occlusion is learned with patch likelihoods instead of patches themselves, the classifier is universally applicable to any videos or objects for occlusion reasoning. Our occlusion detection algorithm has decent performance in accuracy, which is sufficient to improve tracking performance significantly. The proposed algorithm can be combined with many generic tracking methods, and we adopt L 1 minimization tracker to test the performance of our framework. The advantage of our algorithm is supported by quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and successful tracking and occlusion reasoning results are illustrated in many challenging video sequences. 1...|$|R

The union of the two provides a complete description of the environment over time.

At first sight, it seems impossible to define with this paradigm a consistent <b>classifier</b> as no <b>cell</b> knows the "original data size", $n$. However, we show that this is not so by exhibiting two different consistent classifiers. The consistency is universal but is only shown for distributions with nonatomic marginals...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{of the results}} obtained from a <b>cell</b> <b>classifier</b> which is confronted with an abnormal/normal cell ratio which {{is different from the}} ratio assumed in the calibration of the classifier. False negative and false positive error rates are determined in advance for classifier operation, along with the necessary sample size in order to validate the predicted distributions. Changes are demonstrated to happen only regarding the false negative rate, where reductions in the abnormal cell rate below the expected rates would cause totally unreliable data. Substantial overproduction of abnormal cells would be quickly noticeable, while production rates beyond, but close to, the expected rates would only require more extensive sampling. Classifier systems for 10 % proportions of abnormal cells are concluded to be possible, but difficulties are present with much lower rate...|$|R
40|$|In {{the pattern}} {{recognition}} literature, Huang and Suen introduced the “multinomial” rule for fusion of multiple classifiers {{under the name}} of Behavior Knowledge Space (BKS) method [1]. This classifier fusion method can provide very good performances if large and representative data sets are available. Otherwise over fitting is likely to occur, and the generalization error quickly increases. In spite of this crucial small sample size problem, analytical models of BKS generalization error are currently not available. In this paper, the generalization error of BKS method is analysed, and a simple analytical model that relates error to sample size is proposed. In addition, a strategy for improving performances by using linear <b>classifiers</b> in “ambiguous” <b>cells</b> of BKS table is described.

40|$|One {{approach}} to detecting objects in greyscale scenes is {{to design the}} computational process itself rather than probability distributions (generative modeling) or decision boundaries (predictive learning). The general idea is to construct a tree-structured representation of the space of object instantiations {{as well as a}} binary <b>classifier</b> for each <b>cell</b> in this hierarchical scaffold. This is highly efficient due to pruning groups of hypotheses simultaneously at all stages of processing. The emphasis in existing work has been on design and modeling. Our approach is more data-driven and focused on learning. In particular, we induce the hierarchy of shapes directly from training data, employ boosting to build the classifiers utilizing cell-dependent “negative” examples, and extend and adapt the hierarchy as new samples are encountered. The resulting generality is illustrated by applying the very same learning and parsing algorithms to detecting both rigid and deformable shapes. 1...|$|R

This method produces a consistent assessment of treatment-induced phenotypes across experiments done by different biologists and highlights {{the prevalence of}} nonuniform and concentration-dependent cellular response to treatment. Contrasting cell phenotypes from high-content screening to kinase selectivity profiles from cell-free assays highlights the limited utility of enzyme potency ratios in understanding the mechanism of action for cell-cycle kinase inhibitors.

40|$|Recognition of {{the blood}} cell types is of great {{importance}} due to its high clinical diagnostic applications. Here, a method based on PCA followed by Bayesian classification, for identification of blood cells has been introduced. We have modified the work by Turk and Pentland on face recognition and extended it to cell recognition. Their method uses the standard method of eigenvector selection. Also only monochrome images have been considered and the method is not tolerant enough to geometrical changes. Here the idea has been extended to colour patterns. We pre-processe the images adjusting their size and rotation, with fast methods. The eigencells are selected based on minimisation of similarities among various sets and finally a <b>classifier</b> identifies the <b>cell</b> types {{by looking at the}} three-fold intensity-colour information. This overcomes many problems in cell classification where either certain cells are recognised or some constraints such as geometrical variations are incorporated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A new {{approach}} {{for the detection}} of the road surface and obstacles is presented. The high accuracy of the method allows the detection of traffic isles as distinct class. The 3 D data inferred from dense stereo are transformed into a rectangular Digital Elevation Map (DEM). Two classifiers are proposed: density-based and road surface-based. The density-based obstacle <b>classifier</b> marks DEM <b>cells</b> as road or obstacles, using the density of 3 D points as criterion. A quadratic road surface model is initially fitted, by a RANSAC approach, to the region in front of the ego vehicle. A region growing-like process refines this primary solution, driven by the 3 D uncertainty model of the stereo sensor. A robust global solution for the road surface is obtained. The road surface is used for discrimination between road, traffic isle and obstacle points. Fusion and error filtering is performed on the results of the two classifiers. The proposed real-time algorithm was evaluated in an urban scenario and can be used in complex applications, from collision avoidance to path planning.

40|$|Normal {{cells in}} the {{presence}} of a precancerous lesion undergo subtle changes of their DNA distribution when observed by visible microscopy. These changes have been termed Malignancy Associated Changes (MACs). Using statistical models such as neural networks and discriminant functions it is possible to design classifiers that can separate these objects from truly normal cells. The correct classification rate using feed‐forward neural networks is compared to linear discriminant analysis when applied to detecting MACs. Classifiers were designed using 53 nuclear features calculated from images for each of 25, 360 normal appearing cells taken from 344 slides diagnosed as normal or containing severe dysplasia. A linear discriminant function achieved a correct classification rate of 61. 6 % on the test data while neural networks scored as high as 72. 5 % on a cell‐by‐cell basis. The <b>cell</b> <b>classifiers</b> were applied to a library of 93, 494 cells from 395 slides, and the results were jackknifed using a single slide feature.

30|$|The {{framework}} of object detection with HOG and color features {{is illustrated by}} the block diagram in Fig.  1 c. It consists of separate training and testing phases. In the training phase, we trained two separate SVMs to detect cells from background and to identify the detected cells as T-cells or B-cells. First using the dataset that is generated from the dual dyed images, a linear-kernel SVM is trained to detect cells from background. Then, the images that is dyed with only singe dye is exhaustively searched using sliding window method, finding HOG for each window and classified by the first SVM. Found cells then used for their color information to train a Radial Basis Function (RBF)-kernel SVM [21] to identify T-cells from B-cells. Although RBF-SVM is timewise costly, it gives better accuracy. In the testing phase, unseen images are scanned with sliding window and HOG features are generated from the position of each window in the image. These features are classified as cell or background with the linear SVM <b>classifier,</b> then classified <b>cells</b> are further processed to get the color information and classified as T-cells or B-cells using the RBF SVM.|$|R
40|$|Many {{biological}} pathways {{were first}} uncovered by identifying mutants with visible phenotypes and by scoring every sample in a screen via tedious and subjective visual inspection. Now, automated image analysis can effectively score many phenotypes. In practical application, customizing an image-analysis algorithm or finding {{a sufficient number}} of example cells to train a machine learning algorithm can be infeasible, particularly when positive control samples are not available and the phenotype of interest is rare. Here we present a supervised machine learning approach that uses iterative feedback to readily score multiple subtle and complex morphological phenotypes in high-throughput, image-based screens. First, automated cytological profiling extracts hundreds of numerical descriptors for every cell in every image. Next, the researcher generates a rule (i. e., <b>classifier)</b> to recognize <b>cells</b> with a phenotype of interest during a short, interactive training session using iterative feedback. Finally, all of the cells in the experiment are automatically classified and each sample is scored based on the presence of cells displaying the phenotype.

40|$|Cisplatin {{resistance}} in {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) reduces survival. In this study we hypothesized that methylation of key genes mediates cisplatin resistance. We determined whether a demethylating drug, decitabine, could augment the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of cisplatin on SCC- 25 /CP, a cisplatin-resistant tongue SCC cell line. We showed that decitabine treatment restored cisplatin sensitivity in SCC- 25 /CP and significantly reduced the cisplatin dose required to induce apoptosis. We then created a xenograft model with SCC- 25 /CP and determined that decitabine and cisplatin combination treatment resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth and mechanical allodynia compared to control. To establish a gene classifier we quantified methylation in cancer tissue of cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant HNSCC patients. Cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant patient tumors had distinct methylation profiles. When we quantified methylation and expression of genes in the <b>classifier</b> in HNSCC <b>cells</b> in vitro, we showed that decitabine treatment of cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cells reversed methylation and gene expression toward a cisplatin-sensitive profile. The study provides direct evidence that decitabine restores cisplatin sensitivity in in vitro and in vivo models of HNSCC. Combination treatment of cisplatin and decitabine significantly reduces HNSCC growth and HNSCC pain. Furthermore, gene methylation {{could be used as}} a biomarker of cisplatin-resistance...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to examine {{different}} machine learning techniques for predicting chemotherapy response in cell lines and patients based on genetic expression. After trying regression, multi-class classification techniques and binary classification {{it was concluded that}} binary classification was the best method for training models due to the limited size of available cell line data. We found support vector machine <b>classifiers</b> trained on <b>cell</b> line data were easier to use and produced better results compared to neural networks. Sequential backward feature selection was able to select genes for the models that produced good results, however the greedy algorithm has limitations. We found that genetic algorithms and simulated annealing were able to select genes that produced better results on both cell lines and patients. We found that combining cell line data sets from different types of cancers produced models that performed well at predicting outcome in cell lines and in patients, indicating that the method of action of chemotherapy drugs is similar across different types of cancer. The use of cell line trained machine learning models to predict patient chemotherapy response shows great promise, however future studies need to acquire larger cell line data sets and find better ways of evaluating the transfer of predictive ability of cell line trained models to patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High content {{screening}} (HCS) is {{a powerful}} method for the exploration of cellular signalling and morphology that is rapidly being adopted in cancer research. HCS uses automated microscopy to collect images of cultured cells. The images are subjected to segmentation algorithms to identify cellular structures and quantitate their morphology, for hundreds to millions of individual cells. However, image analysis may be imperfect, especially for "HCS-unfriendly" cell lines whose morphology is not well handled by current image segmentation algorithms. We asked if segmentation errors were common for a clinically relevant cell line, if such errors had measurable effects on the data, and if HCS data could be improved by automated identification of well-segmented cells. Results Cases of poor cell body segmentation occurred frequently for the SK-BR- 3 cell line. We trained classifiers to identify SK-BR- 3 cells that were well segmented. On an independent test set created by human review of cell images, our optimal support-vector machine <b>classifier</b> identified well-segmented <b>cells</b> with 81 % accuracy. The dose responses of morphological features were measurably different in well- and poorly-segmented populations. Elimination of the poorly-segmented cell population increased the purity of DNA content distributions, while appropriately retaining biological heterogeneity, and simultaneously increasing our ability to resolve specific morphological changes in perturbed cells. Conclusion Image segmentation has a measurable impact on HCS data. The application of a multivariate shape-based filter to identify well-segmented cells improved HCS data quality for an HCS-unfriendly cell line, and could be a valuable post-processing step for some HCS datasets. </p...|$|R

To this end we combined 32 cases (350 - 400 Feulgen-stained nuclei analyzed per case) in a data file, which was then subjected to principal component and canonical analyses. We found considerable heterogeneity within the cell nucleus population of Ewing's sarcomas. Indeed, after the arbitrary subdivision of the file into two <b>cell</b> <b>classifiers</b> (CC 1 and CC 2 cell types) {{on the basis of the}} first canonical function, the 32 Ewing's sarcomas showed a great deal of variability in the proportion of CC 1 and CC 2 cell nucleus types. The nuclei of the CC 1 type had a more finely textured chromatin when compared to the CC 2 type, the nuclei of which exhibited a more granular chromatin pattern. Additionally, these 32 Ewing's sarcomas were characterized by three distinct DNA histogram types. Eight tumors displayed a diploid nonproliferating DNA histogram pattern (type A), 11 a diploid proliferating (type B) and 13 an aneuploid (type C) DNA histogram profile. We found a highly significant relationship between these DNA histogram types and the CC 1 :CC 2 cell type percentage ratio. The eight Ewing's sarcomas with a type A DNA histogram contained a significantly higher proportion of CC 1 cell type nuclei as compared to the 13 tumors with a type C DNA histogram, which contained a great proportion of CC 2 cell type nuclei.

Design, setting, and participants CRCs were established from seven patient samples with disease ranging from primary PCa to advanced castration-resistant PCa (CRPC).

40|$|Genetic {{variants}} in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting regulators commonly {{influence the}} quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription. Recent interest in expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping has paralleled the adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) {{for the analysis of}} complex traits and disease in humans. Under the hypothesis that many GWAS associations tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and that these SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression, it has become common to interpret GWAS associations using eQTL data. To exploit the mechanistic interpretability of eQTL-GWAS comparisons, an improved understanding of the genetic architecture and cell type specificity of eQTLs is required. We address this need by performing an eQTL analysis in four parts: first we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; next we quantified cell type specific eQTLs across the studies; then we integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data sets from the ENCODE project; finally we built a <b>classifier</b> to predict <b>cell</b> type specific eQTLs. Consistent with prior studies, we demonstrate that allelic heterogeneity is pervasive at cis-eQTLs and that cis-eQTLs are often cell type specific. Within and between cell type eQTL replication is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE element classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. Using a random forest classifier including 526 CRE data sets as features, we successfully predict the cell type specificity of eQTL SNPs in the absence of gene expression data from the cell type of interest. We anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{automatically}} detect {{certain types of}} cells or cellular subunits in microscopy images is of significant interest {{to a wide range}} of biomedical research and clinical practices. Cell detection methods have evolved from employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques to locate target cells. The essential idea of these methods is that their <b>cell</b> <b>classifiers</b> or detectors are trained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In this paper, we seek a different route and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) -based cell detection method that uses encoding of the output pixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is the sparsely labeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. Consequently, we employ random projections to encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN regresses this compressed vector from the input pixels. Using $L_ 1 $-norm optimization, we recover sparse cell locations on the output pixel space from the predicted compressed vector. In the past, output space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in conjunction with linear and non-linear predictors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output space encoding. We experimentally demonstrate that proposed CNN + CS framework (referred to as CNNCS) exceeds the accuracy of the state-of-the-art methods on many benchmark datasets for microscopy cell detection. Additionally, we show that CNNCS can exploit ensemble average by using more than one random encodings of the output space.

Live birth prediction analysis using machine learning algorithms (support vector machines) with performance estimation by leave-one-out cross validation and independent validation on an external data set. We defined a signature of 30 genes expressed in CC predictive of live birth. This live birth prediction model had an accuracy of 81 %, a sensitivity of 0. 83, a specificity of 0. 80, a positive predictive value of 0. 77, and a negative predictive value of 0. 86. Receiver operating characteristic analysis found an area under the curve of 0. 86, significantly greater than random chance. When applied on 3 external data sets with the end-point outcome measure of blastocyst formation, the signature resulted in 62 %, 75 % and 88 % accuracy, respectively.
