40|$|BACKGROUND: The recent {{development}} of automated <b>cough</b> monitors has enabled objective assessment of <b>cough</b> frequency. A study was undertaken {{to determine whether}} short-duration recordings(< 6 h) accurately reflect 24 -h <b>cough</b> frequency and to investigate their responsiveness. METHODS: One hundred adults with chronic <b>cough</b> underwent 24 -h <b>cough</b> frequency monitoring with the Leicester <b>Cough</b> Monitor and completed <b>cough</b> visual analog scales (VASs) and the Leicester <b>Cough</b> Questionnaire (LCQ). <b>Cough</b> recordings were analyzed using customized software to derive <b>cough</b> frequencies from 1 to 6 h and 24 -h recordings. Responsiveness was assessed with repeat assessments following therapeutic trials. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) 24 -h <b>cough</b> frequency was 11. 5 (5. 8 - 26. 6) coughs/h. Four hours was considered the shortest recording duration that represented 24 -h <b>cough</b> frequency(ρ= 0. 9, P ≤. 001). Median 4 -h <b>cough</b> frequency was 16. 6 (7. 3 - 36. 8) coughs/h. Both 4 -h and 24 -h <b>cough</b> frequency correlated moderately with <b>cough</b> VAS (ρ= 0. 49, P ≤. 01 and ρ= 0. 44, P ≤. 01) and LCQ (ρ = - 0. 48, P ≤. 01; ρ = - 0. 50, P ≤. 01). Four-hour <b>cough</b> frequency was responsive to improvements in <b>cough</b> severity following trials of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Four-hour <b>cough</b> frequency correlates highly with 24 -h <b>cough</b> frequency recordings and relates equally well with subjective measures in chronic <b>cough.</b> Short-duration <b>cough</b> monitoring could be a practical tool to validate the presence of <b>cough</b> and assess response to trials of therapy in the clinic setting...|$|R

40|$|Early animal {{experiments}} on <b>cough</b> developed {{the concept that}} <b>cough</b> was an involuntary reflex controlled from areas in the brainstem and that <b>cough</b> could be inhibited by centrally acting medicines such as codeine. Studies on the voluntary control of <b>cough,</b> the urge to <b>cough</b> and the placebo effect of <b>cough</b> medicines have demonstrated that human <b>cough</b> {{is more complex than}} a brainstem reflex. The efficacy and mechanism of action of centrally acting <b>cough</b> medicines such as codeine and dextromethorphan is now in dispute, and codeine is no longer accepted as a gold-standard antitussive. This review puts forward a <b>cough</b> model that includes three types of cough: (1) reflex <b>cough,</b> caused by the presence of food or fluid in the airway – this type of <b>cough</b> is not under conscious control and can occur in the unconscious subject during general anaesthesia; (2) voluntary <b>cough</b> – under conscious control that is abolished with general anaesthesia; (3) <b>cough</b> in response to sensation of airway irritation – this type of <b>cough</b> causes an urge to <b>cough</b> that initiates voluntary <b>cough</b> and may only be present in the conscious subject. The review proposes that human <b>cough</b> associated with respiratory disease is under conscious control and is mainly related to a sensation of airway irritation and an urge to <b>cough</b> (type 3). The review discusses the summation of sensory input from the airway in a brainstem integrator that reaches a threshold to cause reflex <b>cough.</b> Subthreshold conditions in the <b>cough</b> integrator may be perceived as an urge to <b>cough</b> that is under voluntary control. The <b>cough</b> model presented in the review has implications for the development of <b>cough</b> medicines as it indicates that the older view of <b>cough</b> medicines acting in the brainstem area to inhibit the <b>cough</b> reflex may need to be revised to include conscious control of <b>cough</b> as an important mechanism of <b>cough</b> in man...|$|R

5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay.

If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Cough</b> {{intensity}} {{is an important}} determinant of <b>cough</b> severity reported by patients. <b>Cough</b> sound analysis has been widely validated for the measurement of <b>cough</b> frequency but few studies have validated its use {{in the assessment of}} <b>cough</b> strength. We investigated the relationship between <b>cough</b> sound and physiological measures of <b>cough</b> strength. METHODS: 32 patients with chronic <b>cough</b> and controls underwent contemporaneous measurements of voluntary <b>cough</b> sound, flow and oesophageal pressure. Sound power, peak energy, rise-time, duration, peak-frequency, bandwidth and centroid-frequency were assessed and compared with physiological measures. The relationship between sound and subjective <b>cough</b> strength Visual Analogue Score (VAS), the repeatability of <b>cough</b> sounds and the effect of microphone position were also assessed. RESULTS: Sound power and energy correlated strongly with <b>cough</b> flow (median Spearman's r= 0. 87 - 0. 88) and oesophageal pressure (median Spearman's r= 0. 89). Sound power and energy correlated strongly with <b>cough</b> strength VAS (median Spearman's r= 0. 84 - 0. 86) and were highly repeatable (intraclass correlation coefficient= 0. 93 - 0. 94) but both were affected by change in microphone position.

40|$|<b>Cough</b> is {{a common}} problem in children. Acute <b>cough</b> lasts less than 3 weeks, {{subacute}} 3 – 8 weeks and chronic <b>cough</b> more than 8 weeks.

However, the child should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out a serious underlying condition or disease responsible for the <b>cough.</b> The commonest cause of subacute <b>cough</b> is a viral infection (postinfectious <b>cough)</b> and it usually resolves spontaneously. If the child is otherwise well and the <b>cough</b> is dry {{and there are no}} specific alerts for a serious disease and the <b>cough</b> is resolving, a period of observation is all that is recommended.

In addition, IPF <b>cough</b> rates were related to measures of physiological disease severity and compared to <b>cough</b> rates in health and other respiratory conditions. Methods Nineteen IPF patients, mean age 70. 8 years ± 8. 6, five female (26. 3 %) were studied. Subjects performed full pulmonary function testing, 24 hour ambulatory <b>cough</b> recordings, completed a <b>cough</b> related quality of life questionnaire (Leicester <b>Cough</b> Questionnaire) and subjectively scored <b>cough</b> severity with a visual analogue scale. Ambulatory <b>cough</b> recordings were manually counted and reported as number of <b>coughs</b> per hour. Results The 24 hr <b>cough</b> rates were high (median 9. 4, range 1. 5 - 39. 4), with day time rates much higher than night time (median 14. 6, range 1. 9 - 56. 6 compared to 1. 9, range 0 - 19. 2, p = 0. 003). Strong correlations were found between objective <b>cough</b> frequency and both the VAS (day r = 0. 80, p Conclusions This study confirms objectively that <b>cough</b> is a major, very distressing and disabling symptom in IPF patients. The strong correlations between objective <b>cough</b> counts and <b>cough</b> related quality of life measures suggest that in IPF patient's, perception of <b>cough</b> frequency is very accurate. </p...|$|R
