25|$|Calendar rules may set a {{standard}} number of days, specifying that (depending on a woman's past cycle lengths) the first three to six days of each menstrual cycle are considered infertile. Or, a calendar rule may require calculation, for example holding that {{the length of the}} pre-ovulatory infertile phase is equal to the length of a woman's shortest cycle minus 21 days. Rather than being tied to <b>cycle</b> <b>length,</b> a calendar rule may be determined from the cycle day on which a woman observes a thermal shift. One system has the length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase equal to a woman's earliest historical day of temperature rise minus seven days.|$|E
25|$|Calendar-based methods use {{records of}} past menstrual cycles {{to predict the}} length of future cycles. However, {{the length of the}} pre-ovulatory phase can vary significantly, {{depending}} on the woman's typical <b>cycle</b> <b>length,</b> stress factors, medication, illness, menopause, breastfeeding, and whether she is just coming off hormonal contraception. If a woman with previously regular cycles has a delayed ovulation due to one of these factors, she will still be fertile when the method tells her she is in the post-ovulatory infertile phase. If she has an unusually early ovulation, calendar-based methods will indicate she is still in the pre-ovulatory infertile phase when she has actually become fertile.|$|E

25|$|Overt {{hyperthyroidism}} {{is associated}} with accelerated bone remodeling (resulting in increased porosity of cortical bone and reduced volume of trabecular bone), a generally reduced bone density, osteoporosis, {{and an increase in}} fracture rate.

40|$|This article {{concerns}} the {{time series analysis}} of jitter. Jitter involves small fluctuations in glottal <b>cycle</b> <b>lengths.</b> Time series analysis is the statistical processing of data that are recorded {{over a period of}} time. Conventionally, the amount of jitter in an analysis interval is estimated by a measure of dispersion of the glottal <b>cycle</b> <b>lengths.</b> The problem is that measures of dispersion only describe the fluctuations in the <b>cycle</b> <b>lengths</b> unambiguously when these are statistically independent. This means that the fluctuations are white noise and that changing the order of the cycles does not change their statistical properties. But it can be shown experimentally that neighbouring <b>cycle</b> <b>lengths</b> are not statistically independent because they are correlated. We therefore studied jitter by means of time series analysis methods. These dispense with the assumption that glottal <b>cycle</b> <b>lengths</b> are statistically independent. They make it possible to distinguish between mean- and short-term perturbations and to remove correlations between neighbouring perturbations. We studied dispersion measures of raw and whitened jitter (i. e. jitter from which correlations had been removed). Jitter time series were obtained from vowels [a], [i], [u] sustained by male and female healthy and dysphonic speakers. Results showed that the inter-speaker differences were smaller for whitened jitter than for raw jitter. Inter-speaker variability was reduced because time series analysis separated random from non-random perturbations. © 1995 Academic Press Limited. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
500|$|Russo & Russo {{from the}} Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia {{conducted}} a study in 1980 examining the proposed correlation between abortion and breast cancer. While analysing {{the effects of the}} carcinogen 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) on the DNA labeling index (DNA-LI) in terminal end buds (TEBs), terminal ducts (TDs) and alveolar buds (ABs) of Sprague-Dawley rats in various stages of reproductive development, they found that rats who had interrupted pregnancies had no noticeable increase in risk for cancer. However, they did find that pregnancy and lactation provided a protective measure against various forms of benign lesions, such as hyperplastic alveolar nodules and cysts. While results did suggest that rats who had interrupted pregnancies might be subject to [...] "similar or even higher incidence of benign lesions" [...] than virgin rats, there was no evidence to suggest that abortion would result in a higher incidence of carcinogenesis. [...] A more thorough examination of the phenomenon was conducted in 1982, confirming the results. A later study in 1987 further explained their previous findings. After differentiation of the mammary gland resulting from a full-term pregnancy of the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and the cell <b>cycle</b> <b>length</b> increases, allowing more time for DNA repair.|$|E
