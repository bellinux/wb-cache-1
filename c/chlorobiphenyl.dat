In contrast to HepG 2 hepatocarcinoma cells, HeLa cervical carcinoma cells showed significantly lower levels of CYP 1 A 1 mRNA expression following PCB 126 exposure. Our results show that the two cell lines maintained differences in the chromatin architecture along the CYP 1 A 1 promoter region.

MDGC/ECD is recommended as the most suitable technique for direct determination of these CBs, without a liquid chromatographic (LC) pre-separation of mono-ortho CBs from the other CBs. Dependent, to some extent, on the stationary phase used, single-column determinations of these CBs easily yield too high results due to the presence of interferences. The contribution of the mono-ortho CBs studied to the total 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents (TEQs) from CBs in fish is highly dependent on the toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) used and varies between 0. 02 and 22 %. This contribution is mainly due to CBs 74, 114, 157 and 167 which may easily be determined by taking three heart-cuts and combining them into one MDGC/ECD run.

40|$|Unicellular {{protozoan}} grazers {{represent a}} size class of organisms where a transition in {{the mechanism of}} <b>chlorobiphenyl</b> (CB) introduction, from diffusion through surface membranes to ingestion of contaminated prey, could occur. This study compares {{the relative importance of}} these two processes in the overall uptake of polychlorinated biphenyls by protists. Uptake rates and steady-state concentrations were compared in laboratory cultures of grazing and nongrazing protozoa. These experiments were conducted with a 10 -μm marine scuticociliate (Uronema sp.), bacterial prey (Halomonas halodurans), and a suite of 21 CB congeners spanning a range of aqueous solubilities. The dominant pathway of CB uptake by both grazing and nongrazing protozoa was diffusion. Organic-carbon-normalized CB concentrations (in the protozoan cell) were equivalent in grazing and nongrazing protozoa for all congeners studied. Rate constants for uptake into and loss from the protozoan cell were independently determined by using [3, 3 ′, 4, 4 ′- 14 C]tetrachlorobiphenyl (IUPAC no. 77), 0. 38 ± 0. 03 min− 1 and (1. 1 ± 0. 1) × 10 − 5 (g of organic carbon) − 1 min− 1, respectively. Magnitudes of the uptake and loss processes were calculated and compared by using a numerical model. The model result was consistent with data from the bioaccumulation experiment and supported the hypothesis that diffusive uptake is faster than ingestive uptake in phagotrophic unicellular protozoa...|$|E
40|$|Polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) mixtures {{and individual}} <b>chlorobiphenyl</b> (CB) congeners have various endocrine-disrupting effects, but ultimate responses may be altered by concurrent effects on enzyme levels and enzyme activities. The toxicodynamics of estrogenic PCBs and metabolites {{have been studied}} in vitro, but nonlinear dose-response relationships in vivo suggest that tests must integrate toxicokinetic parameters to explain whole-animal responses. To determine if any such interactions occurred, relatively large doses were subdivided into different treatment regimens for immature female Sprague-Dawley rats. Aroclor 1242 was uterotropic when 120 mg/kg (total) was administered (intraperitoneally) in two, three or five doses. CB 47 (2, 2 ', 4, 4 '-tetraCB) and CB 153 (2, 2 ', 4, 4 ', 5, 5 '-hexaCB) increased absolute uterine weights at 30 mg/kg on days 20 and 21. Results at 25 days in rats that received zero, two, three or five doses between days 20 and 24 were much more variable due to changes in tissue responsiveness and/or toxicokinetic interactions. In rats receiving treatment for 5 days, pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) activity was inversely related to CB serum residues; in rats receiving CB 153 for 2 days, PROD activity was directly related to serum residues. It was not clear whether PROD activity {{was the cause of}} or a reflection of lower serum residues; however, nonplanar CBs are better substrates for PROD than are planar CBs, and the longer-term dosing may enhance metabolism and excretion, changing the biological effects observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{separation}} {{space in}} gas chromatography {{can be enhanced}} dramatically by the comprehensive coupling of two independent separation dimensions. An interface between the two columns must accumulate analytes eluting from the first dimension, focus them and at the appropriate moment transfer them {{to the head of}} the second column. A thermal desorption modulator can be used for this purpose, It consists of a capillary in a relatively cold zone which effects trapping and focusing of the analytes, A current through a conductive material on the outside of the capillary Provides rapid heating and consequently a fast transfer of the analytes to the second column. Several conductive materials were applied using different techniques and their performance was evaluated. The durability of thin metal coatings was found insufficient The use of a wire coiled around the capillary was more robust and its temperature response appeared to be fast enough, despite the higher thermal mass, The effect of voltage and heating time on the thermal desorption was studied and various temperature estimations were made Large-volume on-column re-injection and semi-comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography of <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> are shown as examples...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of chlorinated biphenyls (CBs), 1, 1 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) - 2, 2 -dichloroethene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and the methylsulfonyl metabolites of CBs (MeSO(2) -CBs) and DDE (MeSO(2) -DDE) were determined in human plasma samples {{and in the}} fractions obtained by ultracentrifugation of plasma into very-low-density (VLDL), low-density (LDL), high-density (HDL) lipoprotein and lipoprotein depleted (LPDP) fractions (containing primarily albumin). The {{concentrations of}} triacylglycerols, cholesterol, phospholipids, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) were determined. The organochlorine compounds were associated with all fractions, but predominantly with the LPDP fraction. On an average 44 % of CBs, 61 % of MeSO(2) -CBs, 73 % of DDE, 77 % of MeSO(2) -DDE, and 45 % of HCB were distributed in the LPDP fraction. A tendency to greater association of 3 -methylsulfonyl substituted than of corresponding 4 -methylsulfonyl substituted <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> to the LPDP fraction was noticed. Among the lipoprotein fractions, LDL was the main carrier of HCB, DDE and CBs. MeSO(2) -DDE was predominantly found in HDL and MeSO(2) -CBs were distributed equally among the LDL and HDL fractions. Calculating the concentrations of organochlorine compounds {{in relation to the}} content of apoB, the levels were about 10 times higher in VLDL than in LDL...|$|R
40|$|Individual <b>chlorobiphenyls</b> (CBs) and p,p 2 ̆ 7 -DDE were {{determined}} in solution and suspension in surface transects {{of the open}} Mediterranean Sea in 1987. Large volumes of sea water (1400 — 1700 dm 3) were analyzed. Concentrations of CBs were low in solution (< 5 pg/dm 3) and in suspension (< 60 pg/dm 3). Values for their sum (XCB) were 1. 7 - 43. 9 and 190 - 615 pg/dm 3, respectively. Compositions of the CB mixtures in solution {{as well as those}} in suspension were very similar in the various transects, but considerable differences were present between solution and suspension in each transect. It was attempted to interpret these differences in terms of molecular characteristics (octanol-water distribution coefficients, Kaw). The resulting plots of log Kovl vs. the apparent distribution coefficient (log K&) gave evidence for the uptake of CBs by suspended particles, followed by sedimentation out of the surface layer. Concentrations in solution were much lower (1 - 2 orders of magnitude) than those reported before. This may result from improvements in the sampling and analytical techniques. No clear evidence for significant local sources of these compounds was detected in the surface waters, as the levels in solution were very similar to the very low concentrations in the adjacent open Atlantic...|$|R
