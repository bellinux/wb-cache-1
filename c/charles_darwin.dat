5|$|After <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin</b> {{published}} Origin of Species in 1859, much of {{the focus}} of paleontology shifted to understanding evolutionary paths, including human evolution, and evolutionary theory.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, various {{professionals}} such as {{architects and}} scientists {{were living in}} Great Marlborough Street. Thomas Hardwick lived here between 1815–25, as did <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin</b> between 1837–8.|$|E

5|$|He also {{continued}} his critical {{work and in}} 1860 reviewed On the Origin of Species by <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin.</b> He {{was one of the}} few contemporary critics to be sympathetic to Darwin, although he was reluctant to show he was convinced of the theories.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin</b> {{explained}} homologous structures as {{meaning that}} the organisms concerned shared a body plan from a common ancestor, and that taxa were branches of a single tree of life.|$|E
5|$|Le Règne Animal was {{influential}} in being widely read, and in presenting accurate descriptions of groups of related animals, {{such as the}} living elephants and the extinct mammoths, providing convincing evidence for evolutionary change to readers including <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin,</b> although Cuvier himself rejected the possibility of evolution.|$|E

5|$|Natural selection, {{introduced}} in 1859 {{as the central}} mechanism of evolution by <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin,</b> is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals {{due to differences in}} phenotype. The mechanism directly implies evolution, a change in heritable traits of a population over time.|$|E
5|$|A free weekly parkrun {{takes place}} in the centre of Shrewsbury. The event is {{attended}} by over 250 runners every week and is 'twinned' with Darwin parkrun in Northern Territory, Australia due to the city of Darwin being named after <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin.</b> Shrewsbury has also seen activity in the physical discipline, Parkour.|$|E

5|$|Pet {{birds are}} kept in their millions, as are {{domestic}} fowls, bantams, and pigeons. These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin</b> took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.|$|E

50|$|The book, {{illustrated}} artistically by Abbott Thayer, {{sets out}} the controversial thesis that all animal coloration has the evolutionary purpose of camouflage. Thayer rejected <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwins</b> theory of sexual selection, arguing in words and paintings that even such conspicuous animal features as the peacocks tail or the brilliant pink of flamingoes or roseate spoonbills were effective as camouflage {{in the right}} light.|$|R
5|$|The {{book was}} many times republished and remains in print. It {{continues}} to be consulted by creationists. <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin</b> took its arguments seriously and responded to them; evolutionary biologists like Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins continue to discuss Paley's book to respond to modern proponents with similar ideas.|$|E
5|$|The giant ground sloth Megatherium is {{from the}} Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in South America, where <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin</b> had {{excavated}} some fossils in 1835. The model was built hugging a live tree which subsequently grew and broke the model's arm. The arm was replaced and later the tree died. This model {{used to be in}} the children's zoo which has now been demolished.|$|E
5|$|This naturalistic {{explanation}} fitted {{well with}} the recent account of evolution by Alfred Russel Wallace and <b>Charles</b> <b>Darwin,</b> as outlined in his famous 1859 book The Origin of Species. Because this Darwinian explanation required no supernatural forces, it met with considerable criticism from anti-evolutionists, both in academic circles and in the broader social realm.|$|E
