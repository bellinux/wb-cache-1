40|$|Coercion is an {{inferential}} {{process through}} which operator-argument conflicts are resolved {{in favor of the}} meaning of the operator, as when frame adverbials impose inchoative readings upon state-type predicates with which they are combined: The ambulance was there in a few minutes. De Swart (1998) represents such effects by means of implicit type-shifting operators that intervene between operator and argument, ensuring that the argument is of the appropriate type for the operator. This model is compositional insofar as it preserves the integrity of the functor-argument relationship, but the proposed mappings are mappings over sets of types, and as such reveal nothing about the contribution of the input lexical representation to the output representation, whether the output type is derived by coercion or by a morphosyntactically transparent type-shifting mechanism, e. g., the English Progressive. To remedy this problem, I propose that aspectual type-shifts are mappings from one Aktionsart representation to another, and that such mappings preserve input structure. This model employs two Aktionsart-based operations, permutation and concatenation, to represent both implicit and explicit aspectual type-shifts in English and French. In accordance with De Swart, I assume that coercion effects belong to linguistic interpretation, and are therefore uniformly traceable to clausal morphosyntax. For this reason, interpretations of Past and Present predications which cannot be predicted from the Aktionsart values of the entailed situation radicals, e. g., habitual, progressive, futurate and perfect readings of Present predications, are analyzed as coerced interpretations triggered by aspectual <b>concord</b> requirements <b>of</b> these <b>tenses...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{syntactic}} domain <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> is the clause: tense {{appears in}} some form in every clause <b>of</b> a <b>tensed</b> language. Semantic interpretation <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> requires information from context, however. This has been clear at least since Partee's 1984 demonstration of the anaphoric properties <b>of</b> <b>tense.</b> In this talk I will show that the facts about context are quite complex, perhaps more so than has been appreciated.

40|$|To acquire Sequence <b>of</b> <b>Tense</b> (temporal {{simultaneity}} {{between a}} matrix and an embedded past tense), {{there are two}} aspects the child has to learn: the structural nature {{of the relation between}} the two tenses and the nature <b>of</b> these <b>tenses</b> themselves. The goal of the present study is to see how Italian learners develop their interpretation <b>of</b> embedded <b>tenses,</b> in particular, if both these aspects are used by the learner in determining Sequence <b>of</b> <b>Tense,</b> or, if not, which comes in first. The nature of the structural relation is formulated as the Complementation Hypothesis; the nature of the contribution of the semantics <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> is laid down in the Imperfectivity Hypothesis. This work is an extension of the work of Hollebrandse (2000) on the acquisition <b>of</b> Sequence <b>of</b> <b>Tense</b> in Dutch, English and Japanese. This paper extends the set of languages under investigation to a Romance language, Italian. Furthermore, while Hollebrandse only looked at the acquisition of the structural nature <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> relations in Sequence <b>of</b> <b>Tense,</b> we have also examined the acquisition of the aspectual nature <b>of</b> the <b>tenses</b> in the present study. 1 Sequence <b>of</b> <b>Tense</b> in Italian Italian uses two different past tenses, the Imperfetto and the Passato Prossimo. 1 Sequence <b>of</b> <b>Tense</b> (a simultaneous reading) is expressed with an Imperfetto in the subordinate clause, (1 a). Readings in which the time of the complement clause is prior to the time of the main clause (real past readings) are expressed with a Passato Prossimo, (1 b). These readings are illustrated on a time line in (2). (1) a. Mario ha detto che Gianni mangiava una mela. simultaneous M. said that G. ate-IMP an apple 'Mario said that Gianni was eating an apple' b. Mario ha detto che Gianni ha mangiato una mela. real past M. said that G. has eaten an apple 'Mario said that Gianni ate an apple' 1 In fact, the Italian spoken in the region of Trieste where we tested our subjects uses these two past tenses.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} semantics <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> and the temporal interpretation <b>of</b> <b>tensed</b> and tenseless predicates in natural language. The central question {{we are concerned}} with is whether natural language employs explicit quantification over times in the object language. Our {{answer to the question}} is “yes, but to a limited extent. ” We argue (i) that the evaluation time <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> operators is represented by what we call the distinguished time variable, and (ii) that the event time <b>of</b> simple <b>tensed</b> predicates is represented by tense morphemes. Tense morphemes are analyzed as temporal variables that saturate the time argument slot of the predicates they are affixed to. As a consequence, the proposal implies that the event time <b>of</b> <b>tensed</b> predicates is realized in syntax as a temporal variable while the event time of tenseless predicates is not. Evidence for this distinction is provided from the temporal interpretation of nouns, differences between the temporal interpretations of relative clauses and participles, and cross-linguistic differences regarding the temporal interpretation of relative clauses. Evidence for explicit quantification over the evaluation times <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> operators is also provided from the <b>tense</b> interpretation <b>of</b> relative clauses, and from cross-linguistic differences regarding the distribution <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> and its interpretation in temporal adjunct clauses. ^ The introductory Chapter 1 presents background assumptions and reviews the previous literature. Cross-linguistic data regarding tense in relative clauses and temporal adjunct clauses are also introduced. Special attention is paid to a previously relatively unnoticed difference among languages that do not exhibit the so-called sequence <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> phenomena, such as Japanese, Polish, and Russian. In Chapter 2, a theory <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> is proposed that employs explicit quantification over times. The temporal interpretation of relative clauses and participle constructions in English, Japanese, Polish, and Russian is examined. Cross-linguistic differences are shown to follow from the proposed tense system and structural differences in relative clauses among these languages. Chapter 3 examines the distribution <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> and its interpretation in temporal adjunct clauses. Again, cross-linguistic differences are derived from our proposal regarding the tense system in conjunction with differences in the structure of temporal adjunct clauses. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{of this article}} involved an examination of theoretical and empirical data so as to ascertain what the defining grammatical and semantic nature <b>of</b> <b>tenses</b> in isiZulu are with {{the ultimate goal of}} presenting an alternative view <b>of</b> these <b>tenses.</b> The article examined selected studies on the theory <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> in general as well as work done specifically on tenses in isiZulu. The most prolific scholar in South Africa writing on tenses in isiZulu is L. C. Posthumus. His studies, particularly those of 1990 and 2008, were examined so as to highlight problems with regard to suppositions and terminology. The conclusion of this discussion was that the basis on which a distinction is made between the so-called absolute and so-called relative tenses in isiZulu is contentious. Examples <b>of</b> <b>tensed</b> clauses in all the tenses in isiZulu taken from the empirical data were then examined in order to gain a sense of the defining temporal information communicated by these clauses. Having discussed these examples alternative terms for some tenses were suggested. The empirical data that guided the discussion and provided examples <b>of</b> <b>tensed</b> clauses are drawn from selected narrative texts. The findings with regard to terminology and the temporal information <b>of</b> <b>tenses</b> in isiZulu were then summarised. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is twofold. On one hand, I {{describe the}} use <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> in the second language of the deaf – written Swedish. There is no previous description of this. On the other hand, I operationalize the transitivity model (Hopper & Thompson 1980) and test its scope. I test in part whether transitivity as it is described by Hopper & Thompson (1980) {{can be used to}} explain the use <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> by the deaf in my study. The reason why I connect transitivity with the use <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> is that I would like to see whether a transitivity analysis of a text can replace classification into foreground and background. If so, a transitivity analysis should be a sufficient method for testing the discourse hypothesis, which maintains that second language learners use their emerging verb morphology to signal foreground and background rather than tense. The material I use for both these aims consists of a total of 129 essays written by deaf high school students. The results show that the percentage of clauses with an appropriate choice <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> in all three subsets of material is high. One interesting trend that could be discerned with regard to use <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> is that when informants use a tense that is appropriate for the genre, their command <b>of</b> that <b>tense</b> is better than when it is used in a genre for which it is less appropriate. Calculations testing the hypothesis of co-variance between the components in the transitivity model show in general that such co-variance exists. Nonetheless, the degree of this varies and is far from total. Taken together, the calculations made in this investigation provide support for the claim that these nine components co-vary with one another. The results also show that there is no correlation between the components and the use <b>of</b> <b>tense.</b> Judging from the results, the value of the different components (positive or negative) appears to have no importance in determining whether the choice <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> is appropriate or not. Nor is there any significant difference in the subsets of material for my investigation of whether the number of positive values that a clause has is relevant in classifying the choice <b>of</b> <b>tense</b> as appropriate...|$|R
