5|$|Opinions on the game's mid-level {{checkpoint}} {{system were}} mixed. Matt Cullen of Canadian Online Gaming {{noted that the}} checkpoints meant that players were not sent too far back into the level after each death, saving time. Official Xbox Magazine's Taylor <b>Cocke,</b> however, noted that the checkpoints save players' point progress, meaning that players would have to start the level over if their performance wasn't good enough before they reached the checkpoint.|$|E

Also in 1958, IBM researchers John <b>Cocke</b> and Daniel Slotnick discussed the use of parallelism in numerical calculations for the first time. Burroughs Corporation introduced the D825 in 1962, a four-processor computer that accessed up to 16 memory modules through a crossbar switch. In 1967, Amdahl and Slotnick published a debate about the feasibility of parallel processing at American Federation of Information Processing Societies Conference. It was during this debate that Amdahl's law was coined to define the limit of speed-up due to parallelism.|$|E
