5|$|In 1980, the Environment Agency {{constructed}} a tidal barrier {{at the mouth}} of the river. The structure spans the river, and a huge steel gate, weighing 202 tonnes, can be lowered into the waterway, effectively sealing the river from the Humber, and preventing tidal surges from moving up the river and flooding parts of the city and the low-lying areas beyond. The gate is lowered between eight and twelve times a year, and protects around 17,000 properties. In 2009, a £10million upgrade of the structure was started, to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years. The upgrade included a new drive mechanism, which raises and lowers the gate, and pivots it when it is at the top of the structure, so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically. It also included a new control system. In July 2017 the barrier was granted Grade II listed status. Plans have been considered to build a barrage {{at the mouth of}} the Hull where it joins the Humber Estuary to maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> as it passes through the city. The idea was first raised by the Abercrombie report, which considered how to redevelop Hull after significant destruction during the Second World War.

The name was {{formally}} proposed in September. Improvements to the island and lake continued: The Corps spent $55,000 for a rock and concrete riprap wall around Kingman Lake, and another $20,000 for gates and conduits at the north and south ends of the lake to maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in lake. The Corps wanted to install a lock in {{the southern end of the}} lake to give pleasure boats access to it, and began laying plans for a second lake (East Lake) on the eastern side of the Anacostia River opposite Kingman Lake. That same year, the National Aeronautic Association proposed filling in all or part of Kingman Lake to build a new city airport. In early 1929, a channel [...] deep was dredged under Benning Bridge as it passed over Kingman Lake. [...] (As of 1998, due to the reconstruction of Benning Bridge and other changes, this had been replaced with a [...] wide culvert.) The dredging ship Benning also dredged about half of Kingman Lake to deepen it. By this time, the conduit and gates had been installed in the lake's lower exit, and the upper gates were expected to be installed soon. About [...] of the western shore of Kingman Lake between Gallinger Hospital and Benning Bridge were set aside for gardens in March 1933 to provide food for the needy.|$|E

However, the potential for phenotypic plasticity in fast developing species was investigated only in a small number of anurans, and the specific response to environmental cues such as low water versus decreasing <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> as well as the effects of such cues on particular developmental stages, are even less understood. In this context, we investigated the plastic response to pond desiccation in a neotropical species (Ceratophrys stolzmanni) by raising tadpoles in three <b>water</b> <b>level</b> treatments: <b>constant</b> high, constant low and decreasing. The growth rates were the highest reported for amphibian tadpoles (up to 0. 3 g/day) and the time to metamorphosis was short in all treatments, with the fastest developing tadpole metamorphosing in only 16 days after egg deposition. Individuals from the <b>constant</b> high <b>water</b> <b>level</b> treatment had a higher growth rate than those in the other two treatments, whereas decreasing and <b>constant</b> low <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> had similar effects on development, speeding up metamorphosis. In turn, this involved a cost as these tadpoles had a lower body size and mass at metamorphosis than the ones raised in <b>constant</b> high <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> The final stages of metamorphosis, when tadpoles are the most vulnerable, were shorter in tadpoles exposed to a decreasing <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> allowing them to leave water quickly. Our experiment demonstrates that phenotypic plasticity is maintained even in environments devoid of permanent aquatic habitats. Ceratophryd tadpoles are able to shorten their developmental time when they perceive a risk of desiccation and react similarly to cues coming from the two unfavorable water conditions showing their adaptation to ephemeral and unpredictable breeding habitats.

40|$|This paper studies a novel mobile {{relaying}} technique, where relays of high mobility {{are employed}} {{to assist the}} communications from source to destination. By exploiting the predictable channel variations introduced by relay mobility, we study the throughput maximization problem in a mobile relaying system via dynamic rate and power allocations at the source and relay. An optimization problem is formulated for a finite time horizon, subject to an information-causality constraint, which results from the data buffering employed at the relay. It is found that the optimal power allocations across the different time slots follow a "stair-case" water filling (WF) structure, with non-increasing and non-decreasing <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> at the source and relay, respectively. For the special case where the relay moves unidirectionally from source to destination, the optimal power allocations reduce to the conventional WF with <b>constant</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> Numerical results show that with appropriate trajectory design, mobile relaying is able to achieve tremendous throughput gain over the conventional static relaying.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{considers the}} hydrology and geochemistry {{of water resources}} within Timpanogos Cave National Monument in American Fork, Utah. In particular, data are presented for five cave pools within the Monument and the American Fork River that flows through the Monument. Two independent dye trace attempts in this study have not established {{a connection between the}} surface near the canyon rim at the south border of the Monument and the cave pools or the river. Ion chemistry of the pools reveals elevated sulfate concentrations. Analysis of sulfate and other reaction products suggests the possibility of combined carbonic and sulfuric acids as speleogenetic agents. Enrichment of 13 C in dissolved inorganic carbon above expected values provides initial support of this hypothesis. The enrichment of sulfate in the cave pools when coupled with higher concentrations of fluorine, suggest increased interaction with bedrock influenced in the past by hydrothermal activity. This is especially relevant in pools with muted water-level fluctuations {{during the course of the}} study. Other pools have greater water-level variation and unexpectedly have a very consistent chemical composition. One hypothesis is that the source waters for the pools with stable geochemical character are from the talus near the canyon rim. Evidence from the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen within water samples support this hypothesis— cave pools with <b>constant</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> are more enriched in heavier isotopes and thus derived from lower elevations compared to cave pools with variable <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and depletion in the heavier isotopes...|$|R

40|$|For amphibians, optimal size at {{metamorphosis}} {{is determined}} by a trade-off between opportunities for growth and risks of mortality in aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and many species show {{a high degree of}} plasticity in time and size at metamorphosis that allow them to adapt to unpredictable environments. We used as model a neotropical anuran species, the Pacific horned frog, Ceratophrys stolzmanni, that inhabits the Tumbesian dry forests of southwestern Ecuador, and lays its eggs in lentic habitats of variable size and unpredictable duration. We investigated (i) how tadpoles time their metamorphosis in order to escape a rapidly drying aquatic habitat, and (ii) the consequences of metamorphosis plasticity on the immediate and mid-term fitness of individuals. We conducted two experiments; in the first one we exposed 36 tadpoles to one of three <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> treatments: <b>constant</b> high, decreasing and constant low. Tadpoles that were raised in decreasing or low <b>water</b> <b>level</b> metamorphosed on average 13 % and 10 % faster than the ones from <b>constant</b> high <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> but at a lower body size and mass. Growth rates were among the highest recorded for tadpoles and individuals from the <b>constant</b> high <b>water</b> <b>level</b> treatment grew at a much faster rate than the others. 	In a second experiment, we sampled 72 freshly metamorphosed (Gosner stage 45) C. stolzmanni individuals of assorted sizes (SVL between 23. 8 and 47. 9 mm, body weight between 1. 2 and 11. 9 g). From this spectrum of sizes, we selected the 21 largest and 22 smallest individuals and evaluated the effects of body size at metamorphosis on trophic and locomotory performance parameters. We determined their growth rate and survival over the course of an activity season (i. e., two months). Our results show that bigger size at metamorphosis is correlated with better survival chances and performance. Larger individuals were more mobile, had bigger gape width and better survival rates (95 % compared to 64 % for small individuals). Growth rates were not correlated with initial size, and small individuals were capable of increasing their size at a higher rate. This indicates that, although size at metamorphosis has an immediate impact on fitness, smaller individuals are able to compensate with an increased growth rate. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Due to the extremely low <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in 1996 - 1997, {{the southern end of}} L. Vortsjärv was full of macrophytes. Therefore, the normal migration and spawning of pikeperch, which prefers open water, was seriously hindered. JRC. H. 5 -Rural, water and ecosystem resource...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} soil water content on Rotylenchulus reniformis {{infectivity}} of 'Lee' soybean roots {{was investigated in}} an autoclaved sandy clay loam. Nematodes were introduced into soil masses maintained at <b>constant</b> soil <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> ranging from 3. 4 to 19 % by weight. Seedling growth and the soil water content-water potential relationships of the soil were determined. Nematode infectivity was greatest when the soil water content was maintained just below field capacity in the 7. 2 (- 1 / 3 bar) to 13. 0 % (- 1 / 7 bar) ranges. Nematode invasion of roots was reduced in the wetter 15. 5 (- 1 / 10 bar) to 19. 0 % (- 1 / 2 0 bar) soil moisture ranges and in the dryer 3. 4 (- 15 bar) to 5. 8 % (- 3 / 4 bar) soil moisture ranges...|$|R
