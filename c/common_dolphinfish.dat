40|$|An {{ecosystem}} approach to fisheries management {{requires an understanding}} of the impact of predatory fishes on the underlying prey resources. Defining trophic connections and measuring rates of food consumption by apex predators lays the groundwork for gaining insight into the role of predators and commercial fisheries in influencing food web structure and ecosystem dynamics. We analyzed the stomach contents of 545 <b>common</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> (Coryphaena hippurus) sampled from 74 sets of tuna purse-seine vessels fishing in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) over a 22 -month period. Stomach fullness of these dolphinfish and digestion state of the prey indicated that diel feeding periodicity varied by area and {{may be related to the}} digestibility and energy content of the prey. <b>Common</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> in the EPO appear to feed at night, as well as during the daytime. We analyzed prey importance by weight, numbers, and frequency of occurrence for five regions of the EPO. Prey importance varied by area. Flyingfishes, epipelagic cephalopods, tetraodontiform fishes, several mesopelagic fishes, Auxis spp., and gempylid fishes predominated in the diet. Ratios of prey length to predator length ranged from 0. 014 to 0. 720. Consumption-rate estimates averaged 5. 6 % of body weight per day. Stratified by sex, area, and length class, daily rations ranged up to 9. 6 % for large males and up to 19. 8 % for small dolphinfish in the east area (0 – 15 °N, 111 °W–coastline).

40|$|International audienceStable {{nitrogen}} and carbon isotopes {{were used to}} investigate trophic ecology in tropical marine bird and fish communities from Reunion Island, western Indian Ocean. Firstly, isotope signatures in the liver of Barau's petrels Pterodroma baraui, Audubon's shearwaters Puffinus lherminieri bailloni, and white-tailed tropicbirds Phaethon lepturus were used to compare their trophic levels and determine whether they forage in the same areas while breeding on Reunion Island. Spatial and trophic segregations were noted among these seabirds. Barau's petrels seem to feed on prey of higher trophic levels than Audubon's shearwaters. Different isotopic signatures in adults and juveniles of these species suggest that these chick-rearing Procellariiformes adopt a dual food-provisioning strategy, making separate foraging trips to feed their fledglings and for their own maintenance. Satellite tracking should be undertaken to verify this hypothesis. Furthermore, novel data were obtained on the seabirds' interbreeding period by analyzing feather signatures. White-tailed tropicbirds are thought to change foraging areas during this season, although none of the birds seemed to shift diets. Secondly, isotopic signatures in the muscle of yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, and <b>common</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> Coryphaena hippurus were used to gather information on their feeding behaviors in Reunion Island waters. Spatial and trophic segregations were also observed, particularly between <b>common</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> and the tuna species, where the former fed more on low trophic level coastal organisms under fish aggregating devices than did the latter. Finally, trophic interactions in bird and fish communities were investigated. Seabirds appear to be trophically more structured than fish, foraging in {{a wider range of}} areas.

40|$|The size, {{growth and}} {{spawning}} characteristics of pompano dolphin (N= 150) and <b>common</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> (N= 36) caught off the Canary Islands between May and September 1995 and between July and September 1996 were examined. Fork length (FL) of pompano dolphin {{was in the}} range 28. 3 - 62. 8 cm. In 1995, the mean length increased significantly from June to September. However, in 1996, the mean length was significantly larger in July than in September. The overall length-weight relationship was W= 0. 0287 *FL 2. 774 (r= 0. 97), while these relationships by sex were as follows: W= 0. 031 *FL 2. 758 (r= 0. 98) and W= 0. 0282 *FL 2. 776 (r= 0. 97), {{for males and females}} respectively. Spawning takes place {{at the beginning of the}} Summer (June-July). All the individuals obtained showed developing gonads, but females showed a higher gonadosomatic index (GSI) than males. The highest GSI values were obtained in June (x- = 3. 10 ± 1. 73), and decreased progressively towards the end of the season (September), when the average of this index was x- = 1. 86 ± 0. 87. Similarly, the condition index decreased significantly from June to September. The proportion of females was always significantly higher than males, except in July 1996 when it was 1 : 1. There was a high correspondence between growth rates determined by annuli scale interpretation and modal progression analysis. According to scale annuli interpretation, the individuals caught showed more than five age classes. However, there are doubts about age assignation from scales. Fork length of <b>common</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> was in the range of 76. 5 - 103. 0 cm. The length-weight relationships obtained for all the specimens caught was W= 0. 00095 FL 3. 527 (r= 0. 96), while these relationships by sex were as follows: W= 0. 00398 FL 3. 222 (r= 0. 94) and W= 0. 01656 FL 2. 873 (r= 0. 91), for males and females respectively. Spawning probably takes place at the beginning of the Summer. All the individuals obtained showed developing gonads, although the GSI of females were higher than males. The highest GSI values were obtained in June (x- = 5. 50 ± 2. 17). In the same way, the condition index decreased from May to June.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>dolphinfish,</b> Coryphaena hippurus, are an abundant, {{highly prized}} pelagic game and {{commercial}} fish, and despite their importance, {{information on the}} dolphinfish mating system is lacking. Dolphinfish are unique among pelagic fishes due to their striking sexual dimorphism, and the function of this dimorphism is currently unknown although it may reflect a very different social structure compared to monomorphic species such as tunas. A total of 58 samples, 23 females and 35 males, caught by recreational fishermen in the Southern California Bight were examined for sexual dimorphism and sexual development. Measurements of the dorsal-fin height, the linear length of the forehead, and the contour length of the forehead were performed and histological sections of the gonads were examined to determine reproductive status and to confirm sex. The morphological measurements show {{that the majority of}} males of any given size have larger head and fin features than the females. Among males, sexual dimorphism was not correlated with sexual maturity: males less than approximately 60 cm fork length, resembled females in forehead shape and dorsal-fin height, but were sexually mature. If dolphinfish exhibit a more complex mating system with large males behaving as territorial bulls and monopolizing groups of females, then fisheries managers should consider this potential social structure when developing population dynamics models and management strategies because reproduction may be affect by intense exploitation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the reproductive dynamics of the <b>common</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> (Coryphaena hippurus), using gonads obtained from four locations in Baja California Sur. From August 2004 to November 2006, 2839 dolphinfish were collected (1399 males and 1440 females), {{ranging in size from}} 42 to 155 cm fork length (FL). The sampling revealed a marked seasonality in abundance with 65 % of samples obtained in summer-autumn. Histological analyses of 320 gonads (84 males and 236 females) showed maximal reproductive activity during the months of increased abundance, which coincided with increased sea surface temperatures (28 - 308 C). No immature individuals were sampled and individuals of both sexes were shown to have advanced reproductive activities. Ovarian development showed different kinds of oocytes, indicating that dolphinfish have asynchronous gonadal development. The low gonadosomatic indices were attributed to post-spawning individuals sampled from August to October. Mean batch fecundity (number of oocytes) estimated for 24 females was 279, 383. The sex ratio for the analysed period did not differ significantly from 1 : 1. 02 (P- 0. 05). It was determined that 50 % of all individuals reached maturity at an average length of 80 cm FL. Using reproductive indicators it was determined that the season of maximum reproduction for dolphinfish in the southern Gulf of California occurs mainly {{during the second half of}} the year, in the warm months of summer-autumn...|$|E
40|$|A {{food web}} model is {{constructed}} to describe predator-prey interactions, community structure and trophic flows in northern Chile upwelling ecosystem (18 ° 20 'S, 24 °S), {{for the year}} 1997. The model is built using the Ecopath with Ecosim software version 6. 4, and encompasses 21 functional groups, ranging from primary producers (phytoplankton) to top predators (birds and marine mammals), the principal fishing resources and the fishery. Input parameters required to build the model were gathered from specialized literature, grey literature and our own estimates. The {{results indicated that the}} total biomass (B T) was estimated at 624. 7 ton km- 2. The combined biomass of small pelagic fish represented 26 % of B T, while the combined biomass of demersal fish represented only 0. 1 % of B T. These results highlight the importance of pelagic fish in this system. Predation mortality resulted to be the main source of mortality. Nevertheless, fishing mortality was important in anchovy, mackerel, <b>common</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> and jack mackerel. The mean trophic level of the fishery was estimated as 3. 7, with landings sustained mainly by anchovy. Primary production required to sustain the landings (PPR) was estimated at 7. 5 % of calculated total net primary production, which is lower than PPR estimates in other upwelling ecosystems. The average trophic transfer efficiency was 18 %, which is in the range (10 - 20 %) informed for marine ecosystems.

40|$|The marine {{recreational}} fishing (MRF) {{represents one of}} the most popular activities along the coasts of numerous countries around the world, in particular in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite the evidences of potential effects on the marine biodiversity and commercially exploited stocks, a sound information base and adequate management plans are still lacking, both at the national and basin level. An analysis of the MRF on the West coasts of the Adriatic Sea was carried out, in 2014, by using a standardized questionnaires approach, aiming to describe the state of the art and to preliminarily assess catches, in comparison with the commercial ones, at the regional scale. Gilt-headed seabream, European seabass, cuttlefish, squid and Atlantic bluefin tuna resulted the anglers' preferred species, even if the top five in term of caught biomass were bluefin tuna, seabream, cuttlefish, <b>common</b> <b>dolphinfish</b> and little tunny, in the order (accounting up to 60 % of total catches). The exploitation level resulted to be significant, as confirmed by the comparison with commercial fisheries, being the MRF captures 30 % or 45 % of the artisanal fishery in the same area, with some species, such as bluefish, bonito, pandora and picarel, showing larger values. The preliminary assessment of ecological effects, highlighted that the exploitation use about 10 %- 16 % of energy fixed by the primary production (Primary Production Required to sustain fishery), but the ecosystem effects are still sustainable (Lindex and probability to be sustainable fished). However, combining catches by MRF with those by small scale fishery completely changes the situation, showing an unsustainable condition, suggesting the need for taking into the account also MRF in the future management planning for the Adriatic coastal area...|$|E
40|$|Sardinella aurita, a round {{sardinella}} from Clupeidae family, is a pelagic fish found in tropical and temperate seas, just like {{other members of}} its family. The species has a wide distribution and its contribution to Mediterranean and international fisheries production potential is high. In Turkey, this species has a wide distribution in the Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea, on the other hand, it is rarely seen in the Black Sea and Marmara Sea. Apart from its economic contribution to the world fisheries industry, the species has {{an important role in}} the food chain in regions it is found as it takes part in diet composition of its predators such as greater amberjack, and <b>common</b> <b>dolphinfish.</b> Nowadays, trophic levels are used in order to develop ecosystem based fisheries management strategies. For this purpose, diet composition of the {{round sardinella}} was investigated. Samples were obtained from commercial fishermen, who generally use purse seine and gill nets in Izmir Bay concerned during October 2010 - September 2011. A total of 434 S. aurita were collected all year round, with total lengths ranging 12. 1 to 27. 1 cm. Fish were dissected immediately after capture, stomachs removed and stored in formalin (10 %) until the contents were analysed. Stomach contents examined using a SZX 7 Olympus stereo microscope. Prey items were identified to the lowest possible taxon. Forty eight species were identified, belonging to six major groups: Polychaeta, Crustacea, Mollusca, Chaetognatha, Tunicate and Teleostei. Finally crustaceans were the most important food item in terms of index of relative importance. At least 31 copepod species were identified, where Calanoida, Oithona nana, Oncaea media and Oithona plumifera appeared all year round with %IRI ≥ 10.
