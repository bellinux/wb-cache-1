50|$|On 31 July 1964 a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{collided}} with the rear of a derailed <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> on the Main Line.|$|R
5000|$|The two <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> were {{proceeding}} {{much slower}} than the parcels train. To prevent delays to the more important parcels train, signalman H. Button of Charfield Box and R.H Smith of Berkeley Road Junction (the block post before Charfield) agreed to shunt the two <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> clear. Button shunted the LMS <b>Goods</b> <b>Train</b> into a siding at Charfield whilst Smith shunted the GWR <b>Goods</b> <b>Train</b> into a siding at Berkeley Road Junction. The parcels train quickly raced through the Stations. After signalman F.W Booking of Wickwar (the signalbox after Charfield) signaled [...] "out of section" [...] to Button, he signaled for the LMS <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> to depart the sidings. However, the driver of this train chose to spend five minutes taking on water at Charfield, something he wasn't booked to do. Nor did he inform Button of this. As a result, the original plan for the GWR <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> had to be altered. The mail train meanwhile was fast approaching Charfield and with this in mind, Button was forced to shunt the GWR <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> into the sidings in Charfield once the LMS <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> had left.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} were operated {{as single}} units on light local passenger trains, double-headed on mainline passenger <b>trains</b> and light <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> or triple-headed on heavy <b>goods</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 13 October, three down trains (The LMS parcels, mail and <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> and the GWR <b>goods</b> <b>train)</b> were {{expected}} to pass through Charfield.|$|R
50|$|After that <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> {{ran over}} the more level line through Grauhof, whilst {{passenger}} trains ran via Goslar. In addition local <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> also served Langelsheim, Herzog-Julius-Hütte and Goslar.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line had}} been built {{primarily}} to handle the many <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> that ran between Lancashire and Yorkshire. A typical weekday in Autumn 1952 saw at least thirty-seven eastbound <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> running into Yorkshire using the Micklehurst Loop and a similar number of westbound trains. The loop had easier gradients than the original line through Mossley and Greenfield and this caused most of the heavy <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> to use it.|$|R
5000|$|An Übergabegüterzug (abbreviated to: Üg or Übergabe, {{literally}} <b>goods</b> exchange <b>train)</b> is a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{that moves}} individual goods wagons {{on the first}} or last stage of their journey i.e. from the start to the first railway hub or from the final railway hub to its destination. Between hubs the wagons are hauled by Nahgüterzüge (Ng), i.e. local <b>goods</b> <b>trains,</b> or Durchgangsgüterzüge (through <b>goods</b> <b>trains).</b> These trains generally cover relatively short distances and {{only have a few}} wagons that are delivered to and collected from industrial or loading sidings, either individually or in so-called wagon groups.|$|R
50|$|More {{freight traffic}} passes through this section. First Python <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> of Western Railway plied on this section on 12 April 2011. Later in October 2011, a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> with 120 wagons plied on this section.|$|R
50|$|The <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> hauled {{agricultural}} {{products in the}} main, but the transportation of logs was also important. The only industries were in Celle.Military transportation to the various military installations was also important. Even after the Second World War further military facilities were added and, on many stations, tank-loading ramps were built. Until 1978 the DB also ran <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> through the line because the distances were shorter than on their own DB lines; towards the end this amounted to 135,000 t per year. In 2006 three <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> ran on the line each week, as well as ad hoc <b>trains</b> and <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> hauled by the OHE between DBAG routes.|$|R
50|$|A Nahgüterzug (abbreviation: Ng) is {{the name}} given to a {{category}} of local <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> in German-speaking countries. It describes a type of <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> that, unlike the Durchgangsgüterzug (through <b>goods</b> <b>train)</b> - does not stay together for its entire journey; instead wagons can be added or dropped off at intermediate stations en route. And unlike the Übergabegüterzug (<b>goods</b> exchange <b>train)</b> Nahgüterzüge run from one railway hub to another, usually between two marshalling yards. Along the way various groups of wagons are detached or collected at the intermediate stations.|$|R
50|$|December 1890. A pick-up <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{was being}} shunted from the up line across the down line {{into the yard}} to bring out some laden trucks, when another <b>goods</b> <b>train,</b> coming from Abergavenny and bound for Newport, dashed into it and cut it in two. The {{accident}} {{was due to the}} steep gradient and' the inability of the driver of the through <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> to pull up in time to avert the mischief.|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s, <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> {{would have}} been hauled by Z25-class locomotive. In the 1930s, 30T and 50 class {{locomotives}} {{would have been}} rostered. Locomotives and their crews were based at Culcairn. <b>Goods</b> <b>trains</b> appear to have worked mostly on Tuesdays.|$|R
50|$|Under {{agreements}} of 1860 {{incorporated into}} Acts of Parliament, the GWR continued to run broad gauge <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> to Crediton until {{the abolition of}} broad gauge on 20 May 1892; narrow gauge GWR <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> continued operating until 1 October 1903.|$|R
50|$|The station {{had a great}} {{importance}} in freight operations for a long time. Thus, in 1934, it already had a diesel locomotive of the Kö I class. After the Second World War, a shunting locomotive from Pirmasens freight yard operated local <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> (Nahgüterzug). In the 1980s, two local <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> from Einsiedlerhof marshalling yard on the Mannheim-Saarbrücken railway served the station as well as Pirmasens and its surroundings. At the same time, local <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> were also operated from Pirmasens Nord station, where a <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> bound for the stations of Waldfischbach, Steinalben and Schopp was separated {{from the rest of}} the train. The former loading track in Schopp station was subsequently dismantled.|$|R
25|$|On 25 October 1928, a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{broke down}} at , Dumfriesshire. An express {{passenger}} train {{was in a}} rear-end collision with it due to errors by the guard of the <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> and a signalman. Four {{people were killed and}} five were injured.|$|R
50|$|These {{days the}} classic {{categories}} of <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> no longer really exist, rather the Deutsche Bahn's regional <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> {{are more like}} a mixture of Üg and Ng trains. They are referred to by the DB as Cargobedienung (CB, i.e. cargo service) trains.|$|R
50|$|Barnawartha was {{the site}} of a {{collision}} between a Melbourne bound <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> and the Melbourne bound Spirit of Progress on June 17 1982. The collision, which happened north of the station, and in heavy fog, occurred after the crew of the <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> ran past a red signal, which was protecting the broken down Spirit of Progress, caused by a loss of power to the engine. The <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> ran {{into the back of the}} SoP at a speed of 46km/h, killing the crew on board the <b>goods</b> <b>train,</b> and injuring 9 other people. Train controllers in Melbourne could not warn the crew of the danger ahead due to a lack of two-way radio systems on board locomotives at the time.|$|R

50|$|The {{first was}} on 31 October 1908. A <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> from Aintree {{ran out of}} control on the {{gradient}} between Royton Junction and Royton Station. It crashed into an empty train at Royton. The fireman of the <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> was killed, and the driver severely injured.|$|R
50|$|The station yard {{has five}} tracks for {{passenger}} service, {{and a number}} of other tracks for the overtaking of <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> waiting in the goods yard at the Bologna end of the station. Even tracks 1 and 4 are used for the overtaking of <b>goods</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R

50|$|Faced {{with the}} {{knowledge}} that the Temora Mail would soon be due, the <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> was brought forward so that it could be reversed into a siding on {{the eastern side of the}} station yard. It was during this manoeuvre that the Temora Mail struck the <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> head-on.|$|R
50|$|The Orgreave Train Collision {{occurred}} on 13 December 1926 near Orgreaves Colliery signal {{box on the}} Great Central Railway line about 4+1/2 mi east of Sheffield.
