Cloud computing [1] is a new flavor of computing where our trend of using internet changes. It makes a virtual pool of resources such as storage, CPU, networks and memory to fulfill the user’s resource requirement and provides on demand (pay per use) hardware and software services without barriers. It can be named as dynamic computing because it provides resources, when required. Cloud Computing manages the pool of resources automatically and dynamically through software and hardware. Various businesses form their cloud for the users to provide pay per use services. Users are required to access the cloud according to the service. In this way, user can get benefited from the proprietary cloud on cheap prices {{but it is difficult}} for the user to find the cloud that can fulfill his demand. It is also not safe for cloud to cloud communication without trust.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009 Recently, due to {{concerns}} about the liberalization of electricity supply, deregulation and global impact on the environment, securing a reliable power supply has become an important social need worldwide To ensure this need is fulfilled, detailed investigations and developments are In progress on power distribution systems protection and the monitoring of apparatus which Is part of the thesis. The main objective of a protection schemes is mainly to keep the power system stable by isolating only the affected components or {{the section of the}} electricity network in which the fault has developed while allowing the rest of the network to continue operating. It {{is important to note that}} the protection equipment does not prevent faults from occurring, but it limits the damaging effect of the fault and protects other healthy equipment. This is only achieved if the protection system of the electrical network involved complies with the requirements and purpose of the electrical protection standards. These requirements include the Operational speed, Reliability, Security and Sensitivity. In conventional substations that are still existing Within the utilities networks, a number of long cables are then used to complete the links between substation equipment in order for them to communicate (hardwired). This method is uneconomical and is being phased out completely in the near future. Over the last few years a new standard for substation automation communication has been developed Within the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the IEC 61850. This standard defines the integration requirements of multi-vendor compliant relays and other lED's for multiple protection schemes as well as control and automation techniques. In this particular thesis, Distribution protection is the area of interest, particularly the application of Time and Overcurrent protection schemes. A look into different protection alternatives and the application of new technologies for Electrical Power Distribution Systems that unify protection and control units so that they can be incorporated into Intelligent Substation as opposed to the most existing (conventional substation) is analyzed. The proposed algorithm has been verified through simulations of the CPUT and Eureka three phase power distribution systems. A testing Lab is also part of this thesis and Is meant for experiments as well as simulation performance in order to gain knowledge and skills for designing and engineer substations with lEG 61850 standards equiprnents. The results indicate that the reduction of <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>cable</b> has increased and the communication speed has improved and simplified...|$|R

50|$|Physically, an {{electrical}} cable is an assembly consisting {{of one or more}} conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual covering(s), assembly protection and protective covering(s). Electrical cables may be made more flexible by stranding the wires. In this process, smaller individual wires are twisted or braided together to produce larger wires that are more flexible than solid wires of similar size. Bunching small wires before concentric stranding adds the most flexibility. <b>Copper</b> <b>wires</b> in a <b>cable</b> may be bare, or they may be plated with a thin layer of another metal, most often tin but sometimes gold, silver or some other material. Tin, gold, and silver are much less prone to oxidation than copper, which may lengthen wire life, and makes soldering easier. Tinning is also used to provide lubrication between strands. Tinning was used to help removal of rubber insulation. Tight lays during stranding makes the cable extensible (CBA - as in telephone handset cords).|$|R
2500|$|Not to be {{confused}} with a separate application known as the World wide web which was invented much later in the early 1990s (see article on the English inventor Tim Berners-Lee), the Internet is the global system of overall interconnected computer networks that use the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private and public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope that are linked by <b>copper</b> <b>wires,</b> fiber-optic <b>cables,</b> wireless connections, and other technologies. The concept of packet switching of a network was first explored by Paul Baran in the early 1960s, and the mathematical formulations behind packet switching were later devised by Leonard Kleinrock. On October 29, 1969, the world's first electronic computer network, the ARPANET, was established between nodes at Leonard Kleinrock's lab at UCLA and Douglas Engelbart's lab at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). Another milestone occurred in 1973 when Bob Kahn and Vinton Cerf co-invented Internet Protocol and Transmission Control Protocol while working on ARPANET at the United States Department of Defense. The first TCP/IP-wide area network was operational on January 1, 1983, when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed the university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet.

50|$|Copper {{production}} {{peaked in}} the second half of the 19th century. At this time a huge fire destroyed the town and it remained impoverished from the end of the 19th century into the early 20th. It burned again in 1910, with the Spanish population abandoning the town for nearby Pátzcuaro and Morelia, leaving only the indigenous. The municipality was the scene of the first uprising in support of Francisco I. Madero, led by Salvador Escalante. However, the town had so degraded economically that its coppersmithing tradition was ignored by Dr. Atl in his 1921 classic work The Popular Arts of Mexico. In 1932, the town’s name was changed to Villa Escalante and the municipality’s name was changed to Salvador Escalante but neither name was ever used popularly. In 1946, a group of local artisans decided to organize a copper fair, which continues to this day. The copper industry was revived here making decorated jugs, vases, centerpieces and other items. However, the nearest copper mines were tapped out in the mid 20th century. Today, the 10,000 tons of copper that comes into Santa Clara each week arrives in the form of recycled <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> and <b>cable</b> from electric and telephone companies in Mexico and abroad.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) {{continually}} seeks {{safer and}} more cost-effective technologies for use in deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) of nuclear facilities. The Deactivation and Decommissioning Focus Area (DDFA) of the DOE's Office of Science and Technology (OST) sponsors large-scale demonstration and deployment projects (LSDDPs). At these LSDDPs, developers and vendors of improved or innovative technologies showcase products that are potentially beneficial to the DOE's projects and {{to others in the}} D&D community. Benefits sought include decreased health and safety risks to personnel and the environment, increased productivity, and decreased costs of operation. The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) generated a list of statements defining specific needs and problems where improved technology could be incorporated into ongoing D&D tasks. One such need is to reduce the volume of waste <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> and <b>cable</b> generated by D&D. Deactivation and decommissioning activities of nuclear facilities generates hundreds of tons of contaminated copper cable, which are sent to radioactive waste disposal sites. The Copper Cable Recycling Technology separates the clean copper from contaminated insulation and dust materials in these cables. The recovered copper can then be reclaimed and, more importantly, landfill disposal volumes can be reduced. The existing baseline technology for disposing radioactively contaminated cables is to package the cables in wooden storage boxes and dispose of the cables in radioactive waste disposal sites. The Copper Cable Recycling Technology is applicable to facility decommissioning projects at many Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear facilities and commercial nuclear power plants undergoing decommissioning activities. The INEEL Copper Cable Recycling Technology Demonstration investigated the effectiveness and efficiency to recycle 13. 5 tons of copper cable. To determine the effectiveness of separating out radioactive contamination, the copper cable was coated with a surrogate contaminant.
