40|$|A computable general {{equilibrium}} {{model with}} specific detail in taxation and energy use is developed in this paper to quantify {{the impact of the}} implementation of energy taxation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland. We find that the reduction target for energy related CO 2 emissions in Ireland of 25. 8 percent compared to 1998 levels can be achieved with a <b>carbon</b> <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> of 10 - 15 euro per tonne of CO 2. Though fuel switching {{is an important part of}} achieving the target, the sensitivity analysis shows that this result is sensitive to the possibilities for producers to substitute away from energy use. Welfare would fall but only by small percentages. Production and consumption patterns would change more significantly, as there would be a shift in demand from fuels with a high emission factor to energy sources with a lower carbon-intensity and from energy to other commodities. This paper shows that a <b>carbon</b> <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> leads to greater emission reductions than an equivalent uniform energy tax. The uniform energy tax has a stronger negative impact on the less polluting energy sectors whereas the carbon tax greatly stimulates the use of renewable energy and reduces the use of peat and coal...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the use of wood {{products}} {{as a means to}} mitigate climate change. We describe the life cycle of wood products including forest growth, wood harvest and processing, and product use and disposal, focusing on the multiple roles of wood as both material and fuel. We present a comparative case study of a building constructed with either a wood or a reinforced concrete frame. We find that the production of wood building material uses less energy and emits less carbon than the production of reinforced concrete material. We compare the relative cost of the two building methods without environmental taxation, under the current Swedish industrial energy taxation regime, and in scenarios that incorporate estimates of the full social cost of carbon emission. We find that the inclusion of climate-related external costs improves the economic standing of wood construction vis-à-vis concrete construction. We conclude that policy instruments that internalise the external costs of carbon emission should encourage a structural change toward the increased use of sustainably produced wood products.

For these reasons, carbon taxes (since this was written in August 1990, the European Commission has proposed a <b>carbon</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>tax,</b> which has a diluted relationship with carbon dioxide emission rates) would heavily penalise the poor, so resulting in reduced consumption.

40|$|Malaysia, as a {{small and}} {{developing}} country, must reduce carbon emissions because the country {{is one of the}} top CO 2 -emitting countries in the ASEAN region. Therefore, the current study implements two environmental <b>tax</b> policies; <b>carbon</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>taxes,</b> in order to examine the impacts of these policies on the reduction of carbon emission in the whole of the economy by applying a computable general equilibrium model. Since the whole of the government revenue from these tax policies is transferred to all household and labor types through two schemes, a lump sum tax, and a labor tax, respectively, it is assumed that there is revenue neutrality in the model for the government. The findings from simulated scenarios indicate that the carbon tax policy is the more efficient policy for reducing CO 2 emission, in both transferring schemes, while its impact on macroeconomic variables is almost lower than the equivalent <b>energy</b> <b>tax.</b> The <b>carbon</b> tax is more effective than the <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> for Malaysia to achieve 40 % carbon reduction target in comparison with its 2005 level.

In those countries, such as Germany, Spain, the USA, and the UK, where government intervention has been set at different levels for different technologies, uses and scales, the contributions of renewable heat and renewable electricity technologies have depended on the relative levels of support, and have resulted generally in a lower renewable contribution to final energy consumption.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results and analysis of a study conducted {{with the objective of}} investigating the impact on economy wide emissions due to a <b>carbon</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> levied within the electricity generation sector of Sri Lanka. An Input-Output decomposition technique is used to analyze four types of effects that contribute to the overall reduction in equivalent Carbon, NOx and SO 2 emissions. These four effects are; fuel mix effect (i. e. the change in emissions due to variation in fuel mix), structural effect (i. e. change in emissions due to changes in technological coefficients), final demand effect (i. e. the change in emissions associated with changes in final demand) and joint effect (i. e. the interactive effect between or among the fuel mix, structural & final demand effects). The polluting fuel sources (e. g. coal) are less preferred under these tax regimes. Of the four effects change in fuel mix in thermal electricity generation and change final demand for electricity were found to be the main contributors in achieving economy wide emission reductions. It was found that a minimum of $ 50 /tC of carbon tax or $ 1. 0 /MBtu of <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> is required to {{have a significant impact on}} economy-wide emissions in the Sri Lankan context. This results in an increase in electricity generation cost by approximately Rs 1 /kWh and Rs 0. 65 /kWh under <b>carbon</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> regimes respectively. The reduction in emissions is also strongly coupled with the value of price elasticity of electricity. Also the study concentrates on tackling the barriers for the promotion of clean and energy efficient technologies in Sri Lanka. Barriers for renewable sources; wind and biomass (dendro thermal) and cleaner technologies; IGCC (coal) and LNG fired combined cycle were identified, based on a survey and strategies are proposed to tackle the major barriers. Analytic Hierarchy Process is used to rank the barriers and the strategies are proposed to address the three major barriers for each technology.

Furthermore, these countries are ranked among the world’s largest CO 2 emitters.

Along with the direct bioenergy promotion policies, a variety of economic policy instruments are introduced as emission trading scheme, <b>carbon</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>taxes.</b> In this study, we estimated the evolution of bioenergy deployment from current energy and climate policies through scenarios analysis using bottom-up energy system optimization model, TIAM-FR, a TIMES family model from ETSAP/IEA.
