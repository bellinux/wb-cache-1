5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{reconstruct}} the uncut version of Greed without use of the lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the Cinémathèque royale de Belgique named Greed {{as one of the}} twelve greatest films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for Greed, which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order {{to reconstruct}} the original version of the film and <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos {{to reconstruct the}} uncut version of Greed, the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 2010, {{long after}} the microlensing event had subsided, the science teams {{studying}} the star used the NACO adaptive optics facility at the Very Large Telescope in Chile to determine the actual apparent magnitude of the star that microlensed its background star, hoping to <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the star measured during the microlensing event. A discrepancy was found, a discrepancy {{that may have been}} a result of either error or of a planetary body. Interpretation of follow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation. The ratio between the planet's mass and its host star's mass is well-constrained, but a large interval of uncertainty exists because the host star's mass is known within a large confidence interval that spans the mass of all red dwarf stars.|$|E

25|$|Pepi, Luci, Bom premiered at the 1980 San Sebastián International Film Festival {{and despite}} {{negative}} reviews from conservative critics, the film amassed a cult following in Spain. It toured the independent circuits before spending {{three years on}} the late night showing of the Alphaville Theater in Madrid. The film's irreverence towards sexuality and social mores has prompted contemporary critics to <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1970s films of John Waters.|$|E

25|$|The Roadmaster was {{introduced}} {{in a year when}} Buick's valve-in-head straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick’s larger straight-eight engine in context, <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were in the front.|$|E

500|$|Spence D. of IGN said, [...] "If Britney Spears' Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{illuminates}} anything it's that Spears is {{a fairly}} proficient sonic chameleon, able to mimic and adopt the stylings {{of those who have}} come before her with enough panache and verve to convince younger generations that she's a bona fide pop revelation. [...] This is the kind of kitschy album that {{you can get away with}} having because Spears is such a prevalent component of pop culture." [...] James Gashinski of The Gazette said that [...] "As a time capsule, My Prerogative does its job well," [...] but [...] "Added together, the pop hits on this album are somewhat less than the sum of their parts". He explained, [...] "Even if it isn't as great a listen as a cohesive album, My Prerogative does work as a portrait of the time when Britney Spears was the defining figure of American pop culture". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed with Gashinski, but added [...] "if you <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Immaculate Collection, which captured the time when Madonna was the defining figure of American pop culture and does work as an album, it's clear that a cultural artifact isn't necessarily the same thing as great music".|$|E
500|$|Haunting Ground {{received}} [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews per ratings aggregator Metacritic. Critics {{were quick}} to <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Clock Tower series, specifically its 2002 installment, Clock Tower 3 (2002). The defenseless heroine elements and hide-and-chase gameplay {{were found to be}} highly derivative of the former titles. The dog companion was, for some, a well-received addition to the gameplay formula, with Eurogamer's Kristan Reed comparing it positively to Ico. Others found the dog and other gameplay elements to be repetitive and contributors to poor pacing. The graphics, cinematics, and atmosphere were universally praised. The staff at 1UP.com described the environments as [...] "some of the most detailed, lavish 3D environments Capcom has ever produced." [...] Kill Screen's Zach Budgor compared Haunting Ground's [...] "psychological landscape" [...] to Dario Argento's film Suspiria (1977) and also highlighted its grotesque expressionism. Despite these highlights, critics ultimately felt that Haunting Ground was too predictable and relied heavily on clichés previously established in the horror genre. For this reason, Reed said it [...] "becomes stifled by its own eventual lack of ambition to break away from the norms instilled by two generations of Japanese horror adventures." [...] The staff at 1UP.com felt the game was dated when compared with the recently released Resident Evil 4 (2005), but said, [...] "Haunting Ground isn't without merit, it's just that the merits are buried deep in an occasionally thrilling, mostly 'been there, done that' game of indistinct origin." ...|$|E

The contrast between Martin's [...] "softness" [...] and Robert's [...] "rough, dusty gruffness" [...] was praised as complementary and [...] "subtle and distracting {{in the best way}} imaginable".|$|E

2500|$|Most {{correlation}} {{measures are}} sensitive to the manner in which X and Y are sampled. [...] Dependencies tend to be stronger if viewed over a wider range of values. Thus, if we consider the correlation coefficient between the heights of fathers and their sons over all adult males, and <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same correlation coefficient calculated when the fathers are selected to be between 165cm and 170cm in height, the correlation will be weaker in the latter case. Several techniques have been developed that attempt to correct for range restriction in one or both variables, and are commonly used in meta-analysis; the most common are Thorndike's case II and case III equations.|$|E

2500|$|His first {{objection}} {{is that we}} have {{no experience}} of world-making. Hume highlighted the fact that everything we claim to know the cause of, we have derived the inductions from previous experiences of similar objects being created or seen the object itself being created ourselves. For example, with a watch, we know it has to be created by a watch-maker because we can observe it being made and <b>compare</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> making of other similar watches or objects to deduce they have alike causes in their creation. However, he argues that we have no experience of the universe's creation or any other universe's creations to compare our own universe to and never will; therefore, it would be illogical to infer that our universe has been created by an intelligent designer in the same way [...] that a watch has.|$|E
