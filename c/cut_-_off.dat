40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{estimate}} serum vitamin B 12 {{levels in}} {{type 1 diabetes}} and to evaluate the influence of duration of diabetes, diabetic control, and age on B 12 levels. Importance of Study: Vitamin B 12 deficiency {{is known to be}} associated with autoimmune disorders. However, currently there is very limited and controversial data regarding the prevalence of B 12 deficiency in type 1 diabetes in South Indian population. If our study demonstrates the presence of low serum B 12 levels in type 1 diabetes in our population, a recommendation for regular screening and supplementation of vitamin B 12 could be considered in these patients. Materials and Methods: This was a cross- sectional study. Ninety type 1 diabetic patients (44 males and 46 females) were randomly selected based on inclusion/ exclusion criteria from the diabetes registry at Bangalore Diabetes Centre. Serum vitamin B 12 level and parameters for diabetic controls were estimated using fully automated methods. All statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 16. Results: The study showed that 45. 5 % of the diabetics had low B 12 using the manufacturer′s <b>cut</b> <b>-</b> <b>off</b> of 180 pg/mL and 54 % had low B 12 using the published <b>cut</b> <b>-</b> <b>off</b> of 148 pmol/l (200 pg/mL).

40|$|Background: Enteric fever is endemic in {{developing}} countries like India. Widal test in a single serum sample is often the only test relied upon for laboratory diagnosis. The test is considered positive if the antibody titres are higher than the <b>cut</b> <b>–</b> <b>off</b> value in a single test or a rising titre in paired sera. But normal baseline titres in healthy population and cutoff values have not been established in our area. So the aim of our {{study was to determine}} the base line titres of antibodies among apparently healthy populations and to define the significant titres of widal test. Materials and Methods: Samples were initially screened by Widal slide agglutination test and further confirmed by the Quantitative tube agglutination test. Results: Among the 500 samples from apparently healthy individuals, 260 samples were positive for agglutinins. 141 were positive for ‘O’ agglutinin and 163 were positive for ‘H’ agglutinin of Salmonella typhi. Among 141 samples, 30 showed agglutination up to 1 in 20 titre, 100 up to 1 in 40 and 25 (4. 8 %) up to 1 in 80. Among 163 samples, 18 showed a titre of 1 in 20, 120 showed a titre of 1 in 40 and 21 (4. 2 %) up to 1 in 80. Conclusion: When a single widal titre is used for the diagnosis of enteric fever in our locality, it will be more appropriate to change the currently used cutoff levels against S. typhi to ≥ 1 in 160 for anti-O and ‘H’ agglutinins remains the same of ≥ 1 in 160...|$|E

Microcalcifications play a {{significant}} role in the early detection of breast cancer, especially of DCIS. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the importance of true geometric (air – gap) magnification views for the visibility and characterization of microcalcifications in digital mammography. Materials and methods: With the agreement of the Ethic Commission 100 patients with suspicious microcalcifications (35 malignant, 65 benign) who had a digital standard mammography (Mx) and an additional digital magnification (MAG) view in the same projection within three month were retrospectively selected using the medical reports. All images were obtained from the same full-detector system (Senographe 2000 D, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The images were independently analyzed by six board-certified radiologists. The probability of malignancy was estimated for Mx first, then for Mx + MAG using a modified Breast Imaging Report and Data System (BI-RADS) classification system and a percentage scale. The results were compared using receiver operation characteristic (ROC) analysis. Additional the readers assessed the visibility of the microcalcifications, the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) for Mx and Mx + MAG. 	 Results: The area under the curve (AUC) combined for all six readers was 0, 664 ± 0, 052 for Mx and 0, 813 ± 0, 042 for Mx + MAG, resulting in a statistically significant improvement of 0, 148 ± 0, 120. There was a higher AUC for Mx + MAG in comparison to AUC for Mx for all readers. The Improvement being statistically significant in four of six readers.

40|$|The {{insufficient}} efficaciousness of most {{currently used}} anticancer drugs has prompted worldwide {{efforts to reduce}} toxic and resistance effects, improve overall bioavailability, and widen the therapeutic window. A particularly promising technology to this end rests {{on the concept of}} polymer-drug conjugation, in which the bioactive agent is bound to a meticulously designed macromolecular water-soluble carrier through a biofissionable link. Drug release in the cancerous cell, strongly pH dependant, proceeds hydrolytically in the acidic intracellular compartment, and this represents an advanced drug delivery method in cancer chemotherapy. The synthesis of water-soluble macromolecular anticancer drugs composed of a polymeric carrier to which the antineoplastic agents are tied via biodegradable hydrazone links were investigated in this project. Carriers were synthesized essentially by polyaddition and ring-opening methods, and polycondensation process was utilized, refined and routinely used. Polyaspartamides derived from polysuccinimide by aminolytic ring-opening was the parent carrier’s structure, allowing for: a) A non-immunogenic and non-toxic chain construction, which was amenable to biodegradation and ensured catabolic elimination of the duly fragment polymer upon drug release; b) A highly flexible backbone and the presence of intrachain-type or side group-attached solubilizing groups, which ensured conjugate solution in aqueous media required for rapid dissipation in the central circulation system, even if the conjugated drug itself does not possess water solubility; and; c) The presence of functional groups as binding sites, represented by the hydrazone entity, which ensured drug attachment and release, was introduced by treatment of polysuccinimide with hydrazine hydrate under specially developed experimental conditions, followed by treatment with selected, functionally active amines providing the aforementioned structural features. Drug systems were modified so as to contain carbonyl functionality, the crucial reaction site in this hydrazone linking process, and bioactive aldehydes, such as ferrocenylpropenal. A cinnamaldehyde was the primary drug model.

40|$|Introduction: Transient {{symptomatic}} hypoparathyroidism after total thyroidectomy {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently observed postoperative complications in endocrine surgery. Diagnostic tools for early detection of the complication are as important as the optimal therapeutic strategy. In this paper the <b>cut</b> <b>-</b> <b>off</b> values of PTH serving as a predictor of postoperative hypocalcaemia are investigated, utilizing a prophylactic supplementation with calcium and vitamin D 3 in patients at high risk for developing hypocalcaemia. Additional risk factors were evaluated due to the multifactorial nature of the disorder. The basic idea is to use a simple laboratory test as an indicator for appropriate prophylaxis in order to avoid unpleasant side effects, thus preventing unnecessary elongated periods of hospitalization. Methods: Between 11 / 2007 and 01 / 2009 124 patients, 26 men and 98 women were included in a prospective randomized and monocentric clinical trial. The mean age was 52, 3 years. In all 124 patients the postoperative laboratory tests elucidated with the hypoparathyroidism as defined by low PTH levels and/or calcium levels below the reference range within the first 48 postoperative hours. Measurements of PTH and calcium were performed after thyroid resection, 4 - 6 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively. Patients in one group received treatment with calcium and calcitriol when PTH and/or calcium levels were below the reference range; patients in the other group received treatment as required. A follow - up was carried out for a minimum of six months after discharge, by observing and analyzing not only the duration and manifestation of symptoms but also the duration of medical treatment, PTH and calcium levels over time. Results: As a predictive indicator a PTH level after thyroid resection of 1, 2 pmol/l and also a PTH level of 0, 9 pmol/l 4 - 6 hours postoperatively could be specified. Other risk factors were female gender and the identification of less than four parathyroid glands in situ. A prophylactic treatment with calcium and calcitriol was feasible to avoid moderate and severe hypocalcaemia. The influence of the prophylaxis on regeneration and function of the parathyroid glands in patients treated long - term (more than 6 months) with calcium and calcitriol could not be clarified within this trial. Conclusion: PTH measurement after thyroid resection or 4 - 6 hours postoperatively can be recommended. The general evaluation of all parathyroid glands in situ and a medical prophylaxis in patients with PTH levels after thyroid resection below 1, 2 pmol/l should be performed...|$|E

Design, Setting, and Participants : We conducted a p rospective 34 month population study using clinician - recorded findings between Dec ember 2011 and September 2014 across all 163 neonatal units in England. Exposure: Abdominal X - ray (AXR) performed to investigate clinical concerns. Main o utcome s and m easure s : Ordinal NEC likelihood score, dichotomous case - definition, and GA - specific probability plots. We secured clinician commitment to record data prospectively into each infant’s Electronic Patient Record (EPR). We obtained study data from the UK National Neonatal Research Database that holds information extracted regularly from the n eonatal EPR. We split study data into test and validation datasets. We entered GA, birth - weight z score, clinical and AXR findings as candidate variables in a logistic regression model, performed model fitting 1000 times, averaged the predictions, and used estimates from the fitted model to develop an ordinal NEC score, and cut - points to develop a dichotomous case - definition based upon the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic c urves and positive predictive values.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{dissertation}} {{is to develop a}} predictive rock physics theory that establishes relations between rock properties and the observed seismic and to present the results of different seismic characterization techniques to interpret a tight gas sand reservoir off the south coast of South Africa using as input rock physics analysis and inverted seismic outcomes. To perform the aims and goals of this study a workflow that involves the execution of three main processes was implemented: (1) rock physics modelling, (2) a simultaneous seismic inversion, and (3) seismic reservoir characterization techniques. First, a rock physics model was generated as a bridge between the seismic observables (density, Vp and Vs) and reservoir parameters such as fluid content, porosity and mineralogy. In situ and perturbational log - derived forward modelling was performed. Both in situ and perturbational forward modelling were used to generate synthetic seismic gathers, which were used to study the AVA attribute responses. Overall, the effect of fluid fill on this tight gas sand seismically is modest compared with the effect of porosity changes. Second, there follows a detailed description of a workflow implemented to simultaneously invert P and S pre - stack seismic data. The derived elastic properties (acoustic impedance, Vp/Vs and density) were then used in combination with the rock physics analysis to characterize seismically the reservoir. The predicted acoustic impedance and Vp/Vs volumes show a good tie with the log data. However, the density outcome was of limited quality compared with the two mentioned above. Finally, using outcomes from rock physic s analysis and/or inverted data, four seismic techniques to characterize the reservoir were conducted. The techniques involved are: (1) AVO cross - plotting to generate a good facies property based on AVO attributes (intercept - gradient) and rock physics in the area of study, (2) rock physics templates (RPTs) to compute discrete rock property volumes (litho - Sw, litho - porosity) using a collection of curves that cover all possible "what if" lithology - fluid content - porosity scenarios for the reservoir and the inverted data, (3) a lithological classification to calculate litho - facies probability volumes based on a litho - facies classification using petrophysical <b>cut</b> <b>-</b> <b>off</b> s, multivariate probability functions (PDFs) and inverted data, and (4) an extended elastic impedance (EEI) inversion to derive rock property volumes (Vclay, porosity) based on AVO attributes (intercept, gradient).

In the above three experimental sections, two homologue series of non - ionic surfactants are used. The investigation of adsorption includes static adsorption experiments {{on a variety of}} polymeric ultrafiltration membranes with the same <b>cut</b> <b>-</b> <b>off</b> (20000) but with different chemical structure. Surfactant solutions are used at concentrations above CMC. Adsorption isotherms are derived from the experimental results for each system of membrane - surfactant species. The data are fitted to the Langmuir model. The adsorption effectiveness is related to the hydrophilicity - hydrophobicity ratio of surfactants, which determines mainly the type of developed interactions at the interface of membrane - surfactant species (monomers and micelles). It is observed an alteration in the adsorption behaviour of the membranes tested which is attributed to the different chemical structure of the membrane and the non specified modifications during their manufacturing process. The morphology of the membrane surface is examined by applying Atomic Force Microscopy. The AFM images reveal a significant change of membrane surface. In solubilization experimental section, the capability of non-ionic surfactant micelles to dissolve Alachlor pesticide is studied. The rate of solubilization of Alachlor is recorded in solutions containing surfactant at various concentrations. The experimental data were fitted to a first order kinetic model. The rate constant, saturation concentration and enhancement factor are estimated for each surfactant system. The more hydrophilic Neodol series was proved more efficient in alachlor solubilization than Triton series. In ultrafiltration experimental section, crossflow ultrafiltration experiments are performed using micellar solutions of single surfactant and micellar solutions of surfactant containing alachlor pesticide. The membrane used for the ultrafiltration experiments is a commercially available polyethersulphone with 10000 nominal molecular weight cut-off. Flux reduction, flux recovery, concentration polarization and the effectiveness of MEUF for the removal of alachlor are examined. The effect of surfactant hydrophilic to hydrophobic ratio as well as the variation of the surfactant concentration on the flux behaviour characteristics are studied. The observed flux decline and flux recovery values are high and the effect is not due to concentration polarization. The rejection of alachlor achieved is in the range 78 - 89 %. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine cut-off point of three different indicators of obesity body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-height ratio (WHtR) and compare the three indicators of obesity in detecting of T 2 DM. The study was a secondary data analysis using data of baseline cohort study of non communicable desease. Total sample for the analysis was 1415 adult subjects. Multiple logistic regression and Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) methods implied to analyze the assosiation. The results showed that <b>cut</b> <b>-</b> <b>off</b> point and strength of the relationship using BMI was more than 26 kg/m 2 (Se 0. 65, Sp 0. 64; Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0. 67), OR 2. 45 (95 % CI 1. 66 - 3. 62), WC men and women was more than 81 cm (Se 0. 63; Sp 0. 63; AUC 0. 68), OR 2. 43 (95 % CI 1. 65 - 3. 57), and WHtR was more than 0. 53 (Se 0. 70; Sp 0. 60; AUC 0. 69,) OR 2. 68 (95 % CI 1. 79 - 4. 01). The conclusion of this study is that the strength of assosiation among the three indicators of obesity and the type 2 diabetes is similar after controlled by age, family history, hypertension and physical activity.

Tujuan penelitian adalah menentukan cut-off point tiga indikator obesitas indeks massa tubuh (IMT), lingkar perut (LP) dan rasio lingkar perut-tinggi badan (LP/TB) serta membandingkan dari ketiga indikator obesitas dalam mendeteksi terjadinya DMT 2. Desain penelitian potong lintang menggunakan data sekunder 1415 sampel dewasa dari baseline studi kohort Penyakit Tidak Menular (PTM). Analisis menggunakan regresi logistik ganda dan metode Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa nilai cut-off point dan kekuatan hubungan menggunakan indikator obesitas umum IMT ≥ 26 kg/m 2 (Se 0, 65; Sp 0, 64; AUC 0, 67), OR 2, 45 (95 % CI 1, 66 - 3, 62), LP laki-laki dan perempuan ≥ 81 cm (Se 0, 63; Sp 0, 63; AUC 0, 68), OR 2, 43 (95 % CI 1, 65 - 3, 57), dan LP/TB ≥ 0, 53 (Se 0, 70; Sp 0, 60; AUC 0, 69) OR 2, 68 (95 % CI 1, 79 - 4, 01).

His men waited in their Tullahoma fortifications for a frontal assault that Rosecrans planned for July 1. However, Polk was overly concerned about the fate of the army with its communications <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>-</b> even temporarily - and counseled Bragg to retreat. Hardee, who had no faith in Bragg, refused to specifically recommend a retreat, but offered no encouragement to stay and fight. A day later, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal across the Elk. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.|$|R
