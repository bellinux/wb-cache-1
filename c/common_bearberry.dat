5000|$|Since this {{pathogen}} is a heteroecious rust, C. arctostaphyli has a primary and an alternate host upon which it produces different fruiting structures and different spores unique to each structure. As {{implied in the}} disease name, spruce broom rust mainly affects four spruce species: white (Picea glauca), black (Picea mariana) Engelmann (Picea engelmannii) and Colorado blue (Picea pungens). [...] The alternate host is bearberry, which can be any of three species in the genus Arctostaphylos. This host is also {{sometimes referred to as}} kinnikinnick, which is the Native American name for <b>common</b> <b>bearberry</b> (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), which is in the family Ericaceae. The plant is named for the red edible berries it produces, which are a favorite food of bears when they can get them. They follow a similar life cycle to spruce, as they are both evergreens. There is also another far less common, yet still viable alternate host, manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.).|$|E
40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>bearberry</b> (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi L. Sprengel) is a {{ubiquitous}} procumbent evergreen shrub located throughout North America, Asia, and Europe.

The antioxidant activity of bearberry leaf extract in the 2, 2 ′-azino-bis- 3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical cation assay was 90. 42 mmol Trolox equivalents/g dry weight (DW). The scavenging ability of the methanol extract of bearberry leaves against methoxy radicals generated in the Fenton reaction was measured via electron paramagnetic resonance. Lipid oxidation was retarded in an oil–water emulsion by adding 1 g/kg lyophilised bearberry leaf extract. Also, 1 g/kg of lyophilised bearberry leaf extract incorporated into a gelatin-based film displayed high antioxidant activity to retard the degradation of lipids in muscle foods. The present results indicate the potential of bearberry leaf extract for use as a natural food antioxidant...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Vegetation {{and plant}} {{resources}} can impact forager mobility and subsistence strategies. However, misconceptions about {{the preservation of}} organics in subarctic archaeological contexts and underestimations {{of the importance of}} plant resources to foraging societies limit paleoethnobotanical research in high-latitude environments. This research draws upon concepts from human behavioral ecology to address questions relating to site seasonality, plant resource use, land use, and deposition and taphonomy. The model developed in this thesis outlines expectations of seasonal archaeobotanical assemblages for Late Pleistocene and Holocene sites in interior Alaska. I consider these expectations in light of plant macroremains found in anthropogenic features from Components 1 and 3 (approximately 13, 300 and 11, 500 cal yr BP, respectively) at the Upward Sun River site, located in central Alaska. Site-specific methods include bulk sampling of feature matrix in the field and wet-sieving matrix in the laboratory to collect organic remains. Analytical measures of density, diversity, and ubiquity tie together the model expectations and the results from Upward Sun River. The dominance of <b>common</b> <b>bearberry</b> in the Component 1 archaeobotanical assemblage meets the expectations of a late summer or fall occupation. This suggests that site occupants may have focused on mitigating the risk of starvation in winter months by foraging for seasonally predictable and storable resources. The variability in results from the Component 3 features could relate to longer-term occupations that extended from mid-summer to early fall, in which site occupants foraged for locally available and predictable plant resources such as blueberry or low-bush cranberry species. In this thesis, I argue that large mammal resources were a key component in Late Pleistocene and Holocene subsistence strategies. However, foragers were flexible in their behavior and also targeted small mammals, fish, waterfowl, and plant resources in response to environmental conditions and cultural preferences. The results illustrate the long-standing use of culturally and economically important plant resources in interior Alaska and draw attention to aspects of human behavior that are under-conceptualized in northern archaeology, such as the gender division of labor, domestic behavior, and potential impacts of plant resource exploitation on mobility and land use...|$|E
