5|$|I: Due to Belgium's complex federal {{structure}} the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region (Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Parlement / Parlement de la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale) (89, regional assembly), Flemish Parliament (Vlaams Parlement) (124, regional and <b>community</b> <b>assembly),</b> the Walloon Parliament (Parlement wallon) (75, regional assembly), the Parliament of the French Community (Parlement de la Communauté française) (94, <b>community</b> <b>assembly)</b> and the Parliament of the German-speaking Community (Parlament der Deutschsprachigen Gemeinschaft) (25, <b>community</b> <b>assembly)</b> have competences in federal legislation that affects their interests.|$|E
25|$|Ecosystems can be regenerative. Following a disturbance, {{such as a}} fire or pest {{outbreak}} in a forest, pioneering species will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat.

25|$|The Serb {{minority}} of Kosovo, which largely opposes {{the declaration of}} independence, has formed the <b>Community</b> <b>Assembly</b> of Kosovo and Metohija in response. The creation of the assembly was condemned by Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu, while UNMIK has said the assembly is not a serious issue because it will not have an operative role.|$|E

50|$|The key to that change, {{from the}} anarchist standpoint, is the {{creation}} of a network of participatory communities based on self-government through direct, face-to-face democracy in grassroots neighborhood and <b>community</b> <b>assemblies</b> for discussion, debate, and decision making.|$|R
50|$|Father Ansbro is {{the priest}} at St. Willibrord's Church. The church had some {{alterations}} to its interior in 2006-07 making {{the back of}} the church a focal point for various local <b>community</b> <b>assemblies,</b> where various charity fund-raising events are organised.|$|R
25|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} of resources can influence plant community composition, diversity and assembly trajectory. Baer et al. (2005) manipulated soil resource heterogeneity in a tallgrass prairie restoration project. They found increasing resource heterogeneity, which {{on its own}} was insufficient to insure species diversity in situations where one species may dominate across the range of resource levels. Their findings {{were consistent with the}} theory regarding the role of ecological filters on <b>community</b> <b>assembly.</b> The establishment of a single species, best adapted to the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important role in determining the community structure.|$|E
25|$|At the National Assembly's {{first session}} on 14 February 2007, {{politicians}} voted overwhelmingly {{to reject the}} proposal by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari on the preliminary resolution {{of the status of}} Kosovo. New elections were called in 2008 as the DS-DSS coalition collapsed due to EU recognition of Kosovo's declaration of independence. In the 2008 parliamentary election the SRS again won 29% of the vote, and 78 seats, leading to the formation of a DS-SPS-led government coalition. The party also won 17 seats in the Kosovska Mitrovica-based <b>Community</b> <b>Assembly</b> of Kosovo and Metohija consisting of Kosovan Serb municipalities who defied Kosovo's declaration of independence.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} to the Russians, the Ottoman Empire {{restored}} the Danube ports of Turnu, Giurgiu and Braila to Wallachia {{and agreed to}} give up on their commercial monopoly and also recognized freedom of navigation on the Danube, as specified in the Treaty of Adrianople signed in 1829. Alongside with that, the political autonomy of the Romanian principalities grew as their rulers were elected for life by a <b>Community</b> <b>Assembly</b> which was made of boyars, a method used to reduce political instability and Ottoman intervantions. Following the war, Romanian lands became under Russian occupation until 1834 under the governance of General Pavel Kiselyov. During his rule the local boyars enacted the first Romanian constitution.|$|E
40|$|Involving {{vulnerable}} pediatric {{populations in}} international research requires culturally appropriate ethical protections. We sought to use mabaraza, traditional East African <b>community</b> <b>assemblies,</b> {{to understand how}} a community in western Kenya viewed participation of children in health research and informed consent and assent processes. Results from 108 participants revealed generally positive attitudes towards involving vulnerable children in research, largely because they assumed children would directly benefit. Consent from parents or guardians was understood as necessary for participation while gaining child assent was not. They felt other caregivers, community leaders, and even <b>community</b> <b>assemblies</b> could participate in the consent process. Community members believed research involving orphans and street children could benefit these vulnerable populations, but would require special processes for consent...|$|R

40|$|The main {{properties}} of the legislative organ to be formed in “federate states” of Cyprus have been evaluated in this study. Starting from this evaluation, determining the duties and powers of the “Community Assemblies” is also considered in the study. In Cyprus, these <b>Community</b> <b>Assemblies,</b> appointed separately by both communities, are empowered with legislative and decision making powers. Accordingly, <b>Community</b> <b>Assemblies</b> enjoying a kind of “autonomy” from the central government shall enjoy these powers on religious, educational, cultural, sportive and charity issues within the limits described by the Constitution. The study consists of two main sections; {{in the first section}} the “{{properties of}} these Community Assemblies” to be created within the federative system are examined, in the second and the last section the duties and powers of these Assemblies are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Community</b> <b>assembly</b> [...] "is a {{framework}} that can unify virtually all of (community) ecology under a single conceptual umbrella". <b>Community</b> <b>assembly</b> theory attempts to explain the existence of environmentally similar sites with differing assemblages of species. It assumes that species have similar niche requirements, so that community formation {{is a product of}} random fluctuations from a common species pool. Essentially, if all species are fairly ecologically equivalent then random variation in colonization, migration and extinction rates between species, drive differences in species composition between sites with comparable environmental conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Ecological fitting {{can explain}} aspects of species {{associations}} and <b>community</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{as well as}} invasion ecology. It is another mechanism, in addition to coevolution and in situ evolution (in which new phenotypes evolve and travel sympatrically), that can explain the creation and maintenance of species associations within a community. The phenomenon of ecological fitting helps {{to weigh in on}} some of the great debates in community ecology. [...] The Clementisian school of community ecology, {{based on the work of}} Frederic Clements, a plant ecologist who studied ecological succession, holds that communities are constructed by deterministic processes that assemble a 'superorganism' from the individual species present. With the removal or exchange of a species, the community would be unstable. [...] On the other hand, the Gleasonian view, promoted by Henry Gleason, who was also a plant ecologist studying successional communities, is more individualistic and emphasizes the role of random processes such as dispersal in <b>community</b> <b>assembly.</b> The Clementsian view would emphasize coevolution and strict niche fidelity as a major factor structuring communities, also known as the niche-assembly perspective, whereas the Gleasonian, or dispersal assembly view emphasizes neutral and historical processes, including ecological fitting. These views of <b>community</b> <b>assembly</b> raise the question: do species continue stable relationships over time, or do all individuals represent [...] "asymmetrical pegs in square holes"? [...] Some of these question can be answered through phylogenetic studies, which can determine when certain traits arose, and thus whether species interactions and <b>community</b> <b>assembly</b> occurs primarily through coevolution or through dispersal and ecological fitting. [...] Support exists for each, indicating that each has a varied role to play, depending on the community and on historical factors.|$|E
