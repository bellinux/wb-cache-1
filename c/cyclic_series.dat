40|$|Abstract — The Mechanic Settlement pluton is a {{small body}} of mafic and ultramafic rocks of tholei-itic affinity, {{occurring}} in the Late Neoproterozoic volcanosedimentary rocks of the Avalon terrane of the Appalachian Orogen. The lenticular-shaped intrusion is layered and consists of ultramafic and mafic lithologies in at least six cyclic units that are relatively thin or short-lived. The lowermost exposed portion of the intrusion {{is characterized by the}} cumulate sequences of olivine and olivine-clinopyroxene and display relatively flat rare earth element profiles. In the overlying lithologies, pla-gioclase is the dominant cumulus phase following olivine in the crystallization sequence. Olivine ranges in composition from Fo 73 to Fo 85 and plagioclase from An 62 to An 89. Variations in the compo-sitions of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene are within Wo 0 - 4 En 52 - 87 Fs 11 - 45 and Wo 39 - 50 En 23 - 50 Fs 3 - 19.

These techniques rely upon an appropriate choice of model parameters that are often difficult to determine. Whilst neural networks also require an appropriate parameter configuration, they offer {{a way in which}} non-linear patterns may be modelled. However, evidence from a limited number of experiments has been used to argue that periodical patterns cannot be modelled using such networks. Researchers have argued that combining models for forecasting gives better estimates than single time series models particularly for seasonal and <b>cyclic</b> <b>series.</b> For example, a hybrid architecture comprising an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a neural network is a well-known technique that has recently been shown to give better forecasts by taking advantage of each model's capabilities. However, this assumption carries the danger of underestimating the relationship between the model's linear and non-linear components, particularly by assuming that individual forecasting techniques are appropriate, say, for modelling the residuals. In this thesis, we show that such combinations do not necessarily outperform individual forecasts. On the contrary, we show that the combined forecast can underperform significantly compared to its constituents'. We also present a method to overcome the perceived limitations of neural networks by determining the configuration parameters of a time delayed neural network from the seasonal data it is being used to model. The motivation of our method is that Occam's razor should guide us in selecting a simpler solution compared to a complex solution. Our method uses a fast Fourier transform to calculate the number of input tapped delays, with results demonstrating improved performance as compared to that of other linear and hybrid seasonal modelling techniques on twelve benchmark time series.

The interactions of peptide hormones (ACTH, alpha-, beta- and gamma-MSH) with the melanocortin receptors regulate multiple physiological functions in the human body. Pharmacological studies of the melanocortin receptors have revealed very broad biological effects including pigmentation, steroidogenesis, energy homeostasis, thermoregulation, anti-inflammation, nerve regeneration, sexual behavior, feeding behavior and memory, and others. Due {{to the lack of}} selectivity of the endogenous ligands (except ACTH) the exact biological roles of the melanocortin receptor subtypes have not been fully elucidated. The objectives of our research are the design and synthesis of new, selective and potent ligands for the melanocortin receptor subtypes to help elucidate their biological functions. Since the three-dimensional structures of the melanocortin receptors and their endogenous ligands are unknown, receptor structure-based design has not been applied. We have chosen a "classical" ligand-based design with the primary structure of an endogenous ligand, gamma-MSH, as a starting point. Our design strategy is to gain high selectivity and potency by fixing the spatial structure of this very flexible peptide ligand in hopes that we can induce the bioactive conformation. We have examined two strategies to constrain the peptide backbone. The first approach is based on global constraint of the peptides by cyclization. A group of 36 cyclic peptides has been synthesized using thioether bond formation as a cyclization step. Macrocyclic peptide ligands varied from 15 - to 30 -membered rings. The truncated sequence of gamma-MSH has been applied in the <b>cyclic</b> <b>series.</b> In the second strategy we have introduced a local constraint into the peptide backbone similar to a reverse turn structure. We have made a very radical change in ligand conformation by peptide complexation with a transition metal in different positions of the sequence.

40|$|How does a {{biological}} light sensor convert {{the energy of}} a photon through a sequence of structural changes to generate {{a biological}} signal? Photoactive Yellow Protein (PYP) isolated from the phototrophic bacterium Ectothiorhodospira halophila, a small water-soluble protein whose three-dimensional X-ray crystallographic structure has been determined to high resolution, serves as a paradigm for structural studies of the interaction of light and proteins. This blue light photosensor has been implicated in the negative phototactic response of these bacteria. PYP undergoes a <b>cyclic</b> <b>series</b> of absorbance changes upon illumination at its λ(max) of 446 nm. In its ground state, the anionic p-hydroxycinnamoyl chromophore of PYP is covalently bound as a thiol ester to Cys 69, buried in a hydrophobic pocket, and hydrogen bonded via its phenolate oxygen to Glu 46 and Tyr 42. The chromophore becomes protonated in the photobleached state (I₂) after it undergoes trans-cis isomerization, which results in breaking of the H-bond between Glu 46 and the chromophore and partial exposure of the phenolic ring to the solvent. To gain an in-depth understanding of these interactions at the molecular level, the active site of the protein and the chromophore structure was modulated via site-directed mutagenesis and incorporation of variant chromophores. The structural, optical, kinetic and thermodynamic properties of several such altered proteins have been investigated and presented in this dissertation. Interestingly, Glu 46 Asp and Glu 46 Ala mutations demonstrated dual photoactive species {{as a result of}} a pH driven color transition. Met 100 Ala was the first PYP mutant to exhibit properties of an optical switch. The unique properties of PYP and its mutant forms may eventually permit their use in optical devices for switching, memory, computing and holographic applications. Early stages of the photocycle were characterized using picosecond and femtosecond ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. These time-resolved spectroscopic studies have revealed the presence of two new intermediates. The time constants for formation and decay of these intermediates have now been resolved and the structural and mechanistic aspects of these results are discussed.

40|$|A constitutively active Cys 128 Phe mutant of the α 1 B-adrenoceptor {{has been}} shown to not only {{activate}} G-protein coupling {{in the absence of an}} agonist, but also activate only a single effector pathway (phospholipase C but not phospholipase A 2). This suggests that in the case of the α 1 B-adrenoceptor, a single receptor subtype forms multiple conformations for G-protein interactions that are specific for a particular G-protein/effector pathway. The existence of this receptor opens up possibilities for the specific modulation of the receptor pathway. Specifically, the development of small molecule ligands which activate a single active conformer would thus provide new signalling-specific therapeutics with pharmacological diversity. In order to achieve this, ligands which bound selectively to the Cys 128 Phe mutant α 1 B-adrenoceptor over the wild-type α 1 B-adrenoceptor were required. Through molecular modelling studies and pharmacophore development a range of conformationally restrained target ligands have been developed which mimic varying conformations of the endogenous ligand adrenaline. This range of target ligands included a simple <b>cyclic</b> <b>series,</b> a bicyclic series, a spirocyclic series and a spiro-fused series. Members of the bicyclic and spirocyclic series were predicted to have particular selectivity potential for the Cys 128 Phe mutant α 1 B-adrenoceptor. The synthesis of the simple cyclic derivatives was via pynolidinone and piperidone frameworks. A series of nine new bicyclic tropane-based target derivatives were prepared from 6 -hydroxytropinone. The major step in the approach to the synthesis of the spirocyclic target ligands was a pro spirocycle-forming intramolecular palladium-assisted cyclisation. One such spirocyclic compound was made. The synthetic procedure for the spiro-fused target derivatives also began from pynolidinone and piperidone frameworks, involving the formation of a hydroxymethyl aryliodide derivative, and a crucial palladium-catalysed intramolecular cyclisation. While this last approach was not completed, a novel indeno-pynole derivative was prepared. Pharmacological testing of the synthesised simple cyclic and bicyclic derivatives indicated that whilst some of the simple cyclic ligands exhibited selectivity for the Cys 128 Phe mutant α 1 B-adrenoceptor, the bicyclic ligands displayed no selectivity for this mutant receptor, and had only weak affinity for both α 1 B-adrenoceptors. The increased rigidity and steric bulk of the bicyclic ligands appeared not to be favourable. However, the set of bicyclic ligands have provided a promising new lead for selective αID-adrenoceptor ligands...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas AM 1, pink {{bacterium}} {{which can}} grow on the one-carbon compounds methanol, formate and methyl- amine as sole carbon and energy sources {{has been the}} principal object of study in the work described. The pathway of carbon incorporation during growth on formate has been studied by chromatographic examination of the non-volatile ethanol-solubie radioactive cell constituents in samples taken {{over a period of}} 2 minutes after administration of [14 C]formate or [14 C]bicarbonate to cells growing on non-radioactive formate. It was found that the primary product of [14 C]formate fixation was serine, and that of [14 C]bicarbonate fixation was malate. At later times phosphorylated compounds, other amino acids, and trehalose acquired radioactivity. It ie concluded that the assimilation of formate in P. AM 1 does not follow an autotrophic pathway, in which 3 -phosphoglyceric acid would be the principal early product. A pathway for synthesis of cell constituents operating during growth on formate has been proposed. This involves the conversion of the reduced C 1 compound to methylenetetrahydrofolate, the fixation of this into serine by serine transhydroxyrnethylase, the conversion of the serine to phosphoenolpyruvate and carboxylation of the latter to C 4 -dicarboxylic acids. The operation of such a biosynthetic route necessitates the synthesis glycine from C 1 units. It is suggested that this process could come about by a direct condensation of two C 1 compounds, or by a <b>cyclic</b> <b>series</b> of reactions involving the formation of glycine from the C 4 end-product. In an attempt to obtain further evidence for this hypothesis an investigation into the enzymes present in cell-free extracts of formate-grown P. AM 1 has been made. It was found that all the enzymes are present for the conversion of formate and glycine to 3 -phosphoglycerate. Extracts supplemented by the appropriate cofactors could bring about the conversion of [14 C]formate to [14 C]- glycerate and [14 C]glycerate to 3 -phospho[14 C]glycerate. The specific activities of all the enzymes involved in these transformations were higher in cells grown on formate than in cells grown on succinate. This observation is taken as evidence that these enzymes do indeed play a special role in the growth of P. AM 1 on C 1 compounds. The specific activities of all the enzymes are of the correct order of magnitude to explain the overall observed rate of growth on formate. Glycine, serine and phosphoglyceric acid have been isolated from the ethanol-soluble fraction of cells grown for 1 min. on [14 C]methanol, and degraded. Similar degradations have also been performed on glycine and serine derived from cells grown for 1 min. on [14 C]- methanol but aerated with air containing 1 % v/v carbon dioxide. The distribution of radioactivity indicates that the carboxyl groups of glycine and aerine are derived from carbon dioxide, that C- 3 of serine is derived from a reduced C 1 unit, and that C- 2 of glycine and C- 2 of serine are also derived from a reduced C 1 unit, but less directly than C- 3. Comparison of these patterns with those of malate derived from the same source indicated that serine could not have been formed from malate, but that malate could have been formed from serine. Cell-free extracts of methanol-grown P. AM 1 contain an enzyme which on purification {{has been shown to be}} a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, catalysing the irreversible formation of oxaloacetate and orthophosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate and bicarbonate. The properties of the enzyme have been investigated. The enzyme is specific for phosphoenolpyruvate (for which K m is 3. 3 x 10 - 4 M), inhibited by phosphate and ammonium ions, not stimulated by ADP or GDP, and activated specifically by Mg 2 + ions. The pH optimum is 8. 5. The enzyme has been assigned a key role in the formation of C 4 compounds from C 3 compounds. Attempts have been made, both in whole cells and in extracts to determine the origin of the glycine necessary for the above biosynthetic scheme. Studies on the metabolites formed from [2, 3 - 14 C 2]succinate after short- term incubation with whole cells of methanol-grown P. AM 1 indicated that glycine could possibly be formed from C 4 dicarboxylic acids by a pathway not involving C 3 compounds or phosphates. It was not found possible, however, to demonstrate this in extracts. Experiments on the carboxylation of reduced C 1 units in extracts were also unsuccessful. Experiments on the oxidation of methanol, formaldehyde and formate by washed suspensions and extracts of formate- and methanol-grown P. AM 1 have been performed. Whole cells rapidly oxidised all three substrates. The only enzyme demonstrable in extracts with a specific activity of the correct order to explain the oxidation rate of whole cells was an NAD-linked formate dehydrogenase.

A <b>series</b> of four precast concrete wall panels were tested to evaluate their response to reversed cyclic loading. These units represent the wall panels of a typical single storey precast concrete structure. In order to achieve improved ductility and energy absorption characteristic, {{it was found that}} the horizontal sliding of the wall panel along the grout-wall interface must be controlled. Due to the reversed cyclic loading and the increased wall panel participation from limiting the horizontal sliding of the wall, it was determined that shear reinforcement of each precast specimen was separated into three separate component parts, joint rotation, wall panel deformations and horizontal wall panel sliding, to compare and evaluate the seismic performance of the wall panels...|$|R
40|$|By {{our past}} review, {{this paper will}} verify the {{hypothesis}} that the autonomous (invisible) body balancing would be better under changeable demand speed and a leading principle in the collaborative networks. This hypothesis was first utilized in the Conveyor-Serviced Production System (CSP System) with cycle time by a Station-Centered Approach to the physical networks. Recently, we are ascertaining this hypothesis in cost/profit balancing under demand speed (invisible hand) at the economic body chain networks. Generally, it becomes simpler at <b>series</b> (<b>cyclic)</b> type, but would not be so at parallel (semi-cyclic) type. Throughout this paper, we will point out the principle of autonomous (invisible) body ba-lancing by demand speed (cycle time), and would extend to a parallel (semi-cyclic) supply chain by the Station-Centered Approach. This thing would bring the invisible merit that the profit maximization occurs at the relative cost balancing of each enterprise in a series-parallel body network...|$|R

40|$|Topographical models, or “graphical tubing tests ” [4] can {{be applied}} to data vectors v where each real number vi can be {{interpreted}} as the value of vertex i in a graph G. For example, a time series with n points corresponds to the n path, while a <b>cyclic</b> time <b>series</b> corresponds to the n-cycle. To each such data vector, the topographical model assigns a signature τG(v), which is a height for each vertex and captures G-relevant aspects of the relative sizes of the data points (it defines a partial order coarsening the ordering of the vi by value). The probability that this signature would have been observed by chance, assuming a unform distribution on the ranked data (e. g. when each point is drawn from an i. i. d., continuous distribution) is then used to measure association to the graph. The signature function also acts as a smoothing operator, filtering out noise in the data; see figure 1, which depicts the expression levels of the mouse gene Obox in a 17 -point time course experiment [2]. The left hand plot is the unfiltered data, while the right hand plot are the heights assigned by the topographical model on the cyclic graph. In this case, topographical models were used to identify cyclic genes in mouse somitogenesis [6]. The probabilities of each observed and possible signature are used to rank genes by cyclicality or more generally by agreement with a graph G and to compute p-values. Topographical models define the same semigraphoid, after inverting the boolean lattice, as the corresponding undirected graphical model (Markov random field) defined by G. The combinatorics of these objects is explored in [4] and [5]...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of high speed trains, large cyclic {{stresses}} are exerted on ballasted rail tracks which in turn cause excessive settlements and lateral deformations of granular materials leading to frequent maintenance of track. The use of planar reinforcement is well established in rail environment to address such aspects. Recent {{studies have shown that}} geocell can provide much better lateral confinement to infill soil compared to planar reinforcement. However, a limited number of researches have been performed to examine the performance of reinforced sub-ballast under cyclic loading in railway environment. In this study, the large-scale prismoidal triaxial apparatus have been employed to investigate the performance of reinforced and unreinforced sub-ballast during <b>cyclic</b> loading. A <b>series</b> of drained tests were carried out to examine the behaviour of unreinforced and geocell reinforced sub-ballast subjected to cyclic loading exerted by train passes. The laboratory experiments were carried out in plane strain condition at very low confining pressure to simulate railway environment. Effects of varying apparent confining pressure (σ′ 3), frequency (f) and number of load cycles (N) were also studied...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study focused}} on the role which static shear plays on the large {{deformation}} behavior of loose saturated sand during undrained <b>cyclic</b> loading. A <b>series</b> of undrained <b>cyclic</b> torsional shear tests was performed on saturated Toyoura sand specimens up to single amplitude shear strain exceeding 50 %. Three types of cyclic loading patterns, i. e., stress reversal, intermediate and non-reversal, were employed by varying the initial static shear level and the cyclic shear stress amplitude. The observed types of failure could be distinguished into liquefaction (cyclic and rapid flow) and residual deformation by comparing both monotonic and cyclic undrained behavior. It {{was found that the}} presence of initial static shear does not always lead to an increase in the resistance to liquefaction or strain accumulation; they could either increase or decrease with an increasing initial static shear level {{depending on the type of}} loading pattern and failure behavior. In addition, according to the failure behavior which the specimens exhibited, three modes of development of large residual deformation were observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of linear ester oligomers (LEOs) and cyclic ester oligomers (CEOs) from non-activated succinic acid (A) {{in combination with}} di-anhydro hexitols (B, DAH) in a toluene based medium using immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL B), was studied. The conversion is highest for isomannide and decreases in the order isomannide > isosorbide isoidide. These experimental results were corroborated by substrate-imprinted docking indicating that the hydroxyl group oriented inwards the “V”-shaped plane of the DAHs (endo-hydroxyl) is preferred over the outwards oriented hydroxyl group (exo-hydroxyl) by CAL B. The maximum conversions under optimized conditions were 88. 2 % and 93. 7 % for succinic acid and isomannide, respectively. MALDI-TOF detected products at 24 h were a mixture of cyclic (35. 1 %) and linear ester oligomers (64. 9 %). Cyclic ester oliogomers were the most abundant products during the first 8 h of reaction (32. 5 – 48. 7 %), where the first <b>cyclic</b> of the <b>series</b> (CEO 1) was the most predominant cyclic product (23 – 40 %) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{advances}} a {{new approach}} that provides closed form expressions for the birth trajectory produced by a regime of changing vital rates. An exponentiated sinusoidal net maternity function is considered in detail, as populations with cyclically varying net maternity are of particular interest because of their connection to the Easterlin hypothesis. The dynamics of the model are largely determined by {{the ratio of the}} population's generation length (A) to the period of cyclicity (T), and relatively simple expressions are found for the phase difference and relative amplification of the birth and net reproduction functions. More generally, an analytical expression for a population's birth trajectory is derived that applies whenever net reproductivity can be written as an exponentiated Fourier <b>series.</b> In the <b>cyclic</b> model, Easterlin's inverse relationship between cohort size and cohort fertility holds whenever the phase difference is zero. At other phase differences, the birth-reproduction equations have the form of predator-prey equations. The present analytical approach may thus be relevant to analyses of interacting populations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a multi-site damage probabilistic life prediction model {{that could be used to}} assess the integrity of engineering structures susceptible to fatigue in presence of neighboring cracks. Both experiments and simulation were used to produce the data required for the model development. The experiments were performed to investigate the interaction of two adjacent semi-elliptical cracks under <b>cyclic</b> loading. A <b>series</b> of tests at different loads and for different crack aspect ratios were conducted under uniaxial constant amplitude fatigue loads on API- 5 L grade B steel samples. Crack growth rate of two initial semi-elliptical cracks was investigated both on the sample surface and in the depth direction. Moreover, Crack growth and interaction was investigated using a simulation technique that incorporates the stress intensity factor of a single crack with an existing cracks interaction correction factor models from the literature. Finally, a Bayesian inference modeling technique is adopted to estimate the life prediction model parameters, assess any model bias and uncertainty and validate it. 1...|$|R
