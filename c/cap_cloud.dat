40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{to observe the}} detailed response of wet deposition to orography in a polluted environment are reported. Rain events were classed as frontal, convective or mixed {{on the basis of}} meteorological data. Analysis of the deposition enhancement and <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> composition confirmed that for the frontal events the seeder-feeder effect (scavenging of <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> by rain drops) dominates. The greater concentration of ions in the water scavenged from the <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> than in the rain means that deposition is enhanced for all ions. For marine ions the scavenged water was found to be between five and six times as concentrated as the rain and for anthropogenically produced ions it was about twice as concentrated. A computational model of rainfall incorporating the seeder-feeder effect has been broadly successful in predicting enhancement although some details of the observed pattern remain to be explained. Convective events were only important in the deposition of marine ions although {{this may not be the}} case in the summer months.

40|$|Radar {{images and}} {{numerical}} simulations of three shallow convective precipitation events over the Coastal Range in western Oregon are presented. In {{one of these}} events, unusually well-defined quasi-stationary banded formations produced large precipitation enhancements in favored locations, while varying degrees of band organization and lighter precipitation accumulations occurred {{in the other two}} cases. The difference between the more banded and cellular cases appeared to depend on the vertical shear within the orographic <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> and the susceptibility of the flow to convection upstream of the mountain. Numerical simulations showed that the rainbands, which appeared to be shear-parallel convective roll circulations that formed within the unstable orographic <b>cap</b> <b>cloud,</b> developed even over smooth mountains. However, these banded structures were better organized, more stationary, and produced greater precipitation enhancement over mountains with small-scale topographic obstacles. Low-amplitude random topographic roughness elements were found to be just as effective as more prominent subrange-scale peaks at organizing and fixing the location of the orographic rainbands. ...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the "Hill <b>Cap</b> <b>Cloud</b> Thuringia 2010 " (HCCT- 2010) international cloud experiment, the influence of cloud processing on the activation properties of ambient aerosol particles was investigated. Particles were probed upwind and downwind of an orographic <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> on Mt Schmucke, which is part of a large mountain ridge in Thuringia, Germany. The activation properties of the particles were investigated by means of size-segregated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) measurements at 3 to 4 different supersaturations. The observed CCN spectra together with the total particle spectra were used to calculate the hygroscopicity parameter kappa for the upwind and downwind stations. The upwind and downwind critical diameters and kappa values were then compared for defined cloud events (FCE) and non-cloud events (NCE). Cloud processing was found to increase the hygroscopicity of the aerosol particles significantly, with an average increase in kappa of 50 %. Mass spectrometry analysis and isotopic analysis of the particles suggest that the observed increase in the hygroscopicity of the cloud-processed particles is due to an enrichment of sulfate and possibly also nitrate in the particle phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of topography on rainfall rate and chemical composition {{has been investigated}} at Great Dun Fell in northern England. The measurements at eight different altitudes between 250 and 850 m above sea-level on the western slopes of Great Dun Fell (GDF) show, {{in the presence of}} a <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> on the hill and a west or southwest wind flow, a marked increase in both rainfall amount and concentrations of major ions with altitude. Three case studies of the variation in rainfall rate and chemical composition with altitude when the seeder-feeder mechanism was operating are described and compared with model predictions. Associated measurements of the <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> microphysics and chemistry were also made. The case studies show close agreement between model predictions and measured values for changes in chemical composition and wet deposition with altitude. This pattern of wet deposition is a frequent occurrence at GDF, but exceptions do occur, for example when the upstream flow is blocked or the wind speed is small, no increase in the concentration or rainfall amount was observed. ...|$|E

This study {{presents}} a comprehensive {{assessment of the}} meteorological conditions and atmospheric flow during the Lagrangian-type "Hill <b>Cap</b> <b>Cloud</b> Thuringia 2010 " experiment (HCCT- 2010), which was performed in September and October 2010 at Mt. Schmücke in the Thuringian Forest, Germany and which used observations at three measurement sites (upwind, in-cloud, and downwind) to study physical and chemical aerosol–cloud interactions. A Lagrangian-type hill <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> experiment requires not only suitable cloud conditions but also connected airflow conditions (i. e. representative air masses at the different measurement sites). The primary goal {{of the present study}} was to identify time periods during the 6 -week duration of the experiment in which these conditions were fulfilled and therefore which are suitable for use in further data examinations. The following topics were studied in detail: (i) the general synoptic weather situations, including the mesoscale flow conditions, (ii) local meteorological conditions and (iii) local flow conditions. The latter were investigated by means of statistical analyses using best-available quasi-inert tracers, SF 6 tracer experiments in the experiment area, and regional modelling. This study represents the first application of comprehensive analyses using statistical measures such as the coefficient of divergence (COD) and the cross-correlation in the context of a Lagrangian-type hill <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> experiment. This comprehensive examination of local flow connectivity yielded a total of 14 full-cloud events (FCEs), which are defined as periods during which all connected flow and cloud criteria for a suitable Lagrangian-type experiment were fulfilled, and 15 non-cloud events (NCEs), which are defined as periods with connected flow but no cloud at the summit site, and which can be used as reference cases. The overall evaluation of the identified FCEs provides the basis for subsequent investigations of the measured chemical and physical data during HCCT- 2010 (see [URL] Results obtained from the statistical flow analyses and regional-scale modelling performed in this study indicate the existence of a strong link between the three measurement sites during the FCEs and NCEs, particularly under conditions of constant southwesterly flow, high wind speeds and slightly stable stratification. COD analyses performed using continuous measurements of ozone and particle (49 nm diameter size bin) concentrations at the three sites revealed, particularly for COD values < 0. 1, very consistent time series (i. e. close links between air masses at the different sites). The regional-scale model simulations provided support for the findings of the other flow condition analyses. Cross-correlation analyses revealed typical overflow times of ~ 15 – 30 min between the upwind and downwind valley sites under connected flow conditions. The results described here, together with those obtained from the SF 6 tracer experiments performed during the experiment, clearly demonstrate that (a) under appropriate meteorological conditions a Lagrangian-type approach is valid and (b) the connected flow validation procedure developed in this work is suitable for identifying such conditions. Overall, it is anticipated that the methods and tools developed and applied in the present study will prove useful in the identification of suitable meteorological and connected airflow conditions during future Lagrangian-type hill <b>cap</b> <b>cloud</b> experiments...|$|E
