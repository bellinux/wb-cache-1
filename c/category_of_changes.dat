Of special interest is, for example, the detection of changes in terms of monitoring and disaster management, where accurate information about dimension and <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> are frequently requested. Hence, in this paper, a workflow for object-oriented multispectral classification is presented to differentiate between traffic infrastructure, water, vegetation and non-vegetation areas. Changes are detected by analyzing multi-temporal classification results. For this, multitemporal QuickBird images covering the city Karlsruhe and LiDAR data are investigated to detect urban change areas...|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of a software system changes {{as a consequence}} of developer’s static source code modifications. In this thesis, we improve upon a previous approach that combines static and dynamic analyses to categorize behavioural changes by greatly improving its accuracy through polymorphic mapping. We further refine the previous model by introducing a change-centric state transition model that captures the flow of call pairs among different partitions based on static and dynamic call graphs. We also extend the approach by incorporating complete dynamic call stacks into the analysis. Finally, we perform a longitudinal analysis of three software systems to categorize how they have dynamically evolved across 100 program versions. In our evaluation, the polymorphic mapping algorithm decreased mismatches between the static and dynamic analyses by 53 %. In particular, we decreased the mismatch by 71 % in the most important <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> from the developer’s point of view. We found that developers introduce new behaviour more often than eliminating old behaviour. Our results show that developers are more likely to remove unexecuted/dead code than code that is executed dynamically. In terms of change types, we found that changes made to fix defects encountered the least inconsistent and unexpected behaviour, while changes made to add new functionality experienced the highest unexecuted behaviour. Finally, we argue that augmenting the dynamic analyses with call stacks provides useful information that helps developers analyze the implications of the call pairs highlighted by our analyses...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} potential of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to detect DNA effects (including DNA damage and mutations) in aquatic invertebrates, following their exposure {{to a variety of}} environmental contaminants under laboratory conditions. After rigorous optimisation of the RAPD method, the protocol, which used a high annealing temperature (50 "C for 10 -mer primers), was found to generate good-quality DNA profiles from groups of organisms belonging to the bacterial, plant and animal kingdoms. The RAPD method was initially used to detect benzo(a) pyrene [B(a) P] and copper-induced DNA effects in the water flea Daphnia magna and ultraviolet-mediated DNA effects in the marine alga Palmaria palmata. The results clearly showed that changes occurred in RAPD profiles obtained from the exposed populations when compared to controls. In these studies, the effect of the genotoxins at higher levels of biological organisation (e. g. Darwinian parameters and/or fitness parameters) were also investigated and were compared with genomic DNA template stability (GTS), a qualitative index representing clear changes in panems compared to control RAPD profiles. The results from these experiments revealed that GTS could be more sensitive than growth parameters and showed at least equal or even greater sensitivity than other measures of fitness. Changes in RAPD profiles were believed {{to be the result of}} DNA effects, namely adduct formation, DNA breakage, oxidative damage and mutations and possibly other effects (e. g. variation in gene expression). Nevertheless, the nature and amount of DNA effects could only be speculated because diverse events may induce the same <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> (i. e. variation in band intensity, appearance of bands, and disappearance of amplicons) in RAPD patterns. Further studies confirmed that RAPD had the potential to qualitatively detect oestrogen and xeno-oestrogen -induced DNA effects in barnacles. Additional experiments emphasised that oxygen radicals and variation in gene expression may induce significant changes in RAPD profiles. To further understand the effects of DNA lesions and mutations on RAPD patterns, individual types of DNA damage were created in vitro. The results clearly indicated that BaP DNA adducts, DNA photoproducts. and DNA breakages had significant effects on RAPD profiles but that diverse types of DNA damage may induce the same <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in RAPD patterns which render the interpretation of the results difficult. It was also concluded that mutations could be detected provided they do not arise in a random fashion. Finally, an attempt was made to determine the kinetics of DNA damage and DNA repair and whether changes in patterns obtained from B(a) P exposed Daphnia magna could be transmitted to successive generations. This strategy was developed to distinguish between mutations and DNA damage. The results showed that some bands obtained from the exposed populations were transmitted to the first and/or second generation but not to the third. It was concluded that the transmission of modified genetic material to the offspring was more likely to be the result of large genomic rearrangements and/or base methylation (epigenetic processes) rather than point mutations. In conclusion, the results presented in this research project show the potential of the RAPD assay as a useful method for the qualitative assessment of DNA effects including genotoxicity and changes in gene expression. The main advantage of this technique is that it can be applied to any species without requiring any information about the nucleotide sequence. In the field of ecogenotoxicology, its main advantage lies in its sensitivity and speed to detect a wide range of DNA damage including DNA breakage, DNA adducts, oxidative damage as well as mutations (including point mutations and large rearrangements). On the other hand, RAPD only allows a qualitative assessment of the DNA effects and the nature of the changes occurring in profiles can only be speculated. Finally, a great deal of further experimentation and validation are required in order to assess the applicability of the technique to a variety of other species and pollutants, particularly under field conditions...|$|E
40|$|Detailed neuro-histopathological {{investigations}} were performed, being grounded on {{the general}} point of view, on thirty-one naturally occurring cases gathered during the years 1948 to 1957,of a swine disease in Janan, so-called "encephalitis eosinophilica suis. " The cardinal symptoms of it consist of circular movement, convulsions, epileptiform seizures, etc. Histopathological lesions of the disease in {{the central nervous system}} are chracterized by various processes consisting of nerve cells diffusely extending over all areas of the brain and spinal cord, mainly pseudolaminar focal necroses (pallidness or focal pallor to malacia) principally being located in the grey matter of the prosencephalon especially in the cerebral cortex and perivascular and tissue infiltration of eosinophil leucocytes principally observed in the cortex and meninges of the telencephalon. The focal necroses, furthermore, are occasionally located in the grey matter such as in the cerebral nuclei, diencephalon, mesencephalon and medulla oblongata. Histo-pathogenetically, a great importance is attached to the fact that most basic pathological processes in the central nervous system of the disease may possibly have much connection with a certain toxic condition originating from systemic metabolic disturbances of fat substances of certain kinds. Such disturbances were proved by the degenerative condition of nerve cells (acute cell change), metamorphosis of fat tissues belonging to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> of "yellow fat disease, " degeneration in the parenchymatous organs and deposition of acid-fast pigment substances detected in the central nervous system, etc. It was confirmed that the necrotic-desolated processes of the central nervous system offer much evidence that they had origin in local functional disturbances of the blood circulation (SPIELMYER); such changes were regarded as secondary ones. There is no wholly denying the surmise that the acid-fast pigment substances which were regarded as an abnormal product of metabolism of fat substances of a certain kind may take part in the functional disturbances. It is conceivable, in conformity with histological findings, that these acid-fast substances may have various chemical states ranging morphologically from non-phanerous to phanerous, the latter showing acid-fastness for the most part. With the exception of reparative symptomatic inflammatory infiltration into the necrotic-desolated processes, as to eosinophil cell infiltration which was recognized in almost all the cases, {{the author would like to}} comprehend it as likely manifestation of the function of the cells which acceleratedly act to counteract to the abnormal pigment substances; in other words, such infiltration is a phenomenon which belongs to a simple reactive process of the body. With the exception of glio-mesenchymal reactive process to the necroticdesolated lesions, mesenchymal changes consisting of swelling, increase, etc. of cells of the walls of the blood vessels, being observed particularly in the grey matter and meninges of the prosencephalon, were regarded as changes reactive to the disorder of the tissue and the abnormal metabolic substances. Edematous focal tissue loosening of various degrees observed frequently in the cerebral cortex are considered to be a secondary process having to do with hyperemia and fibrin thromboses of the blood vessels principally of the veins. As to the causal genesis of the present disease, "yellow fat disease" of various creatures and encephalomalacia of chicks are referred to as interesting objects from the morphological standpoint. A certain swine disease in Europe and America, having a name similar to that of the present disease, is clinically and morphologically similar, if not identical, to the present disease...|$|E

40|$|Protected {{areas are}} {{experiencing}} {{increased levels of}} human pressure. To enable appropriate conservation action, {{it is critical to}} map and monitor changes in the type and extent of land cover/use and habitat classes, which can be related to human pressures over time. Satellite Earth observation (EO) data and techniques offer the opportunity to detect such changes. Yet association with field information and expert interpretation by ecologists is required to interpret, qualify and link these changes to human pressure. There is thus an urgent need to harmonize the technical background of experts in the field of EO data analysis with the terminology of ecologists, protected area management authorities and policy makers in order to provide meaningful, context-specific value-added EO products. This paper builds on the DPSIR framework, providing a terminology to relate the concepts of state, pressures, and drivers with the application of EO analysis. The type of pressure can be inferred through the detection <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in state (i. e. changes in land cover and/or habitat type and/or condition). Four broad <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in state are identified, i. e. land cover/habitat conversion, land cover/habitat modification, habitat fragmentation and changes in landscape connectivity, and changes in plant community structure. These <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in state can be mapped through EO analyses, with the goal of using expert judgement to relate changes in state to causal direct anthropogenic pressures. Drawing on expert knowledge, a set of protected areas located in diverse socio-ecological contexts and subject to a variety of pressures are analysed to (a) link the four <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> in state <b>of</b> land cover/habitats to the drivers (anthropogenic pressure), as relevant to specific target land cover and habitat classes; (b) identify (for pressure mapping) the most appropriate spatial and temporal EO data sources as well as interpretations from ecologists and field data useful in connection with EO data analysis. We provide detailed examples for two protected areas, demonstrating the use of EO data for detection <b>of</b> land cover/habitat <b>change,</b> coupled with expert interpretation to relate such change to specific anthropogenic pressures. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and feasibility of using EO data and techniques to identify anthropogenic pressures, suggesting additional research efforts required in this direction...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{change in}} community integration (CI) and functional status following discharge from in-patient musculoskeletal (MSK) rehabilitation, {{and to explore}} the concordance between the Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI) and patient interviews. Participants: Twenty-five individuals with lower extremity MSK disorders discharged home after rehabilitation. Methods: For all outcome measures, <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> between successive time points were created using the minimal detectable change. Change patterns were evaluated at the group and individual level across four time intervals. Percent agreement quantified concordance between interview and RNLI data. Results: Change over time was confirmed at the group level. However, individual-level analyses revealed much variability in change patterns. High concordance (81 %) {{was found between the}} two methods <b>of</b> reporting <b>change</b> in CI. Significance: The individual-level findings indicate heterogeneity in recovery patterns, which if assessed as a group would have not been identified. Interview findings support the RNLI for measuring CI for the target population...|$|R

40|$|Our {{longitudinal}} study of the sensemaking and responses to strategic <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the senior management team of a UK multinational subsidiary provides unusual data that enable us to explore the complexity <b>of</b> senior team <b>change</b> related sensemaking. We show senior teams to be distinct interpretive communities rather than one homogeneous <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> agents, as typically portrayed in change literature, who at times <b>of</b> center-led strategic <b>change</b> occupy a complex dual recipient/change agent role. By adopting a narrative approach, we show the shared sensemaking of such a team to be impacted by the locally differentiated nature of its interpretive and relational contexts, leading to context specific interpretations <b>of</b> center-led <b>change</b> and locally distinct responses, with consequences for change outcomes. We found that because of their dual role, senior managers construct two sets of interwoven and interacting change narratives which mediate {{the relationship between the}} wider organizational change and local change actions. Our analysis reveals how these evaluations <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> accompanied by affect, evolve over time and how they impact action. These findings contribute to existing theories <b>of</b> sensemaking and <b>change</b> by addressing the previously undertheorized relationship between senior management teams’ sensemaking and their responses to strategic chang...|$|R
