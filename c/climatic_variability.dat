2500|$|There is a {{well-documented}} global {{pattern that}} correlates decreasing {{plant and animal}} diversity with increasing latitude, that is to say, there are fewer species as one moves towards the poles.

[...] Theories for its explanation include energy availability, <b>climatic</b> <b>variability,</b> disturbance, competition, etc. Despite this global diversity gradient, this pattern can be weak for freshwater systems compared to global marine and terrestrial systems. This may be related to size, as Hillebrand and Azovsky found that smaller organisms (protozoa and plankton) did not follow the expected trend strongly, while larger species (vertebrates) did.

Following studies on the potential effects of NOx generated by engine heat in stratosphere flying Supersonic Transport (SST) airplanes in the 1970s, in 1974, John Hampson suggested in the journal Nature that due to the creation of atmospheric NOx by nuclear fireballs, a full-scale nuclear exchange could result in depletion of the ozone shield, possibly subjecting the earth to ultraviolet radiation for a year or more. In 1975, Hampson's hypothesis [...] "led directly" [...] to the United States National Research Council (NRC) reporting on the models of ozone depletion following nuclear war in the book Long-Term Worldwide Effects of Multiple Nuclear-Weapons Detonations. In the book it states that a nuclear war involving 4000 Mt from present nuclear arsenals would probably deposit much less dust in the stratosphere than the Krakatoa eruption, judging that the effect of dust and oxides of nitrogen would probably be slight climatic cooling which would [...] "probably lie within normal global <b>climatic</b> <b>variability,</b> but the possibility of climatic changes of a more dramatic nature cannot be ruled out". Model calculations in the early-to-mid 1970s on the effects of a nuclear war with the use of large numbers of multi-megaton yield detonations returned conclusions that fireball generated NOx and ozone layer loss therefrom could reduce ozone levels by 50 per cent or more in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

30|$|We {{have also}} noticed <b>climatic</b> <b>variabilities</b> of the IMC (cf. Yamanaka 2016): two {{systematic}} periodical (annual and diurnal) cycles that are forced astronomically and other components without fixed periodicity (ISVs and interannual variations). The annual cycles of rainy (monsoon) and dry seasons are less {{clear in the}} IMC than in adjacent regions such as Indochina (Murakami and Matsumoto 1994) and vary spatially: the seasonal march in the southern hemispheric part (Jawa and Bali) has a southern-hemispheric annual cycle (a clear rainfall maximum in southern summer) (e.g., Haylock and McBride 2001; Hamada et al. 2002; Aldrian and Susanto 2003; McBride et al. 2003; Chang et al. 2004, 2016). The equatorial and northern-hemispheric parts have either a semi-annual cycle (with double peaks near equinox seasons), a northern-hemispheric annual cycle (one peak in northern summer), or the cycle is unclear. The semi-annual cycle is reasonable if we consider that the sun passes the zenith, when the insolation becomes maximum, twice a year. So the rainfall over the IMC is sensitive to the insolation. However, why is the insolation stronger in the rainy and cloudy season? Why is the southern-hemispheric rainy season so dominant in low-latitude Jawa and Bali? We must answer these questions adequately, as well as establishing the mechanism {{to explain why the}} world’s largest regional rainfall falls over the IMC.|$|R

40|$|Corals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout {{a long stretch}} of geological time and can provide highresolution histories of <b>climatic</b> <b>variabilities</b> in the tropics, which {{play a key role in}} understanding the Earth's climate system. Geochemical approaches to corals have been widely used for reconstructing palaeoclimates because the geochemistry of the skeleton is believed to vary as a function of several environmental conditions. However, large variations that cannot be ascribed to a single environmental factor have been observed among and/or within calibrations of coral-based proxies. Two main unsolved factors could lead to these large discrepancies: unexpected environmental changes in reefs and unknown biological processes occurring at coral biomineralization sites. In this review, we show the recent progress in dealing with this question by application of coral culture technique and micro analytical methods to skeletal geochemistry in corals and discuss on how the degree of geochemical variation could be affected by environmental changes and how by biological processes during the skeleton's calcification. The next challenge will be to perform high-resolution analysis on cultured corals growing under controlled and/or constant environmental conditions. Such efforts hold the promise of yielding important new insights into the various biomineralization processes that may affect the chemical and isotopic composition of the skeletons, with the goal of understanding how environmental changes express themselves in geochemical variability...|$|R

40|$|NCEP/NCAR (National Center for Environmental Prediction &ndash; National Center for Atmospheric Research) {{data have}} been used to {{estimate}} the long-term variability of the mean flow, temperature, and Stationary Planetary Waves (SPW) in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. The results obtained show noticeable <b>climatic</b> <b>variabilities</b> in the intensity and position of the tropospheric jets that are caused by temperature changes in the lower atmosphere. As a result, we can expect that this variability of the mean flow will cause the changes in the SPW propagation conditions. The simulation of the SPW with zonal wave number m= 1 (SPW 1), performed with a linearized model using the mean flow distributions typical for the 1960 s and for the beginning of 21 st century, supports this assumption and shows that during the last 40 years the amplitude of the SPW 1 in the stratosphere and mesosphere increased substantially. The analysis of the SPW amplitudes extracted from the geopotential height and zonal wind NCEP/NCAR data supports the results of simulation and shows that during the last years there exists an increase in the SPW 1 activity in the lower stratosphere. These changes in the amplitudes are accompanied by increased interannual variability of the SPW 1, as well. Analysis of the SPW 2 activity shows that changes in its amplitude have a different sign in the northern winter hemisphere and at low latitudes in the southern summer hemisphere. The value of the SPW 2 variability differs latitudinally and can be explained by nonlinear interference of the primary wave propagation from below and from secondary SPW 2...|$|R

40|$|Paleoclimatic records {{obtained}} from western Nordic Seas core GS 15 - 198 - 38 CC (70 °N, 17 °W) exhibit fluctuating climatic patterns of millennial time scales. Here, foraminifera isotope records used to reconstruct sea surface water mass properties indicated that variability changes {{during the last}} glacial period (~ 130 kyr) have been dominated by forcing at precession (21 kyr) and millennial timescales. Observed shifts in δ^ 18 O records, abundance ice-rafted detritus and planktonic foraminifers display a good agreement to Greenland atmospheric temperatures changes, indicating a coupling between ice sheet dynamics and sea surface processes east of the Greenland continental margin. The most frequent abrupt stadial/interstadial changes retained from the marine sediments are known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles, and appear every 1 - 2 kyr. These cycles are characterized by abrupt short-lived increase in temperatures (10 ± 5 °C) followed by gradual cooling preceding the next rapid event. A second millennial scale feature detected in the sediments record is cooling events culminating significant iceberg discharges analogous to Heinrich events. Mechanisms triggering abrupt changes display uncertainties, but leading hypothesis is attributed to modifications in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and deep-water formation initiated by freshwater input. Finally, contrasting <b>climatic</b> <b>variabilities</b> between Marine Isotope Stages 5 and 3 is apparent.

In West and Central Africa, for instance climatic events, which have resulted in floods and droughts, have caused a lot of concern to both governments and people of the region. In particular, the droughts have been so widespread that greater awareness and concern have become generated for the need to find solutions to the problems created by the consequences of the climatic events.
