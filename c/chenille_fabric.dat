25|$|Other {{evidence}} included straw, packaging foam, a bedspread, and waterlogged {{fragments of}} a newspaper later determined to have been The New York Sunday from September 26, 1976. The bedding and newspaper fragments had been wrapped {{over some of the}} body parts. The newspaper was linked to the northern part of New Jersey, where the perpetrator may have had ties. The bedspread in the suitcases had a reddish-orange color, was made of <b>chenille</b> <b>fabric,</b> and was wrapped around some of the body. It had yellow and pink embroidered flowers.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, {{chenille}} appeared in quilting {{in a number}} of yarns, yards or finishes. As a yarn, it is a soft, feathery synthetic that when stitched onto a backing fabric, gives a velvety appearance, also known as imitation or [...] "faux chenille". Real chenille quilts are made using patches of <b>chenille</b> <b>fabric</b> in various patterns and colors, with or without [...] "ragging" [...] the seams.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>chenille</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{should be}} dry cleaned. If hand or machine-washed, {{they should be}} machine-dried using low heat, or as a heavy textile, dried flat to avoid stretching, never hung.|$|R
5000|$|Standards of {{industrial}} production were not introduced until the 1990s, when the Chenille International Manufacturers Association (CIMA) was formed {{with the mission}} to improve and develop the manufacturing processes. [...] From the 1970s each machine head made two chenille yarns straight onto bobbins, a machine could have over 100 spindles (50 heads). Giesse {{was one of the}} first major machine manufacturers. Giesse acquired Iteco company in 2010 integrating the chenille yarn electronic quality control directly on their machine. <b>Chenille</b> <b>fabrics</b> are also often used in Letterman jackets also known as [...] "varsity jackets", for the letter patches.|$|R
40|$|Chenille yarns are {{traditionally}} {{used in the}} manufacture of furnishing fabrics, fashion knitwear, and as decorative threads in many types of broad and narrow <b>fabrics.</b> <b>Chenille</b> yarn has a very distinct weakness-it does not have very good inherent abrasion resistance. When the yarns are in use, clearly the abrasion resistance of the chenille yarn is crucially important. Either during further processing or during the eventual end-use, any removal of the effect yarn forming the beard will expose the ground yarns, which in turn will result in a bare appearance. To avoid this undesirable result, several options are available. Therefore, the studies on this area are about the investigation of the influences of some material types and machine parameters on the abrasion resistance of <b>chenille</b> yarns and <b>fabrics</b> produced with these yarns. In this paper, the experimental studies about the abrasion properties of chenille yarns in yarn, knitted and woven fabric forms are summarized...|$|R
50|$|Based on {{the design}} of the Ledge wagon, the Bow Top is {{significantly}} lighter, and less likely to turn over in a strong wind. The design incorporated a lightweight canvas top, supported by a wooden frame: a design reminiscent of the older “bender tents” used by the Romanichal. Both back and front walls of the wagon were decorated in scrollwork and tongue and groove and the wagon was painted green to be less noticeable in woodland. The inside of the Bow Top also contained the same high scrollwork or <b>Chenille</b> <b>fabric,</b> with a stove, table and double bed.|$|E
50|$|Alexander Buchanan, a foreman in a Paisley fabric mill, is {{credited}} with introducing <b>chenille</b> <b>fabric</b> to Scotland in the 1830s. Here he developed a way to weave fuzzy shawls. Tufts of coloured wool were woven together into a blanket that was then cut into strips. They were treated by heating rollers {{in order to create}} the frizz. This resulted in a very soft, fuzzy fabric named chenille. Another Paisley shawl manufacturer went on to further develop the technique. James Templeton and William Quigley worked to refine this process while working on imitation oriental rugs. The intricate patterns used to be difficult to reproduce by automation, but this technique solved that issue. These men patented the process but Quigley soon sold out his interest. Templeton then went on to open a successful carpet company that became a leading manufacturer throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
5000|$|An {{ordinary}} Pillow Pet is {{made with}} <b>chenille</b> <b>fabric.</b> Underneath it is a velcro strap. Given that it starts in pillow position, its strap fastens {{to the other side}} in order to transform it into a stuffed toy. If the strap is unfastened again, the Pillow Pet can again be used as a pillow.The original release of Pillow Pets included merely six varieties. Now, more than one hundred varieties of Pillow Pets have been sold by CJ Products. Current varieties range from scented to body pillow pets, they even have a North Dakota State University pillow pet available as one of the licensed Pillow Pets. [...] Available as one of the licensed Pillow Pets that exist for MLB, NFL, NHL and NCAA sports teams. There are also themed Pillow Pets based on Disney characters. Stuffed toys based on Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora the Explorer, and SpongeBob SquarePants are being produced as well. CJ Products has also licensed Pillow Pets for three English Premier League football clubs for release in September. Besides stuffed animals, other products bear the Pillow Pets name, such as blankets, slippers, hats, and print pajamas. Three Pillow Pets books and two board games are also available. In late October 2011, a Pillow Pets video game was released for Nintendo DS. Recently, Pillow Pets World online has been created, featuring interactive, Pillow Pet related games for children to play for free online.|$|E
50|$|James Templeton was a farmer's son {{born in the}} Campbeltown area in 1802. As a youth he came to Glasgow {{to work in a}} draper's shop. In 1823 {{he moved}} to Liverpool, and soon after he {{obtained}} a lucrative post in Mexico where he made enough money to return to Scotland and start his own business. Initially he opened a shawl manufactury in Paisley, in 1829. In 1837, through contact with another shawl manufacturer, William Quiglay, a new process was invented for processing <b>chenille,</b> a standard <b>fabric</b> for shawls, into compact C-shaped tufts which were both very soft and preserved their shape very well, enabling complex patterns to be created, and Templeton immediately saw this as ideal for carpet manufacture. Quiglay and Templeton took out a patent on this process, but only for 14 years.|$|R
