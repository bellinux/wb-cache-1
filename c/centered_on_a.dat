Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed.|$|E

5|$|The {{project that}} {{eventually}} led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier.

5|$|Eventually, {{two large}} Native American groups {{controlled}} {{most of the}} Snake River: the Nez Perce, whose territory stretched from the southeastern Columbia Plateau into northern Oregon and western Idaho, and the Shoshone, who occupied the Snake River Plain both above and below Shoshone Falls. Lifestyles along the Snake River varied widely. Below Shoshone Falls, the economy centered on salmon, who often came up the river in enormous numbers. Salmon were the mainstay of the Nez Perce {{and most of the}} other tribes below Shoshone Falls. Above the falls, life was significantly different. The Snake River Plain forms one of the only relatively easy paths across the main Rocky Mountains for many hundreds of miles, allowing Native Americans both east and west of the mountains to interact. As a result, the Shoshone <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> trading economy.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the {{original}} film, a student short film serving as an unauthorized sequel was made by amateur filmmaker Don Glut, after he discovered the Sun Demon mask in Bob Burns' collection. Filmed in black and white with a running time of three-and-a-half minutes, Wrath of the Sun Demon starred Burns as the Sun Demon. The short film was made {{with the support of the}} University of Southern California, where Glut was a student at the time. The plot <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> man (presumably McKenna) transforming into the Sun Demon and terrorizing several people before falling to his death off a cliff.

5|$|Reflector sights {{were invented}} as an {{improved}} gun-sight and since their invention {{they have been}} adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights (sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points {{that have to be}} aligned). Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on the front sight, keeping it centered on the (unfocused) rear sight, while keeping the whole <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> target at different distances, requiring alignment of all three planes of focus to achieve a hit. The reflector sight's single, parallax-free virtual image, in focus with the target, removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and expert shooters alike.|$|E
5|$|The Church of the SubGenius' {{ostensible}} beliefs defy categorization or {{a simple}} narrative, often striking outside observers as bizarre and convoluted. The group {{has developed an}} intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants, which is usually considered by observers to satirize other religions. Their primary deity, generally known as Jehovah1, is cast as an extraterrestrial, who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television. Jehovah1 gave him supernatural knowledge {{of the past and}} future, in addition to incredible power. Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers. Some of their discussion <b>centered</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.|$|E
