5|$|In 2006 {{a private}} {{security}} guard {{with a pistol}} pursued on foot two men whom he believed tried to steal scrap metal. The men climbed on a railway embankment and started throwing rocks down at the guard who thereafter shot ten rounds in their direction, mortally wounding {{one of them in}} the head. The guard was first convicted of murder by the Municipal Court in Prague and given a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. The decision was changed by the High Court in Prague to conviction of intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter) and a sentence of five years imprisonment. The guard was finally exonerated by the Supreme Court in Brno which considered his action legitimate self-defense, noting that defense must be <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> intensive than attack in order to be successful, and that the stones and bricks being thrown presented grave danger to the man's life.|$|E
5|$|The plays {{were written}} across thirty-six years of Sophocles' career {{and were not}} {{composed}} in chronological order, but instead were written in the order Antigone, Oedipus Rex, and Oedipus at Colonus. Nor were they composed as a trilogy – a group of plays to be performed together, but are the remaining parts of three different groups of plays. As a result, there are some inconsistencies: notably, Creon is the undisputed king {{at the end of}} Oedipus Rex and, in consultation with Apollo, single-handedly makes the decision to expel Oedipus from Thebes. Creon is also instructed to look after Oedipus' daughters Antigone and Ismene at the end of Oedipus Rex. By contrast, in the other plays there is some struggle with Oedipus' sons Eteocles and Polynices in regard to the succession. In Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles attempts to work these inconsistencies into a coherent whole: Ismene explains that, in light of their tainted family lineage, her brothers were at first willing to cede the throne to Creon. Nevertheless, they eventually decided to take charge of the monarchy, with each brother disputing the other's right to succeed. In addition to being in a <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> powerful position in Oedipus at Colonus, Eteocles and Polynices are also culpable: they consent (l. 429, Theodoridis, tr.) to their father's going to exile, which is one of his bitterest charges against them.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, {{he formed}} the Adrian Rollini Orchestra (a studio group {{assembled}} for recording), which appeared on Perfect, Vocalion, Melotone, Banner, and Romeo labels. While Rollini {{did manage to}} assemble some great talent (for example Bunny Berigan, Benny Goodman and Jack Teagarden), these records were <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> commercial in comparison to his earlier work. Several examples have solo work and proto-swing elements, {{but on the whole}} the records were meant to sell current pop tunes. (A number of sides have Rollini on bass sax only to switch to vibraphone during the song.) At this time Rollini also appeared as vibraphonist with Richard Himber's radio orchestra, playing a strictly secondary role in the large, string-oriented ensemble.|$|E
25|$|Aerotel's patent {{was found}} to relate to a {{patentable}} invention in principle because {{the system as a}} whole was new in itself, not merely because it is to be used for the business of selling phone calls. While this system could be implemented using conventional computers, the key to it was a new physical combination of hardware. The judge felt that this was <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> than just a method of doing business as such. The method claims were construed as relating to a use of the new system and were also deemed to relate to a patentable invention in principle. The additional questions of whether the claimed invention was novel and involved an inventive step were not considered directly by the judge, although the implication is that the invention was at least novel.|$|E
25|$|Amon began 1969 {{with success}} driving the Dino engined Ferrari 246T in the Tasman Series that {{included}} winning both the New Zealand and Australian Grands Prix. He would ultimately win the seven race Tasman Series, finishing with four wins, two thirds and one retirement, but in Formula One his poor luck continued. Despite six starts from top-six positions, {{he was only}} able to achieve a third-place at the Dutch GP. Ferrari's F1 V12 engine was too unreliable and although its replacement had proven very fast in testing, it had suffered many mechanical breakages. Amon {{had no reason to}} believe it would be any more dependable than the V12, so although the new engine was <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> powerful, he decided to leave Ferrari for a Cosworth DFV powered team. Ironically, the new flat-12 engine would become one of the best Formula One engines of the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Wheelbarrows in China came in two types. The {{more common}} type after the 3rd century has a large, {{centrally}} mounted wheel. Prior types were universally front-wheeled wheelbarrows. The central-wheeled wheelbarrow could generally transport six human passengers at once, {{and instead of}} a laborious amount of energy exacted upon the animal or human driver pulling the wheelbarrow, {{the weight of the}} burden was distributed equally between the wheel and the puller. European visitors to China from the 17th century onwards had an appreciation for this, and was given a considerable amount of attention {{by a member of the}} Dutch East India Company, Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest, in his writings of 1797 (who accurately described its design and ability to hold large amounts of heavy baggage). However, the lower carrying surface made the European wheelbarrow <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> useful for short-haul work. As of the 1960s, traditional wheelbarrows in China were still in wide use.|$|E
25|$|He {{came from}} a family of criminals: his father died when he was a child, and his mother died after being riddled by machine gun fire during a botched robbery attempt in his teenage years. He has three younger brothers, a set of {{triplets}} called Tim, Tom and Tumb, who are professional criminals and frequently try to use Bob as the scapegoat in their criminal schemes. Despite this, Bob refuses to follow the criminal career path and frequently berates his brothers for it, despite them being <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> successful than Bob. He stopped berating them after they joined the TNT under The Great Caesar. Bob has a poetic side: he frequently tries to write books or poems that end up being rejected by even the worst publishers and/or ridiculed by other TNT members. He is mostly at odds with Number One for abnormally poor salary and his tyrannical attitude, and he is usually attacked by Number One with his stick when Bob provokes him. Despite this, {{he is one of the}} most trusted TNT agents.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{consider}} Angaturama {{a synonym}} of Irritator, citing {{the fact that}} the remains of Angaturama allegedly seem to complete Irritators skull (meaning that they could belong to the same specimen). However, substantial objection has been raised to this assertion. Kellner and Campos (2000) and Machado and Kellner (2005) both expressed the opinion that the fossils come from two different genera, and that the fossil of Angaturama was <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> laterally flattened than Irritator. A review of both fossils by Sales and Schultz (2017) also noted that the specimens differ in other aspects of their preservation: the Irritator specimen is brighter in color; the Irritator speicmen is affected by a vertical crack while the Angaturama specimen bears many cavities; and the damage to the teeth of the Irritator specimen is much less severe. They also identified a possible point of overlap, the third left maxillary tooth, and observed that the skull of Angaturama may have been larger than that of Irritator based on the proportions of Baryonyx. Nevertheless, although the two specimens evidently do not belong to the same individual, Sales and Schultz noted that synonymy at the genus level would need to be verified by more extensively overlapping remains. If Angaturama and Irritator are actually regarded {{as a member of the}} same genus, Irritator challengeri would be the valid scientific name under rules of priority.|$|E

500|$|Apatosaurus minimus was {{originally}} {{described as a}} specimen of Brontosaurus sp. in 1904 by Osborn.

Wedel published a short abstract describing the material of [...] "A."minimus, finding it hard to place among either Diplodocoidea or Macronaria. While it was placed with Saltasaurus in a phylogenetic analysis, it was thought to represent instead some form with convergent features from many groups. The study of Tschopp etal. did find that a camarasaurid position for the taxon was supported, but noted that the position of the taxon was found to be highly variable and there was no <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> likely position.|$|E
500|$|John Eliot Gardiner, who {{conducted}} the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir in 2000, evaluated the work, connected to Bach's first cantata for Leipzig: this cantata is <b>clearly</b> <b>more</b> than just a sequel to the previous Sunday's ...together they form a diptych revealing a thematic continuity extended over two weeks, with plentiful cross-referencing between the two set Gospels and Epistles beyond the obvious parallels between the injunction to give charitably to the hungry (BWV 75) and of brotherly love manifested in action (BWV 76). He described the works as featuring [...] "a characteristically Lutheran interpretation" [...] of the First Epistle of John. He also noted the depth of metaphorical uses of [...] "eating and drinking", highlighting [...] "the rich man's table, from which Lazarus tried to gather fallen crumbs (BWV 75), standing {{in opposition to the}} [...] "great supper" [...] and God's invitation through Christ to the banquet of eternal life (BWV 76)". Summarising both pieces, Gardiner wrote: evidently a lot of thought and pre-planning had gone on while Bach was still in Köthen, as well as discussions with his unknown librettist and possibly with representatives of the Leipzig clergy, before he could set the style, tone and narrative shaping of these two impressive works.|$|E
