5|$|Given that FH {{is present}} from birth and {{atherosclerotic}} changes may begin early in life, {{it is sometimes}} necessary to treat adolescents or even teenagers with agents that were originally developed for adults. Due to safety concerns, many physicians prefer to use bile acid sequestrants and fenofibrate as these are licensed in children. Nevertheless, statins seem safe and effective, and in older <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used as in adults.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E

Thus, a <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> covered by Medicaid based on his individual status even if his parents are not eligible. Similarly, if a child lives with someone other than a parent, he <b>may</b> still <b>be</b> eligible based on its individual status.|$|R
5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. <b>Children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E

25|$|Interventions include {{supporting}} {{foster parents}} {{to learn to}} help the child in regulating emotions, to learn to respond effectively to the child's distress and to understand the child's signals, especially 'miscues' as the signals of such children are often confusing {{as a consequence of}} their often frightening, inconsistent and confusing past relationships. Foster carers are taught to recognize what such children actually need rather than what they may appear to signal that they need. Such children often exhibit provocative and oppositional behaviors which may normally trigger feelings of rejection in caregivers. Withdrawn <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> overlooked and seemingly independent, indiscriminate <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> considered to be managing much better than they are. Foster carers are regularly contacted and visited to assess their needs and progress.|$|E

25|$|Hookworm {{infection}} is an infection by {{a type of}} intestinal parasite in the roundworm group. Initially there may be itching and a rash {{at the site of}} infection. There may be no symptoms in those only affected by a few worms. In those infected by many worms there may be abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and feeling tired. The mental and physical development of <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> affected. Anemia may result.|$|E
25|$|When {{a parent}} or {{caregiver}} dies or leaves, children may have symptoms of psychopathology, but they are less severe than in children with major depression.

A very young child, under one or two, may be found to have no reaction if a carer dies, but other <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> affected by the loss.|$|E

25|$|A {{binary tree}} is a rooted tree {{that is also}} an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree {{naturally}} imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> defined as the nodes connected to it a level below. Ordering of these children (e.g., by drawing them on a plane) makes possible to distinguish left child from right child. But this still doesn't distinguish between a node with left but not a right child from a one with right but no left child.|$|E
25|$|In some Central African areas, {{malicious}} magic {{users are}} believed by locals {{to be the}} source of terminal illness such as AIDS and cancer. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally physical and psychological abuse. <b>Children</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.|$|E
25|$|According to {{credible}} {{local press}} reports, dozens of child {{victims of violence}} from poor families are lodged in juvenile detention centers under judicial protection orders.
