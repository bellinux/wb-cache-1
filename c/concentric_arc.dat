40|$|Studies on {{the tool}} path {{generation}} for {{free form surface}} have been conducted extensively {{and most of these}} studies were focused on the effect of tool path generation on the tool wear and surface texture. In this study, the effect of tool path generation on tool wear, surface finish, machining time and dimensional accuracy were evaluated during ball end milling of a mold cavity. UGS CAD/CAM software was used to simulate the tool path and actual during machining at various cutting parameters was conducted on CNC machining centre to machine a concave shape of the mold-cavity component. Work piece of 6061 aluminium alloy and HSS ball end mill were used in this study. Four types of tool path strategies were investigated; they are Follow Periphery, Parallel Line, <b>Concentric</b> <b>Arc</b> and Radial Lines. Result showed that the highest value of 0. 04 pm flank wear was obtained when using <b>Concentric</b> <b>Arc</b> and the lowest value of 0. 01 pm was recorded with Parallel Line. Follow Periphery tool path strategy demonstrates the shortest machining time of 115 min and radial line recorded the longest machining time of 352 min. Radial Line and Follow Periphery recorded the lowest and highest surface roughness of 0. 95 pm and 2 - 76 pm respectively. In average, the smallest error value in dimension was from Radial Line strategy with 0. 04 % while the biggest error was recorded using Follow Periphery with 0. 6 %. Based on the result obtained, it can be concluded that Parallel Line and Radial Line produce lower tool wear, smaller error in dimensional accuracy and better in surface finish but longer in cutting time while Follow Periphery and <b>Concentric</b> <b>Arc</b> produce shorter cutting time, higher tool wear, bigger error in dimensional accuracy and poor in surface finish...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe set P of all {{probability}} measures σ {{on the unit}} circle T splits into three disjoint subsets depending on properties of the derived set of {|ϕn| 2 dσ}n⩾ 0, denoted by Lim(σ). Here {ϕn}n⩾ 0 are orthogonal polynomials in L 2 (dσ). The first subset is the set of Rakhmanov measures, i. e., of σ∈P with {m}=Lim(σ), m being the normalized (m(T) = 1) Lebesgue measure on T. The second subset Mar(T) consists of Markoff measures, i. e., of σ∈P with m∉Lim(σ), and {{is in fact the}} subject of study for the present paper. A measure σ, belongs to Mar(T) iff there are ε> 0 and l> 0 such that sup{|an+j|: 0 ⩽j⩽l}>ε, n= 0, 1, 2,…,{an} is the Geronimus parameters (=reflectioncoefficients) of σ. We use this equivalence to describe the asymptotic behavior of the zeros of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials (see Theorem G). The third subset consists of σ∈P with {m}⫋Lim(σ). We show that σ is ratio asymptotic iff either σ is a Rakhmanov measure or σ satisfies the López condition (which implies σ∈Mar(T)). Measures σ satisfying Lim(σ) ={ν} (i. e., weakly asymptotic measures) are also classified. Either ν is the sum of equal point masses placed at the roots of zn=λ, λ∈T, n= 1, 2,…, or ν is the equilibrium measure (with respect to the logarithmic kernel) for the inverse image under an m-preserving endomorphism z→zn, n= 1, 2,…, of a closed arc J (including J=T) with removed open <b>concentric</b> <b>arc</b> J 0 (including J 0 =∅). Next, weakly asymptotic measures are completely described in terms of their Geronimus parameters. Finally, we obtain explicit formulae for the parameters of the equilibrium measures ν and show that these measures satisfy {ν}=Lim(ν) ...|$|E

We then measured the amount of motion of local structures and the signature <b>concentric</b> <b>arcs</b> by determining their relative shifts over the 7. 25 yr interval. Based on our analysis, which does not rely on the single-scattering assumption, we concluded that the lobes have been excavated by a linear expansion along the bipolar axis for the past 400 yr, while the <b>concentric</b> <b>arcs</b> have been generated continuously and moving out radially at about 10 km/s for the past 5, 500 yr, and there appears to be a colatitudinally-increasing trend in the radial expansion velocity field of the <b>concentric</b> <b>arcs.</b> There exist numerical investigations into the mass-loss modulation by the central binary system, which predict such a colatitudinally-increasing expansion velocity field in the spiral-shock trails of the mass-loss ejecta.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method that computes a {{conformal}} mapping from a multiply connected mesh to the so-called slit domain, which consists of a canonical rectangle or disk in which 3 D curved landmarks on the original surfaces are mapped to concentric or parallel lines in the slit domain. In this paper, we studied its application to brain surface parameterization. After cutting along some landmark curve features on surface models of the cerebral cortex, we obtain multiple connected domains. By computing exact harmonic one-forms, closed harmonic one-forms, and holomorphic one-forms, {{we are able to}} build a circular slit mapping that conformally maps the surface to an annulus with some <b>concentric</b> <b>arcs</b> and a rectangle with some slits. The whole algorithm is based on solving linear systems so it is very stable. In the slit domain parameterization results, the feature curves are either mapped to straight lines or <b>concentric</b> <b>arcs.</b> This representation is convenient for anatomical visualization, and may assist statistical comparisons of anatomy, surface-based registration and signal processing. Preliminary experimental results parameterizing various brain anatomical surfaces are presented. ...|$|R

We {{assume that the}} lead vehicle linear and angular velocities are unknown constant parameters.

The only information the robot vehicle can use for feedback control is the relative position and orientation with respect to the lead vehicle obtained from onboard sensing. The control velocities of the ego-vehicle are computed using the leader velocity estimates obtained from the dynamic part of the proposed controller. The proposed adaptive control law achieves asymptotic stabilization of the closed-loop system in error coordinates.
