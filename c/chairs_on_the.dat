5|$|When {{given the}} {{opportunity}} to host a public reception for President McKinley, fair organizers chose to site it in the Temple of Music—Louis L. Babcock, grand marshal of the Exposition, regarded the building as ideal for the purpose. The large auditorium was located close to the Esplanade, {{in the heart of the}} fair, and had doorways on each of its four sides. In addition to rows of <b>chairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of the hall, it had spacious galleries. Babcock spent the morning of September 6 making some physical arrangements for the reception. Floor seating was removed to create a broad aisle, running from the east doors through which the public would be admitted, to where McKinley would stand. Once members of the public shook hands with McKinley, they would continue on to exit the building. An American flag was draped behind the President, both to screen him from behind and for decoration—several potted plants were arrayed around his place to create an attractive scene. Besides its utility for other purposes, the ornate building was one of the architectural features of the fair.|$|E

In May 2015 all seven of the original members of S Club 7 reunited in an arena tour, entitled Bring It All Back 2015. On 12 March 2015, Stevens appeared on BBC Radio 1's Innuendo Bingo.|$|E

25|$|On the {{edition of}} October 29 of Raw, Shane McMahon told his father, Vince McMahon, that {{a member of}} the WWF would jump ship to the Alliance that night. Later that same night, Kurt Angle backstabbed the WWF by hitting Jericho, The Rock, Undertaker, and Kane with steel <b>chairs.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> edition of November 1 of SmackDown!, Angle, who {{originally}} led the WWF wrestlers, explained that he represented what is great about America—he was a winner, and his defection came from his decision to fight along the winning side. That side included Steve Austin, a man Angle claimed knew how to win.|$|E
25|$|Regardless, {{the plans}} of Wagenknecht, Reed & Co. {{to fight it}} out at the 1919 Emergency National Convention {{continued}} apace. With the most radical state organizations effectively purged by the Regulars (Massachusetts, Minnesota) or unable to participate (Ohio, Michigan), and the Left Wing language federations suspended, a big majority of the hastily elected delegates to the gathering were controlled by the Executive Secretary Adolph Germer and the Regulars. A group of Left Wingers without delegate credentials, including John Reed and his sidekick Benjamin Gitlow, {{made an effort to}} occupy <b>chairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> convention floor before the gathering was called into order. The incumbents were unable to block the Left Wingers at the door, but soon called the already present police to their aid, and the officers of the law obligingly expelled the boisterous radicals from the hall. With the Credentials Committee firmly {{in the hands of the}} Regulars from the outset, the outcome of the gathering was no longer in doubt and most of the remaining Left Wing delegates departed, to meet with other co-thinkers downstairs in a previously reserved room in a parallel convention. It was this gathering which established itself as the Communist Labor Party on August 31, 1919.|$|E
500|$|The debating chamber {{contains}} a shallow elliptical horseshoe of seating for the MSPs, with the governing party or parties {{sitting in the}} middle of the semicircle and opposition parties on either side, similar to other European legislatures. Such a layout is intended to blur political divisions and principally reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members. This is in contrast to the [...] "adversarial" [...] layout reminiscent of other Westminster style national legislatures, including the House of Commons, where government and opposition sit apart and facing one another. There are 131 desks and <b>chairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of the chamber for all the elected members of the Scottish Parliament and members of the Scottish Government. The desks are constructed out of oak and sycamore and are fitted with a lectern, a microphone and in-built speakers as well as the electronic voting equipment used by MSPs. Galleries above the main floor can accommodate a total of 255 members of the public, 18 guests and 34 members of the press.|$|E

2500|$|Not all {{response}} was positive. The Futon Critic, in a June 14, 2007 {{review of the}} pilot episode, declared [...] "it's actually far more ingrained into the Terminator mythology than you'd expect," [...] but stated [...] "this installment feels less like a 'pilot' and more like an excuse to rearrange the deck <b>chairs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'Terminator' franchise to potentially have a TV show." [...] One negative report from La Lámina Corredora reported [...] "the pilot feels too much like a cheap remake of [...]" [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle derided the entire conceptualization and production of the series. Though limited to his viewing {{of the first two}} episodes, Goodman leveled criticism against Fox for having [...] "taken the wholly predictable course of putting a lot of money into explosions and regenerating cyborgs" [...] but not having [...] "paid much attention to plot, casting or writing." ...|$|E
