40|$|Consolidated {{financial}} statements present aggregated information for parent {{company and its}} subsidiaries. For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, International Financial Reporting Standards require non-controlling interest to be presented within <b>consolidated</b> <b>equity</b> to distinguish it from the amount of equity attributable to the shareholders of the parent. Since 2014, new standards on consolidation introduced broadened disclosure requirements for subsidiaries with material non-controlling interest. Definition of material non-controlling interest however {{is not included in}} the standards. The article provides the analysis of the {{financial statements}} published by companies listed on Prague Stock Exchange. Main focus is given to assessment criteria applied to identify material non-controlling interest. Consequently, study of compliance with the disclosure requirements for selected companies has been undertaken. The results of the analysis indicate whether value relevance of financial statements has been improved {{as a result of the}} new disclosures...|$|E

40|$|Standards (IFRS) by BEL- 20 {{companies}} in Belgium. The research analyses the application oflFRS in the {{consolidated financial statements}} of Belgian publicly traded companies. In Belgium, as in several other continental European countries, a close link exists between accounting and taxation. The study provides insight into IFRS implementation problems based on a survey sent to BEL- 20 companies. The survey focused on the impact that IFRS conversion has on companies, their internal organization and accounting and finance strategy. The benefits and challenges of the adoption of IFRS are analysed, {{as well as the}} level of understanding and experience with IFRS, perception of the quality of IFRS, and the impact of adoption of IFRS on <b>consolidated</b> <b>equity</b> and net income. Principal differences between IFRS and Belgian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), having a major impact on the conversion to IFRS, are identified. This study should be important not only to the European Union (EU) countries but to countries which will join the EU in the future, and to other countries worldwide that are adopting IFRS. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Equity focused health impact {{assessments}} (EFHIAs), {{or health}} equity impact assessments, are being increasingly promoted internationally {{as a mechanism}} for enhancing the consideration of health equity {{in the development of}} policies, programs and projects. Despite this there are relatively few examples of examples of completed EFHIAs available. This paper presents a case study of a rapid EFHIA that was conducted in Australia on a health promotion policy implementation plan. It briefly describes the process and findings of the EFHIA and evaluates the impact on decision-making and implementation. Methods The rapid EFHIA was undertaken in four days, drawing on an expert panel and limited review of the literature. A process evaluation was undertaken by email one month after the EFHIA was completed. An impact evaluation was undertaken two years later based on five semi-structured interviews with members of the EFHIA working group and policy officers and managers responsible for implementing the plan. A cost estimation was conducted by the EFHIA working group. Findings The EFHIA made both general and specific recommendations about how the health equity impacts of the policy implementation plan could be improved. The impact evaluation identified changes to development and implementation that occurred {{as a result of the}} EFHIA, though there was disagreement about the extent to which changes could be attributed solely to the EFHIA. Those responsible considered the recommendations of the EFHIA in the next versions of their ABHI implementation plans. Factors that influenced the impact of the EFHIA included <b>consolidating</b> understandings of <b>equity,</b> enabling discussion of alternatives, and differing understandings of the purpose of the EFHIA. The EFHIA cost US$ 4, 036 to undertake. Conclusions This EFHIA was conducted in a short timeframe using relatively few resources. It had some reported impacts on the development of the implementation plan and enhanced overall consideration of health equity. This case highlights some of the factors and preconditions that may maximise the impact of future EFHIAs on decision-making and implementation. </p...|$|R
