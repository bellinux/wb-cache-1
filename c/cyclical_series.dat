Because the value observed at time t may depend on values observed at previous time points, time series data may violate independence assumptions. An ARIMA(p, d, q) model can account for temporal dependence in several ways. First, the time series is differenced to render it stationary, by taking d differences. Second, the time dependence of the stationary process is modeled by including p auto-regressive and q moving-average terms, in addition to any time-varying covariates. For a <b>cyclical</b> time <b>series,</b> these steps can be repeated according to the period of the cycle, whether quarterly or monthly or another time interval. ARIMA models are extremely flexible for continuous data.

40|$|Gali (1999) used a VAR with {{productivity}} and hours worked {{to argue that}} technology shocks are negatively correlated with labor and are unimportant for the business cycle. More recently, Beaudry and Portier (2003) studied a VAR in {{productivity and}} stock prices. Remarkably, {{they found that the}} component which has a permanent impact on productivity is almost identical to that which has no immediate impact on productivity. Moreover, either of these components explains most business cycle variation. Like Gali's results, these observations are inconsistent with early RBC models, {{but on the other hand}} they contradict Gali's claim that technology shocks are unimportant for cycles. In this paper, we study trivariate VARs in productivity, hours worked, and stock prices to see how these apparently contradictory results can be reconciled. We find one VAR specification that qualitatively and quantitatively matches the findings of Gali (so that long-run technology shocks drive hours down), and a second specification that matches the main findings of Beaudry and Portier (so that long-run technology shocks increase hours, are similar to the short-run shock to stock prices, and play a major role in generating business cycles). Surprisingly, the difference between these two specifications has nothing to do with estimating in levels or in differences, or with running VARs or VECMs, or with the ordering of variables. The only difference between the two specifications lies in which productivity variable is used: labor productivity (to generate results like Gali's) or TFP (to generate results like those of Beaudry and Portier). Both the original Beaudry and Portier estimations, as well as our findings on the productivity specification, add to the evidence that Gali's findings are not robust.

40|$|A major aim {{of recent}} {{empirical}} modelling {{of the business}} cycle is to identify {{the relative importance of}} aggregate supply and demand shocks. Supply or technology shocks are associated with permanent (structural) effects on economic activity whereas demand shocks are related to temporary (cyclical) effects. Most studies in this vein use multivariate VAR ­models or the common trends- cointegration approach in order to disentangle supply and demand shocks. As an alternative, this paper uses the methodology of unobserved (or structural) components time series models as set out in Harvey (1989) for identification of technology and demand shocks in a two equation system of labour productivity and industrial output. The novelty is the introduction of correlation between the two types of shocks such that the mutual dependency of these shocks can be estimated explicitly. This is because technology shocks will have cyclical (temporary) effects, and demand shocks will have structural (permanent) effects, which are not fully described by the interaction of the endogenous variables in the model. The estimation procedure is set out in Koopman et al. (1995). The data is quarterly time series of labour productivity and industrial output for France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our results show that the covariance of the dynamics of supply and demand shocks appears to be important in these countries.

40|$|The {{question}} addressed {{is whether}} or not childhood epidemics such as measles and chickenpox are characterized by low-dimensional chaos. We propose a new method for the detection and extraction of hidden periodic components embedded in an irregular <b>cyclical</b> <b>series,</b> and study the characterization of the epidemiological series in terms of the characteristic features or periodicity attributes of the extracted components.

The chickenpox series has one seasonal component with stable pattern, and the process is deterministic but linear, and hence non-chaotic.

The process dynamics is also studied using seasonally forced SEIR epidemic model, and the characterization performance of the proposed schemes is assessed...|$|E

We apply a Monte Carlo experiment to show that the detection accuracy of HMMs is highly improved when combined with the wavelet approach. Further simulations demonstrate the excellent accuracy of this improved HMM method relative to another two change point detection algorithms.

Each of these assumptions distorts model outcomes in specific ways. These assumptions have implications for total cow and heifer inventories, especially when viewed as a series of decisions over inventory and price cycles.

Teacher cognition {{studies are}} {{rare in the}} mainland Chinese context; they are also rare in other contexts similarly defined by common features such as non-native speaking language teachers, large classes, publicly-funded institutions, and mandated curricula or materials. This broadly qualitative investigation of three tertiary-level Chinese English teachers sought to elicit views and beliefs about language learning and teaching, their sources, and their links with classroom behaviour. A <b>cyclical</b> <b>series</b> of data collection (including autobiographical writing, interviews, lesson observations and stimulated-recall interviews, documentary data, and a group discussion) was employed to produce four linked studies: three individual case studies and a cross-case study. Interpretive data analysis, achieved {{through a process of}} constant comparison, was employed to reveal each teacher's views and beliefs.

The second is to describe an on-going Action Research Project (the Project), the purpose of which has been to increase the academic success rates of educationally disadvantaged students in accounting and business courses. The Project is part of an Alternative Admissions Program (AAP) located at a mid-sized public university in the Northeast United States. The Project has involved a small sub-set of students in the AAP who expressed an interest in majoring in business or accounting. The Project description covers a period of eight years during which time the authors engaged in a <b>cyclical</b> <b>series</b> of action steps including planning, acting, observing and reflecting (Grundy, 1988). Based upon qualitative data gathering through observation of student behavior, and through completion of certain assessment forms, frequent changes were made to teaching methods and the general conduct of the Project. The Project’s success has been attributable in part to smaller class sizes and individual attention. However, engaging students in positive learning experiences has also been important. While the numbers are small, we feel that the Project has contributed to improving the lives of the students involved. Throughout this Project, our hope has been that as the expectation levels of educationally disadvantaged students grow, they will in turn be motivated towards higher levels of academic achievement, thus permanently removing the educationally disadvantaged stigma. 1 2 Baker and Logan Key words: action research, accounting education, educationally disadvantaged students, minority student...|$|E

I examined whether the participants’ backgrounds impacted their perceptions of songwriting, whether participants valued songwriting, whether meanings emerged from the songwriting process, and what strategies emerged through the process. Qualitative methods were used in gathering data, which included interviews, journals, conversations, observation field notes, e-mails, and songwriting artifacts. The data were coded through a <b>cyclical</b> <b>series</b> of transcription and analysis and slowly a research story began to emerge (Saldaña, 2009). The seven participants were worship and music majors at a southern Christian University in an undergraduate songwriting survey class.

Narrative analysis revealed that participants constructed meaning through the process of songwriting. The backgrounds of the participants helped in shaping the subjects of their songs often involving hardships. Participants storied the tension between the initial stage of songwriting and the revisions to follow. Songwriting became a narrative expression of their experience of spiritual awakening. Through reflection during the songwriting process they found greater connection with God. In the process the participants constructed their songs using tone painting to shape their melodies to express their lyrics and metaphors to enliven their lyrics. Participants made use of various recording devices to capture initial ideas before they forgot them, and noted a preference for working with pen and paper in the songwriting process.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] Quaternary period has been characterised by a <b>cyclical</b> <b>series</b> of glaciations, which are attributed to {{the change in the}} insolation (incoming solar radiation) from changes in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. The spectral power in the climate record is very {{different from that of the}} orbital forcing: prior to 1000 kyr before present most of the spectral power is in the 41 kyr band while since then the power has been in the 100 kyr band. The change defines the middle Pleistocene transition (MPT). The MPT does not indicate any noticeable difference in the orbital forcing. The climate response to the insolation is thus far from linear, and appears to be structurally different before and after the MPT. This paper presents a low order conceptual model for the oscillatory dynamics of the ice sheets in terms of a relaxation oscillator with multiple levels subject to the Milankovitch forcing. The model exhibits smooth transitions between three different climate states; an interglacial (i), a mild glacial (g) and a deep glacial (G) as proposed by Paillard (Nature 391 : 378 – 381, 1998). The model suggests a dynamical explanation in terms of the structure of a slow manifold for the observed allowed and “forbidden” transitions between the three climate states. With the model, the pacing of the climate oscillations by the astronomical forcing is through the mechanism of phase-resetting of relaxation oscillations in which the internal phase of the oscillation is affected by the forcing. In spite of its simplicity as a forced ODE, the model is able to reproduce not only general features but also many of the details of oscillations observed in the climate record. A particular novelty is that it includes a slow drift in the form of the slow manifold that reproduces the observed dynamical change at the MPT. We explain this change in terms of a transcritical bifurcation in the fast dynamics on varying the slow variable; this bifurcation can induce a sudden change in periodicity and amplitude of the cycle and we suggest that this is associated with a branch of “canard oscillations” that appear for a small range of parameters. The model is remarkably robust at simulating the climate record before, during and after the MPT. Even though the conceptual model does not point to specific mechanisms, the physical implication is that the major reorganisation of the climate response to the orbital forcing does not necessarily imply that there was a big change in the environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis puts {{forth the}} means of a {{strategic}} approach to address a persistent problem in the energy system and in this way, to transition the built environment to a future state that is more exergy-aware to curb CO 2 emissions. Such a vision is {{made possible by the}} six-fold contributions of the research work: I) An analytical model is developed, which for the first time, formulates the CO 2 emissions that are compounded in the energy system {{as a function of the}} systematic failures to match the supply and demand of exergy. This model is namely the Rational Exergy Management Model or REMM. II) REMM is then applied to analyze the pathways in which it is possible to lead the built environment into addressing structural overshoots in its exergy supply to curb CO 2 emissions. The cases that embody these pathways are also analyzed over a base case, including cases for sustainable heating and cooling. III) New tools are designed to augment decision-making and exemplify a paradigm shift in the more rational usage of exergy to curb CO 2 emissions. These include a scenario-based analysis tool, new options for CO 2 wedges, and a multi-fold solution space for CO 2 mitigation strategies based on REMM. IV) The concept of a net-zero exergy building (NZEXB) is developed and related to REMM strategies as the building block of an exergy-aware energy system. The target of a NZEXB is further supported by key design principles, which address shortcomings in state-of-the-art net-zero design. V) A premier building that deployed the key design principles to integrate building technology in an innovative, exergy-aware design and received LEED Platinum is analyzed on the basis of the NZEXB target. The results validate that this building boosts net self-sufficiency and curbs compound CO 2 emissions, which are then presented in a proposed scheme to benchmark and/or label future NZEXBs. VI) Based on the scalability of the best-practices of the NZEXB ready building, the means to realize a smarter energy system that has exergy-aware relations in each aspect of the value chain to curb CO 2 emissions are discussed. This includes a target for such a network at the community level, namely a net-zero exergy community (NZEXC). As a whole, the results of the thesis indicate that the strategic approach as provided by REMM and the NZEXB target of the research work has the potential to steer the speed and direction of societal action to curb CO 2 emissions. The thesis concludes with a roadmap that represents a <b>cyclical</b> <b>series</b> of actions that may be scaled-up at various levels of the built environment in a transition to be in better balance with the Planet.
