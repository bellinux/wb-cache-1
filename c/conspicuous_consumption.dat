Because of this, the nobility food was {{more prone to}} foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited <b>conspicuous</b> <b>consumption</b> among the nouveaux riches. Social norms also dictated that the food {{of the working class}} be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labour and one's food; manual labour required coarser, cheaper food.|$|E

In 1282 he attempted to mediate between the Welsh and King Edward, but given that Edward would not budge on the main issues, it was a hopeless mission. In the end, Peckham excommunicated some of the Welsh who were resisting Edward, not unsurprising given Peckham's views of the Welsh. Peckham visited the Welsh dioceses {{as part of his}} tour of all his subordinate dioceses. While there, Peckham criticised the Welsh clergy for their unchaste lives, <b>conspicuous</b> <b>consumption,</b> and heavy drinking. He also found the Welsh clergy to be uneducated, although he did order a Welsh-speaking suffragan bishop to be appointed to help with pastoral duties in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. Peckham also criticised the Welsh people as a whole, contrasting their pastoral economy with the farming-based economy of England, and finding the Welsh to be lazy and idle.|$|E

Analogous to the consumer trend for oversized houses is the trend towards buying oversized light-trucks, specifically the off-road sport-utility vehicle type (cf. station wagon and estate car), as a form of psychologically comforting <b>conspicuous</b> <b>consumption,</b> because such big motor-vehicles usually are bought by people who reside in a city, an urban nuclear family.|$|E

A significant part of this usage is related to cleanliness practices that are steadily changing toward more frequent showers and clothes washing. These trends will inevitably lead to still greater water and energy consumption.

The conceptual perspective of this work is primarily predicated upon consumer theory that encompass modern and late modern <b>consumption,</b> <b>conspicuous</b> and ordinary <b>consumption,</b> and risk handling and hedonism in everyday life. Analysis shows that cleanliness practices are handed down from parents to children and also are subject to strong peer-group influence. Furthermore, the practices may involve considerations about risk handling in everyday life related to health issues. However, broader notions of sustainability are seldom reflected.

In Utility from Accumulation (2009), Louis Kaplow said that assets exercise an objective social-utility function, i.e. the rich man and the rich woman hoard material assets, because the hoard, itself, functions as status goods that establish his and her socio-economic position within society. When utility is derived directly from accumulation of assets, this lowers the dead weight loss associated with inheritance taxes and raises the optimal rate of inheritance taxation.|$|E

We build a discrete choice model with binary dependent variables, which employs {{the data from the}} omnibus research in the Czech Republic and determines a probability of a certain action by certain individuals with common characteristics.

40|$|By {{the logic}} of many {{theories}} of organization, the dominance of large firms in an industry should hinder the emergence and operation of small specialist firms.

Within the perspective of organizational ecology, the theory fragment known as resource partitioning views these two trends as interdependent. The theory holds that under certain environmental and organizational conditions, the increased dominance of large firms in an industry will enhance the life chances of specialist organizations. Here, we examine this theory and the evidence that has been offered in its support. We discuss four different mechanisms that produce resource partitioning: location, customization, anti-mass-production cultural sentiment, and <b>conspicuous</b> status <b>consumption.</b> We also explore empirical issues involved in investigating these mechanisms. Finally, we describe some interesting and little investigated problems of the theory...|$|R

40|$|The rising {{consumer}} {{thirst for}} guilt-free consumption has drawn great attention from both academia and marketers. As {{a growing number}} of consumers look beyond their pocketbooks to broader societal and environmental issues, such as economic recession and environmental degradation, they are increasingly concerned about the negative impacts that their consumption has on the society and the planet, which lead them to experience a sense of guilt. This sense of guilt is specifically associated with luxury consumption. As the values of luxury consumers evolve from having to being, they become skeptical about purchasing luxury brands that appeal to their extrinsic values and trigger guilty feelings; Instead, become more favorable to purchasing luxury brands that embody their intrinsic values (i. e., seeking personal style, social-consciousness, and environmental-consciousness), which allows them to assuage guilty feelings caused by the undesirable consequences of <b>conspicuous</b> luxury <b>consumption.</b> Despite the recent consumer trend of guilt-free consumption, less is understood on what intrinsic or extrinsic values and individual traits lead consumers to feel a less or more intensity of guilt. To address this void, we employ decision tree modeling to profile luxury fashion consumers into high guilt (HG) and low guilt (LG) groups and identify the significant values and demographics associated with each group. Referring to the key intrinsic (or extrinsic) values and demographics related to HG, opposed to LG, may contribute to luxury brand marketers in developing effective guilt-reducing strategies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} three food-centred {{spaces in}} London. Drawing on theoretical perspectives from sociology, geography, urban design and morphology, it explores the spatial and social {{transformation of the}} Borough Market, Broadway Market and Exmouth Market areas through the revival of their food markets. Using a mix of methods including interviews, observations, mapping and urban design analysis, the case study-based research situates these neighbourhoods along a continuum of food quarter development. The work reflects on the quarters not only as fast gentrifying locations in which renewal is grounded in new forms of <b>conspicuous</b> food <b>consumption,</b> but as places that also support changing - and potentially less alienating - relationships between sustainable urban form, urban design context and convivial social processes focused on food. It is argued that the aspatiality of much sociological research into foodscapes tends to underemphasise the connections between the physical and the social, which in the three food quarters are nuanced and complicated. On the one hand, food quarters are experienced by some, after Bourdieu (1984), as 'mini habituses' (Bridge, 2006) in which identity construction is linked to distinction based on food, and modelled on particular forms of food consumption. On the other hand, despite sometimes 'idealised narratives' (Butler, 2007) of community' formation, food quarters may {{also make a contribution}} to developing more sustainable cities, by supporting and nurturing convivial socio-spatial food practices that sometimes transcend commodification. In particular, the thesis explores how compact city design, founded on a strong sense of place, underpins local economic vitality, and informs the richness of experiences of food and eating. The thesis concludes that despite some gentrifying effects, the food quarters are in certain respects defying dominant spatialised trends evident in London, to develop in a more convivial, gastronomically rich and sustainable way...|$|R
30|$|Testimony of {{this kind}} about the scale of {{informal}} extraction from the private mines could easily be multiplied. In part, these moneys were used to fund legitimate state activities. Shenmu and Fugu in particular ploughed large sums raised through “donations” into providing free {{health care and education}} for local residents as well as social security payments. But it seems that often these ad-hoc levies on mine owners were used for what may be best described as <b>conspicuous</b> government <b>consumption.</b> When the Linfen City Public Security Bureau wanted to construct a new administrative building, it sent its staff out to collect fines from coal bosses. Everyone was given a collection target, including staff from offices entirely unrelated to mining. Over RMB 100 million was thus raised. Collection of fines was only reigned in after someone deposited a package of explosives in the Bureau’s courtyard (Oriental Outlook, 2008). In 2003 in Xingren County, Guizhou, the county head financed a large cultural festival with “voluntary” donations from mines (Southern Metropolis Daily 2006), while back in Linfen Prefecture, a county head obliged local mines to “donate” up to several million yuan each to finance the construction of a replica of Tian’anmen Square as well as what is apparently the world’s tallest ceremonial gate complex. Extraction by individual officials proceeded in similar ways. Much probably took place through bribes, especially when licenses had to be obtained or renewed, or in the context of “handling” mine accidents. Thus, the former Head of the Henan Coal Mine Safety Inspectorate amassed at least RMB 19 million in bribes over an 8 -year period in the mid- 2000 s (Caixin Online 2010). But probably even more prevalent was stockholding by officials and their relatives in mines. In 2005, this was made illegal as were cadres. Extraction by individual officials proceeded in similar ways.

40|$|In recent years, {{the luxury}} market has entered {{a period of}} very modest growth, which has been dubbed the ‘new normal’, where varying tourist flows, {{currency}} fluctuations, and shifted consumer tastes dictate the terms. The modern luxury consumer is a fickle mistress. Especially millennials – people born in the 1980 s and 1990 s – are the embodiment of this new form of demanding luxury consumer with particular tastes and values. Modern consumers, and specifically millennials, want experiences and free time, and are interested in a brand’s societal position and environmental impact. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate what the luxury value perceptions of millennials in higher education are in Europe, seeing {{as many of the}} most prominent luxury goods companies in the world originate from Europe. Perceived luxury value is herein examined from the individual’s perspective. As values and value perceptions are complex constructs, using qualitative research methods is justifiable. The data for thesis has been gathered by means of a group interview. The interview participants all study hospitality management in a private college, and each represent a different nationality. Cultural theories and research on luxury and luxury values provide the scientific foundation for this thesis, and a multidimensional luxury value model is used as a theoretical tool in sorting and analyzing the data. The results show that millennials in Europe value much more than simply modern and hard luxury. Functional, financial, individual, and social aspects are all present in perceived luxury value, but some more in a negative sense than others. <b>Conspicuous,</b> status-seeking <b>consumption</b> is mostly frowned upon, as is the consumption of luxury goods for the sake of satisfying social requisites and peer pressure. Most of the positive value perceptions are attributed to the functional dimension, as luxury products are seen to come with a promise of high quality and reliability, which justifies any price premiums. Ecological and ethical aspects of luxury are already a contemporary trend, but perceived even more as an important characteristic of luxury in the future. Most importantly, having time is fundamental. Depending on who is asked, luxury can mean anything, just as much as it can mean nothing...|$|R
40|$|This paper shall {{introduce}} a new phenomenon about consumption. This is related to consumption of characters like Mickey Mouse and Hello, Kitty. The phenomenon appears prominently in Japan. In order to examine consumption of characters and the strategies for creating characters, we conducted a case study {{on a set of}} marketing strategies of a toy manufacturer in Japan. Traditionally, consumption research is asserted using the uni-methodological paradigm. The uni-methodological paradigm here means that researchers have a methodological exclusiveness stance to any other research approaches. Hirschman and Holbrook (1992) distinguish five non-interchangeable research approaches on consumer research. For instance, from an economic point of view, consumption could be assumed as a problem solving method to increase utility. Baudrillard (1968, 1970) criticized this type of functional consumption. Researchers have often denied the other approaches competitive to their own approaches rather than incorporating them. Character consumption cannot be revealed by such an insulated research stance because consumers would like to consume characters for multidimensional reasons. They consume characters to enhance their utilities. In addition, characters stimulate consumers’ sentiments. The possession desire is satisfied by consuming characters. Possessing character goods can create small interest groups and stimulate communication among the group members. Consuming characters is assumed to involve multidimensional aspects: functional, <b>conspicuous,</b> and semiotic <b>consumption.</b> As a result, once we try to understand character consumption, we have to employ the multidisciplinary approach in contrast to the unimethodological paradigm. Through our case study, we revealed the distinctive marketing strategies in the business of characters. It is necessary for marketers of character goods to regard character consumption as having functional, conspicuous, and semiotic aspects. We can find distinctive characteristics in the market research, product development, advertising, and communication strategies in the process of creating characters...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{behaviour}} {{has always}} been the focus of academic marketing research due to its significant managerial implications; even so, various aspects worth analyzing have been neglected. Size heuristics is one of the topics that did not receive sufficient attention so far. Apart from the theoretical contribution to the marketing filed, this topic has practical implications in the buying decision process {{as well as in the}} context of environmental concern. If size does influence the evaluation of a product, would it not lead to a contradiction with the general concern regarding a more sustainable consumption? By identifying this gap in the literature, the present study proposes that there is indeed a link between the size of a product and the perceptions that consumers form upon its quality, desirability and willingness to pay for it. Through a web – based survey using two product categories - apartments and cars - this study examines whether the preferences for larger or smaller stimuli leads to differences in evaluating a product. The analysis shows a positive association between the preference for large items and the impact on desirability. However, this association could not be established for the other two variables. The reasons behind a preference for larger items are also investigated. The authors propose three possible explanatory reasons: utilitarian, <b>conspicuous</b> and hedonic <b>consumption.</b> When the apartments category was investigated, utilitarian reasons were found to be a motivation for purchasing a larger version. On the other hand, conspicuous reasons were found to influence the preference for a larger version in the cars category. Hedonic consumption could not be explored due to the lack of reliable measurement scales. The findings of this study have both theoretical and practical implications and point out essential aspects worth to be further examined. Consequently, the present study will not only contribute to the consumer behaviour literature, but most importantly will enable managers to better understand the purchase behaviour of consumers in terms of emphasizing the preferred physical attributes...|$|R
