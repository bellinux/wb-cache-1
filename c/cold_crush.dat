They also performed at the Ritz, at the Kennedy Center, and on the Jerry Lewis Telethon. In 1981, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts hosted a breaking battle between Dynamic Rockers and Rock Steady Crew. The Daily News and National Geographic covered this event.

For inner-city youth, participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within America, and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture. MC Kid Lucky mentions that [...] "people used to break-dance against each other instead of fighting". Inspired by DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa created a street organization called Universal Zulu Nation, centered around hip hop, as a means to draw teenagers out of gang life, drugs and violence.|$|E

30|$|The {{scope of}} the present {{research}} is to prepare high alumina batch using Aswan clay and China calcined bauxite {{as well as to}} study the effect of different phosphoric acid percentages on the technological properties of the fired samples, through monitoring the densification parameters, <b>cold</b> <b>crushing</b> strengths, and thermal shock resistance. To achieve these parameters, chemical and mineralogical compositions of the starting materials were determined using XRF and XRD, respectively. The plastic and liquid limits as well as the plasticity of the clay were determined to detect the amount of water required for making the clay as plastic material. The density of the used clay and the calcined bauxite was also measured. The high alumina batch was designed from the Egyptian clay and the China calcined bauxite according to their composition. Three different concentrations of 3, 5, and 7 % of phosphoric acid were added to the preformed high alumina batch to form three different concentration batches. The designed batches of different phosphoric acid concentrations were fired at 1350 [*]°C for 1  h. The phase composition of the selected batch was done using XRD and a scanning electron microscope as well as EDAX. The densification parameters in terms of bulk density, apparent porosity, and linear shrinkage as well as <b>cold</b> <b>crushing</b> strength and thermal shock resistance were carried out.|$|R
30|$|Generally, the {{selected}} batch has an acceptable bulk density, and <b>cold</b> <b>crushing</b> strength values {{higher than the}} requirements of the Egyptian Standard ES- 4134 - 2003 and the European Standard DIN EN 12478 - 1998 (Serry et al. 2006 and Serry and El-Maghraby 2006); furthermore, its apparent porosity exists within the acceptable range of such standard refractories (<[*] 20.0 %). This is usually attributed to the presence of the highly refractory phases (corundum and mullite); in addition, the glassy phase is thought to be the main factor that improves the load-bearing capacity of this mullite batch.|$|R
