60|$|But he {{recognises}} the incompatibility of the Infinite {{with the}} Definite; of a Being who loves, who thinks, who hates; of an Actus purus who is called jealous, wrathful and revengeful, with an Eternal {{that makes for}} righteousness. In {{the presence of the}} endless contradictions, which spring from the idea of a Personal Deity, with the Synthesis, the Begriff of Providence, our Agnostic takes refuge in the sentiment of an unknown and an unknowable. He objects to the countless variety of forms assumed by the perception of a <b>Causa</b> <b>Causans</b> (a misnomer), and to that intellectual adoption of general propositions, capable of distinct statement but incapable of proofs, which we term Belief.|$|E
6000|$|With such shifting, {{grotesque}} {{and inadequate}} fables, the cosmogonic myths {{of the world}} are necessarily bewildered and perplexed. We have already seen in the chapter on [...] "Nature Myths" [...] that many things, sun, moon, the stars, [...] "that have another birth," [...] and various animals and plants, are accounted for on the hypothesis that they are later than the appearance of man--that they originally WERE men. To the European mind it seems natural to rank myths of the gods before myths of the making or the evolution of the world, because our religion, like that of the more philosophic Greeks, makes the deity the fount of all existences, <b>causa</b> <b>causans,</b> [...] "what unmoved moves," [...] the beginning and the end. But the myth-makers, deserting any such ideas they may possess, find it necessary, like the child of whom we spoke, to postulate a PLACE for the divine energy to work from, and that place is the earth or the heavens. Then, again, heaven and earth are themselves often regarded in the usual mythical way, as animated, as persons with parts and passions, and finally, among advancing races, as gods. Into this medley of incongruous and inconsistent conceptions we must introduce what order we may, always remembering that the order is not native to the subject, but is brought in for the purpose of study.|$|E
6000|$|The Ilha de Loanda, {{which gave}} {{its name to}} the city, {{according}} to Mr. W. Winwood Reade ("Savage Africa," [...] chapter xxv.), is [...] "derived from a native word meaning bald:" [...] I believe it to be the Angolan Luánda, or tribute. Forming the best harbour of the South African coast, it is made by the missionaries of the seventeenth century to extend some ten leagues long. James Barbot's plan (A.D. 1700) shows seven leagues by one in breadth, disposed from north-east to south-west, and, in the latter direction, fitting into the [...] "Mar Aparcelado" [...] or shoaly sea, a curious hook-shaped bight with a southern entrance, the [...] "Barra de Curinba" [...] (Corimba). But the influences which formed the island, or rather islands (for there are two) have increased the growth, reducing the harbour to three and a half miles by two in breadth, and they are still contracting it; even {{in the early nineteenth century}} large ships floated off the custom house, and it is dry land where boats once rode. Dr. Livingstone ("First Expedition," [...] chapter xx.) believes the <b>causa</b> <b>causans</b> to be the sand swept over the southern part of the island: Douville more justly concludes that it is the gift of the Cuanza River, whose mud and ooze, silt and débris are swept north by the great Atlantic current. Others suppose that it results from the meeting of the Cuanza and the Bengo streams; but the latter outfall would be carried up coast. The people add the washings of the Morro, and the sand and dust of the sea-shore south of the city.|$|E
6000|$|Such a rhapsody may be {{somewhat}} out of order, even in a popular scientific book; and yet one cannot help at moments envying the old Greek imagination, which could inform the soulless sea-world with a human life and beauty. For, after all, star-fishes and sea- anemones are dull substitutes for Sirens and Tritons; the lamps of the sea-nymphs, those glorious phosphorescent medusae whose beauty Mr. Gosse sets forth so well with pen and pencil, are not as attractive as the sea-nymphs themselves would be; and who would not, like Menelaus, take the grey old man of the sea himself asleep upon the rocks, rather than one of his seal-herd, probably too with the same result as the world-famous combat in the Antiquary, between Hector and Phoca? And yet - is there no human interest in these pursuits, more humanity and more divine, than there would be even in those Triton and Nereid dreams, if realized to sight and sense? Heaven forbid that those should say so, whose wanderings among rock and pool have been mixed up with holiest passages of friendship and of love, and the intercommunion of equal minds and sympathetic hearts, and the laugh of children drinking in health from every breeze and instruction at every step, running ever and anon with proud delight to add their little treasure to their parents' stock, and of happy friendly evenings spent over the microscope and the vase, in examining, arranging, preserving, noting down in the diary the wonders and the labours of the happy, busy day. No; such short glimpses of the water-world as our present appliances afford us are full enough of pleasure; {{and we will not}} envy Glaucus: we will not even be over-anxious for the success of his only modern imitator, the French naturalist who is reported to have fitted himself with a waterproof dress and breathing apparatus, in order to walk the bottom of the Mediterranean, and see for himself how the world goes on at the fifty-fathom line: we will be content with the wonders of the shore and of the sea-floor, as far as the dredge will discover them to us. We shall even thus find enough to occupy (if we choose) our lifetime. For we must recollect that this hasty sketch has hardly touched on that vegetable water-world, which is as wonderful and as various as the animal one. A hint or two of the beauty of the sea- weeds has been given; but space has allowed no more. Yet we might have spent our time with almost as much interest and profit, had we neglected utterly the animals which we have found, and devoted our attention exclusively to the flora of the rocks. Sea-weeds are no mere playthings for children; and to buy at a shop some thirty pretty kinds, pasted on paper, with long names (probably mis-spelt) written under each, is not by any means to possess a collection of them. Putting aside the number and the obscurity of their species, the questions which arise in studying their growth, reproduction, and organic chemistry are of the very deepest and most important in the whole range of science; and it will need but a little study of such a book as Harvey's [...] "Algae," [...] to show the wise man that he who has comprehended (which no man yet does) the mystery of a single spore or tissue-cell, has reached depths in the great [...] "Science of Life" [...] at which an Owen would still confess himself [...] "blind by excess of light." [...] "Knowest thou how the bones grow in the womb?" [...] asks the Jewish sage, sadly, half self-reprovingly, as he discovers that man is not the measure of all things, and that in much learning may be vanity and vexation of spirit, and in much study a weariness of the flesh; and all our deeper physical science only brings the same question more awfully near. [...] "Vilior algâ," [...] more worthless than the very sea-weed, says the old Roman: and yet no torn scrap of that very sea-weed, which to-morrow may manure the nearest garden, but says to us, [...] "Proud man! talking of spores and vesicles, if thou darest for a moment to fancy that to have seen spores and vesicles is to have seen me, or to know what I am, answer this. Knowest thou how the bones do grow in the womb? Knowest thou even how one of these tiny black dots, which thou callest spores, grow on my fronds?" [...] And to that question what answer shall we make? We see tissues divide, cells develop, processes go on - but How and Why? [...] These are but phenomena; but what are phenomena save effects? [...] Causes, it may be, of other effects; but still effects of other causes. And why does the cause cause that effect? Why should it not cause something else? Why should it cause anything at all? [...] Because it obeys a law. But why does it obey the law? and how does it obey the law? And, after all, what is a law? A mere custom of Nature. We see the same phenomenon happen a great many times; and we infer from thence that it has a custom of happening; and therefore we call it a law: but we have not seen the law; all we have seen is the phenomenon which we suppose to indicate the law. [...] We have seen things fall: but we never saw a little flying thing pulling them down, with [...] "gravitation" [...] labelled on its back; and the question, why things fall, and HOW, is just where it was before Newton was born, and is likely to remain there. All we can say is, that Nature has her customs, and that other customs ensue, when those customs appear: but that as to what connects cause and effect, as to what is the reason, the final cause, or even the <b>CAUSA</b> <b>CAUSANS,</b> of any phenomenon, we know not more but less than ever; for those laws or customs which seem to us simplest ("endosmose," [...] for instance, or [...] "gravitation"), are just the most inexplicable, logically unexpected, seemingly arbitrary, certainly supernatural - miraculous, if you will; for no natural and physical cause whatsoever can be assigned for them; while if anyone shall argue against their being miraculous and supernatural on the ground of their being so common, I can only answer, that of all absurd and illogical arguments, this is the most so. For what has the number of times which the miracle occurs to do with the question, save to increase the wonder? Which is more strange, that an inexplicable and unfathomable thing should occur once and for all, or that it should occur a million times every day all the world over? ...|$|E

5000|$|Mombauer {{argues that}} Fischer's work led to greater {{discussion}} of the Holocaust by German history professors. A number of German and even British historians find the assertions of Fischer a glaring oversimplification of how the First World War developed, arguing that is decidedly disingenuous given {{the complexity of the}} situation as a whole - especially since parts of the evidence for German war aims (i.e. belligerence) from before the Great War were collected amid the fringe writings of Pan-Germans or were parceled together from Kaiser Wilhelm's rantings; none of which constituted official state policy. [...] Even many times more outrageous than Fischer’s reductionist explanation for the outbreak of World War I are the ruminations of Stig Förster, whose <b>causa</b> <b>causans</b> for the Great War is likewise aimed at the Germans, albeit from an alarming perspective. Förster’s verdict upon the Germans is that they triggered the Great War in a suicidal manner, preferring annihilation and death over life in a modern pluralistic, industrial society. [...] Unsurprisingly, Fischer's thesis still arouses much debate among historians even to this day.|$|E
50|$|Child {{contributed to}} the {{literature}} of economics; especially Brief Observations concerning Trade and the Interest of Money (1668), and A New Discourse of Trade (1668 and 1690). He was a moderate in those days of the mercantile system, and has sometimes been regarded {{as a sort of}} pioneer {{in the development of the}} free-trade doctrines of the 18th century. Though Child considered himself a proponent of the competitive market, he simultaneously argued for a government-controlled interest rate and restricted trade among the colonies which would benefit England. He made various proposals for improving English trade by following the Dutch example, and advocated a low rate of interest as the <b>causa</b> <b>causans</b> of all the other causes of the riches of the Dutch people. This low rate of interest he thought should be created and maintained by public authority. Child, whilst adhering to the doctrine of the balance of trade, observed that a people cannot always sell to foreigners without ever buying from them, and denied that the export of the precious metals was necessarily detrimental. Like other writers in what is commonly called the mercantilist period or tradition, he viewed a numerous population as an asset to a country and became prominent with a new scheme for the relief and employment of the poor. He also advocated the reservation by the mother country of the sole right of trade with her colonies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{dynamics}} of the Greek public debt and its relationship with the ‘twin deficits’, that is, the public and current account deficits. By modeling the evolution of these variables and using actual data of the Greek economy, this paper shows that the public debt is unsustainable as the ‘twin deficits’ are expected to persist. The <b>causa</b> <b>causans</b> of this persistence is the erosion of the international competitiveness of the country. Under these circumstances, the contemplation of policies such as reduction in government expenditures and cuts in unit labour costs in the private sector seems to be the only available, although too little too late ‘remedy’. ...|$|E

'' In this essay the needed concepts of BST theory are developed in detail, and it is then proved that the causae causantes a given outcome event have exactly {{the structure of a}} set of Mackie inus conditions. The proof requires the assumption that there is no EPR-like ``funny business. '' This seems enough to constitute a theory of ``causation'' in at least one of its many senses...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{starts with}} a list of stylized facts on {{economic}} trends in the last few decades with particular attention to international elements. A very brief analysis of the current economic crisis is then attempted. The root cause, the <b>causa</b> <b>causans,</b> of the excessive growth of the financial sector and the inevitable current crisis is identified in the lack of profitable investment opportunities in advanced capitalist systems. The short-term remedies include a shift in income distribution to increase the consumption component of effective demand; it also includes serious regulation of the financial sector at both national and international levels. In the medium to longer term governments should consider engaging in large investment projects such as alternative sources of energy, transport as well as in public services. This might help to improve conditions for profitable private sector investment, thus benefiting both the workers and the capitalists operating in the real sector {{at the expense of the}} rent-seekers. The paper then draws some inference on key elements likely to impact on futures, particularly with respect to internationalization and the two types of innovation identified in the stylized facts: organizational and technological. Inference is drawn with respect to the economic system as well as to economics as a scientific and academic field. The final discussion draws these various elements together...|$|E
