5|$|The Machination {{performs}} a successful surgery on Hunter, and Ironhide is seemingly {{killed in an}} explosion set up by them. They now begin to manufacture their own army of Sunstreaker bodies. Shockwave and the Dynobots are excavated up by archaeologists in Eureka, Nevada and Skywatch takes over the area. In Oregon, two young humans wonder whether to buy Soundwave, still trapped in <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> mode. Megatron calls Sixshot to come and speed up Earth's destruction, and the Reapers follow, eager to have Sixshot join their attempt to rid the universe of war-like species. Elsewhere on Earth, Ramjet's grandiose plans for a coup against Megatron fail when the Decepticon leader kills him in one-on-one combat.|$|E
5|$|The Decepticon {{scientist}} Shockwave {{begins the}} secretive Operation: Regenesis — seeding Energon on various planets, including Earth. While stabilizing Earth's seeding, the Dynobots attack Shockwave, {{and they are}} all buried in molten lava for thousands of years. Bludgeon is assigned by Megatron to investigate Operation: Regenesis and Soundwave is told to spy on him. In 1984, Soundwave learns to his horror that Bludgeon intends to use the Ultra-Energon on Earth to re-animate Thunderwing, but is silenced and put into stasis-lock in his <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> mode. The following year, an organization named Skywatch find Laserbeak and Ravage's bodies. Starscream and his unit later come to Earth, discover Shockwave's Energon and mine it in Nebraska. When they exhaust this supply in 2006, they move to Oregon, entering siege mode to protect their discovery. As part of their plan to acquire a Transformer, an agent working for the Machination takes a photo of a Decepticon transforming and locates the original Decepticon base. As a response he is targeted and killed by Thundercracker, Runabout and Runamuck. Before his death, his laptop with the photo is stolen by a girl named Verity Carlo and she is taken to the Autobots - inadvertently leading the Machination straight to them via a homing device in the laptop.|$|E

5000|$|A {{key element}} of the cassette's success was its use in in-car {{entertainment}} systems, where {{the small size of}} the tape was significantly more convenient than the competing 8-track cartridge system. <b>Cassette</b> <b>players</b> in cars and for home use were often integrated with a radio receiver, and the term [...] "casseiver" [...] was occasionally used for combination units for home use. In-car <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> were the first to adopt automatic reverse ("auto-reverse") of the tape direction at each end, allowing a cassette to be played endlessly without manual intervention. Home cassette decks soon added the feature. In Car <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> are preferred by some particularly for their cheaper cost and serviceability.|$|R

25|$|Stereo {{recorders}} eventually {{evolved into}} high fidelity and {{were known as}} cassette decks, after the reel-to-reel decks. Hi-Fi cassette decks, in contrast to cassette recorders and <b>cassette</b> <b>players,</b> often didn't have built-in amplification or speakers. Many formats of <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> and recorders have evolved over the years. Initially all were top loading, usually with cassette on one side, and VU meters and recording level controls on the other side. Older models used combinations of levers and sliding buttons for control.|$|R

25|$|The blast {{fragments}} included {{parts of}} a radio <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> and {{a small piece of}} circuit board. This rang alarm bells within the intelligence communities in Britain, the U.S., and West Germany, as the West German police had recovered a Semtex bomb hidden inside a Toshiba radio <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> in an apartment in Neuss, West Germany, in October 1988, two months before PA 103 exploded. The bomb, one of five, had been in the possession of members of the Damascus–based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC), led by Ahmed Jibril, a former Syrian army captain. Feraday travelled to West Germany to examine this bomb, and though he found that the Lockerbie fragments did not precisely match the Toshiba model, they were similar enough for him to contact Toshiba. With the company's help, DERA discovered there were seven models in which the printed circuit board bore exactly the same details as the Lockerbie fragments.|$|E

25|$|The compact {{cassette}} {{technology was}} originally designed for dictation machines, but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette to supplant the Stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional applications. Its uses ranged from portable audio to home recording to data storage for early microcomputers. The first <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> (although mono) {{designed for use}} in car dashes was introduced in 1968. Between the early 1970s and the early 2000s, the cassette {{was one of the}} two most common formats for prerecorded music, first alongside the LP record and later the compact disc (CD).|$|E

25|$|In Western Europe and North America, {{the market}} for {{cassettes}} declined sharply after its peak in the late 1980s. This was particularly noticeable with pre-recorded cassettes, the sales of which were overtaken by those of CDs during the early 1990s. By 1993, annual shipments of CD players had reached 5 million, up 21% from the year before; while <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> shipments had dropped 7% to approximately 3.4 million. The decline continued, and in 2001 cassettes accounted for only 4% of all music sold. Since then, further decline occurred, with very few retailers stocking them because {{they are no longer}} issued by the major music labels.|$|E
25|$|The case came {{to court}} in January 2008 where Hodgson denied taking Nicholl {{to any of}} his {{ramshackle}} huts hidden in the Sandbeck Plantation near to the A6136 road, south of Richmond. DNA evidence contradicted this as did the discovery of Nicholl's nightdress, teddy bear and <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> at the same location. Police believed that Hodgson became jealous of his brother's relationship with Nicholl and he killed her on the night she disappeared. Hodgson's elder daughter, stated in court that Nicholl was seen alive in Richmond two days after her disappearance and had been staying with her uncle (Hodgson's elder brother). Robert Hodgson denied this claim and stated in court {{that he had not}} seen Nicholl for some time.|$|E
25|$|This {{generation}} Imperial was a 6-passenger sedan {{offered in}} either velour or Mark Cross leather. Power equipment came standard, as did automatic climate controlled air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, cruise control, driver's side airbag, and its distinct landau vinyl roof. The Imperial featured hidden headlamps behind retractable metal covers {{similar to those}} found on the LeBaron coupe/convertible and New Yorker/Fifth Avenue. The Imperial was available with a choice of several Infinity sound systems, all with a <b>cassette</b> <b>player.</b> Other major options included fully electronic digital instrument cluster with information center, electronically controlled air suspension system, and remote keyless entry with security alarm. Dealer-installed integrated Chrysler cellular phones and six-disc CD changers were also available.|$|E

50|$|Walkman is a Sony brand tradename, {{originally}} {{used for}} portable audio <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> {{from the late}} 1970s onwards. In later years, {{it has been used}} by Sony to market digital portable audio/video players, as well as a line of mobile phones introduced in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|By September {{of their}} {{formation}} year, their track [...] "Daisies" [...] was featured on Bandcamp's The Indie <b>Cassette</b> <b>Player's</b> (now known as The Mill Records) second compilation album, with [...] "Love My Love" [...] being {{featured on the}} website's third compilation album in October.|$|R
25|$|The Flight cost £10,380 {{and offered}} {{electric}} front windows, a three-speed fan and a <b>cassette</b> <b>player.</b> For an additional £1,000 the Finesse added alloy wheels, air conditioning, a CD player, fog lamps and metallic paint. The more competitive prices {{managed to keep}} European Escort sales going until the last one rolled off the Halewood assembly line in July 2000, making it the last Ford car to be assembled there. The plant was transferred to Jaguar that year for the new X-Type saloon, and following the later merger with Land Rover and {{the sale of the}} plant to Tata, Ford now only has a small presence at Halewood - retaining the transmission works at the site.|$|E
25|$|Both four-door {{sedan and}} five-door station wagon {{variants}} were available as before, although trim levels {{were limited to}} SLX and GS. The SLX was aimed at fleet markets, fitted with power steering, a radio <b>cassette</b> <b>player,</b> a remote boot and fuel cap release, and electric side-view mirrors. The sedan-only SLX V6 added four-wheel disc brakes over the 2.2 model's front-disc, rear-drum layout, with anti-lock brakes (ABS) on the V6 available as an option. Wagons without ABS fitted made do with a load-sensing valve mechanism to control rear brake lock-up. The higher GS trim built on the SLX level, adding 60/40 split-fold rear seats, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, tachometer, central locking and a more luxurious interior upholstery style.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{consumer}} demand, the cassette has remained influential on design, {{more than a}} decade after its decline as a media mainstay. As the Compact Disc grew in popularity, cassette-shaped audio adapters were developed to provide an economical and clear way to obtain CD functionality in vehicles equipped with cassette decks. A portable CD player would have its analog line-out connected to the adapter, which in turn fed the signal {{to the head of the}} cassette deck. These adapters continue to function with MP3 players and smartphones, and generally are more reliable than the FM transmitters that must be used to adapt CD players and digital audio players to car stereo systems. Digital audio players shaped as cassettes have also become available, which can be inserted into any <b>cassette</b> <b>player</b> and communicate with the head as if they were normal cassettes.|$|E
50|$|A table {{radio is}} a small, {{self-contained}} radio receiver {{used as an}} entertainment device. Most such receivers are limited to radio functions, though some have compact disc or audio <b>cassette</b> <b>players</b> and clock radio functions built in; some models also include shortwave or satellite radio functionality.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} way to connect an older boombox to an MP3 player {{is to use}} a cassette adapter, which interfaces an MP3 player's output directly to the <b>cassette</b> <b>player's</b> heads. The 'Line In' (also known as 'Aux In') can be used if the boombox has one.|$|R
5000|$|The Walkman DD was {{an early}} series in Sony's Walkman line of {{portable}} audio <b>cassette</b> <b>players.</b> The [...] "DD" [...] referred to [...] "Direct Drive" [...] as the capstan spindle {{was part of the}} drive motor shaft, a feature later shared with the Walkman Professional series.|$|R
