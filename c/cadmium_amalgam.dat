Electrical {{connections}} to the <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam</b> and the mercury are made by platinum wires fused through the lower ends of the legs.|$|E
40|$|An {{equation}} is derived which enables {{the determination of}} stability constants of complex ions by differential pulse polarography. Values obtained by this method for the cadmium (II) chloride system are in excellent agreement with those determined by potentiometry using a <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam</b> electrode. Some of the particular advantages of the method are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the study of}} the susceptibility of amalgams in connection with the theory of the magnetism of free electrons in metals was pointed out in a previous paper 1 in which the results of measurements on copper amalgams were given. The present work is a continuation of the earlier investigation to obtain information concerning the magnetic properties of <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam</b> which has not been studied so far by previous workers...|$|E
50|$|Galvanic {{cells are}} {{typically}} {{used as a}} source of electrical power. By their nature, they produce direct current. The Weston cell has an anode composed of <b>cadmium</b> mercury <b>amalgam,</b> and a cathode composed of pure mercury. The electrolyte is a (saturated) solution of cadmium sulfate. The depolarizer is a paste of mercurous sulfate. When the electrolyte solution is saturated, the voltage of the cell is very reproducible; hence, in 1911, it was adopted as an international standard for voltage.|$|R
40|$|Properties of thiol (HS(CH 2) 10 COOH) monolayers were {{investigated}} at stationary electrodes based on silver, copper, bismuth and <b>cadmium</b> solid <b>amalgams</b> {{covered by a}} mercury meniscus or by a mercury film. For comparison, parallel experiments were performed at a classical hanging mercury drop electrode. Dependences of monolayer parameters on time of electrochemical deposition of thiol and on scan rate were performed. Statistical evaluation of all obtained results has confirmed that solid amalgam electrodes are a convenient tool for research of thiol layers...|$|R
40|$|Mercury drops falling {{vertically}} {{through an}} electrolyte may be deflected from their course by {{application of a}} horizontal field in the electrolyte. A method of photographing the curve followed by any drop is described, and it is shown possible to deduce the ionic charge on the drop from {{a study of the}} shape of the curve. In Sulphuric acid of fixed concentration the drop charge is found to be proportional to its volume. Results are also given for the charges in various acid concentrations between 0. 1 N and 0. 001 N. All charges are found to be reduced when the acid is saturated with mercurous sulphate. This seems to afford evidence that, in acid, the charges are due to hydrogen ions, and not to mercurous ions as had been assumed by several investigators. Results obtained in other electrolytes are also given. Some remits for drop charges, measured by a ballistic galvanometer method, are included for comparison. The method is less accurate but confirms the original results. A description is given of similar experiments with amalgam drops. Silver amalgam is similar in behaviour to pure mercury, but <b>Cadmium</b> and Zinc <b>amalgams</b> show a curious phenomenon. The drops are naturally positive, but their charge may be reversed in sign by application of a 'sufficiently strong field. A possible explanation of this, effect is discussed. Some attention is given to the fact { that Zinc and Cadmium appear naturally positive. Several results showing charges in various potential gradients, and. for amalgams of various compositions, are included. A few final pages are devoted to similar experiments using air bubbles and the possibilities of the method for cataphoresis experiments...|$|R

Experimental data have been explained by assuming the formation of species CdP 2 O 7 (log  1, 0, 1 = 7. 9 ± 0. 1) and CdH 2 P 2 O 7 (log  1, 2, 1 = 14. 52 ± 0. 02) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of serine as a ligand towards cadmium(II) {{has been}} studied at 25 °C in 3. 00 M NaCLO 4 by measuring the electromotive force of galvanic cells containing <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam</b> and glass electrodes. The experimental data {{can be explained by}} assuming the existence of the following species: CdL−. CdHL 2 −. CdL 2. CdH 2 L 2 − 2. CdL− 3, CdHL 3 and CdH 2 L− 3. The stability constants have been determined. Good agreement between experimental and calculated values supports the validity of the model...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of histidine and ornithine as ligands (L) towards cadmium(II) {{has been}} studied at 25 -degrees-C. Complex formation between histidine and cadmium(II) has been investigated in two ionic media 1 M NaCl and 1 M NaClO 4, while the system ornithine - cadmium(II) {{has been studied}} in 1 M NaCl. Experimental data, obtained by measuring the electromotive force of galvanic cells containing glass and stationary diluted <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam,</b> were explained by assuming formation of CdL+, CdHL 2 +, CdH 2 L 3 +, CdL 2, CdHL 2 +, and CdH 2 L 22 +. In 1 M NaClO 4 species CdH 2 L 22 + was not present in appreciable concentration. The stability constants of each complex have been determined showing that protonated species prevail {{in a wide range}} of concentration of reagents, even in neutral or moderately alkaline solution. The results have been discussed and compared with those obtained for aspartate and glutamate...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of taurine as a ligand (L) towards silver(I) and cadmium(II) was {{studied at}} 25 °C and in 1 mol dm 3 NaClO 4, as a constant ionic medium. Experimental data, obtained for both cations from electromotive force measurements performed by using silver and <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam</b> and glass electrodes, were explained by assuming {{the formation of}} the AgL, AgL 2, CdL, and CdL 2 complexes. The taurine protonation constant and stability constants of the above complexes were determined. The cadmium(II) –taurine system was investigated by determining the free concentration of taurine from the Ag electrode potential and the knowledge of equilibria existing between silver(I) and taurine. Experimental data obtained from this approach were explained by assuming the presence of the above species with very close stability constant values. The success of this method supports the possibility of using the Ag:Ag–taurine, taurine electrode to measure the free concentration of taurine in its solutions...|$|E
40|$|Potentiometric amalgam {{electrodes}} of lead, cadmium, {{and zinc}} are proposed {{to study the}} complexation properties of commercial and river sediment humic acids. The copper complexation properties of both humic acids were studied in parallel using the solid membrane copper ion-selective electrode (Cu-ISE). The complexing capacity and the averaged conditional stability constants were determined at pH 6. 00 ± 0. 05 in medium of 2 x 10 - 2 mol L- 1 sodium nitrate, using the Scatchard method. The lead and <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam</b> electrodes presented a Nernstian behavior from 1 x 10 - 5 to 1 x 10 - 3 moles L- 1 of total metal concentration, permitting to perform the complexation studies using humic acid concentrations around of 20 to 30 mg L- 1, that avoids colloidal aggregation. The zinc amalgam electrode showed a subnernstian linear response in the same range of metal concentrations. The Scatchard graphs for both humic acids suggested two classes of binding sites for lead and copper and one class of binding site for zinc and cadmium...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of aspartate and glutamate as ligands towards cadmium(II) {{has been}} studied at 25 °C in 1. 00 M NaClO 4 by measuring the electromotive force of galvanic cells containing <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam</b> and glass electrodes. The experimental data of the cadmium(II) -aspartate system {{can be explained by}} assuming the existence of the species CdL. CdHL+, CdH 2 L 2 + CdL 2 2 -, CdH 2 L 2, CdH 4 L 2 2 +, CdL 3 4 -, CdHL 3 3 - and CdH 2 L 3 2 -, while the data obtained for the cadmium(II) -glutamate system can be accounted for by CdL, CdHL+, CdH 2 L 2 +, CdL 2 2 -, CdHL 2 −, CdH 2 L 2, CdH 4 L 2 2 +, CdL 3 4 -, CdHL 3 3 - and CdH 3 L 3 −, where in all cases L indicates the Iigand. The stability constants have been determined. The protonation constants of glulamate were determined under the same experimental conditions, by using a H 2 electrode. Good agreement between experimental and calculated values supports the validity of the model...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{cysteine}} to form complexes with cadmium(II) in aqueous solutions {{has been investigated}} at 25 °C and in constant ionic medium NaCl at two different concentrations, 1. 00 and 3. 00 mol l− 1. The presence of chloride ions was necessary to avoid the precipitation of cadmium(II). Two kinds of measurements were carried out. The electromotive force of galvanic cells containing glass and <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam</b> electrodes was measured {{as a function of}} cadmium and hydrogen ion concentrations in acid or moderately alkaline solutions in order to obtain the free concentration of cadmium(II) and hydrogen ions. The experimental data obtained in 1. 00 mol l− 1 NaCl were explained by assuming the presence of CdHL and CdH 2 L 2, while those obtained in 3. 00 mol l− 1 NaCl were accounted for with the formation of CdHL, CdH 2 L 2, CdH 3 L 3 and CdH 2 L 3. Moreover, polarographic measurements were carried out under the same experimental conditions but in alkaline solutions, and the formation of CdL 2 and CdL 3 was assumed from the shift of E(1 / 2) of cadmium(II) with an excess of cysteine. The stability constants of the assumed species were determined. Protonation constants of cysteine in 1. 00 and 3. 00 mol l− 1 NaCl have been also determined. A comparison with the behaviour of serine and α-aminopropanoate towards cadmium(II) is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This paper [1] is {{considered}} the seminal, definitive paper describing the revolutionary one-volt Josephsonjunction array standard. NIST changed forever highaccuracy voltage measurements with this development, which built on earlier work at NIST and a microwave feed design from the then West German standards laboratory, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The basic element of the array is the Josephson junction, {{in the form of}} a superconductor-insulatorsuperconductor sandwich. When irradiated with microwave energy, such a junction exhibits a dc potential uniquely determined by the frequency of the radiation, the electronic charge, and Planck’s constant, with a single junction providing a few millivolts. In other words, a Josephson junction can act as a superb frequency-to-dc voltage converter. A properly designed and fabricated array of junctions can be excited to produce a series of very accurate quantized voltages, or steps. As developed and demonstrated by the NIST team [1 - 8], a Josephson-junction-based voltage standard system consists of microwave source and feed, cryostat, probe, chip, and readout and control system. Microwave energy is fed into the chip mounted in the probe’s chip carrier and cooled by liquid helium. The array standard microchip is fabricated by techniques analogous to those used to fabricate silicon integrated circuits, although with very different material systems. For almost 80 years, starting in 1901, the U. S. Legal Volt was maintained by several groups of standard cells. There was a large effort in the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century to establish a standard for electromotive force (emf) based on electrochemical reactions within chemical cells. The first legal unit of voltage for the United States was based on the Clark cell, developed by Latimer Clark in 1872, with its output assigned a value of 1. 434 international volts by the 1893 International Electric Congress. Public Law 105, passed by the U. S. Congress in 1894, made this the legal standard of voltage in the U. S. During the years between 1893 and 1905, the standard cell devised by Edward Weston was found to have many advantages over the Clark cell [9]. The Weston cell consists of a <b>cadmium</b> <b>amalgam</b> anode and a mercury-mercurous sulfate cathode with a saturated cadmium sulfate solution as th...|$|E
