5|$|In 2003, Chia mooted {{the idea}} that Singaporeans {{should be able to}} borrow from their own Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to tide over periods of {{financial}} difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, there was no reason why they {{should not be allowed to}} do so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Harry asked printer James E. James (who had printed Frank Comments), if he <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, {{as they were}} too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie at four in the morning. Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, when The Beatles had to {{pose for}} the {{photograph}} for the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band cover, Lennon asked Mona if he <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> the war medals {{her father had been}} given in India to wear for the photo session. Although still upset at the way her son was dismissed from The Beatles, Mona agreed, and the medals were then returned, along with a Cash Box trophy that is in the letter 'L' of THE BEATLES flower-sign on the cover. Mona never opened another club, or engaged in another business venture, although she did have paying guests at her house, which she shared with her bed-ridden mother and her sons after she and Best parted. Mona {{died of a heart attack}} on 9 October 1988, after a long illness.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Hergé's English {{language}} publishers, Methuen, were planning on translating and publishing The Black Island for the British market. Methuen believed that many British readers {{would find the}} depiction of Britain in the comic inaccurate and out-of-date, and drew {{up a list of}} 131 errors that they asked Hergé to rectify before they would publish it in English. They were also aware that the work would appear particularly dated when compared {{with some of the most}} recently published Adventures like Destination Moon and The Calculus Affair, which made use of advanced technologies in their plot. At the time, Hergé was busy producing the twenty-second Tintin story, Flight 714 to Sydney, and so did not have the time to undertake research into contemporary British society and culture. Instead, he sent his assistant Bob De Moor to Britain in October 1961, where he visited such sites as Batemans and the White Cliffs of Dover, making many observations as to new developments in clothing and architecture. While in England, De Moor sought out various contemporary uniforms to use as a basis for more accurate illustrations. A police constabulary lent him a police uniform, although when he asked British Rail if he <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> one of their uniforms, their staff were suspicious and refused.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} the Witham had {{deteriorated}} by 1802, and the Commissioners asked John Rennie for advice. He stated that the Kirkstead lock was badly placed, and the associated staunch {{was in danger of}} collapse. He recommended that it be demolished and rebuilt elsewhere, and also suggested that access to Boston should be through the Witham Naviagable Drains, rather than the Grand Sluice, or that a new cut should be built to the south of the sluice, to rejoin the river at Boston Harbour. In 1803, he suggested that High Bridge at Lincoln should be demolished and rebuilt. Four years later, he suggested that the locks at Kirkstead and Barlings should be removed, and replaced by one near Washingborough church. The Commissioners petitioned parliament in 1808, and a new Act of Parliament authorised the work, to be carried out by a company of proprietors. They <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> £30,000 for the drainage element of the scheme and £70,000 for the navigation element. Two new locks were built, one at Stamp End and the other at Bardney, which replaced the original locks. A new channel was cut near Fiskerton, upstream of Bardney, and the plan for a lock at Washingborough was dropped. While Stamp End lock was being rebuilt, an alternative route was provided, utilising the Sincil Dyke and the South Delph. Rennie recorded that Branston Delph, Carlton Dike, Nocton Delph and Timberland Dike were navigable at the time. The proprietors obtained three more Acts of Parliament, in 1812, 1826 and 1829, all with the main aim of allowing more capital to be raised.|$|E
5|$|To get {{satisfactory}} {{conditions for}} the loan, the company was recommended by banks to increase the ownership equity to 10% of the loan. The share capital was insufficient, so the company started issuing preferred shares to individuals and the companies, and managed to secure NOK1.7 million. An exception to the rules was made, and the company was allowed to start detailed planning before the loans had been finalized. An estimate from 1966 showed that the bridge itself would cost NOK27 million, while the auxiliary roads would cost NOK4 million, excluding inflation and interest during construction. On 23 November 1966, the county council supported a proposal that {{one third of the}} construction costs be covered by national road funds. On 10 August 1967, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Norway gave permission that the company <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> up to NOK25 million. The loan was a bond sold by Bergens Privatbank and Samvirke Forsikring, consisting of one series valued at NOK15 million issued in 1968, and one valued at NOK10 million issued in 1970, with an interest of 5.5% and 6.0%, respectively. There was a five years interest-only period, followed by ten years of repayment. The mortgage deed was secured in the right to collect tolls, supported by guarantees from the municipalities of Bergen, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, and the county municipality. In addition, the company was granted loans from Bergens Privatbank, Bergens Sparebank and Vestlandsbanken for NOK3 million, although these were never used. The state's part of the financing was through a loan from the Regional Development Fund.|$|E

25|$|Uruguay's {{administrative}} subdivisions {{consisted of}} nineteen territories called departments and governed by intendencias, which were {{subordinate to the}} central government and responsible for local administration.

Because Minnesota library card holders <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> from other systems in the state, MPL also duplicated services offered by Hennepin County Library (HCL), which saw shared use by MPL patrons.

25|$|To this end, Fourier instituted {{two major}} reforms that showed his {{intelligence}} {{and concern for}} his flock.

His motto in serving the parish was to feed only one person was to of use to all. His second innovation was in his preaching style, where he employed dialogues with small groups of his parishioners to explain better their Catholic faith to them. He had his pupils engage in dialectics on Sundays on the various virtues and vices in practice by the congregation. This style proved immensely successful.|$|E

In 1888 a temporary timber exhibition building was constructed for approximately £500, while the National Association called for competitive designs for a permanent exhibition building. Under the provisions of the National Association and Acclimatisation Society Act 1890, the land leased from the Queensland Acclimatisation Society for an exhibition ground was resumed and granted to the National Association as Trustees, who were also empowered under this act to borrow money from the Queensland Government to erect the new exhibition building.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 Breed {{started work}} as the children's {{librarian}} in the East San Diego branch library. In 1945 she was named acting city librarian. The following year, she was appointed San Diego's city librarian, a position she held for 25 years. During her tenure as city librarian, the library system expanded {{with the creation of}} a new main library in 1955, and the addition of several branch libraries. She established the Serra Cooperative Library System that increased efficiency of interlibrary loans. Previously, library patrons only could check books out of the agency (city, county, etc.) to which they belonged. With the creation of the cooperative library system, patrons <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> books from libraries throughout San Diego and Imperial counties. She was also the driving force behind the construction of San Diego's central library building in the 1950s. In 1983 she wrote a centennial history of the San Diego library system, Turning the Pages: San Diego Public Library History, 18821982.|$|E

25|$|Since 1961, Turkey {{has signed}} 19 IMF loan accords. Erdoğan's {{government}} satisfied the budgetary and market {{requirements of the}} two during his administration and received every loan installment, the only time any Turkish government has done so. Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> from Turkey. In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia. In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership, inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004. Since then, Turkish inflation has continued to fluctuate around 9% and {{is still one of}} the highest inflation rates in the world. The Turkish public debt as a percentage of annual GDP declined from 74% in 2002 to 39% in 2009. In 2012, Turkey had a lower ratio of public debt to GDP than 21 of 27 members of the European Union and a lower budget deficit to GDP ratio than 23 of them.|$|E
25|$|The {{emancipation}} of the serfs came in 1770–1830, {{beginning with}} Schleswig in 1780. The peasants were now ex-serfs and could own their land, {{buy and sell}} it, and move about freely. The nobles approved for now they could buy land owned by the peasants. The chief reformer was Baron vom Stein (1757–1831), who was influenced by The Enlightenment, especially the free market ideas of Adam Smith. The end of serfdom raised the personal legal status of the peasantry. A bank was set up so that landowners <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> government money to buy land from peasants (the peasants {{were not allowed to}} use it to borrow money to buy land until 1850). The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasants became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815. In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land as serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Rathborne {{chose to}} open the episode with a shot {{centered}} on Sherilyn Fenn, finding the actress to be [...] "seductive" [...] and [...] "absorbing" [...] {{in a similar manner}} to screen icon Marilyn Monroe. Rathborne had initially worried that the episode featured too many static scenes of characters sitting and talking, with little action, and asked Lynch if she <b>could</b> <b>borrow</b> some of the imagery of the previous episode's surreal dream sequence to keep these conversations more interesting, adding brief snippets of footage as Cooper discussed the dream with the others. Rathborne has noted that this dream-centric approach to the character of Cooper is rooted in Carl Jung's theories of analytical psychology. She felt this was something that had not been seen on television before, and credits Lynch with introducing it to the series. She has also described the narrative, both of [...] "Episode 3" [...] and of Twin Peaks as a whole, as a [...] "Bildungsroman" [...] showing Cooper's development into a more rounded and enlightened person.|$|E
