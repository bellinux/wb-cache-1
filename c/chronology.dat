40|$|Presented are {{the results}} of dendroclimatological {{analysis}} of trees from the submediterranean and the mountainous (Alpine) regions of Slovenia. By means of standard dendrochronological and dendroclimatological processes two regional <b>chronologies</b> were made, for black pine (out of four local <b>chronologies)</b> and oak (out of three local <b>chronologies)</b> for Slovenian areas {{under the influence of}} submediterranean climate. Made in a similar way were two regional <b>chronologies,</b> for common spruce (out of 6 local <b>chronologies)</b> and European larch (out of 6 local <b>chronologies),</b> for Slovenian areas with the mountainous climate. In spite of specific differences between individual locations as regards the responsiveness of radial increments to climate conditions it is evident from the results of regional <b>chronologies</b> that the above-average precipitation in the vegetation period with the concurrent lower temperatures are mainly important for the formation of radial increments of trees in submediterranean Slovenia. On the other hand, primarily decisive for the growth of trees in the mountainous climate are the aboveaverage temperatures in the vegetation period. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} the analysis of tree-ring collections from standing trees of sixteen species at twenty sites distributed throughout the Italian Peninsula. Visual and numerical crossdating among ring widths allowed the computation of standard and residual tree-ring <b>chronologies.</b> Relationships among <b>chronologies</b> were identified by Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation, using Bonferroni's inequality to adjust significance level. The oldest living tree sampled to date is a 963 -year old palebark pine (Pinus leucodermis Ant.) at Parco del Pollino. Individuals {{more than two centuries}} old were identified at eleven sites for eight species. The tree-ring network so far con-sists of twenty-two <b>chronologies</b> for nine species at nineteen sites. Seven conifer species account for ten <b>chronologies</b> and two angiosperm species account for the remaining twelve <b>chronologies.</b> The most represented species is Fagus sylvatica L., with eleven <b>chronologies</b> distributed over the entire peninsula and highly correlated with one another. The order of autoregressive models fitted to the data never exceeded two. In particular, the order of autoregressive models fitted to Fagus syl-vatica <b>chronologies</b> decreased with decreasing age of sampled trees. Based on the significant coef-ficients of rank correlation, residual <b>chronologies</b> of Fagus sylvatica could be separated into north-ern, central, and southern groups. This points to the existence of broad regions distributed along a latitudinal gradient, corresponding to large-scale climatic regimes over the Italian Peninsula.

40|$|Final Report, Preparation and Analysis of Tree-Ring Specimens From Washington State, USA, for University of California, Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryThe {{purpose of}} this project has been to produce tree-ring <b>chronologies</b> from {{increment}} cores of Pinus ponderosa collected from an area in Washington State south of the Trail, British Columbia copper smelter. The cores were collected by Carl Fox, now of Southern California Edison, Rosemead, California, in 1977 and delivered to the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research in 1980. We began work on the project in July, 1981 when funding became available from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. According to Carl Fox, the cores were collected from seven sites, three control sites and four pollution sites. We successfully dated cores from all the control sites, but from {{only two of the}} pollution sites. We have produced five site <b>chronologies</b> from the dated cores. However, we suggest that {{because of the nature of}} the <b>chronologies,</b> the individual core and tree <b>chronologies</b> comprising the site <b>chronologies</b> may provide more meaningful information than the site <b>chronologies</b> for subsequent analyses of the data...|$|R
40|$|Two piñon (Pinus edulis) tree-ring <b>chronologies</b> {{developed}} {{on each of}} three substrates (sandstone, shale, and alluvial fan deposits) in southern Utah for the period 1702 to 1997 demonstrate that geologic substrate affects dendrochronologic streamflow reconstructions. <b>Chronologies</b> from alluvial fan deposits explain the most variance of winter streamflow reconstruction (October 1 to May 31) with an adjusted coefficient of determination (Ra 2) equal to 0. 59. <b>Chronologies</b> from sandstone deposits account for 52 percent of the variance, while those on shale deposits account for 45 percent. Correlation coefficients among the three substrates are significantly different at the 95 % confidence level. The highest single-site annual discharge reconstruction (October 1 to September 30), Ra 2 = 0. 25, is provided by <b>chronologies</b> from shale deposits. The highest substrate-pair annual discharge reconstruction, Ra 2 = 0. 27, is provided by <b>chronologies</b> from alluvial fan deposits. The highest summer reconstruction (July 4 to September 3), Ra 2 = 0. 14, is provided by <b>chronologies</b> from sandstone. Over 90 percent of the summer reconstructions are below Ra 2 = 0. 10. The different substrate response is attributed to varying amounts of clay in each substrate affecting infiltration and available water for tree growth. ...|$|R

40|$|Six mean ring-width tree-ring <b>chronologies</b> were {{constructed}} for living Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L.), growing near the species' upper and northern limits {{in the area}} between the Ob River and the subpolar Ural Mountains in Russia. All ring-width series were standardized by fitting cubic smoothing splines and <b>chronologies</b> {{were constructed}} as biweight robust means. The six <b>chronologies</b> ranged from 181 to 276 years in length. Response function analysis showed all <b>chronologies</b> to have negative responses to winter precipitation. Most <b>chronologies</b> also showed positive, but relatively low responses to temperatures of the current and previous summer. Total October-May precipitation was reconstructed back to A. D. 1843 using the lagged and unlagged <b>chronologies</b> as candidate predictors. In addition to reflecting an unstable and time-varying growth-climate link, moderate verification results may partly be due to problems with short verification periods. The reconstruction contains almost equal amounts of high-frequency (8 years) variations, among them a significant 30 -year variation. The precipitation signal may add an important aspect to reconstructing paleoclimatic fluctuations in the northern hemisphere. Continuing work with the Scots pine from this area depends on {{improving the quality of}} a precipitation reconstruction and finding older living and subfossil wood...|$|R
40|$|Several {{freeware}} {{programs are}} available for calculation of <b>chronologies.</b> In this paper, we compared two of these programs; the well known ARSTAN and the newly introduced library for standardization dendrochronological data dplR, made for statistical program R. Both are free. ARSTAN is specific and produces <b>chronologies</b> from tree-ring width by standardization, while dplR is a package within the statistical programming environment R, which is able to analyze and present results of other analysis. For comparison of chronologies,made in these two programs, we used different tests. ARSTAN provides many options for calculating <b>chronologies,</b> whereas dplR demands written orders and offers no choices. Differences between built <b>chronologies</b> from these two programs are not statistically significant - programs produce same results comparing basic statistical analysis for average tree-ring width sand standard deviations, but for results of sensitivity and autocorrelation coefficient, {{there is a difference}} on a second decimal place. Correlation between standardized <b>chronologies</b> is 0. 9773, while between residual <b>chronologies</b> it reaches 0. 9776; graphically, the differences are also small and low numbered. As the true difference between the programs lies merely in the working environment, it is for users to decide, which program suit them best...|$|R
40|$|Six new tree-ring <b>chronologies</b> in {{northern}} Utah were combined with preexisting <b>chronologies</b> from Utah and western Wyoming {{to produce a}} 400 -year reconstruction of mean annual flow for the Logan River, the largest tributary of the Bear River.

30|$|An {{analysis}} {{was performed on the}} climatic responses of the radial growth of Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr. on contrasting north-facing and south-facing slopes in Tura, central Siberia. We developed <b>chronologies</b> of tree-ring width for four plots, designated as north-upper, northlower, south-upper, and south-lower. Both residual and standard <b>chronologies</b> of tree-ring widths exhibited a significant positive correlation with temperature from the end of May until early June in all four plots. The <b>chronologies</b> of ring width did not reveal any major difference in the response to temperature among the four plots. The standard <b>chronologies</b> of ring widths on the north-facing slope were negatively correlated with precipitation during the winter (October–April) and in early and mid-May, whereas the residual <b>chronologies</b> did not reveal clear relationships with precipitation during the winter and May. The significant correlation between ring width and temperature from the end of May until early June indicates that temperatures in springtime {{play a significant role in}} the radial growth of L. gmelinii. The negative correlations between standard <b>chronologies</b> of tree-ring width and precipitation in the winter and in May on the north-facing slope indicate that lowfrequency fluctuations in snowfall have negative effects on the radial growth.
