25|$|<b>Clipless</b> pedals are bicycle pedals {{that require}} a special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a {{mechanism}} in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal. Most <b>clipless</b> pedals lock onto the cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although {{in some cases the}} locking mechanism is built into the cleat instead of the pedal. The <b>clipless</b> pedal was invented in 1895 by Charles Hanson of Peace Dale, Rhode Island.|$|E
25|$|Also {{strongly}} associated with La Vie Claire was the French company LOOK, which made the first <b>clipless</b> pedals, and which was owned by Tapie at that time.|$|E
25|$|Most Popular (and incompatible) step-in systems used {{unique and}} {{proprietary}} mechanisms, {{such as the}} step-ins produced by Burton, Rossignol and Switch. Shimano and K2 used a technology similar to <b>clipless</b> bicycle pedals. Burton and K2 Clicker step-in binding systems {{are no longer in}} production as both companies have opted to focus on the strap-in binding system. Rossignol remains as the sole provider of step-in binding systems and offers them primarily to the rental market as most consumers and retailers alike have been discouraged by lack of adequate development and industry support for step-in technology.|$|E
25|$|Toe-clips and toestraps and <b>clipless</b> pedals {{help keep}} the foot locked in the proper pedal {{position}} and enable cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include cyclocomputers for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include lights, reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and cages, and bell. Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing.|$|E
25|$|Many {{athletic}} shoes {{are designed with}} specific features for specific activities. One of these includes roller skates, which have metal or plastic wheels on the bottom specific for the sport of roller skating. Similarly, ice skates have a metal blade attached to the bottom for locomotion across ice. Skate shoes have also been {{designed to provide a}} comfortable, flexible and durable shoe for the sport of skateboarding. Climbing shoes are rubber-soled, tight-fitting shoes designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for rock climbing. Cycling shoes are similarly designed with rubber soles and a tight fit, but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to interface with <b>clipless</b> pedals, as well as a stiff sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot.|$|E
2500|$|Reflectors and {{reflective}} tape provide additional visibility (especially {{when applied to}} moving parts of the bicycle) and are mandatory in many jurisdictions. Pedal reflectors in particular are very visible to following traffic as they move up and down; unfortunately they are not compatible with most <b>clipless</b> pedal systems, although adaptors are available for some, mainly older SPD models, and a few single-sided designs are available with built-in reflectors. [...] In the UK, where front and rear pedal reflectors are compulsory after dark, most cyclists with <b>clipless</b> pedals are therefore riding illegally. [...] The law is rarely if ever enforced, but could potentially be used in court to reduce financial compensation if the cyclist were {{to be hit by}} another vehicle. [...] The CTC have suggested that the requirement should be waived if the cyclist fits an additional rear reflector or lighting, but this was not changed in the last revision of the UK vehicle lighting laws (which permitted flashing LEDs). [...] Riders of recumbent bicycles have pointed out that the pedal reflector requirement is nonsensical for them, since the reflectors point straight up and down in use, and are invisible from other vehicles. [...] As of 2008, California law allows white or yellow shoe reflectors (front and back), or reflective ankle bands, in lieu of pedal reflectors.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to slow down or stop a fixed-gear bike in two ways. The first, most efficient, and least stressful on the rider's body is by resisting the turning cranks as they come up and around, shedding speed with each pedal rotation. The second way, less efficient but more showy, is to bump or skid the rear wheel along the pavement. Such a move is initiated by shifting the rider's weight slightly forward and pulling up on the pedals using <b>clipless</b> pedals or toe clips and straps. [...] The rider then stops turning the cranks, thus stopping the drivetrain and rear wheel, while applying body weight {{in opposition to the}} rotation of the cranks. This causes the rear wheel to skid, and slow the bike. The skid can be held until the bicycle stops or until the rider desires to continue pedaling again at a slower speed. The technique requires practice and is generally considered dangerous when used during cornering [...]|$|E

When using a Marcel handle, one applies his or her own {{pressure}} to the clamp. <b>Clipless</b> wands have no clamp, and the user simply wraps hair around a rod. Most <b>clipless</b> curling irons come with a Kevlar glove to avoid burns.|$|E

5000|$|Mike King, {{along with}} fellow racer Brian Lopes, is {{credited}} with starting the Mountain Bike racing SPD <b>clipless</b> pedals trend in BMX racing starting in the mid-1990s, {{moving away from the}} then standard platform and cage pedals for racing. They both raced with them at the ABA Fall Nationals in Burbank, California on October 22, 1994. There is controversy in BMX over the use of <b>clipless</b> pedals, including that rider can not maneuver their feet off and on the pedals in turns when the racer wants to set up for a pass, or stabilize his or her bicycle in a low-speed, tight turn. This reduces the opportunity to pass riders in the turns, as was commonplace in the 1980s when cage and platform pedals were the norm. Some say that <b>clipless</b> pedals reduce the excitement of BMX races, with the racers [...] "following the leader" [...] and only having the ability to pass on straights. Despite the respect given by the BMX world to Mike King and Brian Lopes, <b>clipless</b> pedals were not used by the majority of pro or amateur racers {{until the end of the}} year 2000. It was the late Mario Soto, a young and highly talented rookie pro who broke into the Senior pro ranks and started immediately doing very well despite his comparatively small size and being totally new to the senior pro ranks, that prompted the move. He attributed part of his success to his use of <b>clipless</b> pedals. Today <b>clipless</b> pedals are the norm in BMX racing. Wade Bootes a highly respected Senior Pro was an early adopter of <b>clipless</b> pedals and helped with the move to them.|$|E

50|$|SPD ("Shimano Pedaling Dynamics") - The SPD pedal was {{released}} by Shimano in 1990 and forms {{one part of a}} <b>clipless</b> bicycle shoe/pedal system. While not the first, its innovation was its small cleat which fitted into a recess in the sole of a shoe designed for SPD use. The recess allowed an SPD-equipped shoe to be used for relatively comfortable short walks, whereas previous systems tended to have a large, protruding cleat which prevented this. <b>Clipless</b> pedals use a system of cleat retention which resembles that of downhill skis, allowing for rapid shoe release, ergo <b>clipless</b> pedals are deemed safer than the older style(s) of pedal/shoe integration using toe-straps, et al.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Clipless</b> pedals (also clip-in or step-in) {{require a}} special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a {{mechanism}} in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal. Most <b>clipless</b> pedals lock onto the cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although {{in some cases}} the locking mechanism is built into the cleat instead of the pedal. <b>Clipless</b> refers to the toe clip (cage) having been replaced by a locking mechanism and not to platform pedals which would normally not have toe clips.The <b>clipless</b> pedal was invented by Charles Hanson in 1895. It allowed the rider to twist the shoe to lock and unlock and had rotational float (the freedom to rotate the shoe slightly to prevent joint strain).The M71 was a <b>clipless</b> pedal designed by Cino Cinelli and produced by his company in 1971. It used a plastic shoe cleat which slid into grooves in the pedal and locked in place with a small lever located on {{the back side of the}} pedal body. To release the shoe a rider had to reach down and operate the lever, similar to the way a racing cyclist had to reach down and loosen the toestrap. The lever was placed on the outside edge of the pedal so that in the event of a fall the lever hitting the ground would release the foot. The pedal was designed for racing, in particular track racing, and because of the need to reach them to unclip they have been referred to as [...] "death cleats".In 1984, the French company Look applied downhill snow skiing binding or cleat technology to pedals producing the first widely used <b>clipless</b> pedals. Initially used by triathletes in order to facilitate faster [...] "transitions", Bernard Hinault's victory in Tour de France in 1985 then helped secure the acceptance of quick-release <b>clipless</b> pedal systems by cyclists. Those pedals, and compatible models by other manufacturers, remain in widespread use today. The cleat is engaged by simply pushing down and forward on the pedal, or, with some designs, by twisting the cleat in sideways. Then, instead of loosening a toestrap or pulling a lever, the cyclist releases a foot from the pedal by twisting the heel outward.The next major development in <b>clipless</b> pedals was Shimano's SPD (Shimano Pedaling Dynamics) pedal system. Whereas Look cleats are large and protrude from the sole of the shoe, SPD cleats are small and could be fitted in a recess in the sole, making it possible to walk (although comfort will vary, as the soles of different cycling shoes vary in their rigidity depending on design). Cycling shoes have rigid soles to maximize power transfer and efficiency. They may be specific to road or mountain biking, or usable for both. Shoes designed for mountain biking typically have recessed cleats that do not protrude beyond the sole of the shoe, and have treads for walking on trails, as walking or carrying the bike is often required. Road cycling shoes are typically lighter than their mountain bike counterparts, and feature a protruding cleat and less weather proofing. The protruding cleat makes these shoes impractical for walking, as doing so can damage the cleat. Mountain bike cleats can generally be mounted without difficulty to road shoes although sometimes an adapter is required. Such attachment is not usually possible for road pedals, as the cleats are normally too large to be mounted on mountain shoes. The smaller mountain bike cleats are attached to the sole of the shoe by two bolts; larger road-specific cleats are attached by three. Various manufacturers have produced their own designs of <b>clipless</b> pedal systems over the years.Platform adapters are designed to temporarily convert <b>clipless</b> pedals into more traditional platform pedals which have a larger and flatter area for the foot to rest on. <b>Clipless</b> pedals can have advantages over flat ones, especially in mountain biking and racing. They keep the foot from slipping in wet and muddy conditions and provide better transfer of power. Since the pedal platform adapters temporarily converts these into platform pedals, this allows riders to wear normal shoes without switching to another bike with a different pedal setup. They can be fastened by using bolts but as they are normally in temporary use, it is also common for them to be mounted using different snap-on techniques. Although it's possible to use <b>clipless</b> pedals with regular footwear, they will be much less comfortable than platform pedals, as the shoe sole is more likely to bend or slip.|$|E

50|$|Shoes {{generally}} have gripping soles {{similar to those}} of hiking boots for scrambling over un-ridable obstacles, unlike the smooth-bottomed shoes used in road cycling.

50|$|The {{traditional}} cycling tourist usually used {{toe clips}} and straps, but touring shoes {{designed for use}} with <b>clipless</b> pedals are now also common, usually with a recessed cleat so that the rider can both walk and cycle effectively. Touring shoes typically sacrifice some rigidity for traction and add treads.|$|E
5000|$|Shimano in 1990 {{introduced}} the Shimano Pedaling Dynamics (SPD) range of <b>clipless</b> pedals and matching shoes, specifically {{designed so that}} the shoes {{could be used for}} walking. The shoes have a recess {{in the bottom of the}} sole for fitting the smaller cleats and therefore it does not protrude, while conventional <b>clipless</b> road pedals are designed for road cycling shoes which have smooth soles with large protruding cleats, which are awkward for walking. The SPD range, in addition to other off-road refinements, were designed to be used with treaded soles that more closely resemble rugged hiking boots. SPD pedals and shoes soon established themselves as the market standard in this sector, although many other manufacturers have developed alternatives which are arguably less prone to being clogged by mud and/or easier to adjust. However, the SPD dominance in this sector has meant that alternative pedal manufacturers nearly always design their pedals to be usable with Shimano shoes, and likewise mountain bike shoe manufacturers make their shoes [...] "Shimano SPD" [...] compatible. SPD has spawned 2 types of road cleats which are incompatible with standard SPD pedals and some shoes - SPD-R and SPD-SL. SPD-R is a now defunct pedal standard. SPD-SL is basically a copy of the standard Look <b>clipless</b> pedal system. It has a wide, one-sided platform and a triangular cleat that is Look 3-bolt compatible.|$|E
50|$|Attaching {{the shoes}} to the pedals gives the user {{more control over}} the pedal movements. There are two methods for {{attaching}} a cyclist's shoes to their pedals: toe clips, a basket-and-strap device which hold the foot in place; and so-called <b>clipless</b> pedals, where specialized shoes with built-in bindings attach to compatible pedals.|$|E
50|$|In {{previous}} years, cyclists tied {{their shoes}} to their pedals with toe-clips, {{allowing them to}} not only push the pedals down but also pull them up. In 1985, Hinault had used clip-ins (<b>clipless</b> pedals), which allowed the shoes to snap into the pedal. His victory in this Tour made these clip-ins popular.|$|E
50|$|Broadly {{there are}} two styles of <b>clipless</b> pedals: road and MTB. Mountain bike style use a small cleat that sits up inside the sole of the shoe. It enables {{reasonable}} walking/running when dismounted. Road pedals use a wide cleat that makes walking difficult but gives good power transfer and is comfortable on long rides.|$|E

Models include Zero, Light Action, and X for road cycling, Frog for mountain biking, and Drillium for downhill.

Speedplay road pedals are popular with triathletes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, several devices were {{developed}} and patented that punched and folded papers to attach them {{to each other}} without a metallic clip. The <b>Clipless</b> Stand Machine (made in North Berwick) sold from 1909 into the 1920s. It cut a tongue {{in the paper that}} it folded back and tucked in. Bump's New Model Paper Fastener used a similar cutting and weaving technology.|$|E
50|$|Many road bikes, {{along with}} {{mountain}} bikes, include <b>clipless</b> pedals to which special shoes attach, via a cleat, enabling the rider {{to pull on}} the pedals as well as push. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and rear lights, bells or horns, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS, locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), baggage racks, baggage carriers and pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages.|$|E
50|$|Modern cycling {{shoes are}} {{designed}} to work with <b>clipless</b> pedal systems. Such systems temporarily connect the shoe to the pedal like a ski binding system for maximal efficiency of power-transfer using a cleat {{on the bottom of}} each shoe and a matched fitting on the pedal. Several manufacturers produce these systems; consequently, modern shoes usually have threaded holes in the sole in various arrangements to attach cleats from different manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|Preferred bike type is {{a robust}} {{mountain}} bike meant for cross-country cycling, but {{any type of}} bike can be used. Depending on terrain type either hard tailed or full suspension mountain bikes are more appropriate. <b>Clipless</b> pedals with a special cycling shoe are mostly used by serious cyclists to enable maximum power output, and to keep feet secure on the pedals. Bicycle helmets are usually a requirement in competitions.|$|E
50|$|An older {{system is}} the {{toe-clip}} and toestrap. A toeclip is a metal cage attached {{to the front of}} the pedal into which the rider inserts the shoe. There are two methods for using pedals with toeclips. The first is a cycling shoe with a slotted shoeplate. Before the introduction of the <b>clipless</b> pedal, most racing shoes had a hard leather or plastic sole to which a metal or plastic shoe plate or cleat was attached. The shoeplate had a slot that fitted into the pedal. The shoeplate along with toe clip and strap keep the rider's feet firmly attached to the pedals. The drawback is that a rider had to reach down and loosen the toestrap by hand to take his foot out of the pedal and for this reason toeclips have been made largely obsolete by <b>clipless</b> pedals. The second is to use a cycling shoe with a smooth sole or a non-cycling shoe. This had the disadvantage of the rider's feet not being firmly attached to the pedals but had the advantage of being able to release from the pedals without having to loosen the strap by hand, and also any shoe can be used.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{performing}} a bunnyhop. The first, {{known simply as}} a bunnyhop, involves both wheels being lifted at once, and is typically easier {{to do when the}} rider is using <b>clipless</b> bicycle pedals. The second is known as a pro hop, involves the rider lifting the front wheel of the bike before the back wheel, and requires precise balance and body movements. If not done properly, a pro hop will very easily lead to a crash or forced dismounting due to the physics involved.|$|E
