40|$|Observations sur le {{comportement}} à l’infestation par Matsucoccus feytaudi DUC. de diverses provenances de pin maritime (Pinus pinaster AIT.), dans une plantation comparative mise en place en 1965 dans le Massif des Maures. Les observations ont consisté en : - notations symptomatologiques arbre par arbre, poursuivies de 1979 à 1984; - une recherche d’explication des différences observées au moyen, d’une part d’une évaluation des niveaux de population d’insectes (par piégeages et par comptages), et d’autre part, sur certaines provenances, par un examen des caractères des tissus corticaux. Les notations sur les symptômes (tabl. 1 et fig. 1) mettent en évidence de grandes différences dans la sensibilité des provenances testées, à M. feytaudi. Différentes hypothèses sont discutées sur les mécanismes qui pourraient présider à ces différences. Observation {{were made}} on the susceptibility of some provenances of <b>cluster</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus pinaster AIT.) to infestation by Matsucoccus feytaudi DUC., in a comparative plantation set up in 1965 in the Maures-Hills (provence Southern France). Observations consisted of : - symptom-notations tree by tree, carried out from 1979 to 1984; - a search for {{an explanation of the}} observed differences, through, on the one hand, an evaluation of the insect population level (by trapping females and by counting second instar nymphae). On the other hand, in certain provenances only, through an examination of the character of the bark-tissues. Sympton-notations (table 1 and figure 1), point to important differences between the tested provenances regarding susceptibility to M. feytaudi. Under the conditions of the experiment, provenances from Cuenca (Spain) and from Tamjoute (Morocco) appeared symptom-free (or almost symptom-free, for the first one), other provenances : Mimizan (Landes, France), Leiria (Portugal), Marghese (Corsica, France), Genova (Italy) and Maures (France) were affected to different degrees, the two latter being very heavily affected. The results of trapping (table 2) and counting (see in text 3. 22.) suggest that the immunity of the Cuenca and Tamjoute provenances seems {{to be related to the}} impossibility for Matsucoccus to multiply to important and injurious levels on these provenances. The observations, on the bark, and other previous observations (CARLE 1973;Riom, 1980) suggest different hypotheses for the mechanisms which might govern these differences. - Mechanical factors, such as the structure of the bark which seems to constitue an obstacle for the settlement of the crawlers. They might be induced genetically and/or by environmental conditions (edaphic, climatic [...] .). - Physiological and/or biochemical factors of the host plant, possibly genetically induced...|$|E

In March 1911, recommended by Francisc Rainer, he began working as a surgical docent and became director of the Techirghiol tuberculosis sanatorium. He modernized the institution, systematizing records, constructing a laboratory, planting a grove of <b>cluster</b> <b>pines,</b> and furnishing a small facility for the study of regional climatology and radioactivity. He also began experimenting with thalassotherapy, light therapy, and the use of medicinal clay. This inaugurated a ten-year practice at various hospitals, during which Gomoiu patented various new surgical techniques. In November, after a disagreement with medical inspector Gheorghe Proca, who suggested that the sanatorium was unhygienic, Gomoiu handed in his resignation.|$|R

5000|$|Pineville {{was known}} as [...] "The Pines" [...] around 1776 and was called by this name for many years, due to a growth of pine trees in the area.
