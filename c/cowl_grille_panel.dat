5000|$|In March 1973 the VH {{range was}} {{superseded}} by the VJ series. The VJ featured {{changes to the}} <b>cowl,</b> <b>grille,</b> lighting and rear quarter feature panel, with notably 7" [...] round headlights replacing the previous rectangular units. Significantly, this new model range saw {{the end of the}} Charger R/T, which pretty much coincided with Chrysler having officially withdrawn from participation in Australian touring car racing {{at the end of the}} 1972 season. However, the essential elements of the Six Pack E37 engine option were carried over into the VJ series, now referred to as the E48 engine option.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the design, the {{headlamps}} may {{be mounted}} in a housing that rotates {{so as to}} sit flush with the front end as on the Porsche 928, may retract into the hood and/or fenders as on the 1963-2004 Chevrolet Corvette, or may be concealed behind retractable or rotating <b>grille</b> <b>panels</b> as on the Dodge Charger, Mercury Comet, or the 1960s Buick Riviera, which pioneered the feature.|$|R
50|$|Lyall's Jewllery Shop is a small, single story shop {{constructed}} of rendered brick. It has an unusually fine shop front with a recessed entrance between two large display windows of curved plate glass, above ornate timber ventilation <b>grilles.</b> <b>Panels</b> of small, coloured glass panes are above the windows. Another large display window glazed with flat glass {{is to the}} side of the shop. There is a gas light over the doorway. The original cedar panelled doors survive, as do sash windows in the side and rear walls.|$|R

25|$|Floor grilles - The First Wars Only - <b>Grille</b> floor <b>panels</b> that, {{like the}} arena sidebars {{mentioned}} above, {{were designed to}} trap robots and {{not allow them to}} drive off. Proved much more effective than the sidebars.|$|R
25|$|For 2010, the Super's rocker <b>panels,</b> <b>grille,</b> and {{fog lights}} {{were added to}} the entire Lucerne lineup.|$|R
50|$|At the 1972 Commercial Motor Show, Duple {{introduced}} a new range of bodies called the Dominant, which were similar in appearance to the Plaxton Panorama Elite, already in production since 1968. The Plaxton Supreme range was introduced in 1974, and in response Duple introduced the Dominant II in 1976 with a restyled front and rear end by Michelotti of Turin. The style was cleaner than earlier models with rectangular headlamps in an integrated <b>grille</b> <b>panel</b> and a much deeper windscreen and driver's window. The Dominant and Supreme body styles were the ubiquitous British coach of the period, with very little competition other than small numbers from Willowbrook. The thought of importing coach bodies from abroad was only just being considered {{towards the end of}} the decade.|$|R
50|$|The 1966 Phoenix {{was coded}} DP6. Changes follow the 1966 Fury III; a new <b>grille,</b> revised rear <b>panels,</b> new {{taillights}} {{and a new}} bootlid.|$|R
50|$|The 1973 {{model year}} Darts {{received}} new front styling with revised fenders, <b>grille,</b> header <b>panel,</b> and hood. Massive front bumpers were installed {{to comply with}} new federal regulations, as well as side-impact guard beams in the doors and new emission control devices. New single-piston disc brakes replaced the more complex 4-piston units offered from 1965 to 1972.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} objects {{naturally}} suit or even require openwork, which allows {{a flow of}} air through screens, censers or incense burners, pomanders, sprinklers, ventilation <b>grilles</b> and <b>panels,</b> and various parts of heating systems. For exterior screens openwork designs allow looking out, but not looking in. For gates {{and other types of}} screens, security is required, but visibility may also be wanted.|$|R
50|$|A minor face {{lift and}} small trim {{variations}} {{were the main}} Cadillac styling news in 1951. Miniature eggcrate grilles were set into the out-board <b>grille</b> extension <b>panels</b> below the headlights. Larger, bullet shaped style bumper guards were used. Jump seats were used in both the seven-passenger sedan and Imperial limousine. Hydramatic automatic transmission was optional and hydraulic window lifts were standard. Business sedans were built in limited numbers on a special order basis.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994 (for the 1995 model year) the 960 {{received}} a facelift, including {{changes to the}} <b>grille</b> and body-coloured <b>panels.</b> A smaller 2.5 version of the six-cylinder (2,473 cc) was also added to the lineup, with [...] for the B6244FS version.|$|R
50|$|The center door is {{screened}} by {{a bronze}} grille. It {{has a full}} foliate surround and fan, radiating from a central cluster to end in anthemia. On the door itself are <b>grilles</b> of square <b>panels</b> with center medallions that alternate between round and square shapes and rosette bindings.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Crispulo Sideco (also {{known as}} Kapitang Pulong) {{house was built}} in the 19th century. Built in the Floral period in the Philippine colonial architecture, ogee arches, filigreed wooden <b>panels,</b> <b>grilles</b> wrought in curlicues and floral and foliate designs abound in the house as basic {{structural}} elements or as ornaments.|$|R
50|$|Also after 747 EUS had {{finished}} demonstrating it entered service with the Preston-area independent Bamber Bridge Motor Services and retained its Albion Grille badge. During its demonstration it spent long spells on loan to Glasgow Corporation Transport (fully one year) and Edinburgh Corporation Transport. Neither were likely customers for the Lowlander, having bought high-capacity single deckers (respectively 30 Leyland Royal Tiger Worldmaster and 100 Leyland Tiger Cub) from 1956 to 1961 for their height-restricted routes. Glasgow had previously announced a large order for Atlanteans and Edinburgh were mainly committed to Titans but dithering between body layouts, lengths and braking systems. It {{is interesting that}} Edinburgh ordered an example but perhaps it was not bodied because any coachbuilder would have had trouble providing adequate nearside visibility for the driver had it been fitted with the Leyland/BMMO full-width bonnet assembly standard at Edinburgh. With {{a full complement of}} badges a Lowlander, regardless to whom it was delivered, would have carried an enamelled Albion saltire shield on the flap concealing the radiator filler, either Leyland or Albion in stylised chrome-plated lettering across the fourth slat down on the radiator grille and a Lowlander badge in chrome finish and Leyland-style script, on the nearside {{at the foot of the}} <b>grille</b> <b>panel,</b> just by the nearside end of the registration number plate.|$|R
50|$|Chrysler of Canada {{produced}} an Airflow Six, model CY, which {{was basically a}} DeSoto Airflow with a Chrysler <b>grille,</b> bumpers, instrument <b>panel</b> and emblems. A total of 445 were built. The Airflow Six was dropped {{at the end of}} 1934. The appearance was also used for commercial trucks as the Dodge Airflow.|$|R
2500|$|Streamliners {{used the}} larger B-body and, {{except for the}} station wagons, used {{fastback}} styling. The 1941 Super models with folding center armrest were known as Chieftains in 1942. All Pontiacs looked lower, heavier and wider. Extension caps on the front doors lengthened the forward fender lines. The hood extended {{back to the front}} doors, eliminating the <b>cowl.</b> The <b>grille,</b> bumper and hood were widened and headlamps were further apart. Long horizontal parking lamps sat just above the vertical side grilles. The horseshoe shaped center grille had horizontal bars and a circular emblem {{in the middle of the}} upper main surround molding. The word Pontiac appeared on the hood side molding of six-cylinder models, while the moldings of the eight-cylinder cars said Pontiac Eight. After December 15, 1941, wartime [...] "blackout" [...] trim was used. All parts previously chrome plated were finished in Duco Gun Metal Grey.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{not being}} {{official}} designations, phase descriptions are quite {{useful to the}} diesel spotter and record keeper, but sometimes tricky {{as many of the}} changes described are mostly cosmetic and easily altered features of a locomotive - roof fans, body <b>panels,</b> <b>grilles,</b> etc. that could be - and often were - updated or swapped interchangeably during production runs.|$|R
50|$|The four-door Cortina 1600E, {{a higher}} trim version, was {{introduced}} at the Paris Motor Show in October 1967, {{a year after}} the arrival of the Cortina Mark II. It combined the lowered suspension of the Cortina Lotus with the high-tune GT 1600 Kent engine and luxury trim featuring a burr walnut woodgrain-trimmed dashboard and door cappings, bucket seating, leather-clad aluminium sports steering wheel, and full instrumentation inside, while a black <b>grille,</b> tail <b>panel,</b> front fog lights, and plated Rostyle wheels on radial tyres featured outside. According to author and Cortina expert Graham Robson, the 1600E would be the first Cortina recognized as a classic.|$|R
50|$|The show {{also used}} 1968 Chargers (which {{shared the same}} sheet metal) by {{changing}} the <b>grille</b> and taillight <b>panel</b> to the 1969 style, and removing the round side marker lights. These Chargers performed many record-breaking jumps throughout the show, {{almost all of them}} resulting in a completely destroyed car. The 1970 Chargers were modified by removing the chrome bumper and changing the taillights.|$|R
5000|$|While Thomas {{had been}} battling for the Mosquito's future Issigonis had been {{settling}} the car's styling. Although {{in his later}} career he would be known for very functional designs Issigonis was heavily influenced by the modern styling of American cars, especially the Packard Clipper and the Buick Super. A new feature was a low-set headlamps, integral with the <b>grille</b> <b>panel</b> (Issigonis had originally sketched hidden lamps concealed behind sections of the grille, but these were never implemented). The original Mosquito prototype, which drew Lord Nuffield's [...] "poached egg" [...] comment, was designed with similar proportions to pre-war cars, being relatively narrow for its length. In late 1947, with Cowley already tooling up for production, Issigonis was unhappy {{with the appearance of}} the car. He had the prototype cut lengthways and the two halves moved apart until it looked [...] "right". The production model was thus four inches (10 cm) wider than the prototype and, in keeping with Issigonis' design principles, this further improved interior space and roadholding. It also gave the car distinctive (and recognisably modern) proportions - contrast with the Austin A30, launched in 1952 but still recognisably pre-war in size and proportions). The last-minute change to the design required a number of workarounds - bumpers had already been produced, so early cars had ones cut in half with a four-inch plate bolted between the join. The bonnet had a flat fillet section added to its centreline and the floorpan had two two-inch sections added either side of the transmission tunnel.|$|R

25|$|For the 2012 model year, the Journey becomes Dodge's {{smallest}} SUV after FCA stopped manufacturing {{smaller but}} more expensive counterpart, the Nitro. In 2014, the Journey Crossroad was introduced. The Crossroad has chrome accents along {{the lower part}} of the body and in the interior, a large bumper, smoked head- and taillights, a black <b>grille,</b> rocker <b>panels,</b> rails for a roof rack, and a skid plate simile at the rear. Chrysler added the revised Dodge logo with two slanted rectangles for the 2013 Model Year. For the 2016 model-year, the Journey's AVP and Limited trims are discontinued and the Crossroad Plus trim is added and also for the 2017 model-year, the R/T trim is replaced by the GT trim.|$|R
50|$|The Valiant Super Bee was {{equipped}} with the 318 V8 engine, with 270 hp, from 1970 to 1974; from 1975 to 1976, it contained the 360 V8 engine, with 300 hp—these engines had more power in Mexico than in the US, as Mexican anti-pollution laws were less strict {{in comparison to the}} US. Over the years, these models only received minor changes, such as new <b>grilles,</b> rear <b>panels,</b> and tail lights. The first generation was produced from 1970 to 1976; during the fall of 1975, Chrysler introduced the new F Body cars: the Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare (as 1976 models), while the Aspen R/T and Volare Road Runner were released as the sports versions.|$|R

Most of the phase differences on the F7 were concerned only with A units; B units varied far less. The following are normally identified as F7 phases: ...|$|R
2500|$|Shelby American {{introduced}} the all new Shelby GTE on 2 August 2016, at their website. Same as the Shelby GT, GTE Is also available for both V8 or Ecoboost engine. The [...] "E" [...] of GTE stands for [...] "enhanced", {{the power of}} the V8 version is 456 horsepower, 21 more than ordinary Shelby GT. [...] The power increases come in part from the Ford Performance catalog, with V8 models getting the factory-approved Power Pack; EcoBoost models, in contrast, get a Shelby-specific engine tune. GTEs also get the Ford Performance Handling Pack and cat-back exhaust as well as Ford Performance 19-inch wheels wrapped in tires of Shelby's choosing. GTE also gets its own specific hood, <b>grille,</b> rocker <b>panels,</b> and rear spoiler.|$|R
50|$|It {{was time}} for another {{facelift}} in 1964 and really a minor one. New up front was a bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes. The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer <b>grille</b> extension <b>panels</b> again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic {{heating and air conditioning}} system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to 429 cuin L OHV V8 for 1964. 340 hp (254 kW) was the result.|$|R
50|$|In 1952, {{to commemorate}} the 50th anniversary of Cadillac, the V-shaped hood and deck emblems were done as gold castings. The <b>grille</b> {{wraparound}} <b>panels</b> were redesigned once again having broad chrome trim below each headlight with side scoop styling and gold-colored winged emblem mounted in the center. Back up lights were now standard equipment and were incorporated in the taillights. At the rear all Cadillacs adopted a through the bumper dual exhaust system. Although all Series 75 had been Fleetwood bodied since 1938 {{it was not until}} 1952 that Fleetwood script appeared on the rear deck lid. Equipment features were the same and no business sedans were built. Engine output for the 331 was up to 190 hp (142 kW) for 1952. It would borrow the bumper bullets (or dagmars) as a styling cue from the 1951 Le Sabre show car.|$|R

5000|$|A minor face {{lift and}} small trim {{variations}} {{were the main}} Cadillac styling news in 1951. Miniature eggcrate grilles were set into the out-board <b>grille</b> extension <b>panels</b> below the headlights. Larger, bullet shaped style bumper guards were used. The features list included handbrake, warning lamp; key start ignition; steering column cover; Delco-Remy generator; knee-action front suspension; directionals; mechanical fuel pump; dual downdraft carburetor; slipper-type pistons; rubber engine mountings; oversize brakes; Super Cushion tires; one-piece windshield; intake silencer; 160-hp engine; oil bath air cleaner; equalized manifolding; automatic choke and luxury appointments. On the dashboard [...] "idiot lights" [...] were used to monitor oil pressure and electrical charge rate instead of gauges. The smaller body was once again used on the 61s and again identified {{by the lack of}} chrome underscores. However a new medallion appeared on the rear roof pillar of the Series 61, above the upper beltline molding.|$|R
25|$|For 2003 {{the design}} of the {{radiator}} <b>grille,</b> headlamp inner <b>panels,</b> and sills were altered. The interior and mirrors were altered, while the suspension and braking systems were also refined. The Skyline Coupe was introduced as a version of Infiniti G35 Sport Coupe for Japanese market. Also, the Skyline 350GT went on sale. It is a version of the Infiniti G35 sport sedan with a six-speed manual transmission for the Japanese market, only available with the 3.5 litre engine. The Skyline 350GT and Skyline 350GT Premium sedan went on sale on 2003-06-03.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{shape of}} the heaters is a disk with each side an {{extremely}} shallow cone. The essential structure consists of two large discs of pressed steel clamped between chrome-plated grilles. This simple and lightweight construction made the units easily portable. The heater is mounted on slim triangular chrome-plated legs, and has white handles to either side made from stay-cool compression-moulded urea-formaldehyde plastic. The internal components can be easily accessed by {{the removal of the}} four set-screws underneath the handles, after which the top <b>grille</b> and back <b>panel</b> simply lift off.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, {{to commemorate}} the 50th anniversary of Cadillac, the V-shaped hood and deck emblems were done as gold castings. The Series 62 sedan was also {{characterized}} by a higher rear deck lid contour. This provided additional luggage space. Back up lights were now standard equipment and were incorporated in the taillights. The <b>grille</b> wraparound <b>panels</b> were redesigned once again having broad chrome trim below each headlight with side scoop styling and gold-colored winged emblem mounted in the center. At the rear all Cadillacs adopted a through the bumper dual exhaust system. Deck ornamentation {{took the form of}} a Cadillac crest over abroad golden [...] "V". New standard features included self-winding clocks, improved direction signal indicators, glare proof mirrors, stannate treated pistons, and four barrel carburetion. Engine output for the 331 was up to 190 hp (142 kW). Sales fell to 70,255, but with the Series 61 out of the way, Series 62 sales accounted for a record 78% of all Cadillacs.|$|R

The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer <b>grille</b> extension <b>panels</b> again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Performance improvements including a larger V-8 were the dominant changes for the model run. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic {{heating and air conditioning}} system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. A convertible was no longer available. The engine was bumped to 429 cid L, with 340 hp (253.5 kW) available. In its final year only 35,079 Series 62s were sold, the smallest number since 1946 and little {{more than a quarter of}} their all-time sales record in 1956.|$|R
50|$|The Holden Nova {{sedan and}} hatchback, like the Apollo arrived in dealerships in 1989 {{replacing}} the Holden Astra (LD), a joint development with Nissan also producing the Nissan Pulsar (N13). The Nova was a rebadged Toyota Corolla (E90) {{with the front}} <b>panels,</b> <b>grille</b> and headlamps from the Japanese-specification Corolla FX hatchback. This was a similar approach to the then contemporary Geo/Chevrolet Prizm sold in the United States and Mexico, which utilised E90 Sprinter panels to differentiate between GM and Toyota models. While the Nova was a Toyota design, the factory producing it in Dandenong, Victoria was a Holden factory closed in 1988 in preparation of production of the Corolla/Nova.|$|R

A new technical feature was the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, also used in the Eldorado and the Sixty Special. A DeVille script above the lower belt molding was continued as an identifier. This was the first year for the DeVille convertible. DeVille sales reached 110,379 units, accounting for nearly two thirds of all Cadillacs sold.|$|R
