6000|$|The truth is, {{that each}} {{elementary}} sound that enters into {{the composition of}} words is represented in our language by so many different combinations of letters, in different cases, that the child has very little clue {{from the sound of}} a syllable to guide him in the spelling of it.

We smile to see laugh spelled larf, just as we should to see scarf spelled scaugh, or scalf, as in half; and we forget that this perception of apparent incongruity is entirely the result of long habit in us, and has no natural foundation, and that <b>children</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be sensible of it, or have any idea of it whatever. They learn, in learning to talk, what sound serves as the name by which the drops of water that they find upon the grass in the morning is denoted, but they can have no clue whatever to guide them in determining which of the various modes by which precisely that sound is represented in different words, as dew, do, due, du, doo, and dou, is to be employed in this case, and they become involved in hopeless perplexity if they attempt to imagine [...] "how it ought to be spelled;" [...] and we think them stupid because they can not extricate themselves from the difficulty on our calling upon them to [...] "think!" [...] No doubt there is a reason for the particular mode of spelling each particular word in the language--but that reason is hidden in the past history of the word and in facts connected with its origin and derivation from some barbarous or dead language, and is as utterly beyond the reach of each generation of spellers as if there were no such reasons in existence. There can not be the slightest help in any way from the exercise of the thinking or the reasoning powers.|$|E
