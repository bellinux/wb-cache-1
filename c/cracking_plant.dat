5000|$|Following the {{oil price}} hikes of 1973/1974 and of 1979/1980 and the reduced supply from the Soviet Union, {{substantial}} investments {{were made in the}} oil processing industry. New, more sophisticated <b>cracking</b> <b>plants</b> were imported from the Federal Republic of Germany, from Japan, Austria, and Sweden, and were operated with modern distributed control systems originating in the FRG and the United States. Thereby, the fraction of so-called [...] "black products" [...] such as bitumen and heavy fuel oil was reduced to almost zero in favour of the [...] "white products" [...] such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and light heating oil. Motor fuels produced in Leuna II were also exported outside the socialist block to bankroll the new plants and to earn hard currency. For instance, Leuna gasoline was sold in West Berlin. Even the heaviest residues from oil processing were used as raw material for the production of syngas in the new low-pressure methanol plant. This hydrogenation-based technology required a large amount of hydrogen and was not profitable.|$|R

Mathematical optimization revealed for ethane cracking a maximum ethylene yield of about 67 wt%. with a linear-concave optimal temperature profile along the reaction coordinate with a maximum temperature between 1200 and 1300 K.

40|$|High thermal {{efficiency}} and {{low levels of}} environmental emissions are priorities in the design of modern power plants. The M. W. Kellogg Company under funding from the Department of Energy, has recently completed a study of a new coal fueled system that would achieve these objectives. During the course of study, Pinch Technology was used to assist in the optimization of the process. The "hybrid cycle" is a second generation PFBC system, employing both gasification and combustion processes. High velocity transport reaction technology, developed originally for Fluid Catalytic <b>Cracking</b> <b>plants,</b> is used in the coal conversion steps; and pulverized limestone is circulated with the coal to capture the sulfur that is released during this process. Both gas turbines and steam turbines are used for power generation. Results from the study indicate that thermal efficiencies in excess of 45 % are attainable, with very low NOx and SOx emissions and attractive capital costs. In this paper the hybrid cycle is described and key aspects of this new technology are explained.
