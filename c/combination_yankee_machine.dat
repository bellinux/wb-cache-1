50|$|The M16's Vortex Flash Hider weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 inches long, {{and does}} not require a lock washer to attach to barrel. It was {{developed}} in 1984, {{and is one of the}} earliest privately designed muzzle devices. The U.S. military uses the Vortex Flash Hider on M4 carbines and M16 rifles. A version of the Vortex has been adopted by the Canadian Military for the Colt Canada C8 CQB rifle. Other flash suppressors developed for the M16 include the Phantom Flash Suppressor by <b>Yankee</b> Hill <b>Machine</b> (YHM) and the KX-3 by Noveske Rifleworks.|$|R
5000|$|The Vortex Flash Hider {{has been}} called the [...] "most {{effective}} flash hider available short of a (sound) suppressor" [...] by writer and gunsmith Patrick Sweeney, when used on an AR-15. In a 2005 article appearing in SWAT magazine it was deemed to be superior to the M16A2 [...] "bird cage" [...] flash suppressor and the <b>Yankee</b> Hill <b>Machine</b> Phantom Flash Suppressor. Peter G. Kokalis of Soldier of Fortune magazine and Shotgun News wrote that he installed over 300 Vortex Flash hiders while working as a military advisor with a Central American paramilitary unit in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The Lost Cause {{belief system}} {{synthesized}} numerous ideas {{into a coherent}} package. Lost Cause supporters argue that slavery was not {{the main cause of}} the Civil War, and claim that few scholars saw it as such before the 1950s. In order to reach this conclusion, they often deny or minimize the writings and speeches of Confederate leaders of the time in favor of later-written revisionist documents. [...] Supporters often stressed the idea of secession as a defense against a Northern threat to their way of life and say that threat violated the states' rights guaranteed by the Union. They believed any state had the right to secede, a point strongly denied by the North. The Lost Cause portrayed the South as more profoundly Christian than the greedy North. It portrayed the slavery system as more benevolent than cruel, emphasizing that it taught Christianity and civilization. In explaining Confederate defeat, the Lost Cause said the main factor was not qualitative inferiority in leadership or fighting ability but the massive quantitative superiority of the <b>Yankee</b> industrial <b>machine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The South {{was at a}} {{relative}} disadvantage to the North for deployment of artillery. The industrial North had far greater capacity for manufacturing weapons, and the Union blockade of Southern ports prevented many foreign arms from reaching the Southern armies. The Confederacy had to rely to a significant extent on captured Union artillery pieces (either on the battlefield or by capturing armories, such as Harpers Ferry); {{it is estimated that}} two-thirds of all Confederate field artillery was captured from the Union. The Confederate cannons built in the South often suffered from the shortage of quality metals and shoddy workmanship. Another disadvantage was the quality of ammunition. The fuses needed for detonating shells and cases were frequently inaccurate, causing premature or delayed explosions. All that, coupled with the Union gunners' initial competence and experience gained as the war progressed, led Southern forces to dread assaults on Northern positions backed up by artillery. A Southern officer observed, [...] "The <b>combination</b> of <b>Yankee</b> artillery with Rebel infantry would make an army that could be beaten by no one." ...|$|R
5000|$|The logos of the {{original}} broadcasters originally were covered by the YES Network logo; eventually, the logos were then replaced by the Yankees logo. The announcers used were a <b>combination</b> of the <b>Yankees</b> radio announcers and national broadcasters used during the telecast, with the audio feed constantly changing during the game from one announcing team to the other, possibly to prevent advertisements or station promos to be heard, or to include Yankee broadcasters Sterling and Michael Kay giving calls of a Yankee home run, or of Sterling's signature victory closing: [...] "Ballgame over! Yankees win! The-e-e-e Yankees win!" [...] Regular season games since YES' launch in 2002 simply take the TV broadcast, with most out-of-date sponsor plugs removed.|$|R
40|$|During {{the months}} of June through September in 1991 and 1992, 71 shark longlines were fished in the Chesapeake Bight region ofthe U. S. mid-Atlantic coast with a <b>combination</b> of rope/steel (<b>Yankee)</b> and {{monofilament}} gangions. A total of 288 sharks were taken on 3, 666 monofilament gangions, and 352 sharks were caught on 6, 975 Yankee gangions. Catch rates between gear types differed by depth strata, by month, and by species. Analyses were divided between efforts in the nursery ground ofthe sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus, in Chesapeake Bay and efforts outside the Bay. Mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) ± SE, as sharks caught per 100 hooks fished, was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower for Yankee gangions. Mean CPUE's for sandbar sharks in the nursery ground were 20. 6 ± 3. 8 for Yankee gangions and 26. 0 ± 3. 0 for monofilament gangions, and mean CPUE's for all species combined outside the Bay were 3. 7 ± 0. 7 for Yankee gangions, and 6. 9 ± 1. 2 for monofilament gangions...|$|R
5000|$|When Fox {{first began}} {{carrying}} baseball, it used the motto [...] "Same game, new attitude." [...] {{to promote the}} telecasts, which had previously been used to promote the network's National Football League coverage when it began in 1994. Fox's primary goal when it first began airing Major League Baseball games was to promote their weak prime time schedule (which at the time included {{only a handful of}} hits, such as established series Beverly Hills 90210, The Simpsons and Married... with Children). Fox Sports president Ed Goren said, [...] "We'll use the World Series and League Championship Series to spur our shows". Like its predecessor NBC, Fox determined its Saturday schedule by which MLB franchise was playing a team from one of the three largest television markets - New York City, Los Angeles or Chicago. If there was a game which featured teams from two of these three markets (involving any <b>combination</b> of the <b>Yankees,</b> Mets, Dodgers, Angels, Cubs or White Sox), that game would be aired on the network.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{manufacturing}} plants now use two drying technologies, impingement heating from air jets, and conduction heating from steam cylinders. Pulse air drying (PAD) improves the existing impingement system {{by increasing the}} heat transfer rate. Typical M. G. or <b>Yankee</b> style paper <b>machines</b> could see a 20 % production increase by retrofitting this technology. However, past studies and pilot plants have suffered from unpredictable performance, and two main problems still exist. First, pulse drying doesn’t have the complete theoretical foundation that steady flow drying has, and secondly, the PAD process requires a pulse burner with significantly different performance characteristics than the pulse burners now used in other industries. The author will {{provide an overview of}} existing technologies, an appraisal of the remaining technical hurtles, and estimates of technology’s economic viability, energy savings, maintenance requirements, and emissions impact. INTRODUCTION: PAPER DRYING TECHNOLOGY The head box of a typical paper forming machine lays down a water suspension that often starts with 90 % water mass content or higher. Through mechanical pressing, this fragile suspension is formed into a web which is knitted together by extensive Van der Waals bonds present where individual fibers contact. Once the paper web has reached a critical moisture level, typically 60 % water mass, further mechanical dewatering will crush individual fibers and degrade th...|$|R
