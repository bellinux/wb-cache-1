40|$|Introduction: The {{clinical}} {{course of}} asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{is influenced by}} the co-occurrence of other chronic diseases and their pharmacotherapy. There are no data associated with the doctors’ pharmacotherapy preferences in treatment of patients with asthma, COPD or allergic rhinitis and <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases.</b> Aim : The assessment of doctors’ preferences in pharmacotherapy of asthma, COPD or allergic rhinitis in relation to <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases.</b> Material and methods : General practitioners, pulmonologists, allergists, laryngologists and paediatricians (n = 319) participated in a questionnaire survey concerning their preferences in pharmacotherapy of asthma, COPD and allergic rhinitis in relation to <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> enrolling 11, 310 patients with asthma, COPD and allergic rhinitis. Results : The <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> were reported in 58. 5 % of patients with asthma, 80. 8 % of patients with COPD and 46. 4 % of patients with allergic rhinitis. Patients with asthma were most frequently treated with inhaled glucocorticosteroids. However, in the subgroups with <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases,</b> an increased usage of inhaled long-acting β 2 -mimetics was noted. Regardless of comorbidities, patients with COPD were most frequently treated with inhaled long-acting β 2 -mimetics whereas patients with allergic rhinitis – with nasal glucocorticosteroids and third-generation antihistamines.

40|$|Introduction. Patients' age and <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{relevant}} {{for the development}} and treatment outcome of pneumonia. Objective. To establish the frequency and relevance of <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> in patients over 65 years of age hospitalized for community acquired pneumonia. Methods. The research included 550 patients hospitalized at the Institute for Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina in Sremska Kamenica due to community acquired pneumonia. Data on <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> and mortality rate was correlated with the patients' age limit of 65 years, and then statistically analyzed and presented in tables. Results. There were 446 (81. 45 %) patients under and 102 (18. 55 %) {{over the age of}} 65 years. Dyspnea, impaired consciousness, cyanosis, tachycardia and arterial hypertension were significantly more common in patients over 65 years of age, who also had a higher prognostic score. Mortality was significantly higher (21. 6 % vs. 6. 0 %) in the patients aged over 65 years (p< 0. 001). <b>Concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> were significantly more common (p< 0. 001) among the patients over 65 years (94. 1 %vs. 69. 2 %), and the majority of the elderly patients had two or three comorbidities. The following comorbidities were significantly more common among the patients aged over 65 years: chronic obstructive disease, bronchiectasis, compensated and decompensated cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The higher number of <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> was associated with a significantly elevated hospital mortality (p< 0. 001). A statistically significant mortality rate difference was found in both age groups regarding the comorbidity of chronic obstructive disease and decompensated cardiomyopathy. Conclusion. The patients aged over 65 years hospitalized due to community acquired pneumonia had a statistically significantly higher prognostic score, mortality rate and <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> than the patients below 65 yeas of age. Most subjects of the older group of patients had two or three comorbidities. <b>Concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> resulted in a statistically significant hospital mortality elevation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2 open label, observational studies (study 1, 9, 507 patients treated for 4 weeks and study 2, 9, 858 patients treated for 12 weeks) were analyzed for global tolerability and effects on blood pressure stratifying for co-morbidity (none, diabetes, hypertension, other cardiovascular disease) and co-medication (diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). RESULTS: Overall 90 and 95 % of patients in studies 1 and 2, respectively, reported good or very good tolerability. While global tolerability was slightly reduced in patients with <b>concomitant</b> <b>disease</b> or some forms of medication (p < 0. 05), it was rated as good or very good by more than 90 and 95 % of patients even in those groups. In control patients, that is those with neither co-morbidity nor co-medication, the tamsulosin induced blood pressure reductions {{were similar to those}} previously reported for placebo treatment but were statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Mean additional blood pressure reductions in patients with <b>concomitant</b> <b>disease</b> or medication were not more than 2 mm. Hg. CONCLUSIONS: Tamsulosin is well tolerated and has marginal effects on blood pressure in the majority of patients. It largely maintains its good global tolerability and minimal blood pressure effects in patients with cardiovascular co-morbidity or diabetes, or those on co-medication with antihypertensive agent...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} anthropometric indices (obesity and abdominal adiposity) {{and the presence of}} an atherogenic lipid profile in Nigerians with major cardiovascular risk factors (type 2 diabetes mellitus-T 2 DM, hypertension-HBP, and <b>concomitant</b> <b>disease).</b> Materials and Methods: Using a prospective design, 278 patients with T 2 DM, HBP, or <b>concomitant</b> <b>disease,</b> attending out-patient diabetes and hypertension clinics at a tertiary institution in Nigeria were evaluated. All patients were cholesterol-lowering oral medication naοve. Demographic and clinical data and anthropometric measurements were documented. Fasting lipid profiles were measured in all cases. The cut-off points for defining dyslipidaemia were: Elevated total cholesterol (TC) (mg/dL) ≥ 200, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholestrol (LDL-C) (mg/dL) ≥ 100, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (mg/dL) < 40 for men and < 50 for women, and high triglycerides (TG) (mg/dL) ≥ 150 mg/dL. Results: We found a significantly higher mean BMI (kg/m [2]) in the HBP group (30. 5 ± 6. 0) compared to T 2 DM (28. 1 ± 5. 9) and concomitant HBP and T 2 DM groups (29. 4 ± 5. 2) (ANOVA; P = 0. 02). The most frequent dyslipidaemia was elevated LDL-C in 92 (96. 8 %) HBP, 73 (85. 9 %) T 2 DM and 79 (80. 6 %) <b>concomitant</b> <b>disease.</b> The frequency of low HDL-C was highest in T 2 DM (68. 2 %) compared to the other 2 groups (P = 0. 03). Conclusions: Only TG levels were found to relate with any anthropometric index (waist circumference (WC) in this case) in Nigerians with major cardiovascular risk factors in this study. Routine anthropometric indices {{do not appear to be}} reliable surrogates for atherogenicity measured by abnormalities in TC, LDL-C and HDL-C...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the imaging features of adult parotitis, focusing on the inflammatory spread in and around the parotid gland on CT images. We investigated 21 patients who were clinically and radiologically diagnosed with parotitis, including patients with concomitant occurrences of sialolith or Sjógren's syndrome. Intra-glandular spread was divided into 13 diffuse types and 8 focal types. There was a significant difference in duration from the first onset of symptoms between the diffuse and focal types. Six of 8 patients showing focal type spread were associated with the concomitant occurrence of sialolith or Sjógren's syndrome. Extra-glandular spread was observed in 13 (6 %) patients. Of them, 12 (92 %) showed subcutaneous fat tissue and/or masticator space involvement. Involvement of the parapharyngeal space and the superficial area just below the gland was observed in 4 and 7 patients, respectively.

40|$|Background: The {{influence}} of age {{on the outcome}} of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (FL) was studied in a population-based non-Hodgkin's lymphoma registry. Patients and methods: This study comprised 214 follicular lymphoma patients. Grade I/II was considered separately from grade III FL. The data were analyzed with respect to three age groups: Results: The overall survival rate decreased in the older age groups. Grade III patients showed a statistically significant decrease in overall survival in comparison with grade I/II patients (P= 0. 03). Cause-specific survival analysis showed that in the older age groups, there was an increasing {{influence of}} <b>concomitant</b> <b>disease</b> on the death rate, especially among grade III FL patients > 70 years of age. The survival curve in grade III FL patients was shown to reach a plateau. The prognostic scoring system, according to the Italian Lymphoma Intergroup, fitted better to grade I/II patients, while the International Prognostic Index showed better discrimination amongst grade III patients. Conclusions: Separate grading for follicular lymphoma is useful. An age > 70 years has a negative impact on outcome, but the contribution of <b>concomitant</b> <b>disease</b> herein is important. Different prognostic scoring systems should be applied to the different grades of FL...|$|R
40|$|Moderate {{to severe}} {{psoriasis}} {{is associated with}} <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases</b> that may {{have a significant impact}} on patients. It is necessary for the treating physician to recognize these <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases,</b> known as comorbidities, early as they influence the management options. Important comorbidities are psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, Crohn′s disease, depression, and cancer. Patients with severe psoriasis may be at an increased risk for myocardial infarction and this subgroup of patients tends to have a reduced life expectancy. The presence of co-morbid diseases is associated with an increase in concomitant medication, some of which may worsen psoriasis; conversely, systemic treatment of psoriasis with certain drugs may impact the co-morbid conditions. As dermatologists are the primary health-care providers for psoriasis, adequate knowledge of comorbidities helps in choosing the appropriate therapy as well as timely intervention...|$|E

Methods Data from the second Dutch National Survey in General Practice, conducted mainly in 2001. In this study the data of 96 practices with a registered patient population of 374. 000 were used. Data included diagnosis made during one year by general practitioners, derived from the electronic medical records, prescriptions for medication and sociodemographic characteristics collected via a postal questionnary (response 76 %) Results A diagnosis of HF was found with 2771 patients (7. 1 in 1000). Their mean age was 77. 7 years, 68 % was 75 years or older, 55 % of the patients were women. Overall prescription rates for RAAS-I, beta-blockers and diuretics were 50 %, 32 %, 86 %, respectively, whereas a combination of these three drugs was prescribed in 18 %.

40|$|Objective. Acute {{mesenteric}} ischemia (AMI) is a disease, usually seen in {{elderly people}} {{and accompanied by}} comorbid diseases. Mean platelet volume (MPV), the significant indicator of platelet activation and function, is associated with AMI. In this study, we considered {{that we can use}} MPV as a reliable indicator in the diagnosis of AMI. Methods. This study was conducted among AMI patients with two control groups. Age, gender, MPV, platelet count, <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases,</b> abdominal computed tomography, and patient outcomes were recorded for evaluation. Control group I contained 41 healthy patients whose ages-genders were matched. Control group II contained 41 patients with no AMI, whose ages-genders-concomitant diseases were matched. Results. Of the total 41 AMI patients, 22 were female and 19 were male. The average age of them was 72. 12 ± 13. 2 (44 – 91) years. MPV was significantly increased in the AMI (p= 0. 001) and control group II (p< 0. 001) in comparison with healthy control groups. In the comparison of the AMI patients with their matched controls for <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases,</b> no statistical difference was found in the MPV values. Conclusion. MPV may be used as an indicator of AMI only if the patient has no <b>concomitant</b> <b>diseases.</b> The existence of a concomitant disease brings into question the reliability of high MPV values as a suitable indicator...|$|E
