5|$|Four {{putative}} first lower molariforms (mf1s) of Ferugliotherium are known, and {{the only}} known tooth of Trapalcotherium is also thought to be an mf1. Ferugliotherium mf1s are roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bear two longitudinal rows of <b>cusps.</b> There are four <b>cusps</b> in the lingual row (on {{the side of the}} tongue) and three in the labial row (the side of the lips). The <b>cusps</b> are connected to <b>cusps</b> in the other row by transverse ridges and separated from <b>cusps</b> in their own rows by three transverse furrows. Two heavily worn Ferugliotherium mf1s were originally identified as upper molars of Vucetichia gracilis by Bonaparte in 1990. One of the two preserves the roots; at the front and back, there were two roots, fused at their bases. The mf1 of Trapalcotherium differs only in some details; among others, the <b>cusps</b> are less distinct from the crests. The sole mf2 of Ferugliotherium is the holotype. It bears two rows of two <b>cusps.</b> The <b>cusps</b> in the front and back pairs are connected by a broad ridge and the two pairs are separated by a deep furrow. Transverse ridges between the <b>cusps</b> similar to those seen in ferugliotheriids are not known in any multituberculate. On the other hand, overall patterns of <b>cusps</b> and ridges are essentially similar among Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica, indicating that the three are closely related.|$|E
5|$|One Ferugliotherium tooth {{is thought}} to be a first upper molariform (MF1).

LACM 149371, the enigmatic possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru, is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven <b>cusps,</b> which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa.|$|E

40|$|Polar <b>cusp</b> VLF hiss of {{irregular}} spectra {{is observed}} mainly at geomagnetic invariant latitudes from 74 ° to 84 °, and at geomagnetic local times from 10 to 14 hours.

40|$|AbstractMice and rats, {{two species}} of rodents, show some dental {{similarities}} such as tooth number and <b>cusp</b> number, and differences such as tooth size and <b>cusp</b> size.

It is also suggested that the mesenchymal cell number regulates not the tooth size but the tooth number. The relationships among these factors in tooth patterning including micropatterning (<b>cusp</b> size and <b>cusp</b> number) and macropatterning (tooth size and tooth number) were analyzed in a reaction diffusion mechanism.

5|$|As in all oryzomyines except Holochilus and {{its close}} relatives, the molars are brachyodont, low-crowned, and bunodont, with the <b>cusps</b> {{extending}} {{higher than the}} central parts of the molars. They are characterized by strong <b>cusps</b> and absence or reduction of accessory crests. The <b>cusps</b> of the upper molars are opposite, but in the lower molars the labial (outer) <b>cusps</b> are slightly further to the front than the lingual (inner) ones. On the upper first molar, one accessory ridge, the anteroloph, is lacking, but another, the mesoloph, is present. Unlike in most other oryzomyines, however, which have mesolophs reaching the labial margin of the molar, the mesolophs of Pseudoryzomys are short and protrude only slightly {{from the middle of}} the molar. The corresponding structure in the lower molars, the mesolophid, is completely absent. The hindmost valley between <b>cusps</b> on the lower first molar, the posteroflexid, is severely reduced, foreshadowing its loss in Lundomys and Holochilus. A number of molar traits support Pseudoryzomyss relationship with Holochilus and Lundomys, forming steps in the transition from the complex, low-crowned generalized oryzomyine molar pattern to the simpler, high-crowned pattern of Holochilus.|$|E
5|$|The lingual row {{contains}} three <b>cusps</b> and the labial probably five (the {{broken corner}} renders the number uncertain). Transverse ridges, separated by deep valleys, connect the lingual and labial cusps; therefore, the <b>cusps</b> are not strongly separate, but rather fused. The lingual <b>cusps</b> are larger and separated by larger valleys than the labial ones. At {{the front of}} the tooth is a triangular structure consisting of the first lingual and the first two labial <b>cusps.</b> A low crest connects the first lingual to the first labial cusp and a stronger crest, separated from the first by a relatively shallow valley, connects the second lingual to the first labial cusp. Behind this structure, a second triangle is formed by two crests passing from the second lingual cusp to two <b>cusps</b> at the labial side (the back of the two is broken away, but its existence is presumed from the crown pattern). The front of these two crests is interrupted by a groove. The third lingual cusp is also connected to two crests, which encircle a small depression and presumably connected to one or more labial <b>cusps,</b> which are missing from the fossil.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The data {{on various}} types of talon <b>cusp,</b> a rare {{developmental}} anomaly that occurs predominantly on palatal surfaces of maxillary incisors with varied prevalence in different populations, is scarce. Thus, the purpose of study was to evaluate prevalence of {{various types of}} talon <b>cusp</b> and its association with sex predilection, site, and other dental anomalies and complications. Subjects and Methods. A cross-sectional prevalence study for various types of talon <b>cusp</b> was conducted in 5200 patients selected randomly. Hattab’s classification criterion was used for diagnosis of types of talon <b>cusp.</b> The clinical diagnosis was confirmed with radiograph. Results. The prevalence of talon <b>cusp</b> {{was found to be}} 0. 02 % (1 in 430 cases). 12 cases of talon <b>cusp</b> in 10 patients (60 % males) were documented (2 bilateral cases and 8 unilateral). Type I talon <b>cusp</b> and type II talon <b>cusp</b> were present in five cases each (40. 1 %) and type III talon <b>cusp</b> was observed in two (16. 2 %) cases. Conclusion. Type I talon <b>cusp</b> and type II talon <b>cusp</b> were the most common types and permanent maxillary central incisor was the most commonly involved tooth (50 %).

5|$|The best-preserved mf1 is MLP 88-III-28-1. The crown is unworn and {{complete}} {{and there are}} no roots, suggesting that the tooth had not yet erupted when its owner died. Krause, who first described the tooth in 1993, identified it as a right molar, but the subsequent discovery of the jaw of Sudamerica made it clear that Ferugliotherium molariforms had been reversed, and MLP 88-III-28-1 is actually from {{the left side of the}} jaw. The tooth is 2.2mm long and 1.5mm wide. The crown is roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bears two longitudinal rows of <b>cusps.</b> The lingual row consists of four <b>cusps,</b> which are smaller and lower than the three labial ones. The <b>cusps</b> in this row become smaller and lower from the front to the back. Two ridges descend from the tip of each cusp to the lingual and labial sides. The labial ridges on the first and fourth cusp only reach the base of the cusp, but those on the second and third <b>cusps</b> join ridges descending from the first and second labial cusp. In the first three <b>cusps,</b> the lingual ridge extends to near the lingual margin of the tooth and then turns backward; the end of the ridge is lingual to the next cusp. In the fourth cusp, the ridge hardly extends posteriorly, but rather labially, forming the posterior margin of the tooth and joining a ridge descending from the last labial cusp. The labial cusp row includes three, larger <b>cusps,</b> each of which bears two ridges that descend lingually into the valley between the two cusp rows. The front ridge of each pair ends in the central valley, and the back ridge joins a ridge from a lingual cusp. The ridge pattern results in the presence of three transverse furrows between the main <b>cusps.</b>|$|E

5|$|The holotype, MACN Pv-RN 20, {{is a right}} mf2 {{according}} to both Krause and colleagues (1992) and Gurovich (2005), but Gurovich considered the side that Krause and colleagues thought was lingual to be labial, and vice versa. The latter interpretation {{is used in the}} following description. It is almost square, but at the front it is slightly narrower than at the back. The labial side of the tooth is taller and less worn than the lingual side. There are two rows of <b>cusps,</b> and each lingual cusp is connected to each labial cusp by a broad crest, with one or more fossas in the middle. One of the two labial <b>cusps</b> may have been divided into two smaller <b>cusps.</b> The two crests are separated by a deep furrow. The enamel prisms of this tooth are small, like those of the premolar MACN Pv-RN 250.|$|E
5|$|The incisors {{are large}} and ungrooved. Their enamel is orange, but paler on the lowers. The {{orientation}} of the upper incisors is opisthodont, with the cutting edge oriented backwards. The molars are brachydont (low-crowned) and have two rows of main <b>cusps</b> separated by deep valleys and complemented by a network of crests and smaller <b>cusps.</b> The first upper molar is broader than in T.talamancae. As in this species, but unlike in many other rice rats, including H.alfaroi, the mesoflexus on the second upper molar, which separates the paracone (one of the main <b>cusps)</b> from the mesoloph (an accessory crest), is not divided in two by an enamel bridge. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the <b>cusps,</b> is very long, extending more than halfway across the tooth; in this trait, it is similar to T.talamancae but unlike H.alfaroi. Each of the upper molars has three roots (two on the outer {{and one on the}} inner side) and each of the lowers has two (one at the front and another at the back).|$|E
5|$|The molar is {{plane and}} hypsodont: the crowns are {{relatively}} {{high and the}} main <b>cusps</b> are about {{as high as the}} other parts of the crown, as they are in Holochilus. Most other oryzomyines have bunodont and brachydont molars, in which the crowns are lower and the <b>cusps</b> are higher {{than the rest of the}} crown. As in closely related species, the front part of the molar is relatively simple, lacking an anteroloph, an additional ridge that is well-developed in most oryzomyines. A shallow anteromedian flexus is present, superficially dividing the front cusp (anterocone). Uniquely, the anterior mure, which connects the anterocone to the rest of the crown, is absent; although this structure is sometimes missing in young individuals of other oryzomyines, it usually develops as a result of wear in adults. The two <b>cusps</b> on the middle part of the molar, the paracone and the protocone, are broadly connected. The median mure, which connects the middle to the back pair of <b>cusps,</b> is attached to the back of the paracone. A complete mesoloph is present, descending from the median mure slightly behind the paracone. The configuration of the paracone–median mure–mesoloph complex is unique to Carletonomys. The two posterior <b>cusps,</b> the hypocone and the metacone, are connected at the back margin of the molar. Unlike in most oryzomyines, no posteroflexus is present, so that the metacone is situated directly at the back margin.|$|E
