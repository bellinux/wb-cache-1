40|$|Discussed {{here is a}} {{new type}} of wind tunnel, its advantages, the {{difficulties}} attendant upon its use, and the special methods required for its operation. The main difference between the new type of wind tunnel and the ones now in operation is the use of a different fluid. The idea is to diminish the effect of viscosity If air is compressed, it becomes a fluid with new properties - a fluid that is best suited for reliable and exact tests on models. When air is compressed, its density increases, but its viscosity does not. It is argued that the increase of pressure greatly increases the range and value of wind tunnel tests.

A molecular tagging velocimetry technique consisting of a NO 2 approaches?NO photo-dissociation reaction and two subsequent excitations of NO was used. The measurement of the transitional boundary layer velocity profiles was made downstream of a 1 -mm tall, 4 -mm diameter cylindrical trip along several lines lying within a streamwise measurement plane normal to the model surface and offset 6 -mm from the model centerline. For laminar and transitional boundary layer measurements, the magnitudes of streamwise velocity fluctuations are compared. In the transitional boundary layer the fluctuations were, in general, 2 - 4 times larger than those in the laminar boundary layer. Of particular interest were fluctuations corresponding to a height of approximately 50 % of the laminar boundary layer thickness having a magnitude of nearly 30 % of the mean measured velocity. For comparison, the measured fluctuations in the laminar boundary layer were approximately 5 % of the mean measured velocity at the same location.

Experiments were performed in the NASA Langley Research Center 31 -Inch Mach 10 <b>Air</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> which is an electrically-heated, blowdown facility. Two-mm high by 8 -mm wide triangular and rectangular trips were attached to a flat plate and were oriented at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the oncoming flow.

PLIF visualization of this NO allowed observation of both laminar and turbulent boundary layer flow downstream of the trips for varying flow conditions as the flat plate angle of attack was varied. By varying the angle of attack, the Mach number above the boundary layer was varied between 4. 2 and 9. 8, according to analytical oblique-shock calculations. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the flowfield with a laminar boundary layer were also performed to better understand the flow environment. The PLIF images of the tripped boundary layer flow were compared to a case with no trip for which the flow remained laminar over the entire angle-of-attack range studied.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{an analysis}} of an Integral <b>Compressed</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Wind</b> Turbine (ICWT), in which energy is extracted from a slow-moving renewable source {{through the use of}} <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> This concept is particularly applicable to large offshore wind turbines, and can be readily integrated with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> energy storage methods. The ICWT has a very large rotor with free pistons travelling within the rotor blades, inducting and <b>compressing</b> <b>air</b> to high pressures {{at each end of the}} stroke. The <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> can be stored and expanded when the energy is required, solving the intermittency issue of wind energy. By gathering energy along the rotor blades, rather than at the hub, it also avoids the very high torques associated with extremely large turbines. This thesis investigates optimal control strategies for ICWTs. Firstly, an initial model of the system using coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is constructed to simulate a single piston pair of an ICWT system. This framework utilises several `modes' which the system passes through in the course of each stroke, with movement between modes controlled by simple algorithms. Calculations of potential and required energy are developed to allow basic control of the valve timings. The simulation is then extended to include thermal modelling of the walls of the compression tube, using orthonormal polynomials. A long-duration instance of the model is used to identify steady-state values for the orthonormal parameters, which demonstrates that the wall temperatures would remain within 15 K of the ambient temperature. One possible solution to the high temperatures caused by the near-adiabatic conditions of the compression is added to the model; namely, the injection of water droplets to the cylinder at the start of the compression stage. A method to efficiently simulate a phase transition in MATLAB is developed and implemented, allowing {{an analysis of}} the optimum mass balance of water to be injected to reduce the exhausted air temperature. An appendix examines several of the assumptions built into the model, in particular the rigidity of the components and variations in the rotational velocity of the rotor due to Coriolis and gravitational forces. Two valve control schemes are developed and implemented into the model; firstly, a simple proportional and derivative controller, which acts according to a rule dictating a gradual reduction in the energy surplus. This option proves to be limited in the degree to which it can avoid wasting <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> A second scheme, involving a simple version of sliding-mode control with two controllers operating at different timescales, is instead developed and shown to be significantly more effective at improving the system efficiency. Finally, an optimisation study is carried out on the `kick' stage, in which stored <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is used to accelerate the piston before compression. A large dataset of simulations allows for the specification of a set of optimum parameters based on a balance between power extraction from the rotating frame and net power generation...|$|R

The code was developed for the aerodynamic analysis of geometrically complex configurations in either free <b>air</b> or <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> environments (vol. 1). The complete flow field is divided {{into a number of}} topologically simple blocks within each of which surface fitted grids and efficient flow solution algorithms can easily be constructed. The multiblock field grid is generated with the BCON procedure described in volume 2. The GMBE utilizes a finite volume formulation with an explicit time stepping scheme to solve the Euler equations. A multiblock version of the multigrid method was developed to accelerate the convergence of the calculations. This user guide provides information on the GMBE code, including input data preparations with sample input files and a sample Unix script for program execution in the UNICOS environment...|$|R
40|$|Droplet size {{distribution}} of a pesticide spray is recognised {{as a main}} factor affecting spray drift. As a first approximation, nozzles can be classified based on their droplet size spectrum. However, the risk of drift for a given droplet {{size distribution}} is also a function of spray structure, droplet velocities and entrained <b>air</b> conditions. <b>Wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> tests to determine actual drift potentials of the different nozzles have been proposed {{as a method of}} adding an indication of the risk of spray drift to the existing classification based on droplet size distributions (Miller et al, 1995). In this research <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> tests were performed in the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> of the International Centre for Eremology (I. C. E.), Ghent University, to determine the drift potential of different types and sizes of nozzles at various spray pressures. Flat Fan (F) nozzles Hardi ISO 110 02, 110 03, 110 04, 110 06; Low-Drift (LD) nozzles Hardi ISO 110 02, 110 03, 110 04 and Injet Air Inclusion (AI) nozzles Hardi ISO 110 02, 110 03, 110 04 were tested at a spray pressures of 2, 3 and 4 bar. The droplet size spectra of the F and the LD nozzles were measured with a Malvern Mastersizer at spray pressures 2 bar, 3 bar and 4 bar. The Malvern spectra were used to calculate the Volume Median Diameters (VMD) of the sprays. status: publishe...|$|R

A throat area of 0. 000375 m 2 {{was used in the}} design process. The properties of the air were calculated using various Mach numbers. These results are used to determine if a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> of Mach numbers between one and five can be built at the University of Arkansas and can run for a sufficient amount of time.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 20 - 21) A detailed {{literature review}} of transonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> operations was completed, and calibration of the supersonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> configured for transonic operation, was begun. The {{intent of the}} study was to select and evaluate various airfoils for use at high angles of attack and at transonic speeds (M between 0, 8 5 and 1. 0 5). However, after extensive operation it was found that the modified <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> as configured, would not allow -operation in excess of mach 0, 63. An analytical study of the transonic configured <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> revealed that considerable additional modification of the air supply system would be required before satisfactory <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> operation would result. Recommendations for the air supply system modification include a higher flow capacity control valve,. and more <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> storage tank volume...|$|R
