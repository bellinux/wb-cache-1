Scientific psychology {{has been responsible for}} perpetuation of bias and the limited generality of published ethnic minority research. A constructive response to these issues includes more coherent scientific preparation for assessment practice, particularly with ethnic minority populations. Adequate preparation entails careful reformulation of assumptions, redefinition of variables, informed selection of research methodologies, understanding deficiencies in normative data, and using culturally responsible interpretive strategies with standard test data in addition to employment of new measures. Currently available guidelines for culturally-relevant research, training, and practice are precursors to empirically-derived consensual standards for responsible and ethical multicultural assessment...|$|R
40|$|The <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> {{instrumental}} variables assumptions {{is often}} under dispute. This paper imposes weak monotonicity {{in order to}} gain information on counterfactual outcomes, but avoids independence or exclusion restrictions. The outcome process is assumed to be sequentially ordered, building up and depending on the information level of agents. The potential outcome distribution is assumed to weakly increase (or decrease) with the instrument, conditional on the continuation up to a certain stage. As a general result, the counterfactual distributions can only be bounded, but the derived bounds are informative compared to the no-assumptions bounds thus justifying the instrumental variables terminology. The construction of bounds is illustrated in two data examples. nonparametric bounds, treatment effects, endogeneity, binary choice, monotone instrumental variables, policy evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Typical {{validation}} {{studies on}} standard setting models, {{most notably the}} Angoff and modified Angoff models, have ignored construct development, a critical aspect associated with all conceptualizations of measurement processes. Stone compared the Angoff and objective standard setting (OSS) models and found that Angoff failed to define a legitimate and stable construct. The present study replicates and expands this work by presenting results from a 5 -year investigation of both models, using two different approaches (equating and annual standard setting) within two testing settings (health care and education). The results support the original conclusion that although the OSS model demonstrates effective construct development, the Angoff approach appears random and lacking in clarity. Implications for creating meaningful and valid standards are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} {{a theoretical}} model {{to show how}} the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> a country’s commitment to an international gold standard regime is driven by fundamental determinants such as: 1) shifts in domestic policy, 2) a breakdown in cooperation between central banks, and 3) unilateral devaluations by foreign central banks. Because the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> the gold <b>standard</b> regime is an important determinant of domestic interest rate uncertainty, the latter is endogenously linked to changes in the fundamental determinants. Applying this analysis to the inter-war period, the paper shows that GARCH measures of interest rate uncertainty rose dramatically in the U. S. during the early 1930 s and that movements in this series can be explained by events which affected the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> the U. S. commitment to the gold standard. Also, interest rate uncertainty explains {{a great deal of the}} variation in aggregate output and its components during the interwar period.

40|$|Summary Organizations face risks {{regardless}} {{of the type of}} industry or government. Historically risks have been undertaken in various processes and coped with differently by society. An appropriate application of risk management is widely acknowledged {{as one of the most}} critical aspects of undertaking business activities across all sectors in society, public and private. In order to carry out this activity as part of the crucial actions the organizations implement as part of their culture, many standards have been developed at the international level. These standards provide the groundwork for entities to start implementing these processes and reduce the risk they face with a standardized set of procedures across sectors. Risk assessment faces abundant arguments that lead to doubt the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>standards</b> implemented by different organizations, as not a single method or definition is agreed upon across cultural and sectorial barriers. Therefore, the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> the standardized assessment is doubted. This study aims to evaluate the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> standardized risk assessments with a focus on the Information Security Risk Assessment Standards, in particular ISO 27005 and NIST 800 - 30 in collaboration with the Swedish Armed Forces. The research adapts the frameworks available in literature to evaluate <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> risk assessments to the international standardized assessment procedure. The standards credibility will be evaluated with different criteria divided in five categories considered applicable to the standardised risk assessment procedure. Also, input from experts in organizations currently employing the standards and academic experts in the field will also be utilized. This study utilizes a qualitative case study approach. The <b>credibility</b> evaluation performance <b>of</b> each international <b>standard</b> is similar; the only category that NIST 800 - 30 has a significant better performance is the category related to the final Risk Assessment Results (Report). The NIST provides a further step in the process as well as the guidelines and templates in order to develop different parts of the assessment process including the report, which is considered a best practice of a standardised risk assessment. The findings of the research contradict four criteria of the framework found in the literature, related to with what can be learned from past risk assessments, to the wide ranging of the required scope of a risk assessment, the relevance of the disclosure of information on the final risk assessment report related to the composition of the assessment group and finally the procedure for finding consensus among stakeholders. The research question “How credible are standardized risk assessments?” provide a holistic understanding <b>of</b> the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>standards</b> previously mentioned, determining that these provide a solid framework for companies to start assessing the risks in a regulated and standardized procedure. These oversee the problems embedded in the subjectivity of a risk assessment and the ever-changing (intrinsic and extrinsic) aspects of stakeholder behaviour with a lack of a systemic approach to solve these issues, which also include the lack of proper handling of risk uncertainty and the lack of transparency on the final risk assessment report. The study provides a groundwork which can be used in order to develop future research. This study also provides a grounded framework which can be used by entities utilizing the standards in order to reflect their procedures of their risk assessment activities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{formulate}} practice standards for quality clinical decision making in nursing. Clinical decision-making is a critical component of nursing practice, as the life of the patient is at stake. The quality of clinical decision-making is, therefore, essential in delivering quality nursing care. The facilitation of quality clinical decision-making in nursing requires the development <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> to monitor, evaluate and implement remedial actions that improve on the quality of clinical decision-making (Muller, 2002 : 203; Beyea & Nicoll, 1999 : 495). However, there are no such practice standards against which the quality of clinical decision-making by nurses can be evaluated and assessed. A qualitative, explorative, descriptive and standard formulation research design (Mouton & Marais, 1990 : 45 - 46; Muller, 1990 : 49 - 55) has been followed to develop standards for quality clinical decision-making in nursing. Standard development was based on the principles described by Muller (in Booyens, 1998 : 607 - 608; 636 - 637), and consists of development and quantification phases that are modified to meet the requirements for instrument development, as described by Lynn (1986 : 382 - 385). The formulation of these practice-standards was derived deductively from a conceptual framework. The conceptual framework was constructed based on an exploration and description of the expectations of the stakeholders about quality clinical decisionmaking in nursing and a literature study on clinical decision-making. To ensure the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>standards</b> for clinical decision-making in nursing, principles of logic, prolonged engagement, triangulation, peer-group discussion, dense description, stepwise repetition and an investigative audit (Lincoln & Guba, 1985 : 289 - 331) were adhered to. Two experts were consulted to validate the standards for quality clinical decisionmaking in nursing...|$|R

40|$|Introduction An {{earlier study}} showed that an Angoff {{procedure}} with {{greater than or equal}} to 10 recently graduated students as judges can be used to estimate the passing score of a progress test. As the acceptability and feasibility of this approach are questionable, we conducted an Angoff procedure with test item writers as judges. This paper reports on thereliability and <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> this procedure and compares the standards set by the two different panels. Methods Fourteen item writers judged 146 test items. Recently graduated students had assessed these items in a previous study. Generalizability was investigated as a function of the number of items and judges. Credibility was judged by comparing the pass/fail rates associated with the Angoff standard, a relative standard and a fixed standard. The Angoff standards obtained by item writers and graduates were compared. Results The variance associated with consistent variability of item writers across items was 1. 5 % and for graduate students it was 0. 4 %. An acceptable error score required 39 judges. Item-Angoff estimates of the two panels and item P -values correlated highly. Failure rates of 57 %, 55 % and 7 % were associated with the item writers' standard, the fixed standard and the graduates' standard, respectively. Conclusion The graduates' and the item writers' standards differed substantially, as did the associated failure rates. A panel of 39 item writers is not feasible. The item writers' passing score appears to be less credible. The <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> the graduates' <b>standard</b> needs further evaluation.
