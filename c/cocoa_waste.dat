This research was conducted in the experimental field and Laboratory of Production Faculty of Agriculture, University of Riau in Campus Binawidya Km 12. 5 Simpang Baru Pekanbaru. This research was conducted from January to April 2015. The research used Completely Randomized Design factorial that consisting of two factors. The first factor is the cocoa 2 ̆ 7 s kind waste (T) consists of four levels, they are T 1 = wet waste in chopped 100 g/plant; T 2 = dry waste chopped 100 g/plant; T 3 = dry waste burned 100 g/plant; T 4 = compost <b>cocoa</b> exocarpium <b>waste</b> 100 g/plant. The second factor is the NPK fertilizer (U), which consists of 4 levels, namely U (3. 75, 7. 5, 11 : 25, 15) g/polybag. Both these factors resulted in 16 treatsment combinations, each combination made three replications, so that there are 48 experimental units. Each experimental unit consisted of four plants, so the total crop was 192 plants. Parameters measured were seedling height, number of leaves, stem diameter, leaf area, the ratio of crown roots and seedling dry weight. Data obtained from the research results were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance followed by a further test of Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s New Multiple Range Test (DNMRT) at 5...|$|R
30|$|Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L., family: Sterculiaceae) {{is a major}} {{cash crop}} in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and many {{tropical}} countries. Global annual production of dry cocoa beans exceeded 3.98  million tons in 2011 – 2012 (ICCO 2012). Each ton of dry beans produced generates approximately ten tons of cacao pod husks and the global burden of pod husk waste continues to increase well over 40  million tons (Vriesmann et al. 2012). Valorization of <b>cocoa</b> pod husk <b>waste</b> has been attempted by producing animal feed (Aregheore 2002; Alexander et al. 2008), black soap (Taiwo and Osinowo 2001), crude gums and pectins for food and pharmaceutical industries (Samuel 2006; Vriesmann et al. 2012) and as a fertilizer in crop production (Oladokun 1986; Iberemo 2010; Oyewole et al. 2012; Gusli 2013). PNG cocoa is known globally for its fine-flavored cocoa beans and country earns an annual export income of almost $ 100  million. The crop is grown in 100, 000 – 130, 000  ha area and exports over 47, 000 t of cocoa (Nelson et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Wastes from a vegetal {{extracts}} industry (cocoa, oak, Guarana and mate) {{were characterized}} by particle size, proximate and ultimate analysis, lignocellulosic fractions, high heating value, thermal analysis (Thermogravimetric analysis – TGA, and Differential thermal analysis - DTA) and energy density to evaluate their potential as biomass {{in the form of}} briquettes for power generation. All wastes presented adequate particle sizes to briquettes production. The wastes showed high moisture content, requiring previous drying for use as briquettes. <b>Cocoa</b> and oak <b>wastes</b> had the highest volatile matter contents with maximum mass loss at 310 ºC and 450 ºC, respectively. The solvents used in the aroma extraction process influenced in the moisture content of the wastes, which was higher for mate due to water has been used as solvent. All wastes showed an insignificant loss mass after 565 °C, hence resulting in low ash content. High carbon and hydrogen contents and low sulfur and nitrogen contents were observed ensuring a low generation of sulfur and nitrous oxides. Mate and cocoa exhibited the highest carbon and lignin content, and high heating value. The dried wastes had high heating value, from 17. 1 MJ/kg to 20. 8 MJ/kg. The results indicate the energy potential of wastes for use as fuel in power generation...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the nutrient degradability, in vitro methane (CH 4) production ofseveral agricultural and food industry by-products in relation to their chemical composition. Twenty-onesamples of 7 feedstuffs from agricultural and food industry by-products consisted of corn straw, potatostraw, rice straw, <b>cocoa</b> pod, sago <b>waste,</b> rice bran, soybean curd residue were evaluated by an in vitro gasproduction and nutrient degradability. The feedstuffs varied greatly in their crude protein (CP), neutraldetergent fiber (NDF) and non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) contents. Crude protein ranged from 1. 5 to 21. 8 %,NDF from 31. 6 to 71. 1 % and NFC from 1. 5 to 50. 8 %. Among the seven feedstuffs, soybean curd residuehad the highest CP content, on the other hand it had the lowest NDF content. Dry matter (DM) and organicmatter (OM) degradability were highest (P< 0. 01) in soybean curd residue among the feedstuffs. The CH 4 production was significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in rice straw, cocoa pod and corn straw as compared to sagowaste. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0. 60; P< 0. 01) between NDF concentration and CH 4 production. However, the total gas productions was negatively correlated (r = - 0. 75; P< 0. 01) with NDFcontent. The CH 4 production of feedstuff is influenced by NDF content...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Development of {{circular}} economy requires significant {{advances in the}} technologies for valorisation of waste, as waste becomes new feedstock. Food waste is a particularly important feedstock, containing large variation of complex chemical functionality. Although most food waste sources are complex mixtures, waste from food processing, no longer suitable for the human food chain, may also represent relatively clean materials. One such material requiring valorisation is cocoa butter. RESULTS: Epoxidation of a triglyceride from a food waste source, processing <b>waste</b> <b>cocoa</b> butter, into the corresponding triglyceride epoxide was carried out using a modified Ishii-Venturello catalyst in batch and continuous flow reactors. The batch reactor achieved higher yields due to the significant decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the laminar flow tubular reactor. Integral and differential models describing the reaction and the phase transfer kinetics were developed for the epoxidation of cocoa butter and the model parameters were estimated. Ring-opening of the epoxidised cocoa butter was undertaken to provide polyols of varying molecular weight (M_w = 2000 - 84 000 Da), hydroxyl value (27 - 60 mg KOH g^- 1) and acid value (1 - 173 mg KOH g^- 1), using either aqueous ortho-phosphoric acid (H_ 3 PO_ 4) or boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF_ 3 ·OEt_ 2) -mediated oligomerisation in bulk, using hexane or tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvents. The thermal and tensile properties of the polyurethanes obtained from the reaction of these polyols with 4, 4 '-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) are described. CONCLUSION: The paper presents a complete valorisation scheme for a food manufacturing industry waste stream, starting from the initial chemical transformation, developing a process model {{for the design of}} a scaled-up process, and leading to synthesis of the final product, in this case a polymer. This work describes aspects of optimisation of the conversion route, focusing on clean synthesis and also demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of the development projects, requiring input from different areas of chemistry, process modelling and process design.
