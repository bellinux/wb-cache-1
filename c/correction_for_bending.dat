40|$|Standard peel {{tests for}} {{aerospace}} laminates based on metal–polymer systems, namely floating-roller and climbing-drum peel methods, have been accommodated in a unified theory of peeling. This theory also accommodates more basic peel tests such as T-peel and fixed-arm peel and also newer {{methods such as}} mandrel peel. These five methods have been applied to two aerospace laminate systems to critically examine their use in the determination of adhesive strength. The theory {{has been used to}} unify the outputs from the tests in terms of adhesive fracture toughness. In this way, the comparative merits of the methods can be commented on. The validity of the standard methods has been put in doubt because of the absence of a <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> plastic <b>bending</b> energy and also because of the poor conformance of the peel arm to the roller system used in these methods. The unified theory and some measurements of peel-arm curvature help but not completely overcome some of these difficulties. A further complication that arises in peel is a change in the plane of fracture. This reflects a transition from cohesive fracture in the adhesive to an adhesive fracture at the interfaces among adhesive, primer, and substrate. It is likely that such plane-of-fracture phenomena are intrinsic to evaluation of the laminate and that contemplation of cohesive fracture toughness for the adhesive cannot accommodate such events...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis describes {{the development of a}} novel strategy for the steady state tip position control of a single link flexible robot arm. Control is based upon a master/slave relationship. Arm trajectory is defined by through 'master' positioning head which moves a laser through a programmed path. Tip position is detected by an optical system which produces an error signal proportional to the displacement of the tip from the demand laser spot position. The error signal and its derivative form inputs to the arm 'slave' controller so enabling direct tip control with simultaneous <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> arm <b>bending.</b> Trajectory definition is not model-based as it is defined optically through movement of the positioning head alone. A critical investigation of vacuum tube and solid state sensing methods is undertaken leading {{to the development of a}} photodiode quadrant detector beam tracking system. The effect of varying the incident light parameters on the beam tracker performance are examined from which the optimum illumination characteristics are determined. Operational testing of the system on a dual-axis prototype robot using the purpose-built beam tracker has shown that successful steady state tip control can be achieved through a PD based slave controller. Errors of less than 0. 05 mm and settling times of 0. 2 s are obtained. These results compare favourably with those for the model-based tip position correction strategies where tracking errors of ± 0. 6 mm are recorded...|$|R

40|$|Gamma ray {{tracking}} {{in future}} HPGe arrays like AGATA {{will rely on}} pulse shape analysis (PSA) of multiple Gamma interactions. For this purpose, a simple and fast procedure was developed which enabled the first full characterization of a segmented large volume HPGe detector. An analytical model for the hole mobility in a Ge crystal lattice was developed to describe the hole drift anisotropy with experimental velocity values along the crystal axis as parameters. The new model {{is based on the}} drifted Maxwellian hole distribution in Ge. It is verified by reproducing successfully experimental longitudinal hole anisotropy data. A comparison between electron and hole mobility shows large differences for the longitudinal and tangential velocity anisotropy {{as a function of the}} electrical field orientation. Measurements on a 12 fold segmented, n-type, large volume, irregular shaped HPGe detector were performed in order to determine the parameters of anisotropic mobility for electrons and holes as charge carriers created by gamma ray interactions. To characterize the electron mobility the complete outer detector surface was scanned in small steps employing photopeak interactions at 60 keV. A precise measurement of the hole drift anisotropy was performed with 356 keV rays. The drift velocity anisotropy and crystal geometry cause considerable rise time differences in pulse shapes depending on the position of the spatial charge carrier creation. Pulse shapes of direct and transient signals are reproduced by weighting potential calculations with high precision. The measured angular dependence of rise times is caused by the anisotropic mobility, crystal geometry, changing field strength and space charge effects. Preamplified signals were processed employing digital spectroscopy electronics. Response functions, crosstalk contributions and averaging procedures were taken into account implying novel methods due to the segmentation of the Ge-crystal and the digital electronics. The results are relevant for the future gamma ray tracking detectors where high precision of position information of single gamma ray interactions is required. The high accuracy in simulation enabled very high position resolution using PSA. The first application of this technique in a real experiment aimed at the <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> crystal <b>bending</b> imperfections in a Bragg-spectrometer. A position resolution of 1. 4 mm (sigma) was achieved with 184 keV gamma rays employing the fully characterized detector. By careful characterization of the electronic noise, this result is expected to improve further upon use of optimized filters...|$|R
