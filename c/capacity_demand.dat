In this contribution, we use methods from algorithmic game-theory and traffic-modeling to predict the flows, and hence <b>capacity</b> <b>demand</b> across worksystems, based on the available production paths and desired output rates, assuming non-cooperative agents with global information. We propose an iterative algorithm that converges simultaneously to a feasible capacity distribution and a flow distribution over multiple paths that satisfies Wardrop's first principle.

COTM antennas {{must address the}} challenge of offering a desired data rate to users using wide beam satellites which are disadvantaged with low gain and asymmetric gain patterns. The new High Throughput Satellite (HTS) designs have large numbers of small spot beams, reuse frequency across the beams, and offer higher EIRP and G/T to address the challenges encountered by COTM. Satellite resources, mainly power and bandwidth, need to be allocated to meet the peak <b>capacity</b> <b>demand</b> {{in each of the}} HTS beam rather than the sum of the <b>capacity</b> <b>demand</b> in all HTS beams. This typically results in a larger capacity requirement to satisfy. The researcher proposes a ground-based solution to plan transmission in HTS beams and dynamically adapt parameters such as bandwidth and transmission power in an HTS equipped with Multi Port Amplifier (MPA) such that the demand for the capacity that changes with time can be met in real time. At any given time, the available power and bandwidth can be assigned to a beam based on its demand by varying the input power levels. Since the conventional transmission in satellite service is fixed and based on the peak demand in each beam, this solution will reduce the satellite resources required to meet the <b>capacity</b> <b>demand</b> and significantly benefit COTM services...|$|E

40|$|Judicious {{management}} of on-chip last-level caches (LLC) {{is critical to}} alleviating the memory wall of chip multiprocessors (CMP). Although there already exist many LLC management proposals, belonging to either the spatial or temporal dimension, they fail to capture and utilize the inherent interplays between the two dimensions in capacity management. Therefore, this dissertation is targeted at exploring and exploiting the spatiotemporal interactions in LLC capacity management to improve CMPs 2 ̆ 7 performance. Based on this general idea, we address four specific research problems in the dissertation. ^ For the private LLC organization, prior-art proposals can improve the efficacy of inter-core cooperative caching at the coarse-grained application level. However, they are still suboptimal because {{they are unable to}} take advantage of the diverse <b>capacity</b> <b>demands</b> at the fine-grained set level. We introduce the SNUG LLC design that exploits the set-level non-uniformity of <b>capacity</b> <b>demands</b> and thus further improves performance. ^ Still for the private LLC management, we notice that neither spatial nor temporal LLC management schemes, working separately as in prior work, can deliver robust performance under various circumstances due to set-level non-uniform <b>capacity</b> <b>demands.</b> We propose a novel adaptive scheme, called STEM, to solve the problem by interactively managing both spatial and temporal dimensions of <b>capacity</b> <b>demands</b> at the set level. ^ For the shared LLC organization, existing proposals try to improve either locality or utility for heterogeneous workloads. But we find that none of them can deliver consistently the best performance under a variety of workloads due to applications 2 ̆ 7 diverse locality and utility features. To address the problem, we present the CLU LLC design that co-optimizes the locality 2 ̆ 6 utility of co-scheduled threads and thus adapts to more diverse workloads than the prior-arts. ^ To make a cache management strategy practical for industry, we will need to cut the overhead of the re-reference prediction value (RRPV). We observe that delicately-tuned replacement policies rooted in single-bit RRPVs can closely approximate the performance of their correspondents with log associativity-bit RRPVs. Therefore, we propose a novel practical shared LLC design, called COOP, which entails a 1 -bit RRPV per cacheline and a lightweight monitor per core for locality 2 ̆ 6 utility co-optimization. At a considerably low storage cost, COOP achieves higher performance than the two recent practical replacement policies that rely on 2 -bit RRPVs but are oriented towards locality optimization only. ...|$|R
