Between the upper front and rear posts of the frame were fitted two streamlined fuel tanks (clearly visible in the image above), one on each side of and above the pilot’s seat, with a combined capacity of six gallons (22.7 L.).|$|E
40|$|Pentachlorophenol {{is banned}} in some {{countries}}, {{and its use}} in other countries is receiving increased resistance. Also, the increased emphasis on hardwood utilization requires that more information be obtained {{on the performance of}} preservatives applied to hardwoods. Several fungicides applied as brush treatments were evaluated as alternatives to chlorinated phenols for protection of wood above ground. <b>Cross-brace</b> and L-joint test units, constructed of southern pine, Douglas-fir, maple, or red oak, were treated just before assembly and exposed outdoors from 5 to 12 years at two sites. After 12 years at the Wisconsin site, untreated pine and maple <b>cross-brace</b> units were severely decayed, red oak had only limited decay, and Douglas-fir had no decay. After 12 years at the Mississippi site, untreated pine, maple, and red oak <b>cross-brace</b> units were severely decayed, and Douglas-fir had no decay. The two hardwood species were more difficult to protect from decay than were the softwood species. No treatment completely prevented decay in maple <b>cross-brace</b> units exposed for 9 to 12 years in Mississippi. Most treatments only slightly reduced decay development in red oak <b>cross-brace</b> units exposed in Mississippi; many treatments protected pine <b>cross-brace</b> units. The L-joint units were exposed for only 5 and 6 years at the Mississippi site but were more difficult to protect from decay than were the <b>cross-brace</b> units. Several alternative treatments were as effective or more effective than the chlorinated phenols in preventing decay in both types of test units...|$|R

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} followed developing standard de Havilland practice, with spruce longerons <b>cross-braced</b> {{and covered}} in thin plywood. [...] The rudder and elevators were balanced and the fin and rudder had the familiar de Havilland shape. [...] The pilot sat directly below {{the leading edge of}} the wing and there was a dorsal observer/gunner's position. [...] Within the fuselage between them, and with three portholes each side, was a cabin for the navigator/bomb aimer. [...] The water-cooled 650hp (485kW) Rolls-Royce Condor III had a rectangular nose-mounted radiator, and drove a four-bladed propeller.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Wib 2 were {{rectangular}} in plan and mounted without stagger or dihedral. [...] The single bays were defined by parallel pairs of inward leaning interplane struts, assisted by crossed flying and landing wires from the bases of the struts to the fuselage. Cabane struts supported the upper wing above the fuselage. The wings had thick, high lift coefficient sections, constructed around deep single spars built up from Duralumin sheet; the ribs were formed from <b>cross-braced</b> metal tubes. Ailerons were mounted only on the lower wing.|$|E
2500|$|The pilot's cockpit, with a faired {{headrest}} behind it, was at {{the trailing}} edge of the upper wing, placed within a small cut-out to improve his limited view. The H.26 had a fuselage built around four metal tube, <b>cross-braced</b> longerons, enclosed within metal formers and stringers to shape it into an oval cross-section. Behind him the fuselage tapered to the broad chord fixed tail surfaces. [...] The mid-fuselage tailplane, which had a strongly swept leading edge, carried round tipped elevators that narrowed inboard. [...] The vertical tail was oval shaped, with a broad chord rudder that ended {{at the top of the}} fuselage.|$|E

2500|$|The Š-3's upright inline {{engine was}} {{completely}} enclosed within a cowling, with its top {{just below the}} pilot's eye line. It drove a two-blade propeller with a domed spinner. [...] The BMW was cooled with Lamblin cylindrical radiators placed between the undercarriage legs, though a diagram shows it with narrow, fuselage-hugging (cheek) radiators. The oval cross-section fuselage tapered rearwards behind the cockpit to a straight tapered tailplane and divided elevators with a cutout for rudder movement; the latter was mounted on a circular-edged fin and had its bottom cropped for elevator clearance. [...] The Š-3 had a fixed, single-axle conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on <b>cross-braced</b> V-struts.|$|E
2500|$|The 4 cylinder, air-cooled, twin-cam 650cc {{engine is}} housed in a <b>cross-braced</b> duplex steel tube frame. Yamaha made the engine {{narrower}} by locating the alternator behind the cylinder block and above the gearbox {{rather than on the}} end of the crankshaft. The Maxim had shaft drive. Contemporary reports praised the Maxim's performance and braking. Criticism was aimed at engine vibration and under-damped suspension. [...] Succeeding Maxim models were refinements; the 1982 Maxim 650 had a more comfortable handlebar, an air-adjustable fork, and a more luxurious seat. A turbocharged variant, the XJ650 Seca Turbo, was featured in the 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again.|$|E
2500|$|The wooden {{monocoque}} fuselage {{was equally}} refined and polished, its oval section tapering towards the tail. [...] Towards the nose the fuselage flattened {{to accommodate the}} three four-cylinder blocks of its 340kW (450hp) W-12 Hispano-Suiza 12Gb engine, driving a low-set two-blade propeller with a large spinner. [...] This was water-cooled, with under-wing radiators from the root to half span, assisted by a single ventral radiator just aft of the undercarriage. [...] The fixed, tricycle undercarriage had unfaired single mainwheels on a single axle, attached by bungee cord to two flat, faired, tapered legs. These legs were <b>cross-braced</b> with streamlined stays. [...] The open cockpit was at the wing trailing edge. [...] Because the Hispano engine of the V.2 was mounted lower in the nose than the Lorraine-Dietrich, another W-12, of the V.1, the central cylinder bank did not so completely obscure the pilot's forward view.|$|E

40|$|Steel {{scaffolds}} collapse {{quite often}} {{in many places}} with {{a considerable number of}} reported casualties, but their behaviour has not been studied to the extent of many other permanent structures. This paper investigates the effect of eccentric loads on steel scaffolding systems used in construction sites. The type of scaffold considered here is the door-shaped steel scaffold with an inner reinforced gable sub-frame. The single-side <b>cross-brace</b> scaffolding systems with various eccentric loads are mainly focused on two issues, namely, the unrestrained boundary and the removal of <b>cross-braces</b> at the access location. This study shows that regardless of the lowest layer of <b>cross-brace</b> in a scaffold being removed or not, the critical load of a scaffolding system under an eccentric load is the lowest, whereas that of scaffolding system under a concentric load is the maximum. If the bottom jack base of a scaffolding system in construction sites is strengthened to a fixed end, the critical load of this scaffolding system will be greatly increased. If a scaffolding system is erected more than 8 stories high, the critical load of the scaffolding system with the fixed end base can be increased to 2. 4 times that with the hinged base. However, whether the <b>cross-braces</b> at the lowest story of a scaffolding system are removed or not, the simulated scaffolding test indicates that the critical load of a used scaffolding system under the eccentric load is the lowest and its load reduction also appears significant.

2500|$|The Hanriot D.I was {{a single}} seat, Nieuport style mid wing monoplane, with {{slightly}} tapered, straight edged wings. Landing wires on each side met over the fuselage at a short pyramidal four strut pylon like that on the Nieuport IV. The single, open cockpit was under the pylon. [...] Like the Nieuport, it had a braced, broad chord tailplane, with a strongly swept leading edge, mounted {{on top of the}} rectangular section fuselage and a deep, broad chord rudder with no fin moving between the elevators. [...] The undercarriage used the standard Hanriot box with two longitudinal skids forming the lower edge of a <b>cross-braced</b> box, with four legs, a cross bar and an axle forming the other sides. The skids were upturned at the front to avoid nose-overs and the rear of the skid ran on the ground on landing, slowing the aircraft and preventing the tail from hitting the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The Ponnier D.III was {{a single}} seat, mid wing {{monoplane}} designed {{to compete in the}} 1913 Gordon Bennett Trophy race. Pairs of landing wires on each side met over the fuselage at a pyramidal four strut pylon and parallel flying wires went to the lower fuselage. An oil deflecting cowling, open at the bottom, surrounded the powerful double row, fourteen cylinder Gnome Lambda-Lambda rotary engine, which delivered [...] to a 2 m diameter propeller. The oval, open cockpit was placed at mid-wing, just aft of the pylon centre. It had a finless rudder at the extreme rear of the fuselage and a straight edged tailplane mounted on the upper fuselage ahead of it. The elevators were aerodynamically separate but interconnected, controlled by central wires. The D.III had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a single axle mounted to the fuselage by pairs of wire <b>cross-braced</b> V-struts, plus a simple elliptical leaf spring tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|The Caudron-Fabre, {{like the}} earlier Caudron land-planes, had no {{enclosed}} fuselage but instead {{a pair of}} parallel vertical girders, each with cross-members but only <b>cross-braced</b> horizontally towards the tail. On the land-planes the lower longitudinal members of the girder ran to the undercarriage; this was not practical on the float-plane so they were replaced by horizontal members running forward from the tail to beyond the wing. These extensions, braced by sloping struts on each side to both of the centre section struts formed a kind of outrigger on which the pilot sat, exposed, just forward of the leading edge. Behind the pilot and mounted on the rear pair of the centre-section struts was an un-cowled, pusher configuration [...] Anzani 6-cylinder radial engine. Long cut-outs from the trailing edges of both wings were needed to clear {{the path of the}} large diameter, two blade propeller. A rectangular tailplane was mounted on a cross member between the upper girders, strengthened by outward diagonal bracing, with broad chord elevator-like surfaces extending beyond. A pair of rectangular rudders were hinged, close together, from this same cross-member.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{construction}} {{began an}} experimental section was constructed. This {{used a variety}} of construction techniques: one end used hollow timber spars, the centre frame used a combination of timber and aluminium, while the other end used aluminium only. Although wood proved the most satisfactory, the Admiralty preferred metal. In late 1909 duralumin became available, and it was decided to use this new alloy, which would allow a considerable weight saving while also forming a stronger structure. The hull was made up of [...] 40 twelve-sided transverse frames spaced [...] apart: some of which were <b>cross-braced</b> by wires, dividing the structure into 17 bays of irregular length, varying from 12.5ft to 37.5ft (3.8m to 11.4m). The frames were connected by 12 longitudinal girders and a triangular section keel below the main structure. The hull shape was based on work by the American aerodynamicist Albert Zahm, and its head resistance was claimed to be 40% of that of contemporary Zeppelins. [...] A fully streamlined shape had been proposed, but was rejected by the Admiralty as being too difficult to construct. It was not until 1917/18 that a truly streamlined airship, the R80, was constructed.|$|E
2500|$|The fuselages of the Types 20 and 22 {{were similar}} flat-sided {{structures}} based on four <b>cross-braced</b> longerons, {{each of three}} parts. [...] Since {{the nose of the}} 22 did not terminate in a propeller, the high cockpit of the 20 was replaced with a blunt-nosed cabin, curved in planform, for the pilot. [...] Behind him the passenger seats in the Type 22 were in pairs, each with their own window. Boarding and disembarking were reported as a little difficult. The wing-mounted engines led to revised wing plans and structures. The Breguet 22 had equal-span, unstaggered wings of rectangular plan and three bays. [...] The innermost bay was defined by the engine by the engine mountings, which placed the U.16s with their four-blade tractor propellers on multiple struts midway between the two wings. Radiators were mounted {{on the sides of the}} engine cowling. [...] The outer bays were formed by single interplane struts with forked junctions into the wings, assisted by cross-bracing. [...] At the rear the tail was, like that of the Type 20, quite small and conventional with the tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage but now carrying a pair of small additional fins. [...] The landing gear was also conventional, with each fixed mainwheel mounted on a pair of substantial V-form legs from the wing spars under the inner bay.|$|E
