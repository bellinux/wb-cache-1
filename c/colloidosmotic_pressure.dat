40|$|The {{magnitude}} of transcapillary backfiltration by the <b>colloidosmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> within the peritoneal capillaries {{compared to the}} effective lymphatic absorption was investigated in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. This was done during a 4 -hour dwell period, using a hypoosmolar dialysis fluid (280 mosm/kg H 2 O) in 8 patients and compared to 5 of these patients using a 1. 36 % glucose (GS; 324 mosm/kg H 2 O). The low molecular weight solute transport did not differ between the two solutions. The intraperitoneal dextran 70 concentration increased during the dwell with the hypoosmolar dialysis fluid (from 770 to 945 mg/l; p = 0. 000002) and decreased with the GS (from 859 to 719 mg/l; p = 0. 007). With the GS the transcapillary ultrafiltration was directed towards the abdominal cavity during the dwell period. With the hypoosmolar fluid, the transcapillary ultrafiltration was continuously directed towards the circulation. In this solution, the {{magnitude of}} transcapillary backfiltration due to <b>colloidosmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> within the peritoneal capillaries was 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 ml/min.

40|$|The {{presence}} of proteins (albumin and globulins) in lymphedematous tissue not only {{gives rise to}} <b>colloidosmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> but also produces an electrostatic charge endowing the proteins with individual features and different migration rates. The working hypothesis of the experimental study is to transfer lymph proteins from the upper fascia accumulation area to a subfascial drainage area by subjecting them to an adequate difference in potential. A double chamber, variable volume system with separation wall able to contain a 1 cm square of muscle fascia, was designed and built; {{the aim of the}} apparatus was to reproduce the subcutaneus zone separated by the fascia interposition, from the muscle-vascular zone.

40|$|AbstractDuring its 48 h asexual {{reproduction}} cycle, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum ingests and digests hemoglobin {{in excess of}} its metabolic requirements and causes {{major changes in the}} homeostasis of the host red blood cell (RBC). A numerical model suggested that this puzzling excess consumption of hemoglobin is necessary for the parasite to reduce the <b>colloidosmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> within the host RBC, thus preventing lysis before completion of its reproduction cycle. However, the validity of the colloidosmotic hypothesis appeared to be compromised by initial conflicts between model volume predictions and experimental observations. Here, we investigated volume and membrane area changes in infected RBCs (IRBCs) using fluorescence confocal microscopy on calcein-loaded RBCs. Substantial effort was devoted to developing and testing a new threshold-independent algorithm for the precise estimation of cell volumes and surface areas to overcome the shortfalls of traditional methods. We confirm that the volume of IRBCs remains almost constant during parasite maturation, suggesting that the reported increase in IRBCs' osmotic fragility results from a reduction in surface area and increased lytic propensity on volume expansion. These results support the general validity of the colloidosmotic hypothesis, settle the IRBC volume debate, and help to constrain the range of parameter values in the numerical model...|$|E
40|$|Following hyperimmunization of rabbits {{a marked}} {{increase}} in the gamma globulin and fall in the albumin in the blood may be demonstrated (1). The increase in globulin (measured by precipitation with ammonium sulfate according to Henriques and Klansen's method (2)) is identical with the {{increase in the}} antibody protein. The fall in the albumin concentration is probably due to a regulative mechanism which attempts to maintain a normal <b>colloidosmotic</b> <b>pressure.</b> This regulation may act in various ways of which the following may be concerned: (a) inhibition of the production of albumin or increase in the rate of its catabolism, (b) displacement of albumin from intra- to extravascular spaces, or (c) simple dilution with increase of the plasma volume. The object {{of this paper is to}} investigate which of these three possible mechanisms is concerned. Methods White rabbks of the Danish country race bred in the State Serum Institute were employed in the experiment. At the commencement of the experiment the animals were 6 to 7 months old and weighed 2, 800 to 3, 000 gin. The vaccine employed consisted of formalin-kiUed pneumococci of eight different types (9 N, llB, 14, 22 L, 23 Mac, 28 A, 33 A, 41 A) in equal quantities of each.

40|$|The author {{carried out}} {{investigations}} on {{the changes in}} blood volume in circulation by means of Congo red dye method and hematocrit in 33 cases of valvular disturbances, hypertension and miocarcliac degeneration that caused circulatory disorder. The observations made were compared with various clinical symptoms so {{that some sort of}} relationship might be established between the two. The results of the investigations disclosed that higher the degree of circulatory disorder, the larger became the blood volume in circulation in the majority of cases under study, but there were some, though the number was small, that manifested no increase in the blood volume although they were suffering from high degree of circulatory disorder. They might be called 2 ̆ 2 metabolic disturbance of oligemia. 2 ̆ 2 A research into the cause of why the blood volume behaved in this manner revealed some interesting. observations. In the metabolic disturbance of high degree, a high degree of dropsy occurred both in the cases in which blood volume was increased and those in which blood volume did not increase, but in the latter serum protein levels, especially the ratio of albumin to globulin, were marked lowered. It will readily be seen that this phenomenon is due to an increase in the consumption of albumin brought about by the multiplication of acid matters in the tissues because of the high degree of disturbance. The resultant difference in the <b>colloidosmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> of the blood would have influenced the transfer of serous fluid between the blood and the tissues. To sum up, there existed close relationship between the behavior of blood volume in circulation and the gegree of metabolic disturbance and dropsy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the {{comparison}} of pressure generation in {{the right and left}} ventricle based on isolated cases of sheep's hearts hemoperfusion. The experiments were made in the scope of the MBF Project "Physiological hemoperfusion of isolated organs and the use for the replacement of animal experiments". The experiments were made with sheep hearts in the animal experiment department of the Charité. The animals all originated from one breed and were of comparable age and of same weight whereby a high degree of result reproducibility was achieved. A system was implemented for the perfusion of the hearts which represents an extracorporal circulation whereby the blood perfusion mixture was oxygenized and dialyzed and thermostated to constant temperature via heat circulation. The perfusion circulation was connected to dialysis circulation via a dialysis module. 50 % of the blood in the perfusion solutions consisted of autologous blood that had been taken from jugular vein of the animals before taking their hearts out. This share of blood guaranteed that the oxygen transport to the heart tissue was given - on the one hand for the <b>colloidosmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and on the other hand}} by the haemoglobin contained. The aim was to determine standard and reference values for pressure generation in both ventricles taking particular account of the values in the right ventricles. Hereby it was possible, with the help of the perfusion apparatus, to compare the performance of the sheep hearts after varying times of cardioplegia under isolated conditions. Two partial experiments were carried out. In each part-experiment 15 sheep hearts were examined. In both parts of the experiment three hearts each were cardioplegia-treated and then connected to the perfusion apparatus characterised above. Both part-experiments were identical in overall procedure with the exception of the cardioplegia treatment solutions. In the first part, a self-produced modified cancer Henseleit solution with BDM additive was used, in the second part a ready-made Bretschneider's solution (Custodiol solution). As both the removal of the hearts and the cardioplegia treatment and also the following perfusion took place in the same building, a very good preservation of the heart was possible to enhance the comparability factor of the experiment. Metabolic characteristics and organ characteristics such as heart frequency, organ resistance and coronary flow rate were used to characterise the stability of the system. All the hearts underwent perfusion for a total period of one hour, whereby the first half of the experiment was to achieve a steady state after connecting the hearts. The measurements were made on the second half under unchanging conditions. It was revealed that the hearts performed under pressure already after 15 to 20 minutes after being connected to a physiological frequency and also revealed a physiological organ flow and perfusion pressure with values of 60 - 120 ml*min - 1 * 100 g - 1 mmHg. The established pressure values decreased in both ventricles in a different manner with both plegia solutions. the longer the cardioplegia time. Thus the individual Custodiol values for the left ventricular end diastolic pressure was 74 % for 8 hours cardioplegia to 25 % for 36 hours compared to the initial values after one hour (100 %). In the case of left ventricular end diastolic pressure values for the BDM cardioplegia the corresponding figures were 64 % (8 hours) to 15 % (36 hours). The situation is vice-versa for the right ventricles, where, in comparison to the cardiopleged hearts with Custodiol in the BDM experiments, a lower percentage decrease of pressure differences resulted in comparison to the initial value. Thus the values for 8 hours (right ventricular end diastolic pressure with BDM) at 55 % (right ventricular end diastolic pressure with Custodiol® at 29 %) and for 24 hours at 43 % and 25 %. After 24 hours of cardioplegia they reveal approximately the same value at 30 % and 31 % respectively. 36 -hour values for the right ventricle could not be determined. The experiment model described is therefore suitable for experiments on the isolated hemoperfusion of sheep hearts and can be utilised for further issues...|$|E
