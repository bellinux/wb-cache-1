2500|$|Gas leaks: [...] Air leaks can {{be caused}} by burst or leaky hoses, {{defective}} o-rings, blown o-rings, particularly in yoke connectors, loose connections, and several of the previously listed malfunctions. Low pressure inflation hoses may fail to connect properly, or the non-return valve may leak. A burst low pressure hose will usually lose gas faster than a burst high pressure hose, as HP hoses usually have a flow restriction orifice in the fitting that screws into the port, as the SPG does not need high flow, and a slower pressure increase in the gauge hose is less likely to overload the gauge, while the hose to a second stage must provide high peak flow rate to minimize work of breathing. A relatively common o-ring failure occurs when the yoke <b>clamp</b> <b>seal</b> extrudes due to insufficient clamp force or elastic deformation of the clamp by impact with the environment.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnnexin V, VI and VII-core (Δ 1 – 107) {{are members}} of the annexin protein family and bind to acidic {{phospholipid}} membranes in a calcium dependent manner. They also show ion channel activity under certain conditions. As annexins bind peripherally to lipid membranes, ion channel formation must consist of at least two steps: An adsorption reaction regulating the binding of annexin to the membrane surface and the opening and closing of the active species controlling the channel activity. By using the baseline current through the patch <b>clamp</b> <b>seal</b> as a probe for unoccupied binding sites at the membrane, we show that the adsorption of annexins to membranes is not only calcium dependent but also strongly voltage dependent. Whereas the free transfer energies at low calcium concentrations are similar for all three annexins, the binding of annexin V becomes much tighter with higher calcium levels, compared to annexin VI and VII-core. This correlates with the finding that annexin VI and VII-core display channel activity much more often than annexin V if one assumes that a high coverage of the membrane surface with annexins stabilizes the bilayer. At higher protein concentrations weaker binding is observed in agreement with the previously reported anti-cooperativity of membrane binding...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} design and test a modified perfusion chamber suitable for topical application of drugs to isolated corneoscleral preparations, and which allowed continuous monitoring of endothelial cell function.  METHODS—A polycarbonate and stainless steel perfusion chamber was designed to clamp corneas in a horizontal plane suitable for topical drug delivery. Endothelial cell function was assessed by ultrasonic pachymetry and specular microscopy during perfusion. Epithelial barrier function was assessed by penetration of fluorescein. Leakage was examined by measuring penetration of a large protein, IgG. Tissue architecture after perfusion was examined by conventional histology.  RESULTS—Corneas maintained a functionally and morphologically intact endothelial monolayer during perfusion periods of up to 14  hours. The epithelial barrier function was well preserved. The tissue <b>clamp</b> <b>sealed</b> the preparation effectively against leakage of macromolecules.  CONCLUSION—The new chamber device forms a reliable tool for in vitro drug penetration and toxicity studies in isolated perfused corneoscleral tissue. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent work}} we {{introduced}} fractional Nernst–Planck equations and related fractional cable equations to model electrodiffusion of ions in nerve cells with anomalous subdiffusion along {{and across the}} nerve cells. This work was motivated by many computational and experimental studies showing that anomalous diffusion is ubiquitous in biological systems with binding, crowding, or trapping. For example, recent experiments have shown that anomalous subdiffusion occurs along the axial direction in spiny dendrites due to trapping by the spines. We modeled the subdiffusion in two ways leading to two fractional cable equations and presented fundamental solutions on infinite and semi-infinite domains. Here we present solutions on finite domains for mixed Robin boundary conditions. The finite domain solutions model passive electrotonic properties of spiny dendritic branch segments with ends that are voltage <b>clamped,</b> <b>sealed,</b> or killed. The behavior of the finite domain solutions is similar for both fractional cable equations. With uniform subdiffusion along and across the nerve cells, the solution approaches the standard nonzero steady state, but the approach is slowed by the anomalous subdiffusion. If the subdiffusion is more anomalous along the axial direction, then (boundary conditions permitting) the solution converges to a zero steady state, whereas if the subdiffusion is less anomalous along the axial direction, then the solution approaches a spatially linear steady state. These solutions could be compared with realistic electrophysiological experiments on actual dendrites...|$|R

In a variety of online leak sealing operations, the work to handle flange leakages accounts for about 90 % of the entire workload. This is because most of flanges in actual production have the installing and machining defects, such as uneven clearance, eccentric, reducing, etc. Aimed at those flanges with defects, to ensure the seal effect, the online leak <b>sealing</b> <b>clamp</b> must be machined and installed precisely, which will increase the difficulty of operation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Taste buds were {{isolated}} from the fungiform papilla of the rat tongue and the receptor cells (TRCs) were patch <b>clamped.</b> <b>Seals</b> were obtained on the basolateral membrane of 281 TRCs, protruding from the intact taste buds or isolated by micro-dissection. In whole-cell configuration 72 % of the cells had a TTX blockable transient Na inward current (mean peak amplitude 0. 74 hA). All cells had outward K currents. Their activation was slower than for the Na current and a slow inactivation was also noticeable. The K currents were blocked by tetraethylammonium, Ba, and 4 -aminopyridine, and were absent when the pipette contained Cs instead of K. With 100 mM Ba or 100 mM Ca in the bath, two types of inward current were observed. An L-type Ca current (ICaL) activated at- 20 mV had a mean peak amplitude of 440 pA and inactivated very slowly. At 3 mM Ca the activation threshold of ICa L was near- 40 mV. A transient T-type current (/CAT) activated at- 50 mV had an average peak amplitude of 53 pA and inactivated with a time constant of 36 ms at- 30 inV. ICR L was blocked more efficiently by Cd and D 600 than/Ca T. ICa T was blocked by 0. 2 mM Ni and half blocked by 200 #M amiloride. In whole-cell voltage clamp, Na-saccharin caused (in 34 % of 55 cells tested) a decrease in outward K currents by 21 %, which {{may be expected to}} depolarize the TRCs. Also, Na-saccharin caused some taste cells to fire action potentials (on-ceLl, 7 out of 24 cells; whole-ceLl, 2 out of 38 cells responding to saccharin) of amplitudes sufficient to activate/CAL.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} concern with the acoustic environment within automotive vehicles, there is an interest in measuring the acoustical properties of automotive door seals. These systems {{play an important role}} in blocking external noise sources, such as aerodynamic noise and tire noise, from entering the passenger compartment. Thus, it is important to be able to conveniently measure their acoustic performance. Previous methods of measuring the ability of seals to block sound required the use of either a reverberation chamber, or a wind tunnel with a special purpose chamber attached to it. That is, these methods required the use of large and expensive facilities. A simpler and more economical desktop procedure is thus needed to allow easy and fast acoustic measurement of automotive door seals. In the present work, a desktop, four-microphone, square cross-section standing wave tube was modified by the addition of a new sample holder to make it possible to measure the transmission loss of door seals under various states of compression. In this new procedure, the sample is clamped between a sliding piston and one wall of the standing wave tube. Since the clamp partially blocks the channel, thus impacting the measured transmission loss, a correction is necessary to determine the transmission loss of the seal by itself. Therefore, an initial set of measurements was performed to identify the correction factor required to adjust the measured transmission loss of the <b>clamp</b> plus <b>seal</b> to eliminate the contribution of the clamp itself. Once the accuracy of the correction procedure was verified, a number of typical door seals were tested at various degrees of compression. The transmission losses of the seals were generally in excess of 30 dB, and the transmission loss was found to increase significantly as the seals were compressed. The latter point, in particular, indicates that careful design of the seal mounting arrangements in the vehicle is crucial to ensuring their optimal performance...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Polyethylene {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for natural gas transport since the mid- 1970 's. The pipeline system is sound and well-functioning, {{but there are some}} aspects of the system that could be improved. One of these is the repair method of leaking pipes. Presently if a natural gas pipe begins to leak, the damaged pipe is completely excavated. The pipeline around the damaged area is <b>clamped</b> to <b>seal</b> the pipe and stop the gas flow. The bad piece of pipe is cut out, and a new piece is welded in place. Often, with the passage of time, these welds leak. This is not dangerous but it is costly. The current research focuses on the viability of using a polyethylene patch and a commercial adhesive to seal a leak in the natural gas pipeline. The patch would be applied to the pipe through a keyhole excavation (18 " diameter) with a tool designed and manufactured by Timberline Tool. This tool offers an advantage because repairmen will be able to operate the tool from the ground level through a single keyhole excavation, and possibly without stopping the gas flow in the pipe depending on the leak size. Four commercial, acrylic-based, structural adhesives were analyzed for bonding the patch to the natural gas pipe. Three of the adhesives are manufactured by 3 M Worldwide, DP- 8005, DP- 8010, and DP- 8 OIONS. The fourth is manufactured by Henkel Loctite, Loctite 3030. The cure kinetics of the adhesives were studied with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. The material and mechanical properties of three types of polyethylene substrates (HDPE, pipe MDPE, and pressed MDPE) were studied with tensile testing, contact angle analysis, DSC experiments, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Previous research of determined the bonded patch must be able to withstand up to 500 psi of shear force with an internal pipe pressure of 100 psi (normal pressure in the pipeline is 65 psi). Overlap shear tests were used to analyze the shear strength of the bond between each adhesive and the different polyethylene substrates. The shear tests were used to determine the optimal cure conditions of the adhesives. One adhesive, DP- 8010 from 3 M, was proven to be appropriate for bonding a polyethylene natural gas pipe. When this adhesive is cured under optimal conditions, and the surface of the polyethylene substrate is prepared properly, consistent shear strengths between 800 and 1400 psi can be attained...|$|R
40|$|When feasible, {{surgical}} resection {{is typically}} the preferred therapeutic option {{in patients with}} both primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. Improved patient selection, preoperative management, and advances in perioperative care have had a considerable effect on short-term and long-term outcomes following hepatic resection. Parenchymal transection of the liver can be performed using many different techniques such as digitoclasia, <b>clamp</b> crushing, vessel <b>sealing</b> system, harmonic scalpel, water-jet, Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator, or radiofrequency dissecting sealer. At the time of surgery, {{one of the main}} factors that influences postoperative morbidity and mortality is blood loss. Different techniques are used to decrease blood loss, such as the Pringle maneuver, selective ligation of the right, left, or smaller branches of the portal system; extrahepatic dissection; isolation; and transection of the hepatic artery and portal vein and the total vascular exclusion. Liver resection is on occasion accompanied by a concomitant procedure. Given that colorectal liver metastasis is a common indication for liver resection, colon resection {{is one of the more}} common concurrent procedures, but also surgical management of other disease in the lung or pancreas may sometimes be indicated. A subset of patients with primary or secondary liver malignancies may also require the addition of an ablative therapy to treat the extent of disease in the liver. Moreover, occasionally, hepatic resection takes place following intra-arterial therapy administration to the liver. Although many of these patients may benefit from surgical therapy, a multidisciplinary team approach remains critical.

40|$|ObjectiveIn acute {{traumatic}} bleeding, permissive arterial hypotension with delayed volume resuscitation is {{an established}} lifesaving concept as abridge to surgical control. This study investigated whether preoperatively administered volume also correlated inversely with survival after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA). MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed prospectively collected and validated data of a consecutive cohort {{of patients with}} rAAAs (January 2001 to December 2010). Generally, fluid resuscitation was guided clinically by the patient's blood pressure and consciousness. All intravenous fluids (crystalloids, colloids, and blood products) administered before aortic <b>clamping</b> or endovascular <b>sealing</b> were abstracted from paramedic and anesthesia documentation and normalized to speed of administration (liters per hour). Logistic regression modeling, adjusted for suspected confounding covariates, was used to investigate whether total volume was independently associated with risk of death within 30 days of rAAA repair. ResultsA total of 248 patients with rAAAs were analyzed, of whom 237 (96 %) underwent open repair. A median of 0. 91 L of total volume per hour (interquartile range, 0. 54 - 1. 50 L/h) had been administered preoperatively to these patients. The postoperative 30 -day mortality rate was 15. 3 % (38 deaths). The preoperative rate of fluid infusion correlated with 30 -day mortality after adjustment for confounding factors, and the association persisted robustly through sensitivity analyses: each additional liter per hour increased the odds of perioperative death by 1. 57 -fold (95 % confidence interval, 1. 06 - 2. 33; P =. 026). ConclusionsAggressive volume resuscitation of patients with rAAAs before proximal aortic control predicted an increased perioperative risk of death, which was independent of systolic blood pressure. Therefore, volume resuscitation should be delayed until surgical control of bleeding is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Joint leakage {{from low}} {{pressure}} natural gas distribution mains (typical value: 0. 25 ft[superscript 3] at 6 inwg gas pressure) is a persistent source of maintenance problems for utitlites. External encapsulation {{is the usual}} choice for repairing leaking joints. It is reliable and expensive, about $ 1000 per joint (80 % of which is for excavation and resurfacing). Consolidated Edison of New York is sponsoring a project to develop a cheap and reliable joint seal. No current sealing methods {{were found to be}} acceptable in Phase I. Adhesion failures between the seal and pipe were a major cause of seal failure. Preliminary Phase II research recommended the development of an internal mechanical seal. Such a seal would minimize excavation and eliminate adhesion failures. To complete Phase II, an internal mechanical seal was developed. The initial research indicated that cleaning of the pipe interior had to be minimized or eliminated. Testing demonstrated that a sealant, either asphalt or vulcanizing silicone, greatly enhanced the sealing of uncleaned pipes, while permitting low stress levels. This {{led to the development of}} a new internal mechanical seal concept for sealing uncleaned gas main joints. Joint tests of 2 injected silicone seal concepts were run. The Type 1 seal, which filled the joint recess, completely sealed an uncleaned pipe joint. The Type 2 seal, which spanned the joint recess with an elastomeric bridge, had a leak rate of 0. 000038 ft[superscript 3]/hr at 6 inwg gas pressure from an uncleaned joint. The leakage was caused by permiability of the silicone bridge.
