40|$|Energy {{consumption}} by private and commercial sectors in the U. S. has steadily grown {{over the last}} decade. The uncertainty in future availability of imported oil, on which the energy consumption relies strongly, resulted in {{a dramatic increase in}} the cost of energy. About 20 % of this consumption are used to heat and cool houses and commercial buildings. To reduce dependence on the foreign oil and cut down emission of greenhouse gases, it is necessary to eliminate losses and reduce total energy {{consumption by}} buildings. To achieve this goal it is necessary to redefine the role of the conventional windows. At a minimum, windows should stop being a source for energy loss. Ideally, windows should become a source of energy, providing net gain to reduce energy used to heat and cool homes. It is possible to have a net energy gain from a window if its light transmission can be dynamically altered, ideally electronically without the need of operator assistance, providing optimal control of the solar gain that varies with season and climate in the U. S. In addition, the window must not require power from the building for operation. Resolution of this problem is a societal challenge and of national interest and will have a broad global impact. For this purpose, the year-round, allclimate window solution to provide an electronically variable solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) with a wide dynamic range is needed. AlphaMicron, Inc. (AMI) developed and manufactured 1 ft × 1 ft prototype panels for the world’s first auto-adjusting Adaptive Liquid Crystal Windows (ALCWs) that can operate from sunlight without the need for external power source and demonstrate an electronically adjustable SHGC. This novel windows are based on AlphaMicron’s patented e-Tint® technology, a guesthost liquid crystal system implemented on flexible, optically <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>films.</b> This technology is suitable both for OEM and aftermarket (retro-fitting) lamination to new and existing windows. Low level of power consumption by ALCWs allows for on-board power electronics for automatic matching of transmission through windows to varying climate conditions without drawing the power from the power grid. ALCWs are capable of transmitting more sunlight in winters to assist in heating and less sunlight in summers to minimize overheating. As such, they can change the window from being a source of energy loss to a source of energy gain. In addition, the scalable AMI’s roll-to-roll process, proved by making 1 ft × 1 ftALCW prototype panels, allows for cost-effective production of large-scale window panels along with capability to change easily their color and shape. In addition to architectural glazing in houses and commercial buildings, ALCWs can be used in other applications where control of sunlight is needed, such as green houses, used by commercial produce growers and botanical gardens, cars, aircrafts, etc...|$|R

50|$|The Helios Prototype is an ultra-lightweight flying wing {{aircraft}} with a wingspan of 247 ft, {{longer than}} the wingspans of the U.S. Air Force C-5 military transport (222 ft or the Boeing 747 (195 ft or 224 ft, depending on the model), the two largest operational aircraft built in the United States. The electrically powered Helios is constructed mostly of composite materials such as carbon fiber, graphite epoxy, Kevlar, styrofoam, and a thin, transparent plastic skin. The main tubular wing spar is made of carbon fiber. The spar, which is thicker {{on the top and}} bottom to absorb the constant bending motions that occur during flight, is also wrapped with Nomex and Kevlar for additional strength. The wing ribs are also made of epoxy and carbon fiber. Shaped styrofoam is used for the wing's leading edge and a durable <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> covers the entire wing.|$|E
50|$|Photographic plates preceded {{photographic}} {{film as a}} capture medium in photography. The light-sensitive emulsion of silver salts was coated on a glass plate, typically thinner than common window glass, instead of a <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>film.</b> Glass plates were far superior to film for research-quality imaging because they were extremely stable {{and less likely to}} bend or distort, especially in large-format frames for wide-field imaging. Early plates used the wet collodion process. The wet plate process was replaced late in the 19th century by gelatin dry plates. Glass plate photographic material largely faded from the consumer market {{in the early years of}} the 20th century, as more convenient and less fragile films were increasingly adopted. However, photographic plates were reportedly still being used by one photography business in London until the 1970s, and they were in wide use by the professional astronomical community as late as the 1990s. Workshops on the use of glass plate photography as an alternative medium or for artistic use are still being conducted.|$|E
40|$|Wide {{usage of}} {{mulching}} technology has increased crop yields, but the {{large amounts of}} mulching film residue resulting from widespread use of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> in China has brought about a series of pollution hazards. Based on a 4 -year (2011 - 2014) long-term experiment, the effects {{of different kinds of}} collecting mothod (zero <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues, conventional <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues, whole <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues remainded) on <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues, residual coefficient and maize yield were explored. <b>Plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues mainly remained in 0 ~ 10 cm, 10 ~ 20 cm soil layers. In 0 ~ 30 cm soil layers, the two types of mulch residues (> 25 cm 2, 4 ~ 25 cm 2) under zero <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues treatment were much less than conventional <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues and whole <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues remainded treatments, no significant differences were observed in the mulch residues (2) among 3 treatments. After maize harvest, the amount of <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues under zero <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues, conventional <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues and whole <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues remainded treatments were 52. 71, 80. 85 kg&# 183;hm - 2 and 152. 65 kg&# 183;hm - 2, respectively, the residual coefficient for zero <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues, conventional <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues and whole <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues remainded treatments were - 9. 45 %, 8. 53 % and 54. 42 %, respectively. The stem diameter, ear length, ear width, ear row number, grain number per row and 100 -grain weight of maize decreased with the increase of residual film amount. Compared with the conventional <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues, the mean grain yield of whole <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues remainded treatment decreased by 15. 08 %, whereas the zero <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> residues treatment increased by 4. 70 %.

5000|$|To {{understand}} why the calotype process could sometimes produce attractive results but {{was found to be}} generally unsatisfactory, {{it would be useful to}} compare pictures of the same subject taken with first paper and then with glass (or <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>film)</b> as the negative substrate. An easier way to gain insight into the destructive effect of low contrast spurious texture is to view a relatively large format (not 35 mm) photographic negative in contact with a piece of tracing paper by transmitted light. [...] Positives can be made with a digital camera and digital image processing so that the two cases, with and without the tracing paper, can be compared side by side. Viewed from a distance, the image made through the tracing paper may seem satisfactory. But from closer up, the paper texture will appear more intrusive and begin to camouflage low contrast scene details. This comparison will also demonstrate that paper texture is relatively coarse and, unlike pixelation in a typical digital image, does not quickly become inconspicuous as the distance from which it is viewed increases. [...] Here it is significant to note that the scale of mottling in paper correlates to the average fiber length, which is on the order of millimeters, rather than to the much smaller fiber width.|$|E
5000|$|The Optigan's {{playback}} system functioned {{much like}} the storage and reading of an optical soundtrack as was used in motion pictures, using a light bulb to energize a row of photodiodes {{on the opposite side}} of spinning, 12" [...] diameter <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> discs (officially referred to as [...] "Program Discs") encoded with fifty-seven concentric optical tracks. The system then translated the analog waveforms on the disc to an audio signal. A flip-down door beneath the keyboard allowed access to the disc's loading area to the left of the unit and a disc storage area to the right. Program discs were loaded by simply sliding them onto the felt-covered platform; a V-shaped notch on the front of the panel aided in alignment. When power was applied and the front cover closed, a spindle engaged the center hole of the disc and a motor-driven idler wheel spun the disc on the spindle. The power switch itself was mechanically linked to the disc's drive system; lowering the front panel dropped the spindle and disconnected power to the instrument, allowing the program discs to be changed without the need to fully power down. A broad, flat, white plastic cleaning tool with a purple, simulated velvet cleaning surface was supplied with each Optigan to allow periodic cleaning of the photoelectric cell, located near the rear of the instrument.|$|E

Soil solarization is one practice that involves passively heating soil covered by a thin <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>ﬁlm</b> for several weeks during the periods of high solar radiation before the crop is planted. Soil solarization treatments were repeated to verify their long-term effectiveness on soil microbial biomass and its respiration activities, in addition to yield response and root-knot nematodes control in tomato and melon crops following soil heating. Experiments in greenhouse were carried out in Southern Italy (40 24 0 N, 16 28 E) during the summer of 1998, 1999 and 2000 on soil infested by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica. Crop yields and fruit quality of all vegetable crops were positively affected by repeating solarization for two and three years, compared to an untreated soil and soil treated once in 1998.

40|$|Cultivation {{practices}} permitting earlier sowing {{of cotton}} (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in Greece {{are required to}} maximize yields and facilitate harvesting. An experiment was conducted for 2 years in Central Greece to evaluate two alternative systems. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a Vertic Cambisol and a Typic Regosol field. Cultivation practices tested were: (1) conventional tillage (CT) and sowing in a flat field, (2) ridge tillage (RT), using autumn ridging and (3) sowing in a flat field under <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> (PF). Early and normal sowings were compared. The effects of the treatment on the crop establishment, growth and yield, {{as well as on the}} soil physical properties, were studied. Performance evaluation of the machinery was carried Out. The cost of cultivation practices was estimated. Results of soil physical properties were similar for both years. Soil water contents from sowing to plastic removal in 2000 were 14. 2, 13. 5 and 18. 0 g/ 100 g and temperatures for the same period at 0. 04 m depth were 17. 7, 18. 1 and 19. 8 degrees C for CT, RT and PF, respectively. PF resulted in higher emergence and higher plants with smaller roots. Average yields of seed-cotton in early sowing were 4936, 4591 and 4033 kg/ha for PF, RT and CT, respectively. In late sowing yields in RT and in CT did not differ significantly. Ridge tillage machinery saved 13. 6 kWh/ha (20. 9 %) compared to conventional tillage machinery. The higher yields under plastic film compensated for the higher cost of the practice at the present prices of seed-cotton. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

We compared the effects of a light-diffusing plastic film and a <b>clear</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>film</b> on growth of Batavia lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in two greenhouses during five growth periods. Lettuce grown under the light-diffusing film were smaller (up to 36 %) than control plants grown under the clear film, due to the fewer leaves per plant (up to 22 %) and lower mean values of individual leaf area (up to 29 %). The photosynthetically active radiations use efficiency was sometimes lower (up to 23 %) in lettuces grown under the light-diffusing film. The pigment contents tended to be lower in plants grown under the light-diffusing plastic. The total macroelement contents of the lettuces grown under the light-diffusing plastic were up to 10 % higher than in the lettuces grown under clear plastic, mainly {{as a result of}} higher leaf K contents (up to 19 % higher). In addition, use of the light-diffusing plastic tended to increase leaf nitrate contents (by up to 23 %). The leaf solid soluble content and acidity values were higher in the lettuces grown under the light-diffusing plastic, while leaf pH values were lower than in the control plants.
