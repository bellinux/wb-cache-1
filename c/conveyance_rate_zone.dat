Background The demand for emergency ambulance services both nationally (in the UK) and internationally has been steadily increasing. A large proportion of calls made to the emergency ambulance service are classified as non-urgent. An alternative response to these calls may release the standard ambulance service to attend more urgent calls. A pilot project was initiated {{in order to provide}} an alternative response to non-urgent emergency calls in an Ambulance Trust in England with support from the local Primary Care Trust. This alternative response comprised a district nurse or an emergency nurse practitioner dispatched with a paramedic to visit low-priority emergency calls. The pilot service was trialled during a 15 -week period in 2003 ??? 2004. Methods This paper evaluates the cost effectiveness of the pilot service by examining both the resource use and the outcomes of the service. Findings It was found that introducing this service to the current provision would increase the overall cost to the ambulance services. However, a reduction in <b>conveyance</b> <b>rate</b> to the hospital was observed as people could be treated on-scene. A reduction in <b>conveyance</b> <b>rate</b> to the hospital would lead to reduced admissions to accident and emergency departments and subsequent hospitalization. This paper provides an indication that further development of this type of service {{has the potential to be}} cost effective, if the wider health care economy is considered, as the cost savings made in secondary care could more than balance the costs to the Ambulance Services in providing such a servic...|$|R

30|$|Previous {{works have}} shown that the high strain <b>rate</b> <b>zone</b> is {{characterized}} by a low coda Q in the lower-frequency bands in the NKTZ (Jin and Aki 2005; Hiramatsu et al. 2013; Tsuji et al. 2014) and have suggested that, in {{the central part of the}} NKTZ, the cause of the high strain <b>rate</b> <b>zone</b> could be attributed to the high deformation rate below the brittle–ductile transition zone in the crust where the lower crust is characterized by low velocity of S-wave (Hiramatsu et al. 2010, 2013; Tsuji et al. 2014). However, in this study area, we identify a weak negative correlation, not only in a low-frequency band (2 – 4  Hz) but also in a middle-frequency band (4 – 8  Hz). This suggests that the generation process of the high strain <b>rate</b> <b>zone</b> in the northeastern part of the NKTZ differs from that in the central part of the NKTZ, i.e., along the Atotsugawa fault zone (Hiramatsu et al. 2013) and around the source area of the 1891 Nobi earthquake (Tsuji et al. 2014). To examine the difference, we have to distinguish a sensitive zone of coda Q in the low- and middle-frequency bands in the crust through a spatial correlation between coda Q and the S-wave velocity.|$|R

Tracking average workload over time can then be used to assess individual fitness and fatigue levels. This method has been used in elite male cyclists and recreational male distance runners, but not female endurance athletes.

We discuss the main contributions of the first and second generations of exchange <b>rate</b> target <b>zone</b> models. In an attempt to reconcile the poor empirical performance of the Krugman (1991) model with the reality of exchange <b>rate</b> target <b>zone</b> regimes, this line of research integrates target zones with alternative underlying economic models, such as imperfect credibility, intra-marginal interventions and sticky price models. It was thus possible to understand the correlations observed between the exchange rate, its fundamentals determinants and the interest rate differential, and to explain the fact that the statistical distribution of the exchange rate is hump-shaped rather than U-shaped. This implies that the initial emphasis of target zone models on nonlinearities, “honeymoon effect”, “smooth pasting” and marginal interventions has vanished. Exchange <b>rate</b> target <b>zones</b> are better described as similar to managed floating regimes with intra-marginal interventions, with some marginal interventions when the exchange rate reaches the edges of the floating band.

High-intensity running distance (> 15 km · h- 1) and total distance covered, time spent in low (90 % maximum heart <b>rate)</b> heart <b>rate</b> <b>zones,</b> and <b>rating</b> of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded for each match. Perceptions of general fatigue and leg soreness were recorded approximately 22 h after each match.

40|$|Measuring {{workload}} objectively {{is challenging}} {{due to a}} variety of factors. One concept that assigns a numerical value to a work bout is training impulse (TRIMP). TRIMP uses time spent in physiologically significant heart <b>rate</b> <b>zones</b> to quantify session workload. Tracking average short-term workload (15 -day acute training load, ATL) and long-term workload (45 -day chronic training load, CTL) can be used to assess individual “fatigue” and “fitness” levels. Moreover, the difference between CTL and ATL scores (training stress balance, TSB) may be suggestive of readiness for optimal physical performance. This method has been used in elite male cyclists and recreational male distance runners, but not female endurance athletes. PURPOSE: To assess the acute and chronic aerobic training load placed upon a female collegiate distance runner by quantifying time spent in physiologically significant heart <b>rate</b> <b>zones.</b> METHODS: One individual was observed over a 6 -month period during the fall collegiate cross country competitive season. Three heart <b>rate</b> <b>zones</b> (moderate, heavy, and severe) were determined by assessing heart rate during a sample training run, as well as measuring heart rate in comparison to critical velocity during a validated endurance capacity test. Heart rate was recorded with a data-storage capable, wearable bioelectrical monitor. Following the completion of each run, data files were imported into a software package that calculated TRIMP scores for the individual work bouts, as well as the moving averages used to determine ATL and CTL. RESULTS: CTL increased during the early competitive season as mileage and overall workout intensities increased. ATL generally decreased preceding competitions. Better race performances did not consistently reflect more positive TSB scores. CONCLUSION: Both ATL and CTL generally reflect subjective workload intensity {{over the course of a}} cross country competitive season. Although the TSB scores prior to important races were positive, a successful race outcome did not always occur. However, the participant’s best race performance did follow the most positive TSB score. It is likely that while TSB contributes to performance in competition, additional factors such as motivation and injury play an important role in describing race outcome...|$|R
