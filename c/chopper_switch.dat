40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{electronic}} load controller for self exited induction generator using PID plus fuzzy logic controller. The self-excited induction generators (SEIGs) {{are considered to be}} well suited for generating electricity by means of conventional energy sources and for supplying electrical energy in remote and rural areas. Induction generators have many advantages such as cost, reduced maintenance, rugged, and simple construction, brushless rotor (squirrel cage). A three phase induction generator can be operated on a delta connection for supplying single phase loads. The main disadvantage of SEIG has is that it poor voltage regulation, and its value depends on the prime mover speed, capacitance, load current and power factor of the load. The electronic load controller (ELC) can be used for maintaining constant voltage and frequency of SEIG with variable consumer load driven by constant prime mover. This paper presents the simulation design and implementation of ELC using fuzzy logic method for an SEIG feeding single-phase load. The ELC consist of a rectifier, IGBT as a <b>chopper</b> <b>switch,</b> PI controller, voltage sensor, and resistive dump load in which power consumption was varied through the duty cycle of the chopper. However an ELC consist of electronics system, in general, has complex nonlinear model with parameter variation problem, and the control need to be very fast. The fuzzy logic based controller gives nonlinear control with fast response and virtually no overshoot. The simulation of ELC for self exited induction generator is carried out on MATLAB/SIMULINK. By this proposed ELC using FLC for SEIG we can maintain the constant voltage and frequency of SEIG with variable consumer load. ...|$|E

50|$|The DC-DC {{converters}} {{under study}} {{in this work}} had a similar form as a DC <b>chopper</b> or <b>switching</b> regulator. A bipolar transistor switches current flowing into an L-C network of an inductor and capacitor. To reduce switching losses, the transistor is always turned either fully off or fully on. Control of this transistor is derived from a control circuit that supplies a series of pulses. In the circuits studied here, the pulses are all of equal length. The overall ON time or mark/space ratio of the pulse train (and thus the output power delivered) is controlled by varying the interval between pulses. Closely spaced pulses increase output. This control signal is derived by use of an ASDTIC circuit.|$|R

This research presents on a CMOS sensor, {{which includes a}} chopper stabilized front-end amplifier with DC suppressed feedback and a 12 -bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with background calibration. It could reduce the flicker noise interference in the low frequency and suppressed the DC offset voltage between the two input signals. Therefore, this structure is suitable for bio-medical applications. The bio-medical signals are smaller than 5 mV in the low frequency between 0. 01 Hz and 1 kHz. After amplifying, the signals will be digitized by a 12 -bit SAR ADC. The chopper stabilized amplifier has a clock rate, 16 kHz, controlling the <b>chopper</b> <b>switches</b> and shifting the original signals to 16 kHz in order to reducing the flicker noise. In our case, the flicker noise could lower at least 80 times at this clock rate. The two-Thomas Biquad low-pass filter, as the anti-aliasing filter, could suppress the harmonic signals at least 40 dB before digitalized by ADC. For the 12 -bit SAR ADC, the differential nonlinearity (DNL) is + 0. 576 /- 0. 96 least significant bit (LSB), and the integral nonlinearity (INL) is + 0. 534 /- 0. 655 LSB.

The high-frequency noise due to the switching of the IGBT choppers has caused the damages to the control system. Furthermore, the capacitors for the RF shield of the ceramics chamber inside the BUHS have been burned by the induced voltage due to the fast falling time of the current pattern and the current ripple of the high frequency. The ground wires that connect to each power supply panel and each magnet has been changed to copper sheets and the neutral ground (ME) resistor of the IGBT assemblies have been installed.

The proposed chopper is composed of a DC/SFQ convertor, an SFQ switch, a PTL driver, and a superconducting low-pass filter (LPF).

40|$|A self-calibrating nulling {{radiometer}} for non-contact {{temperature measurement}} of an object, {{such as a}} body of water, employs a black body source as a temperature reference, an optomechanical mechanism, e. g., a <b>chopper,</b> to <b>switch</b> {{back and forth between}} measuring the temperature of the black body source and that of a test source, and an infrared detection technique. The radiometer functions by measuring radiance of both the test and the reference black body sources; adjusting the temperature of the reference black body so that its radiance is equivalent to the test source; and, measuring the temperature of the reference black body at this point using a precision contact-type temperature sensor, to determine the radiative temperature of the test source. The radiation from both sources is detected by an infrared detector that converts the detected radiation to an electrical signal that is fed with a chopper reference signal to an error signal generator, such as a synchronous detector, that creates a precision rectified signal that is approximately proportional to the difference between the temperature of the reference black body and that of the test infrared source. This error signal is then used in a feedback loop to adjust the reference black body temperature until it equals that of the test source, at which point the error signal is nulled to zero. The chopper mechanism operates at one or more Hertz allowing minimization of l/f noise. It also provides pure chopping between the black body and the test source and allows continuous measurements...|$|R
40|$|IEEE This paper {{proposes a}} simple and {{cost-effective}} current measurement technique for four-phase switched reluctance motor (SRM) control, by splitting the dual bus line of the converter, without pulse injection and voltage penalty. Only two hall-effect sensors are utilized, where one is installed in the upper bus to measure two phase currents, and another one {{is placed in the}} lower bus to measure another two phase currents. In order to realize independent current measurement in the whole turn-on region, switching functions are redesigned so that upper switches of two phases act as the <b>choppers,</b> while lower <b>switches</b> of the other two phases are employed as the choppers. Compared to traditional drives, the developed system requires only two hall-effect sensors in the dual bus line, without a need for individual phase sensors or additional devices, which reduces the cost and volume for SRM drives. Furthermore, compared to the single-sensor based current measurement scheme, the proposed method has no need to implement pulse injection and will not cause any voltage penalty and current distortion, which also improve the current measurement accuracy and system performance.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} new topologies of thyristorised power converters for controlled DC as well as 3 -phase AC output using single phase supply with possible application to electric traction. The input side power factor is kept high and the thyristors are load commutated with the help of two AC capacitors. The circuits can work at considerably high frequencies using not too fast thyristors. The turn-on and turn-off losses are kept low due to soft switching. In all, three stages of power conversion are proposed. The first stage is a 1 -phase AC to DC boost converter which converts the AC input into fixed DC voltage with a magnitude higher than the peak of the input voltage. This is followed by a second stage which is a fast response DC to DC <b>chopper</b> with reduced <b>switching</b> losses. The output of this stage can be directly fed to a DC motor (for DC traction). The third stage of power conversion consists of a new inverter circuit and is meant for AC motor drives. The inverter is directly connected to the output terminals of the second stage. The proposed inverter circuit does not need any commutation elements and the thyristors used can be of converter grade. Only one snubber circuit is needed. However the inverter needs 12 thyristors in place of the usual 6 thyristors and 8 diodes. The operation of the above circuits is explained briefly and the experimental oscillograms of currents and voltages at different stages as obtained from laboratory scale set-ups (along with necessary controllers) are given...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of {{electronic}} equipment is currently an important design parameter. Layout {{play a significant}} role in the EMC of power electronic converters. This thesis describes an investigation undertaken into the electromagnetic effects of converter layout. Typical detrimental effects identified during experimental work are presented. Possible causes for these effects are discussed. The experimental work is based on a systematic approach, which starts with a basic single <b>switch</b> <b>chopper</b> and ends in a split supply half-bridge converter. Interconnection modelling and SPICE simulations of layout affects are investigated next. The focus falls on analytical equations for extraction and simplified simulation circuits to make the process generally accessible. Typical resonant frequencies present in some of the experimental circuits are investigated with the help of analytically extracted parameters. The possibility of minimizing detrimental layout effects through impedance matching of interconnections and their terminations, is investigated next, since the previous section quantified layout parameters. Distributed vs. lumped element modelling of interconnections, and the boudary in between, are discussed. Simulation and experimental results are presented. Since maximum fuctionality and power, and minimum cost, per volume drives product development, all elements of a circuit should be investigated for the possibility of realizing secondary or even tertiary functions contributing to normal circuit operation. This is the focus of the last part of this thesis. Employing interconnections as low-pass or surge filters are investigated. Several waveforms are used to test experimental interconnection structures. Lumped and distributed modelling of these strucutres are discussed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents several synchrotron-based biomedical X-ray imaging projects involving bent Laue silicon (Si) crystals. Log-spiral bent Laue analyzers (BLA) {{were made}} from 20 micron thick Si crystals to map manganese (Mn) fluorescence in the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging {{of the human brain}} with Parkinson's disease (PD). The BLA improved Mn specificity in XRF imaging and achieved a Mn detection limit of 0. 5 mM concentration and an energy resolution of 34. 5 eV. A novel method of three dimensional (3 D) confocal XRF imaging of iodine was designed based on the one dimensional (1 D) focusing ability of a log-spiral BLA made from 175 micron thick Si crystals. Combined with a pencil beam or a two dimensional (2 D) focused beam, a 3 D voxel of 100 × 100 × 124 cubic micron could be used to probe the 3 D elemental mapping of a sample. A cylindrical bent Laue monochromator (BLM) was made from 600 micron thick Si crystals to simultaneously prepare three beams for the three-energy K-Edge Subtraction (KES) imaging and KES Computed Tomography (CT). A novel three-beam chopper was made as the first beam <b>chopper</b> for fast <b>switching</b> among the three beams. The three-energy KES imaging was successfully used to track uptake of injected iodine with time in a live mouse. The first simultaneous dual-energy KES imaging and the first KES CT imaging were successfully performed in Canada at the Biomedical Imaging and Therapy (BMIT) beamline. A novel rat head restraint and its corresponding field flatteners were constructed using a rapid-prototyping machine for the KES project based on CT scan data of a rat. This type of animal restraint worked well to immobilize the animal and holds great promise in improving the image quality and repeatability while reducing stress on experimental animals. The field flattener improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the image at a cost of raised maximum exposure to some regions of the subject and reduced anatomical information in the images. In animal imaging applications, this method holds great promise to visualize low concentrations of contrast agents. Another cylindrical BLM was made to perform the novel Near Edge Spectral Imaging (NESI) and NESI CT. It showed high sensitivity for iodine with a measured detection limit of 2 microgram/centimetre square and a slightly better SNR performance than conventional KES imaging. The overwhelming impact of NESI is that it will bring together contrast imaging and elemental speciation imaging through X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) analysis which have been totally different realms...|$|R
