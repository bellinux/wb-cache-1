50|$|The NCR 315-100 was {{the second}} version of the {{original}} 315. It too had a 6 microsecond clock cycle, and from 10,000 to 40,000 slabs of memory. The 315-100 series console I/O incorporated a Teletype printer and keyboard {{in place of the}} original 315's IBM typewriter. The primary difference between the older NCR 315 and the 315-100 was the inclusion of the Automatic Recovery Option (ARO). One of the problems with early generation of computers was that when a memory or program error occurred, the system would literally turn on a red light and halt. The normal recovery process was to copy all register and counter setting from the <b>console</b> <b>light</b> <b>panel,</b> and to restart the program that was running {{at the time of the}} error. Usually the restart was from the very beginning of the program.|$|R

By overlaying the navigation imformation on the front glass, the driver need not gaze at the <b>console</b> <b>panel.</b> Therefore, accidents caused by gazing at <b>console</b> <b>panel</b> could be reduced. To overlay the image accurately on the target object through the front glass, both the vehicle’s position/orientation and the driver’s position/orientation are estimated by vision-based tracking and measuring angular velocities of the vehicle’s wheels.

The public downstairs rooms feature similar woodwork, with elaborate mantelpieces.

The intent {{of this study was to}} determine the dominant environmental factors influencing mental and motor performance, and to investigate the existence of interaction between environmental factors. Since the performance requirements involved in operating a console are representative of numerous man- machine operations, measurements were made of the mental and motor tasks involved in such an operation. A console requiring several cue and response operations was constructed. The cue sequences were programmed to be repeated and the responses were automatically recorded. Cues included dials, gauges, and flashing and colored lights. Responses required manipulation of a foot pedal, push buttons, and a toggle switch. The <b>console</b> <b>panel</b> was designed according to accepted recommendations for optimum performance. Th...|$|R

40|$|The {{basic problem}} of {{communicating}} over a computer network can be illustrated by analogy. Imagine that {{a dozen people}} know they will be imprisoned, one person per cell. Each cell has a single <b>light</b> <b>panel,</b> featuring a <b>light</b> bulb, on/off buttons, and an ID number. <b>light</b> <b>panel</b> with ID # 6 Pressing the "on " button on one <b>light</b> <b>panel</b> turns on the light bulbs in every cell. Likewise, the "off " button turns off everyone's lights. In other words, all <b>light</b> <b>panels</b> are connected to a single light system. 1 Knowing all this, the dozen people conspire to use the light system {{to communicate with each}} other. They know they can represent any information as a string of bits (0 s and 1 s). How can they use their <b>light</b> <b>panels</b> to transmit 0 s and 1 s, and what difficulties will they encounter?
