5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, Italy was {{permitted}} to retain Regina Elena and her three sisters. The Italian Navy <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the ships in service indefinitely, but they could not be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system. Nevertheless, she was stricken from the naval register on 16 February 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Alboin's {{death had}} a lasting impact, as it {{deprived}} the Lombards {{of the only}} leader they had that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents {{the death of the}} last of the line of the hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and Bavarians celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.|$|E

However, {{they were unable}} to do this, losing 1–0, and {{finishing}} the First Round with a record of 1–0–2. The U.S. also lost their next match 5–2, versus Chile, ending their 1950 World Cup run with a First Round record of 1–0–2. They would not qualify for the World Cup again until 1990. Spain advanced to the four-team Final Round, finishing fourth. Uruguay won the 1950 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|In early 1922, the world's major navies, {{including}} Italy, {{signed the}} Washington Naval Treaty. According {{to the terms}} of the treaty, Italy could keep Napoli and her three sisters, along with the newer dreadnought battleships. Due to the small size and age of the ships, particularly in comparison to the modern dreadnoughts, the Italians <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the ships in service indefinitely. They could not, however, be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system, which provided for replacements after a ship was 20 years old. Napoli was retained for a few years, but was stricken from the naval register on 3 August 1926 and sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Alboin {{was assassinated}} on June 28, 572, in a coup d'état instigated by the Byzantines. It was {{organized}} by the king's foster brother, Helmichis, {{with the support of}} Alboin's wife, Rosamund, daughter of the Gepid king whom Alboin had killed some years earlier. The coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the Lombards, who elected Cleph as Alboin's successor, forcing Helmichis and Rosamund to flee to Ravenna under imperial protection. Alboin's death deprived the Lombards of the only leader who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the newborn Germanic entity together, the last in the line of hero-kings who had led the Lombards through their migrations from the vale of the Elbe to Italy. For many centuries following his death Alboin's heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in Saxon and Bavarian epic poetry.|$|E

25|$|In Rove's analysis, 10 of the 28 House seats Republicans lost were sacrificed {{because of}} various scandals. Another six, he said, were lost because incumbents did not {{recognize}} and react quickly enough to the threat. Rove argued that, without corruption and complacency, The Democrats would have gained around a dozen seats and Republicans <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> narrow control of the House regardless of Bush's troubles and the war.|$|E
25|$|If in {{fact there}} was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so {{that one of the}} two wheels was {{stationary}} and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but {{there is no mention of}} one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the wall is the degree of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs. Limites did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond the walls. People within and beyond the limes travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check-points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways in the limes, patrolling legionaries <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> track of entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging customs dues and checking for smuggling. Another theory is of a simpler varietythat Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected the sunlight and was visible for miles around.|$|E

25|$|Mating threats {{along the}} opponent's back rank often enable one to swindle. An example {{is seen in}} Rhine–Nagle, U.S. Masters 1997 (left-most {{position}}). Black, a pawn up with White's king in danger, decides {{that it is time}} to finish White off, forgetting that even a losing position may have defensive resources. Black continued 26...Rg5 27.Rhg1 Ra2?? A powerful-looking move, threatening mate in two, but it actually loses by force. Black <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> a winning position with (for example) 27...Qf4+ 28.g3 Qf2+ 29.Rg2 Qf7, or 28.Kh1? Rg3 29.Qd1 Raa3 (threatening Rxh3+) 30.Qf1 Qh4 (renewing the threat) 31.Kh2 g6! (31...Ra2 32.Qf5! is weaker) and now Black is winning after 32.Ra1 Qxb4; 32.Rb2 Rgd3; or 32.Rc1? Ra2! (threatening mate on h3) 33.Kh1 Raxg2! 28.d6+ Kh8 The only reasonable move. White wins after 28...Qf7 29.dxc7! Ra8 30.Rgd1! Qxb3 31.Rd8+ Kf7 32.Rxb3 or 28...Kf8 29.Rbf1! Rxg2+ 30.Rxg2 Qxf1 31.Qxa2. 29.Qxa2!! Qxa2 30.dxc7! (right-most diagram) Turning the tables: Black, although ahead a queen for a rook, is suddenly helpless against White's passed pawn on the seventh rank. 30...Qc2 30...Qa8 31.Rbd1 Rf5 32.Rd8+ Rf8 33.Rgd1, and 30...Qg8 31.Rgd1 Rf5 32.Rd8 Rf8 33.Rbd1, also win for White. 31.Ra1! The threat of a back-rank mate decides the game. 31.Rbc1? Rxg2+! 32.Rxg2 Qxc1 33.Ra2! Qf4+ 34.Kg2 Qg5+ would allow Black to draw by perpetual check. 31...h6 If 31...Qxc7, 32.Ra8+ and mate next move. The game concluded: 32.Ra8+ Kh7 33.c8=Q Qe4 34.Qg8+ Kg6 35.Rf8 1–0.|$|E

500|$|On 7 May, Quisling ordered police not {{to offer}} armed {{resistance}} to the Allied advance except in self-defence or against overt members of the Norwegian resistance movement. The same day, Germany announced it would surrender unconditionally, making Quisling's position untenable. A realist, Quisling met military leaders of the resistance {{on the following day}} to discuss how he would be arrested. Quisling declared whilst {{he did not want to}} be treated as a common criminal, he did not want preferential treatment compared to his Nasjonal Samling colleagues. He argued he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> his forces fighting until the end, but had chosen not to so as to avoid turning [...] "Norway into a battlefield." [...] Instead he tried to ensure a peaceful transition.

But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
