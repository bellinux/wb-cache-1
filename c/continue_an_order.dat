40|$|Background: Although {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} computerized drug-drug interaction alert systems may reduce the occurrence of drug-drug interactions, the numerous reminders and alerts generated by such systems could represent an excessive burden for clinicians, resulting in a high override rate of not only unimportant, but also important alerts. Methods: We analyzed physicians ’ responses to alerts of relative contraindications and contraindications for coadministration in a computerized drug-drug interaction alert system at Hokkaido University Hospital. In this system, the physician must enter a password to override an alert and <b>continue</b> <b>an</b> <b>order.</b> All of the drug-drug interaction alerts generated between December 2011 and November 2012 at Hokkaido University Hospital were included in this study. Results: The system generated a total of 170 alerts of relative contraindications and contraindication for coadministration; 59 (34. 7 %) of the corresponding orders were cancelled after the alert was accepted, and 111 (65. 3 %) were overridden. The most frequent contraindication alert was for the combination of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and fibrates. No incidents involving drug-drug interactions were reported among patients who were prescribed contraindicated drug pairs after an override. Conclusions: Although computerized drug-drug interaction alert systems that require password overrides appear useful for promoting medication safety, having to enter passwords to override alerts may represent an excessive burden for the prescribing physician. Therefore, both patient safety and physicians ’ workloads {{should be taken into}} consideration in future designs of computerized drug-drug interaction alert systems...|$|E

40|$|With a {{sequence}} of regressions, one may generate joint probability distributions. One starts with a joint, marginal distribution of context variables having possibly a concentration graph structure and <b>continues</b> with <b>an</b> <b>ordered</b> sequence of conditional distributions, named regressions in joint responses. The involved random variables may be discrete, continuous or of both types. Such a generating process specifies for each response a conditioning set that contains just its regressor variables, and it leads {{to at least one}} valid ordering of all nodes in the corresponding regression graph that has three types of edge: one for undirected dependences among context variables, another for undirected dependences among joint responses and one for any directed dependence of a response on a regressor variable. For this regression graph, there are several definitions of pairwise Markov properties, where each interprets the conditional independence associated with a missing edge in the graph in a different way. We explain how these properties arise, prove their equivalence for compositional graphoids and point at the equivalence of each one of them to the global Markov property.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the biodegradation of polycaprolactone (PCL) was investigated in terms of morphological and molecular weight changes that occur during the biodegradation process. The polymer was prepared in three forms for study: films, single crystals, and crosslinked films. Morphology was monitored by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS), and turbidity measurements. Molecular weight changes were measured by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). Degradation was monitored by suspension turbidity, GPC peak area loss, and weight loss. The degrading organisms used were a Fusarium isolate and Cryptococcus Laurentii. ^ It was found that PCL biodegradation is a selective process in which amorphous regions are degraded more rapidly than crystalline material. In contrast to chemical selective degradation, the enzyme system appears to include a cofactor which helps break down crystalline material comparatively rapidly. Although crosslinking was shown to reduce crystallinity, it was also shown to reduce the biodegradation rate. This {{is due to the}} inability of crosslinked sites to fit into the enzyme active site, which may require several repeat units. The single crystal investigations revealed that degradation proceeds by attacking the amorphous surface layer most rapidly until it is depleted. Degradation <b>continues</b> at <b>a</b> pseudo-zero <b>order</b> rate {{at the edge of the}} crystallite where the only available hydrolyzable linkages remain. ...|$|R

From May 1980 the lineup included the GT5, which had bonded and riveted-on fibreglass wheelarch extensions and from November 1984 the GT5S model which had blended arches and a distinctive wide-body look. The GT5 also incorporated better brakes, a more luxurious interior, much larger wheels and tires and the fiberglass body kit also included an air dam and side skirts. Production {{of the wide}} body GT5 (and similarly equipped narrow body GTS models) continued until 1985, when the GT5-S replaced the GT5. Although the factory has not made its records available, an analysis based on Vehicle Identification Numbers by the Pantera Owners Club of America (POCA) late model (9000 series) registrar has shown that fewer than 252 GT5 Panteras were {{likely to have been}} built. The GT5-S featured single piece flared steel fenders instead of the GT5's riveted-on fiberglass flares, and a smaller steel front air dam. The 'S' in the GT5-S name stood for [...] "steel". Otherwise the GT5-S was largely identical to the GT5. The POCA 9000 series registrar's VIN analysis indicates that fewer than 183 GT5-S Panteras were built.
