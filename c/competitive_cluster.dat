That is, the second term of the objective function in CA can be seen as quadratic or second-order entropy. Along this novel explanation, two generalized <b>competitive</b> <b>clustering</b> algorithms inspired by Renyi entropy and Shannon entropy, i. e. RECA and SECA, are respectively proposed in this paper. Simulation results show that CA requires a large number of initial clusters to obtain the right number of clusters, while RECA and SECA require small and moderate number of initial clusters respectively. Also the iteration steps in RECA and SECA are less than that of CA. Further CA and RECA are generalized to CA-p and RECA-p by using the p-order entropy and Renyi’s p-order entropy in CA and RECA respectively. Simulation results show that the value of p has a great impact on the performance of CA-p, whereas it has little influence on that of RECA-p.

Our results show that the cluster size distribution depends on the particular choice for the topology of the network of contacts among the agents.

Firms that agglomerate (co-locate) {{may benefit from}} the differentiation of competitors without making similar differentiating investments themselves.

Further, the lowest-cost providers with the greatest strategic distance from the norm of the <b>competitive</b> <b>cluster</b> reap the greatest benefit from co-location with differentiated firms. We find empirical support for these ideas using a sample of 14, 995 U. S. lodging establishments, and controlling for a number of key demand-shaping factors.

The main focus of this paper is, however, the devising of survival strategies through selective networking, to alter the the fate of an arbitrarily chosen cluster: whether this be to revive a dying cluster to life, or to make a weak survivor into a stronger one. Although such goals are typically achieved by networking with relatively small clusters, our results suggest that {{it ought to be}} possible also to network with peers and larger clusters.

40|$|ISBN: 9780415669863 Repair of {{structures}} in concrete {{is still a}} challenge, especially when access and environment offer a difficult context such as the case of wharves. Concerning the repair of concrete for marine structures, European standards give the requirements in predefined and standardised conditions. However, repair of wharves is performed in harsh conditions such as access, humidity and operator position. These conditions do not enable the direct application of standards. By accounting for these requirements, the repair technique consists in rebuilding the concrete cover {{and in some cases}} using protective coating for some beams. In this paper, we focus on the concrete repair techniques. The aim of MAREO project (French project of the National <b>competitive</b> <b>cluster</b> in Civil Engineering and Eco-Building) is to compare several repair techniques carried out in the most complex area for repair: the tidal zone. The project deals with initial performance, sustainability, cost of durability and concrete properties monitoring by Destructive Testing (DT) and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques. The studied NDT techniques are: impact-echo, surface waves, multi-offset radar, and capacitive method. Both, beams placed in natural exposure and slabs specimens placed in accelerated conditions in laboratory are considered. For all the beams, the contaminated concrete was removed using high-velocity water jets (hydro-demolition). The selected techniques are wet shotcrete, dry shotcrete, formed concrete and manual repair. This paper focuses on the ability of NDT techniques to evaluate the changes of properties related to the chloride ingress in concrete both on site and in accelerated laboratory conditions. The interest of each technique and its sensitivity to several physical factors are highlighted. The need of NDT-combination is illustrated...|$|E

They can rather choose the direct battle with their competitors or decide for a cooperation using the strategic alliances to gain the competitive advantage. As examined form of strategic alliance the author made a choice of the problem of clusters in Czech Republic conditions. Scientific aim: The main scientific aim is to present the results of current state of clusters in Czech Republic and {{to determine if the}} clusterization is recognized as competitive strategy of Czech firms. Methodology/methods: The pripary and secondary research was applied. Concerning the secondary research the well-known competitive strategies and its authors is described. Further the clusters from environement, politics and incetives point of view was examined too.  Regarding the primary research the method used was the direct interviewing of cluster managers and also key finding has been found in questionnaires filled during the project Clusters Cord, CNCB and C Plus.
