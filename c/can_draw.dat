5|$|The game takes {{advantage}} of the Nintendo DS's stylus in several different ways. The player <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> shapes to open certain doors and plot out the path of ships on the ocean, among other tasks. The device's touchscreen {{can also be used to}} direct Link's boomerang. Phantom Hourglass features cel-shaded graphics, similar to that of The Wind Waker, with some influence from Four Swords Adventures. Link and Zelda's appearances in Phantom Hourglass closely resemble those from The Wind Waker.|$|E
5|$|While Smith {{tends to}} write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a {{collaborative}} effort. The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or acoustic guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'. Smith {{has said that he}} purposely makes the lyrics ambiguous so people <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> their own conclusions.|$|E
5|$|The Pokémon {{franchise}} {{revolves around}} 805fictional species of collectible monsters, each having unique designs and skills. Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World. The {{designs for the}} multitude of species <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> inspiration from anything, such as inanimate objects, real-world animals, or mythology. Many Pokémon are capable of evolving into more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. Originally, {{only a handful of}} artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon, however, by 2013 a team of 20artists worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.|$|E

5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors are open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi <b>can</b> <b>draw</b> out and then suck up with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before it disappears. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a beeper sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E

50|$|Cells can {{be shown}} in two {{different}} symmetries. The linear Coxeter diagram form <b>can</b> be <b>drawn</b> with one color for each cell type. The bifurcating diagram form <b>can</b> be <b>drawn</b> with two types (colors) of truncated cuboctahedron cells alternating.|$|R
50|$|For other {{surfaces}} S {{than the}} plane, a graph <b>can</b> be <b>drawn</b> on S without crossings if {{and only if}} it <b>can</b> be <b>drawn</b> {{in such a way that}} all pairs of edges cross an even number of times; this is known as the weak Hanani-Tutte theorem for S. The strong Hanani-Tutte theorem, known for the projective plane as well as for the Euclidean plane, states that a graph <b>can</b> be <b>drawn</b> without crossings on S {{if and only if}} it <b>can</b> be <b>drawn</b> in such a way that all independent pairs of edges cross an even number of times, without regard for the number of crossings between edges that share an endpoint.|$|R

50|$|The genus of a graph is {{the minimal}} integer n {{such that the}} graph <b>can</b> be <b>drawn</b> without {{crossing}} itself on a sphere with n handles (i.e. an oriented surface of genus n). Thus, a planar graph has genus 0, because it <b>can</b> be <b>drawn</b> on a sphere without self-crossing.|$|R
