25|$|CBS enzyme {{activity}} is {{not found in}} all tissues and cells. It is absent from heart, lung, testes, adrenal, and spleen in rats. In humans, {{it has been shown}} to be absent in heart muscle and primary cultures of human aortic endothelial cells. The lack of CBS in these tissues implies that these tissues are unable to synthesize cysteine and that cysteine must be supplied from extracellular sources. It also suggests that these tissues might have increased sensitivity to homocysteine toxicity because they cannot <b>catabolize</b> excess homocysteine via transsulfuration.|$|E
50|$|Non-fermenters (also non-fermenting {{bacteria}}) are a taxonomic heterogene {{group of}} bacteria {{of the division}} Proteobacteria, which cannot <b>catabolize</b> glucose, so {{are not able to}} ferment. This does not exclude automatically, that species can <b>catabolize</b> other sugars or have an anaerobiosis like fermenting bacteria.|$|E

50|$|Archaea that <b>catabolize</b> acetate {{for energy}} are {{referred}} to as acetotrophic or aceticlastic. Methylotrophic archaea utilize methylated compounds such as methylamines, methanol, and methanethiol as well.|$|E
50|$|In general, SDH levels {{decrease}} {{with increasing}} mammalian size. In fact, mammals <b>catabolize</b> serine into pyruvate with the enzymes serine hydroxymethyltransferase and glycine cleavage enzymes rather than SDH.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} oxygenase 1 to <b>catabolize</b> free heme and produce carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) gives its anti-inflammatory properties by up-regulation of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) expression.|$|E

30|$|Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 {{utilizes}} FA, VAN, and VA as carbon sources (Merkens et al. 2005) and <b>catabolizes</b> PCA via two pathways. Thus, FA can be <b>catabolized</b> through VAN and VA to PCA via a non-β-oxidative, {{catabolic pathway}} (Merkens et al. 2005) (Fig.  1 -I) as well through the β-oxidative, phd pathway via VA (Kallscheuer et al. 2016) (Fig.  1 -II). PCA is then converted to succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA through the β-ketoadipate pathway (Brinkrolf et al. 2006).|$|R
50|$|Glycogenolysis is the {{breakdown}} of glycogen (n) to glucose-6-phosphate and glycogen (n-1). Glycogen branches are <b>catabolized</b> by the sequential removal of glucose monomers via phosphorolysis, by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{mutations}} in this gene affect the synthesis, processing, {{and stability of}} this enzyme, which causes Fabry's disease, a rare lysosomal storage disorder and sphingolipidosis that results from a failure to <b>catabolize</b> alpha-D-galactosyl glycolipid moieties.|$|E
50|$|Lactobacillus pontis has {{the ability}} to <b>catabolize</b> arginine. Three enzymes are {{involved}} in the process; including arginine deaminase (ADI), ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC), and carbamate kinase (CK). A fourth protein located at the cell membrane acts as transporter, allowing the antiporter exchange between arginine and ornithine.|$|E
50|$|The enzyme encoded by the MCAT gene, {{along with}} other enzymes that {{regulate}} Malonyl-CoA concentration, {{have been shown to}} regulate levels such that malonyl-CoA concentration decreases in human muscle tissue when under exercise training. This enzyme specifically has increased activity under these conditions, as it is known to <b>catabolize</b> malonyl-CoA.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} {{and distribution of}} substance P-catabolizing enzyme(s) were studied in the rat kidney. Kidney homogenates inactive substance P 5 - 20 {{times as fast as}} do homogenates of intestine, liver, lung, heart or brain. The <b>catabolizing</b> activity was highest in the cortex and decreased progressively down the papilla. Cortex of rat kidney was homogenized and fractions enriched in microsomal membrane, final supernatant, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, brush border and intact glomeruli were prepared. The identity and homogeneity of the preparations were determined by assaying marker enzymes and by morphological examination. Substance P was <b>catabolized</b> most rapidly by the microsomal and plasma-membrane-enriched fractions, and least rapidly by endoplasmic reticulum or final supernatant fractions. Purified brush border of proximal tubules inactivated substance P more than 10 times as fast as isolated glomeruli. Our experiments show that substance P is <b>catabolized</b> at a rate that is similar to the rates of inactivation of bradykinin and angiotensin II. Further, the distribution of substance P-catabolizing activity in various kidney fractions is similar to the distribution of kininase and angiotensinase activities previously reported...|$|R
50|$|PAF also induces {{apoptosis}} in {{a different}} way that is independent of the PAF receptor. The pathway to apoptosis can be inhibited by negative feedback from PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), an enzyme that <b>catabolizes</b> platelet-activating factor.|$|R
50|$|The {{concentration}} of PAF {{is controlled by}} the synthesis of the compound and by the actions of PAF acetylhydrolases (PAF-AH). PAF-AH are a family of enzymes that have the ability to <b>catabolize</b> and degrade PAF and turn it into an inactive compound. The enzymes within this family are lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, cytoplasmic platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 2, and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b.|$|E
5000|$|Fresh {{domestic}} sewage entering a wastewater collection system contains proteins including organic sulfur compounds oxidizable to sulfates and may contain inorganic sulfates. [...] Dissolved oxygen is depleted as bacteria begin to <b>catabolize</b> organic material in sewage. In {{the absence of}} dissolved oxygen and nitrates, sulfates are reduced to hydrogen sulfide as an alternative source of oxygen for catabolizing organic waste by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), identified primarily from the obligate anaerobic species Desulfovibrio.|$|E
50|$|Cathepsin K is a protease, {{which is}} defined by its high {{specificity}} for kinins, that is involved in bone resorption. The enzyme's ability to <b>catabolize</b> elastin, collagen, and gelatin allow it to break down bone and cartilage. This catabolic activity is also partially responsible {{for the loss of}} lung elasticity and recoil in emphysema. Cathepsin K inhibitors show great potential in the treatment of osteoporosis. Cathepsin K is degraded by Cathepsin S, called Controlled Cathepsin Cannibalism.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{sometimes}} phosphorolysis {{is preferable}} to hydrolysis (like in the breakdown of glycogen or starch, as in the example above) because glucose 1-phosphate yields more ATP than does free glucose when subsequently <b>catabolized</b> to pyruvate.|$|R
30|$|Some {{strains of}} Pseudomonas species convert FA to PCA (Venturi et al. 1998; Priefert et al. 1997). For example, P. putida WCS 358 <b>catabolizes</b> FA to VAN, VA, and PCA (Venturi et al. 1998). E. coli {{harboring}} the vanillin dehydrogenase (Vdh) gene from Pseudomonas HR 199 converts 14  mM of VAN to 13  mM of VA and 0.5  mM of PCA (Priefert et al. 1997). Wild-type C. glutamicum <b>catabolizes</b> FA, VAN, and VA as carbon sources (Merkens et al. 2005; Brinkrolf et al. 2006). However, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, biotransformation of FA to produce PCA by these microorganisms has not been reported.|$|R
50|$|The brain {{prefers to}} use choline to {{synthesize}} acetylcholine. This limits {{the amount of}} choline available to synthesize phosphatidylcholine. When the availability of choline is low or the need for acetylcholine increases, phospholipids containing choline can be <b>catabolized</b> from neuronal membranes. These phospholipids include sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine. Supplementation with citicoline can {{increase the amount of}} choline available for acetylcholine synthesis and aid in rebuilding membrane phospholipid stores after depletion. Citicoline decreases phospholipase stimulation. This can lower levels of hydroxyl radicals produced after an ischemia and prevent cardiolipin from being <b>catabolized</b> by phospholipase A2. It can also work to restore cardiolipin levels in the inner mitochondrial membrane.|$|R
50|$|Two main hexose {{fermentation}} pathways {{are used}} to classify LAB genera. Under conditions of excess glucose and limited oxygen, homolactic LAB <b>catabolize</b> one mole of glucose in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway to yield two moles of pyruvate. Intracellular redox balance is maintained through the oxidation of NADH, concomitant with pyruvate reduction to lactic acid. This process yields two moles of ATP per mole of glucose consumed. Representative homolactic LAB genera include Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pediococcus, and group I lactobacilli.|$|E
50|$|Strains of Rhodococcus are {{important}} owing {{to their ability}} to <b>catabolize</b> a wide range of compounds and produce bioactive steroids, acrylamide, and acrylic acid, and their involvement in fossil fuel biodesulfurization. This genetic and catabolic diversity is not only due to the large bacterial chromosome, but also to the presence of three large linear plasmids. Rhodococcus is also an experimentally advantageous system owing to a relatively fast growth rate and simple developmental cycle, but is not well characterized.|$|E
5000|$|Amino acids are {{the main}} source of {{chemical}} energy for H. salinarum, particularly arginine and aspartate, though they are able to metabolize other amino acids, as well. H. salinarum have been reported to not be able to grow on sugars, and therefore need to encode enzymes capable of performing gluconeogenesis to create sugars. Although [...] "H. salinarum" [...] is unable to <b>catabolize</b> glucose, the transcription factor TrmB has been proven to regulate the gluconeogenic production of sugars found on the S-layer glycoprotein.|$|E
50|$|Septic {{tank and}} drain field {{microorganisms}} have very limited capability for <b>catabolizing</b> petroleum products and chlorinated solvents, and cannot remove dissolved metals; although some may sorb onto {{septic tank sludge}} or drain field soils, and concentrations may be diluted by other groundwater {{in the vicinity of}} the drain field. Cleaning formulations may reduce drain field efficiency. Laundry bleach may slow or stop microbial activity in the drain field, and sanitizing or deodorizing chemicals may have similar effects. Detergents, solvents and drain cleaners may transport emulsified, saponified or dissolved fats into the drain field before they can be <b>catabolized</b> to short-chain organic acids in the septic tank scum layer.|$|R
25|$|Citicoline {{decreases}} phospholipase stimulation. This {{can lower}} levels of hydroxyl radicals produced after an ischemia and prevent cardiolipin from being <b>catabolized</b> by phospholipase A2. It can also work to restore cardiolipin levels in the inner mitochondrial membrane.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{origin of}} {{hydrogen}} peroxide is {{the degradation of}} adenosine monophosphate which yields hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is then oxidatively <b>catabolized</b> first to xanthine and then to uric acid, and the reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme xanthine oxidase: ...|$|R

50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is secondary-alcohol:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include aldehyde reductase 1, prostaglandin 9-ketoreductase, xenobiotic ketone reductase, NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase, ALR3, carbonyl reductase, nonspecific NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase, aldehyde reductase 1, and carbonyl reductase (NADPH). This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism, and has recently been shown to <b>catabolize</b> S-Nitrosoglutathione, as a means to degrade NO in an NADPH-dependent manner.|$|E
50|$|A nucleotidase is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{hydrolysis}} of a nucleotide, forming a nucleoside and a phosphate ion. Nucleotidases {{are essential for}} cellular homeostasis, because they are partially responsible for maintaining a balanced ratio of nucleotides to nucleosides. Some nucleotidases function outside the cell, creating nucleosides that can be transported into the cell and used to regenerate nucleotides via salvage pathways. Inside the cell, nucleotidases may help to maintain energy levels under stress conditions. A cell deprived of oxygen and nutrients may <b>catabolize</b> more nucleotides to boost levels of nucleoside triphosphates such as ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell.|$|E
3000|$|... d-GalUA is <b>catabolized</b> by {{different}} life forms using different catabolic pathways. There {{are at least}} two prokaryotic and one eukaryotic pathway in microorganisms for the catabolism of d-galUA. The d-galUA and the d-glcUA pathways are similar in some life forms.|$|R

40|$|The fate {{of small}} doses of isotopically labeled isologous {{hemoglobin}} was {{studied in the}} rat. When haptoglobin depleted animals were given 2. 0 mg of 59 Fe hemoglobin intravenously, nearly half was trapped by the kidneys. Kidney 59 Fe activity disappeared slowly over several weeks. Whatever iron was lost from the kidneys was largely reutilized. In contrast, the porphyrin of hemoglobin absorbed by the kidneys appeared to be rapidly <b>catabolized,</b> since 5 hr after the injection of 14 C or 59 Fe heme-labeled hemoglobin {{only a small fraction}} was recovered as hematin. Likewise, after injection of globin-labeled hemoglobin, rapid disappearance of kidney protein activity indicated that the absorbed globin was readily <b>catabolized</b> in situ...|$|R
