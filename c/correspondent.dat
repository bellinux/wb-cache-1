40|$|Copyright © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved. Objective The study {{examined}} the content and frequency of messages to an Internet support group, using a conceptual framework based on support-giving and emotional work. The main questions addressed concerned what <b>correspondents</b> seem to be gaining from their involvement and whether the high-frequency <b>correspondents</b> differ motivationally from the lower-frequency <b>correspondents.</b> Methods Messages to an Internet support group for women with breast cancer were collected over 12 months. The number of contributions written by individual <b>correspondents</b> could be determined. Messages were reliably coded for their main themes in terms of seeking or providing support. Results The majority of <b>correspondents</b> (94 %) wrote fewer than 10 messages. Two high-frequency <b>correspondents</b> emerged whose messages significantly less often referred to seeking and more often to providing support than did the messages of the less-frequent <b>correspondents.</b> These volunteer emotion workers both reported gaining personal satisfaction from their role. Conclusion The high-frequency <b>correspondents</b> act as informal volunteer emotion workers for the other users, and valuably supplement {{the role of the}} group's initiators. Further research is needed on how to amplify the psychological rewards for volunteer emotion workers in online support groups for adults with cancer. Practice implications Volunteer assistants in electronic groups may be crucial to the sustainability of online support initiatives. Helen R. Winefield[URL]...|$|R
