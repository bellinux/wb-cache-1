5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. <b>Cucumbers</b> and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E

30|$|The {{productivity}} {{increased as}} re-cropping years increasing, but the yield decreased obviously after 5 yrs re-cropping, this indicted that {{degradation of soil}} quality was occurred. The increase of fungus and bacteria number became main factors of soil degradation as re-cropping years increasing. The cropping models of <b>cucumber</b> and greengrocery, <b>cucumber</b> and cowpea showed significant higher <b>cucumber</b> yield, the second higher yield appeared in the cropping models between <b>cucumber</b> and maize for green manure, <b>cucumber</b> and tomato, <b>cucumber</b> and kidney bean.

5|$|The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, {{being found}} only in the {{oesophagus}} of sea <b>cucumbers.</b> It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves. When the sea cucumber sucks in sediment, the bivalve allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.|$|E

Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love and attention to the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E
5|$|Greenhouses convert solar {{light to}} heat, {{enabling}} year-round {{production and the}} growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate.

5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and <b>cucumbers</b> dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E

However, it prefers benthic bivalve mollusks, especially clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements. The walrus sucks the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a vacuum. The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.|$|E
