50|$|In 1994, the Touring edition was {{discontinued}} {{but many}} of the features of that model became standard or available on Regency Elite including the supercharged engine. Additionally, the Ninety-Eight added standard front passenger-side airbag plus new instrument panel, steering wheel, and door panel designs. The exterior received a new cross-hatch grille as well as redesigned head- and <b>side-marker</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Fiesta was {{initially}} available in Europe with the Valencia [...] I4 (high compression and low compression options), and [...] engines and in Base, Popular, L, GL (1978 onward), Ghia and S trim, {{as well as}} a van. The US Mark I Fiesta was built in Cologne, West Germany, but to slightly different specifications; US models were Base, Decor, Sport, and Ghia, the Ghia having the highest level of trim. These trim levels changed very little in the Fiesta's three-year run in the US, from 1978 to 1980. All US models featured the more powerful [...] engine, (which was the older [...] "Crossflow" [...] version of the Kent, rather than the Valencia) fitted with a catalytic converter and air pump to satisfy strict Californian emission regulations), energy-absorbing bumpers, <b>side-marker</b> <b>lamps,</b> round sealed-beam headlamps, improved crash dynamics and fuel system integrity as well as optional air conditioning (a/c was not available in Europe). In the US market, the Ford Escort replaced both the Fiesta and the compact Pinto in 1981, competing with the Chevrolet Chevette.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most visible}} change in {{differentiating}} a 1968 from a 1967 was the addition <b>of</b> <b>side-marker</b> reflectors on all fenders. Also, the small rear window cab {{was no longer}} available (the C40 and C60 medium duty trucks retained the small window). The GMC grille was revised, with the letters [...] "GMC" [...] no longer embossed in the horizontal crossbar. Another addition was the Custom Comfort and Convenience interior package that fell between the Standard cab and CST cab options. In 1968, Chevrolet celebrated 50 years of truck manufacturing, and to commemorate, they released a 50th Anniversary package, which featured an exclusive white-gold-white paint scheme. Also in 1968, the 307 and 396 CID V8's were added {{as well as the}} Longhorn model on 3/4 ton trucks. Featuring a 133-inch wheelbase, the Longhorn added an extra 6 inches to the bed. Longhorns, interestingly, were only 2wd; no factory Longhorn 4x4 was built.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFundamental {{results of}} Tannaka duality include the {{reconstruction}} of a coalgebra in the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces from its <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations equipped with the forgetful functor, and the characterization <b>of</b> those <b>categories</b> equipped with a functor into the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces which are equivalent to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations of some coalgebra. This paper generalizes these results by replacing the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces by an arbitrary monoidal category and replacing coalgebras by their several-object analogue. Applications include providing sufficient conditions on a small R-linear category to ensure that its <b>category</b> <b>of</b> presheaves {{is equivalent to the}} <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations of some R-coalgebra.
