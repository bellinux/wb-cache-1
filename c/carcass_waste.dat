40|$|Corsica is a French Mediterranean {{island with}} {{traditional}} extensive pig farming oriented towards {{the production of}} high quality cured meat products. The increasing success of these cured products in continental Europe has triggered the development and organisation of an extensive pig farming industry. However, these pig farming practices have seldom been described and analysed to understand the potential risk of introduction and spread of infectious diseases. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Corsica in 2013 to characterise the main pig management practices and to identify groups of farms with similar practices and therefore homogeneous risk of introduction and spread of infectious diseases. We interviewed 68 pig farmers and investigated different farm management practices {{which could lead to}} contact between herds, such as trading animals, sharing pastures, feed and reproduction management (direct contacts), slaughtering and <b>carcass</b> <b>waste</b> management, and contacts with people and vehicles (indirect contacts). The practices were described and the farms grouped by multiple factor and hierarchical clustering analyses. Results revealed interesting patterns in the introduction and spread of infectious disease, such as the seasonality of pig production, the potential local spread of diseases in pastures due to the presence of free-ranging boars, carcasses, and animal waste. Multivariate analyses identified four groups of farms with different levels of risk of the spread of infectious disease, illustrating changes in farmers' customs from free-range uncontrolled farming systems to more controlled systems aimed at the production of high quality pork products. These results will be useful to more realistically simulate the spread of infectious diseases among Corsican pig farms and highlight the need for awareness raising campaigns among the stakeholders to reduce risky practices.

40|$|Salmonella {{is a major}} food-borne {{pathogen}} worldwide, including Thailand, {{and poultry}} meat plays a role {{as a vehicle for}} the spread of the disease from animals to humans. The prevalence and characteristics of Salmonella isolated from 41 small scale poultry slaughterhouses in Chiang Mai, Thailand were determined during July 2011 through May 2012. Salmonella’s prevalence in live poultry, <b>carcasses,</b> <b>waste</b> water, and soil around processing plants were 3. 2 %, 7. 3 %, 22. 0 % and 29. 0 %, respectively. Eighteen different serotypes were identified, the most common being Corvallis (15. 2 %), followed by Rissen (13. 9 %), Hadar (12. 7 %), Enteritidis (10. 1 %), [I. 4, 5, 12 : i : -] (8. 8 %), Stanley (8. 8 %), and Weltevreden (8. 8 %). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that 68. 4 % of the Salmonella spp were resistant to at least one antimicrobial while 50. 6 % showed multiple drug resistance (MDR).

40|$|Background: Animals {{treated with}} tumor {{necrosis}} factor a (TNF-a) developed severe metabolic abnormalities despite receiving suffi-cient protein and energy by total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Objective: We {{sought to investigate}} the nutritional and meta-bolic effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. Design: Rats were randomly allocated to 5 groups: oral nutrition (ON control; n = 7), TPN control (n = 7), ON+LPS (n = 6), TPN+LPS (n = 9), and pair fed (PF) in relation to ON+LPS (n = 6). Results: Body weight decreased significantly as diet consumption decreased in the ON+LPS and PF groups compared with the ON control group. Relative carcass weights were significantly lower in the TPN+LPS and ON+LPS groups than in their respective control groups. Diaphragm and extensor digitorum longus weights were significantly lower in the ON+LPS and PF rats, {{but not in the}} TPN+LPS rats, compared with their respective controls. Bio-chemical abnormalities and plasma corticosterone concentrations were greater in the TPN+LPS group than in the other groups. Conclusions: These data suggest that provision of sufficient protein and energy by TPN does not prevent general <b>carcass</b> <b>wasting</b> induced by LPS but may protect individual muscles. However, com-pared with an oral ad libitum diet, TPN providing sufficient protein and energy worsens the biochemical abnormalities induced by LPS. More rapid clearance of TNF-a and low corticosterone concentra-tions in weight-losing animals may help reduce the severity of the metabolic effects of LPS. Am J Clin Nutr 2000; 71 : 835 – 43.

40|$|Introduction: From August 2009 to October 2010, International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh and the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research {{together}} investigated 14 {{outbreaks of}} anthrax which included 140 animal and 273 human cases in 14 anthrax-affected villages. Our investigation objectives were {{to explore the}} context in which these outbreaks occurred, including livestock rearing practices, human handling of sick and dead animals, and the anthrax vaccination program. Methods: Field anthropologists used qualitative data-collection tools, including 15 hours of unstructured observations, 11 key informant interviews, 32 open-ended interviews, and 6 group discussions in 5 anthrax-affected villages. Results: Each cattle owner in the affected communities raised a median of six ruminants on their household premises. The ruminants were often grazed in pastures and fed supplementary rice straw, green grass, water hyacinth, rice husk, wheat bran, and oil cake; lactating cows were given dicalcium phosphate. Cattle represented a major financial investment. Since Islamic law forbids eating animals that die from natural causes, when anthrax-infected cattle were moribund, farmers often slaughtered them on the household premises while they were still alive so that the meat could be eaten. Farmers ate the meat and sold it to neighbors. Skinners removed and sold the hides from discarded carcasses. Farmers discarded the <b>carcasses</b> and slaughtering <b>waste</b> into ditches, bodies of water, or open fields. Cattle in the affected communities did not receive routine anthrax vaccine due to low production, poor distribution, and limited staffing for vaccination. Conclusion: Slaughtering anthrax-infected animals and disposing of butchering <b>waste</b> and <b>carcasses</b> in environments where ruminants live and graze, combined with limited vaccination, provided a context that permitted repeated anthrax outbreaks in animals and humans. Because of strong financial incentives, slaughtering moribund animals and discarding <b>carcasses</b> and <b>waste</b> products will likely continue. Long-term vaccination coverage for at-risk animal populations may reduce anthrax infection...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella is {{pathogen}} of many mammalian {{species and}} {{it is one of the}} most important bacteria that cause food borne illness worldwide. Salmonella spp. can be commonly found in raw poultry and meat. Eggs, agricultural products, processed foods, raw milk and raw milk products and contaminated water also have been implicated in human salmonellosis. In Thailand, Salmonella was found to be the second largest cause of food poisoning, following rotavirus. Furthermore, antimicrobial-resistant strains of Salmonella spp. has been reported in many parts of the world. The importance of the resistance is that the bacteria acquire their resistance in the animal host before being transmitted to human through food chain. This may result treatment failures in human when applying antimicrobial agents to treat human salmonellosis. This study aimed to elucidate the status of small scale poultry slaughterhouses and their affect to ecological and health in the community in order to sustainably enhance hygiene and functioning of small scale poultry slaughterhouses in Northern Thailand. Initial steps included the identification of key stakeholders associated with the meat production chain, development of a research framework, and design of a methodology based on stakeholder consultations. The framework and methodology combine issues in five major areas: (1) public health, (2) socioeconomics, (3) policy, (4) veterinary medicine, and (5) communities and the environment. Consequently, a total of 41 small-scale poultry slaughterhouses were visited during the period from July 2011 to May 2012. Data on the current status of the slaughterhouses regarding productivity, economic status, hygienic management, and opportunities and challenges faced in improving the plants and following the DLD slaughterhouse regulations, were collected using a structured questionnaire and interviews. In addition, a checklist, which was developed based on the DLD regulations, was used for triangulation. In addition, a microbiological risk assessment approach was employed to detect Salmonella contamination in meat processing facilities. The microbial risk assessment was combined with stakeholder perceptions to provide an overview of the existing situation, as well as to identify opportunities for upgrading slaughterhouses in order to more effectively address matters of food safety, processing, and government licensing. The results of this study demonstrated that the developed conceptual framework could elucidate the complex factors limiting small-scale slaughterhouse improvement including a lack of appropriate enabling policies and an apparent absence of feasible interventions for improvement. Unhygienic slaughterhouse management was reflected in the incidence of Salmonella contamination. The prevalence of Salmonella spp. in live poultry, <b>carcasses,</b> <b>waste</b> water, and soil around processing plants were 3. 17 %, 7. 32 %, 21. 27 % and 29. 27 %, respectively. Moreover, the bacteria could be isolated from each point of slaughter lines. Eighteen different serotypes were identified, the most common being Corvallis (15. 19 %), followed by Rissen (13. 92 %), Hadar (12. 66 %), Enteritidis (10. 13 %), [I. 4, 5, 12 : i : -], Stanley, and Weltevreden (8. 86 %). Tests revealed that 68. 35 % of the Salmonella spp. were resistant to at least one antimicrobial while 50. 63 % showed multiple drug resistance (MDR). Specifically, 44. 30 % of Salmonella was resistant to nalidixic acid, followed by streptomycin (41. 77 %), ampicillin (34. 18 %), tetracycline (34. 18 %), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (20. 25 %). Policy advocacy was implemented through meeting with policy-level DLD officer responsible for slaughterhouse control in Thailand. The instruction including blueprint and feasible criteria of good practice of small scale poultry slaughterhouse was developed and then tested of microbiological quality of the meat. The results showed that Coliform bacteria and total bacteria count in meat after implementation was lower than that before implementation. It could be concluded that there is potential for the use of an Ecohealth approach to address critical problems and it’s solving at the interface of rural development and public health.

Tissues from sheep naturally infected with scrapie were placed within fiberglass mesh bags and buried in compost piles for 108 d in experiment 1 or 148 d in experiment 2. The temperature in the compost piles rose quickly; it was above 60 °C for about 2 wk and then slowly declined to the ambient temperature. Before composting, PrPSc was detected in all the tissues by Western blotting. In experiment 1, PrPSc was not detected after composting in the tissue remnants or the surrounding sawdust. In experiment 2, 1 of 5 specimens tested negative after composting, whereas PrPSc was detected in the other 4 bags, though in reduced amounts compared with those before composting. Tissue weights were reduced during composting.

The nutritional composition of tilapia whole bodies, fillet, and carcass residues were quantitatively determined. Carbon and nitrogen free-extract percentages were similar among whole body (53. 76 % and 6. 96 %, respectively), fillets (47. 06 % and 6. 75 %, respectively), and carcass (56. 36 % and 7. 04 %, respectively) whereas percentages of N, S, and protein were highest in fillet (13. 34, 1. 34, and 83. 37 %, respectively) than whole body (9. 27, 0. 62, and 57. 97 %, respectively) and carcass (7. 70, 0. 39, and 48. 15 %, respectively).

40|$|The {{recycling}} of e-waste in general allows {{the recovery of}} valuable materials, which can be reused as secondary raw materials. However this implies, to adopt reliable treatment processes to achieve specific standard characteristics. Actually, the market standards are very strict and strongly affect the economic value of recovered materials. In particular, waste refrigerators recycling allows the recovery of different plastic materials and metallic fractions (ferrous and non ferrous), whose economic value has considerably increased in the last years. Only in Italy, in 2010, approximately 66, 000 tons of waste refrigerators were collected for recycling. An efficient recycling treatment could assure about 85 % of recovery rate. In this paper, a model to control and characterize the materials recovered from mechanical {{recycling of}} <b>carcasses</b> dismantled from <b>waste</b> refrigerators is proposed. The treatment flow sheet consists of various separation and comminution operations. A mathematical model was implemented to determine a partition function, utilizing data obtained from the treatment of 100 <b>waste</b> refrigerator <b>carcasses,</b> carrying out mass balance of recovered materials. The partition function {{was used to determine}} control parameters and assess the quality of the recovered products, and, therefore, of the applied technologies. The results have shown that for <b>waste</b> refrigerator <b>carcasses</b> it has been possible to reach for ferrous metals a recovery rate of 97. 5 % with purity of more than 98 %.

While there have been {{established}} several legal rules and evaluation systems regarding the hygienic static of poultry and pig husbandry, they are still missing for dairy farms. The aims {{of the study were}} the development and test of an objective evaluation system for dairy farms under field conditions, which allows with the help of index numbers the comparison between different dairy farms, identifies risk factors and gives recommendations for improvements. The hygienic status of 10 dairy farms (ranging from 380 to 1400 dairy cows) was analyzed and evaluated by ‘hygiene index numbers’. These index numbers were raised during on-farm audits and they are divided into 11 examination sections. Additionally several microbiological samples regarding the milking hygiene, the feed hygiene and youngstock area hygiene were collected and analyzed. The hygiene analysis is subdivided into 11 focus areas: 1. Biosecurity 2. Cleaning and disinfection 3. Feed an drinking water hygiene 4. <b>Carcass</b> disposal, <b>waste</b> disposal, disinfestation 5. Building and procedural hygiene 6. Stall climate 7. Transport hygiene 8. Quarantine and isolation of sick animals 9. Birth hygiene 10. Milking hygiene 11. Administration, planning and organization Each of these focus areas is divided into subsections. The basis of the hygiene analysis are single criteria which are evaluated systematically by the auditor. All evaluated single criteria of each subsection are computed to a ‘section hygiene index number’. The hygiene status for the whole examined dairy farm is expressed in the ‘hygiene index number’, which is calculated from the 11 ‘section hygiene index numbers’. After the development of the hygiene analysis 10 dairy farms were examined, in order to determine their present hygienic status. During later meetings with the production managers the individual results were presented to them and the possibilities for improvement were discussed. In a second examination the farms were analyzed once more in order to determine whether they could realize the appointed improvements. Although the recommended measures challenged them, the farms achieved a better ‘hygiene index number’ during the second examination. The microbiological samples could prove additional risk factors. With the hygiene analysis the 10 different dairy farms could be objectively evaluated and differentiated. Individual risk factors and possibilities for improvement could be pointed out for each farm. Due to its structure the extent of the hygiene analysis can be adapted. It can now be used to evaluate the hygienic status of a larger number of dairy farms...|$|R

Methods: A brain sample was obtained from each of the 180 animals and tested for rabies virus by a direct fluorescent antibody test. Results: Out of the total number of animals involved in attacks on humans, 63. 3 % were positive for rabies. Of these, dogs were the main animal involved in attacks with a percentage of 92 %, of which 62. 7 % were positive for rabies. Of animals involved in attacks, 70. 6 % were males of which 60. 6 % were positive, and 29. 4 % were females of which 69. 8 % were positive. Males comprised 68. 9 % of the total human individuals attacked, of whom 62. 9 % were attacked by rabies-positive animals. The significant risk factors that contributed to the spread of rabies in general included the presence of poultry <b>carcasses</b> and other <b>waste</b> in the vicinity of the attacks (PPR = 9. 5) with a percentage of 84. 8 %, followed by the time of year, in particular school vacations (PPR = 3. 8) with a percentage of 78 %. Conclusion: Rabies is endemic in Yemen with a very high rabies-positive rate for animals involved in attacks, particularly for stray male dogs. Male children were most often involved in attacks by rabies-positive animals. The presence of food <b>waste</b> (particularly poultry <b>carcasses)</b> and school vacation periods were found to correlate significantly with increased risk for human exposure to rabies...|$|R

In this context, the present research aims at analyze the dynamics of the value in the local non-existent supply chain of the large wild game meat by the application on the case study of the Valle Ossola (Piedmont, Italy). Due to its representativeness among Italian wild ungulates, the research focus on red deer meat. The data has been collected in 2016 through in-depth interviews and focus groups with the stakeholders involved in the supply chain: hunters, transformers and restaurateurs. Results show that for the hunter the red deer reach a hypothetical price of 6, 00 €/kg. From a meat processing targeted at the maximum enhancement of the <b>carcass,</b> without any <b>waste,</b> the transformers can reach a hypothetical price of 9, 80 €/kg. Whereas for the restaurateur, the red deer meat can reach a final price range between 22, 88 and 51, 47 €/kg (hypothesizing maximum sales of high value-added course). Through the maximization of the meat’s quality, hunter and transformers profits can increase significantly, with a redistribution of the added value throughout the supply chain. A limitation {{of this study is that}} the calculated values does not take into consideration the stakeholders’ production costs (that increasing along the supply chain).

40|$|Co-combustion {{of animal}} <b>carcasses</b> and {{slaughterhouse}} <b>waste</b> products (animal waste), which are classed as high-risk infectious waste, {{has been considered}} as a “fuel opportunity” for waste-to-energy boilers. In this study, the impact of co-combustion of animal waste with municipal solid waste (MSW) on operational issues such as bed agglomeration, deposit formation and emission was investigated, employing experimental and theoretical methods. In the experimental section, a series of full-scale tests in a bubbling fluidised-bed boiler were carried out, {{to determine the effects}} of animal waste co-combustion on the issues addressed. Two combustion scenarios were considered, identified as the reference (Ref) case and the animal waste (AW) case. In the Ref case, a solid-waste fuel mix, consisting of sorted and pretreated industry and household waste was combusted. In the AW case, 20 wt% AW was added to the reference fuel mix. The collected samples, which included super-heater deposits, fuel mixes and bed and fly ashes, were analysed, using chemical fractionation, SEM-EDX and XRD. In addition, the flue gases´ emission rate were continuously analysed, using FTIR spectrometry. The results showed positive effects from co-combustion of AW, indicating decreased deposit formation and lower risk of bed agglomeration, as well as reduced emissions of NOx and SO 2. Moreover, it was found that the concentrations of P, Ca, S and Cl were enriched in the bed materials. In the theoretical section, thermodynamic calculations, with respect to experimental data, were performed to provide greater understanding of the ash transformation behaviour and the related melting temperature. The calculations mainly focused on bed agglomeration, where addition of AW to the MSW considerably reduced the risk of agglomeration. The results of equilibrium products and phase diagram information for the bed ashes suggested melt-induced agglomeration as a possible cause of the formation of sticky layers on the bed particle in the Ref case. Moreover, it was concluded that higher amounts of calcium phosphate and sulfates increased the first melting temperature of the bed ashes in the AW case.

The research aims to identify the contexts relevant to the implementation of biopharming in New Zealand and to investigate whether and how the associated risks can be managed. It does this by eliciting relevant knowledge from people with experience and expertise in the identified contexts. Animal biopharming is defined here as the farming of transgenic animals genetically modified to produce pharmaceutical compounds for use in humans. Plant biopharming is also under development. Biopharming is one of several methods {{that can be used to}} produce the class of drugs known as biopharmaceuticals. Animal biopharming research and development have focused primarily on dairy species. The major drivers internationally for the development of animal biopharming are its potential to lower the costs of drug production, the greater ease of upscaling and downscaling production, an anticipated shortage of manufacturing capacity using other production methods, the potential to address some of the limitations of other production methods, and the desire to strengthen or evade patent restrictions. In New Zealand, major drivers include New Zealand’s animal-health status, the strength of its dairy research and farm management, and a desire to use biopharming as a tool to move the economy away from commodity production and to enhance economic competitiveness. Biopharming research and development in New Zealand is currently focused on dairy cows. Significant uncertainties remain regarding the potential benefits and hazards of biopharming. These include: cost-effectiveness in relation to competing platforms, unresolved technical problems, patent and regulatory issues, potential risks to human health, issues of gene spread, and animal-welfare concerns. Factors to be considered when assessing the prospects, including the risks and benefits, of biopharming in New Zealand should include the nature of the biopharming enterprise (e. g., animals used, activities encompassed, and operational and ownership structure) as well as the risk management measures likely to be applied. Four scenarios have been developed for assessment based on these factors. Factors relevant to risk assessment and management of biopharming emerging from the research encompass implications of the farm context for risk management as well as impacts of risk management on farm practice. The former include: impact of ownership structure, social and economic influences on implementation of controls, labour market, and the role of human error. The latter include: grazing practices, disposal of <b>carcasses</b> and <b>waste,</b> farm location, movements on and off the farm, and future land use. Application of the research findings to the scenarios suggests that there are substantial obstacles in the way of animal biopharming being taken up by dairy farmers in New Zealand. Specialist integrated biopharm operations may not face the same obstacles, but may also not offer the prospective benefits that have driven research on biopharming in New Zealand. Application of the findings to risk assessment and risk management points to a need to include a wider range of knowledge in risk-assessment processes and to consider a wider range of factors in assessing risks and benefits and in developing risk management protocols...|$|R
