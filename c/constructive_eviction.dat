50|$|The {{court held}} that the {{landlord}} was responsible for the <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction</b> of a tenant when the landlord allowed another lessee to obstruct the tenant's light and air. Traditionally, <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction</b> was only found when the landlord had acted intentionally to interfere with the tenant's possession of their lease.|$|E
50|$|In {{an action}} for unpaid rent brought by a {{landlord}} against a tenant, a tenant can offer <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction</b> as an affirmative defense. A <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction</b> {{means that the}} tenant is {{no longer able to}} occupy the lease, but that the tenant was not physically evicted by the landlord. This is often used in conjunction with a breach of the implied covenant of habitability.|$|E
50|$|A tenant {{who suffers}} from a <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction</b> can claim all of the legal {{remedies}} available to a tenant who was actually told to leave.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{entails a}} case study on the investigation of illegal farm evictions in the Great Kei Local Municipality of the Eastern Cape. The study was propelled by the plight of people living and working on farms in South Africa who are always victims of illegal farm evictions. Such evictions in many an instance violate their basic human rights protected by South Africa’s constitution and many other international conventions. It is hoped that the findings and recommendations of the research will have {{a profound impact on}} how illegal farm evictions in future will be handled by those championing the rights of people living and working on farms. Similarly, there is hope that this study will create an interest in others to new broader issues of human rights protection. A closer look at concepts like <b>constructive</b> <b>evictions</b> is necessary because of their traumatic nature to their victims. The study is divided into five chapters. 1. Introduction This chapter provides a background, the purpose of the study, specific objectives or research questions, hypotheses or assumptions of the study, the significance of the study, justification or rationale of the study, delimitation of the study, literature review, methodology, ethical considerations, and the limitations of the study. 2. The history of farm evictions in South Africa This chapter gives an outline of farm evictions in South Africa from both the colonial and apartheid 3. The culture of human rights in South Africa This chapter examines the institutions and instruments that influence the human rights culture in South Africa. It focuses on the legislative framework of human rights. 4. Farm evictions in the Great Kei Local Municipality of the Eastern Cape This chapter discusses farm evictions in the Great Kei Local Municipality and South Africa in general between December 2001 and December 2006. A case study of the same municipality is the nucleus of this research. 5. Conclusion The evaluation, findings, and recommendations of the study form the greater part of the chapter...|$|R
50|$|Case v. Minot, 158 Mass. 577 (1893), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of Massachusetts {{that was one of}} the first cases to hold that {{inaction}} by a landlord could establish a <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Violation of the {{warranty}} of habitability results in <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction,</b> whereby the landlord or [...] has, in effect, evicted the tenant or lessee. The tenant may remedy the problem, or complain to local government authorities for remedies.|$|E
5000|$|... "Constructive eviction" [...] {{occurs when}} a {{landlord}} does not actually evict but does something that renders the premises unlivable. This might occur, for example, where a tenant vacates an apartment because a landlord turns off the heat or water. The tenant, however, must abandon possession in order to claim {{that there was a}} <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Constructive</b> <b>eviction</b> is a {{term used}} in the law of real {{property}} to describe a circumstance in which a landlord either does something or fails {{to do something that}} he has a legal duty to provide (e.g. the landlord refuses to provide heat or water to the apartment), rendering the property uninhabitable. A tenant who is constructively evicted may terminate the lease and seek damages.|$|E
50|$|Javins, Saunders, Gross and {{a fourth}} tenant, Gladys Grant, appealed the {{decision}} to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. Edmund E. Fleming, the tenants' lawyer, argued that the court should find an implied warranty of habitability in the lease, {{based on the idea}} of <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction.</b> Despite the fact that briefs were submitted relatively quickly, the oral argument for the Court of Appeals case did not occur until 2 years after the initial trial. During that time, Sidney Brown, the owner of First National Realty, was put in jail for heating system code violations. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision, and the tenants appealed to the D.C. Circuit.|$|E
50|$|The {{case was}} finally {{decided by the}} N.Y. Appellate Division in 1988. The Court's ruling in favor of Kikuchi {{established}} the notion of partial constructive eviction; that is, a partial exclusion from the quiet use and enjoyment of the property. The rule established in this case entitled a partially constructively evicted tenant to a pro rata rent reduction {{in proportion to the}} portion of the property they were unable to use. Importantly, the court held that leaving the premises was not required under this new concept. This rule has not been widely adopted in the United States and is a minority rule. The case, 528 N.Y.S.2d 554 (App. Div. 1988) is featured in contemporary property law case books to illustrate the concept of partial <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Further, tenant is {{responsible}} for all environmental matters, {{no matter what the}} cause. It has been argued that following a major casualty or irreparable condemnation, the tenant isn't required to continue paying rent without abatements, even under a bond lease. The argument follows that under certain circumstances such a material event may even be construed as [...] "constructive eviction" [...] ultimately allowing the bond tenant {{to walk away from the}} property without providing a rejectable offer or other termination payment provision. Examples of case law exist however; which uphold the [...] "hell or high water" [...] clause as well as the <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction</b> argument. [...] When analyzing any commercial lease it is always advisable to have the lease reviewed by legal counsel and pay close attention to the local state real estate laws.|$|E
50|$|An implied {{warranty}} of habitability, generally, is a warranty implied by law that by leasing or buying a residential property, the lessor or seller is promising that {{the property is}} suitable to be lived in. The warranty of habitability can be breached {{if there is no}} heat, hot water, or other essential services. Also, safety issues like no smoke alarm or other fire code issues can be considered to make a dwelling uninhabitable. Also, if the municipality in which the property is located prohibits habitation without a certificate of occupancy but has not issued such a certificate with respect to the property, the unlawfulness of that habitation renders the property uninhabitable as a matter of law. The breach of the implied warrant of habitability can be used to legally break a lease. If the factors have been created or are controllable by the landlord and he or she has not fixed them despite ample written notification, this situation can also be considered <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction,</b> which allows the tenant to break the lease, but also may allow the tenant to sue for damages in some jurisdictions.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Kikuchi lived in New York City and rented a loft {{apartment}} on W. 20th Street. The large apartment, over 1700 square feet, {{was in a}} formerly commercial building adapted to artists spaces and mixed studio and apartment space. His space was filled with musical instruments and recording equipment; a creative work space as well as living space. In late 1977, a health spa equipment sales business moved into the floor above Kikuchi's studio. A series of damaging water leaks, noise, and eventually large scale building renovations began. These leaks and activities severely interfered with his work and daily living; Eventually Kikuchi sued his landlord asserting that the combined events and activities breached the convent of quiet enjoyment of his apartment. Importantly, he also claimed that the construction work effectively excluded his use of a generous swath of the loft apartment, that is he was constructively evicted by the landlord's acts and failure to act (related to the upstairs tenant). Despite the massive disruptions, he continued living in the apartment during the legal dispute. At common law, {{an essential element of}} claiming <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction</b> is the tenant's moving out; The logic of the common law rule is rooted in proof: the landlord's actions must be so severe and materially impact the tenant that no one would continue to stay there under the circumstances.|$|E
40|$|Under Australian law, {{a tenant}} {{complaining}} of nuisance caused by another tenant traditionally had no recourse to the lessor unless the lessor actively {{participated in the}} nuisance. A recent Queensland Court of Appeal decision, Aussie Traveller Pty Ltd v Marklea Pty Ltd, has found that a lessor who fails {{to take steps to}} control a tenant's nuisance may be liable to other tenants for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. This paper considers the recent decision in light of common law developments in Australia, England and the United States, including the American concept of <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction...</b>|$|E
40|$|Virtually {{every member}} of the urban {{community}} is a party to a landlord-tenant relationship. As the general tenor of urban life in America changes, so must the laws which govern the urban dweller. For years the doctrine of caveat emptor prevented the tenant from forcing the landlord to make necessary repairs or to retain the leased premises in a habitable condition. The doctrine of <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction</b> afforded him little relief; and housing and sanitation codes, while achieving a measure of success, were generally ineffective. Only when conditions because unbearable did the law protect him. Increasingly, however, the trend has been to enlarge the responsibilities of the landowner, through such devises as rent strikes, rent abatement, and the warranty of habitability. This has been due, in large measure, to the recognition of the need for quality housing, the unequal bargaining positions of the landlord and tenant, and the changed status of the tenant from rural to urban. The cases which serve as the focus of this Note, whereas contract and tort theories are used in novel ways to impose greater duties on landowners, are the most recent developments in this progression...|$|E
40|$|On October 8, 2009, Committee Concerning Community Improvement v. City of Modesto {{created a}} split in federal circuit courts over whether FHA § 3604 (b) applies to {{discrimination}} that occupants suffer after acquiring their dwelling. The {{question is whether}} the FHA only applies to discrimination in acquiring their property or afterwards as well. This Note examines the split in federal circuit courts created by Modesto. Part I examines the history of the FHA and theories of statutory interpretation. Part II discusses the split in federal authority and both sides’ interpretative methodologies and rationales.. Part III. A maintains that meaning-based and intent-based theories are unavailing because the disagreement between the circuits arises from a fundamental ambiguity in the statute regarding what constitutes housing access, integration, and the “privileges of sale or rental. ” Because traditional interpretive theories fail to resolve this ambiguity, Part III. B offers a solution based on an alternative interpretative theory, the Coherence Theory, developed by Ronald Dworkin. This Note suggests that the Supreme Court should resolve the split in authority by interpreting the FHA to advance the “policies or principles that furnish the best political justification for the statute” as maintained by Dworkin. It analyzes the related principles and policy issues concerning housing discrimination underlying the FHA and posits that the Supreme Court should recognize that the distinction between pre- and postacquisition discrimination is arbitrary because housing availability, access, and integration involve ongoing rights that do not end at the point of acquisition. This Note concludes that the Supreme Court should abolish the distinction between pre- and post-acquisition discrimination by adopting the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation and by allowing occupants to seek redress under § 3604 (b) for discriminatory treatment that occurs after acquiring their dwelling not amounting to <b>constructive</b> <b>eviction...</b>|$|E
