5|$|As of 2015, the EEU has no {{directly}} or indirectly elected body. In 2012, {{the creation of a}} Eurasian parliament was under consideration. However, it was <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> premature, and member states have instead begun harmonising national laws and legal codes.|$|E
5|$|In July 1899, as the Second Boer War loomed, Balfour {{offered to}} raise a {{thousand}} men to go and fight, but it was <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> early to begin that effort.|$|E

50|$|All of the group's albums {{have been}} re-issued on CD, except for their debut, which the group <b>consider</b> <b>too</b> rough {{for a proper}} reissue (though semi-bootleg copies can be {{obtained}} with the band's blessing).|$|R
5|$|John did {{not attend}} his parents' {{coronation}} on 22 June 1911, as this was <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> risky for his health; nonetheless, cynics said that the family feared their reputation would be damaged by any incident involving him.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, workers whose {{tasks were}} <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> {{important}} to be paid on a piece-rate basis were moved to a time-rate method. This was largely done in consideration of safety grounds and usually applied to those conducting maintenance or the repair of equipment.|$|E
5|$|All juniper species grow berries, {{but some}} are <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> bitter to eat. In {{addition}} to J. communis, other edible species include Juniperus drupacea, Juniperus phoenicea, Juniperus deppeana, and Juniperus californica. But the berries of some species, such as Juniperus sabina, are toxic and consumption of them is inadvisable.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} levels of {{radioactive}} contamination, her papers from the 1890s are <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> dangerous to handle. Even her cookbook is highly radioactive. Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and {{those who wish to}} consult them must wear protective clothing. In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith never resumed {{the work}} of writing the history, as {{she was unable to}} balance its revelatory autobiographical truth with the scandal that would then ensue. In her life, there were rumors that she had {{accepted}} men such as Harte, Stoddard, Clemens and Miller as occasional lovers—a book discussing these liaisons was one she <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> controversial.|$|E
5|$|Noé {{first tried}} to get the film funded in the early 2000s. Several {{producers}} responded positively to the script, and it was briefly under development for Tom Tykwer's German company X-Filme Creative Pool. It was <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> expensive and the producers dropped out. Prospects changed when Irréversible (2002) became a commercial success. Noé had written and directed Irréversible for StudioCanal, and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary, Wild Bunch. When the producers at Wild Bunch asked Noé {{what he wanted to do}} next, he answered Enter the Void. The project was once again <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> expensive in relation to its commercial potential, but when Wild Bunch discovered that Noé had started to develop the film for Pathé instead of them, they said that they were willing to fund it. Since development went slowly at Pathé, Noé chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch's offer.|$|E

50|$|Many U.S. federal {{agencies}} and states and local governments require or reward LEED certification. However, four states (Alabama, Georgia, Maine, and Mississippi) have effectively banned the use of LEED in new public buildings, preferring other industry standards that the USGBC <b>considers</b> <b>too</b> lax.|$|R
25|$|Spinning wool {{was very}} different: the staple was {{naturally}} twisted and easily adhered to other staples. The yarn could be bulked out by pressing in short fibres {{that would have}} been <b>consider</b> <b>too</b> short to spin if cotton. The mule could be far simpler in its construction.|$|R
5|$|On May 12, 2014, Whitlock {{was signed}} as an undrafted free agent with the Cincinnati Bengals. Upon signing with the Bengals, Whitlock was moved from {{defensive}} tackle to fullback. At 5'10", , Whitlock was <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> small to play defensive tackle at the NFL level.|$|E
5|$|Served {{mostly by}} a shuttle train and having low {{passenger}} numbers, {{the station and}} branch were considered for closure several times. Service was offered only during weekday peak hours from 1962 and discontinued in 1994, when the cost of replacing the lifts was <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> high for the income generated.|$|E
5|$|The F-1 draw, {{initially}} <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> steep for use, {{was also}} eventually opened when engineers laid down a new road. In {{the absence of}} any real progress opening the D-3 and E-3 draws, landing schedules were revised {{to take advantage of this}} route, and a company of tanks from the 745th tank battalion were able to reach the high ground by 20:00.|$|E
5000|$|Characteristics {{that have}} been noted to recur {{throughout}} Shimer's history, [...] include a unique degree of student involvement in administering the school's affairs. The school maintains a tradition of welcoming any pupils as they are ready and able to learn, admitting students many schools would <b>consider</b> <b>too</b> young.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{official}} blog for HOW {{as well as}} on its Facebook page, Jensen claims that he wants to see players feel the frustration that was common in older games [...] and commented on his dislike of children thinking themselves to be tough for having beaten games that he <b>considers</b> <b>too</b> easy.|$|R
50|$|Indeed, a storm {{stirred the}} seminarians of Vallendar-Schoenstatt: {{students}} {{protest against the}} internal regulations that they <b>consider</b> <b>too</b> severe; protesters spread graffiti on the walls. Two priests in charge of their spiritual direction resign. Under this situation, a young Father, Joseph Kentenich, is named for replacing to try to restore confidence among the seminarians.|$|R
5|$|After the 1932 season, University of Chicago {{president}} Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins {{forced out}} 70-year-old head coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, whom he <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> old for the position. Stagg {{then moved on}} to coach at the College of the Pacific. Athletic director T. Nelson Metcalf hired Shaughnessy to replace Stagg as head coach in 1933. Shaughnessy inherited a difficult situation at Chicago, and for the most part, lacked good material. He did, however, inherit from Stagg at least one important recruit: inaugural Heisman Trophy winner and future Hall of Fame back Jay Berwanger, whom many Midwest pundits considered the best back of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|As La Dispute have {{promoted}} {{their music}} on headline tours {{they have tried}} to create a play different songs and create a different experience for each live show. They have also used songs after a certain period of time: an example is 'King Park', which although was initially <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> emotionally draining for live performances, the band eventually started to play the song live. The band played 'St Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' from Wildlife at its first performance in September 2012.|$|E
50|$|A new {{religious}} movement apologist (NRM apologist or cult apologist) is {{a person}} who offers arguments in defense of controversial {{new religious movement}}s (pejoratively called cults). Sociologists Ben Zablocki and Thomas Robbins say the term is used by critics of new religious movements to devalue scholars whose writings they <b>consider</b> <b>too</b> sympathetic or tolerant of such groups.|$|R
50|$|In-store rentals are {{processed}} by either using a kiosk and ordering books online {{with a third}} party facilitator or renting directly from the store's inventory. Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections {{of the most popular}} books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they <b>consider</b> <b>too</b> risky to put in the rental system.|$|R

5|$|Critics {{were highly}} {{positive}} towards Phantom Hourglass. Its control scheme was praised, while criticism focused on its online features, which were <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> simple. The game received several video game industry awards, including the Nintendo DS Game of the Year award from GameSpot, GameSpy, and IGN. Phantom Hourglass was the best-selling game {{in its first}} month in Japan, with 302,887 copies sold. In the United States, it was the fifth best-selling game in the month it debuted, with 262,800 copies sold. 4.13 million copies of Phantom Hourglass were sold worldwide by March 2008.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> {{far away from the}} city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|For torpedo {{training}} it {{was even}} more difficult. Shallow water was needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, but at the time, its location near Portsmouth was <b>considered</b> <b>too</b> near the English Channel and as a result Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command giving up the site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo Training Units (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in this regard enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E

50|$|The canon de 6 système An XI {{was used}} {{extensively}} during the Napoleonic wars.
