500|$|Spence D. from IGN Music {{commented that}} the song is the coolest song on the album up to this point. Paul Rees from Q {{magazine}} complemented the track as a [...] "conventional rock song, filled with drama, darkness and surprises". USA Todays Edna Gunderson said that the [...] "funkified" [...] synth-pop of [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] attests to Madonna's [...] "undiminished" [...] skills as a shrewd pop composer. Yahoo! Music's Dan Genoe commented that Madonna has a personality crisis in the song. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice gave the song a mixed review, writing: [...] "It mutes slightly the slaphappy beats of Mirwais's own club hit [...] "Disco Science" [...] to make vague digs at the press and defensively vow self-improvement. Madonna's voice is mixed and diced into baby gurgles, {{which might have been}} cute if it weren't so redundant." [...] John Payne from LA Weekly deduced that even within the synth sounds of the song, he could see [...] "real feeling deeply ingrained in this particular icon. 'Why should I <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world thinks of me?' That is, yes, she does <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world thinks of her. She says she’ll just withdraw from the public eye, ’cause who needs this, huh?" [...] Conversely, Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, gave a negative review saying that [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] might be the silliest track that Madonna had ever recorded.|$|E

She sang in choral groups {{for most of her}} life, spending over 50 years in the Philadelphia Chamber Chorus. She was also a hiking and canoeing enthusiast. She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her and kissed her. That was not being done in 1961." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{handsome}} riverboat gambler, Gaylord Ravenal, {{appears on}} the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia ("Nolie") Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap'n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (Parthy). Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal ("Make Believe"). She seeks advice from Joe, a black dock worker aboard the boat, who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie, the ship's cook. He replies that there are [...] "lots like [...] on the river." [...] As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice. He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of [...] "Ol' Man River", who doesn't seem to <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world's troubles are, but [...] "jes' keeps rollin' along".|$|E

500|$|St. John was {{instructed}} by the show's directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth's performances of Todd {{because they wanted}} him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other guy did. That's his time." [...] St. John felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform Todd. [...] "I know that sounds very arrogant and overconfident," [...] he stated, [...] "but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Nobody Knows Me" [...] has vocoder effects, spacey synths, bubbly bass. IGN Music's Spencer D. {{described}} {{that the}} song blips, glurgs, and shuffles with a Jetsons' styled disco {{ebb and flow}} and sounds like as an outtake from Music (2000). It begins with vocoder treated vocals over a bleeping synth, on a minor chord. Heavy drum hits stress the melody during the verse. [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] is written in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Madonna's voice spanning from B3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–Am–D–Am–A–E as its chord progression. Lyrically, she rejects tabloid culture's [...] "social disease", denouncing both TV and magazines. The chorus features repeated echo shifts of [...] "nobody knows me" [...] while she ponders thoughts like, [...] "It's no good when you're misunderstood, but why should I <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world thinks of me?". O'Brien {{described it as a}} trancey track with a sense of childlike defiant lyrics, dismissing critics who have no knowledge of her [...] "jealously guarded inner self".|$|E
500|$|Edna Gunderson of USA Today was positive, commenting, [...] "The music, while upbeat {{and even}} giddy, steers away from {{adolescent}} pranks and pratfalls, a welcome upgrade. The band creates a fresh breed of post-punk power pop by roughing up bright melodies." [...] AllMusic's Brian O'Neill gave the album three stars, {{calling it a}} [...] "far cry from the party-boy ethos DeLonge is best known for, and he wears the emotional depth well, with songs that are just as hooky as from his bread-winning main squeeze." [...] A reviewer for Q admitted that the musicians [...] "confound expectations with a very good record." [...] The positive reception of the album was {{in contrast to the}} reviews for Blink, which were often negative. [...] "I think it's a cop-out for [...] to like the music I do," [...] DeLonge told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "Critics can't say they like Blink or give us any credit, 'cause we're out there goofing around." [...] Barker was more critical: [...] "I especially don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> critics say. Most of them are like 50 years old and they're not really educated in what kind of music we're playing to begin with!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Sing for Me" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, with a {{duration}} of four minutes (...) [...] Its instrumentation consists of [...] "soft" [...] strings, a [...] "delicate" [...] piano melody and [...] "80s power ballad-type drums" [...] at its close. The key in which the structure was composed is changed {{during the course of the}} song. Aguilera's vocals span from E♭3 to E♭5. Aguilera's vocal performance garnered a comparison to Gabby Douglas and the vocal gymnastics that she projects from Mike Wass for Idolator. He also noted that although Carey would consider the vocals runs as [...] "over-the-top", they fit with the nature of the song. The song features a [...] "thunderous" [...] ironic chorus which consists of the lyrics Cause when I open my mouth, my whole heart comes out." [...] According to Chris Younie for 4Music, Aguilera belts the song out [...] "as if her life depends on it." [...] The [...] "reflective ballad" [...] may be what was created as a result of Aguilera singing [...] "Beautiful" [...] alone in her bedroom after the weak commercial response of Bionic. It represents a [...] "fine line" [...] between the [...] "her hurt over the Bionic backlash and the woe-is-me territory she occasionally veers into on some of the album’s worst tracks." [...] Aguilera tries to [...] "shake her insecurities" [...] during the lines [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world thinks or how I sound." [...] According to Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club, Aguilera [...] "discusses working through regret and reclaiming her sense of self." ...|$|E
500|$|Another Green World was {{released}} in September 1975 and did not chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States. The album's reception was {{for the most part}} very favourable. Henry Edwards of High Fidelity wrote positively of the album, claiming it to be Eno's [...] "most accessible to date". Tom Hull of The Village Voice felt that, although it [...] "wouldn't {{be fair to say that}} Another Green World is Eno's best album," [...] the album is definitely [...] "his easiest to love." [...] Charley Walters of Rolling Stone found it a [...] "major triumph" [...] that Eno's creative risks [...] "so consistently pan out", and said that it is [...] "indeed an important record—and also a brilliant one". Negative reviews of the album focused on the lack of the rock songs from Eno's previous albums. Jon Pareles, writing in Crawdaddy!, found its electronic excursions less challenging than Eno's previous progressive rock songs and remarked, [...] "This ain't no Eno record. I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> credits say. It doesn't even get on my nerves." [...] Lester Bangs of The Village Voice was lulled by much of the music and said that [...] "those little pools of sound on the outskirts of silence seemed to me the logical consequence of letting the processes and technology share your conceptual burden". Robert Christgau, who originally gave the album an [...] "A–" [...] in his review for The Village Voice, admitted that he resisted the album at first, but ultimately grew to [...] "love every minute of this arty little collection of static (i.e., non-swinging) synthesizer pieces (with vocals, percussion, and guitar)." [...] He felt that its 13 pieces can be appreciated both individually and as a whole, and called the album [...] "the aural equivalent of a park on the moon — oneness with nature under conditions of artificial gravity." [...] In 1977, Another Green World was voted the 11th best album of 1976 in the Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it second on his own list for the poll.|$|E

2500|$|John Younger {{was almost}} arrested in Dallas County, Texas in January 1871. He killed two lawmen during the attempt and escaped. On June 3, 1871, the gang robbed {{a bank in}} Corydon, Iowa; the James and Younger {{brothers}} were suspects. The bank contacted the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in Chicago, the first involvement of the famous agency {{in the pursuit of}} the James–Younger Gang. Agency founder Allan Pinkerton dispatched his son, Robert Pinkerton, who joined a county sheriff in tracking the gang to a farm in Civil Bend, Missouri. A short gunfight ended indecisively as the gang escaped.

[...] Meine made his professional baseball debut in 1921 at age 25. [...] He entered professional baseball {{the same year that}} the spitball, Meine's mainstay, was outlawed. [...] Interviewed in 1963, Meine recalled:"After the Carl MaysRay Chapman accident in 1920, baseball outlawed all freak pitches and trick deliveries. [...] I had one break. [...] Either the news was slow in reaching Texas or they didn't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> rest of the world did. [...] The spitball was still a legal pitch in the Texas League in 1921.

And I think the other players will feel that way, too." [...] However, LaRose also expressed his admiration of the Big Eight [...] "for standing up for what was right – enforcing its own rules". Also at the gathering, Colorado All-American guard Joe Romig echoed similar feelings when he said, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> NCAA or the Big Eight does. We lost the game at Kansas. Nothing will change that." [...] Meanwhile, Kansas All-American quarterback John Hadl expressed more concern about his teammate when asked at the All-America gathering and had this to say, [...] "He's a good guy. I hope it doesn't hit him too hard." [...] Missouri head coach Dan Devine expressed his apparent disappointment in the process adopted by the Big 8 when he said, [...] "This is {{the worst thing that could}} happen in inter-collegiate athletics.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was really upset that she would say and do those things. In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and do those things when people break up, and she obviously felt the need {{to go out there and}} make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful thing and it got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write back and be mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{discussion}} paper aims to synthesise {{the literature on}} patient-centred care {{from a range of}} health professions and to relate this to the field of rehabilitative audiology. Through review of the literature, this paper addresses five questions: <b>What</b> is patient-centred <b>care?</b> How is patient-centred <b>care</b> measured? <b>What</b> are <b>the</b> outcomes of patient-centred <b>care?</b> <b>What</b> are <b>the</b> factors contributing to patient-centred <b>care?</b> <b>What</b> are <b>the</b> implications for audiological rehabilitation? Design: Literature review and synthesis. Study sample: Publications were identified by structured searches in PubMed, Cinahl, Web of Knowledge, and PsychInfo, and by inspecting the reference lists of relevant articles. Results: Few publications from within the audiology profession address this topic and consequently a review and synthesis of literature from other areas of health were used to answer the proposed questions. Conclusion: This paper concludes that patient-centred care is in line with the aims and scope of practice for audiological rehabilitation. However, there is emerging evidence that we still need to inform the conceptualisation of patient-centred audiological rehabilitation. A definition of patient-centred audiological rehabilitation is needed to facilitate studies into the nature and outcomes of it in audiological rehabilitation practice...|$|R
