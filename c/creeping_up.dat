5|$|To {{mark the}} album's tenth anniversary, The Downward Spiral was re-released on November 23, 2004 in {{high-resolution}} SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc {{one of the}} album's deluxe edition re-release is nearly {{identical to the original}} version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks <b>creeping</b> <b>up</b> on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a stereo and multi-channel SACD layer. The second bonus disc is a collection of remixes and B-sides and also includes a stereo SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{examines}} McMahon {{and finds}} {{her to be}} physically normal, Doggett thinks {{that they may be}} onto something whilst Reyes remains skeptical. Doggett is then suspended by Kersh and Follmer. Reyes tries {{to find out more about}} McMahon's history and learns that she is a Department of Justice employee and had been contacted by Wormus and McFarland in their attempts to expose the plans to contaminate the water supply. The Lone Gunmen intercept a call from the captain to Wormus, who tells him to contact the FBI, Knowle Rohrer is nearby eavesdropping. The captain then pulls a gun on the Navy Seal guarding the entrance to the lab, demanding that Nordlinger surrender the project's data. He does not notice Rohrer <b>creeping</b> <b>up</b> behind him. After hearing Reyes' findings, Scully, Reyes and Doggett go to the ship. They expect to meet the captain, but instead find Rohrer. Just as Rohrer is about to crush Doggett's skull, he is decapitated by McMahon. Rohrer is presumed dead, but soon awakens and stabs McMahon. Both bodies tumble into the water. The three agents board the ship, which is abandoned, and find the captain's decapitated body. Scully gains access to the now empty lab and finds evidence of manipulation of ova. However, she is forced to leave when Doggett finds a time bomb on the bridge. The agents narrowly escape the explosion.|$|E
25|$|Duel Live {{made use}} of the {{original}} outdoor queue line, often with other actors roaming the wooded area. For the 2008 version, the queue featured gravediggers and werewolves <b>creeping</b> <b>up</b> on the guests, though in 2009 this was reduced to one actor in a hooded robe. Guests waited at the door instead of walking straight in, before being greeted by either a maid or a butler (the performers alternated during the 2009 version, but in 2008 only the butler featured) and given a brief talk about what was inside and why the guns were switched off. The TV screens in the Drawing Room were covered with cloth and muted, and the original spooky music turned up; the room being similar {{to what it was}} in the original Haunted House. During the 2008 event, the maid jumped out at guests as they entered the Drawing Room.|$|E

500|$|Getting {{funding for}} the project was {{difficult}} because of the taboos against death, and the crew had to approach several companies before Departures was approved by Toshiaki Nakazawa and Yasuhiro Mase. According to the film's director, Yōjirō Takita, a consideration in taking on the film was {{the age of the}} crew: [...] "we got to a certain point in our lives when death was <b>creeping</b> <b>up</b> to become a factor around us". Kundō Koyama was enlisted to provide the script, his first for a feature film; his previous experience had been in scripting for television and stage. Takita, who had begun his career in the pink film genre before entering mainstream filmmaking in 1986 with Comic Magazine, took on the director's role in 2006, after producer Toshiaki Nakazawa presented him with the first draft of the script. In a later interview he stated [...] "I wanted to make a film {{from the perspective of a}} person who deals with something so universal and yet is looked down upon, and even discriminated against". Although he knew of the encoffining ceremony, he had never seen one performed.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from most music critics. In {{an article for}} The Source, The Ghetto Communicator wrote [...] "This record is harsh, {{but so is the}} world that we live in. For B-boys n'girls who come from the core of the hard, this is the hip-hop album you've been waiting for". Rolling Stones review was decidedly ambivalent, praising the album's sound, but noting that [...] "Wu-Tang... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas—the self." [...] Entertainment Weekly was more enthusiastic, giving the album an A, and writing that [...] "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, Enter has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret." [...] Touré declared of the album, that [...] "This is hip-hop you won't find <b>creeping</b> <b>up</b> the Billboard charts but you will hear booming out of Jeep stereos in all the right neighborhoods." [...] However, Enter the Wu-Tang had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound. It peaked at number 41 on the Billboard 200 chart and reached number eight on Billboards Top R/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album continued to sell steadily and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 15, 1995.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2015, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} from the UK and the US published a paper demonstrating similar findings. The researchers concluded that [...] "motor responses and the choice of hand can be modulated using tDCS". However, a different attempt by Sohn et al. failed to replicate such results; later, Jeffrey Gray wrote in his book Consciousness: <b>Creeping</b> <b>up</b> on the Hard Problem that tests looking for the influence of electromagnetic fields on brain function have been universally negative in their result.|$|E
2500|$|Sillaginids {{are taken}} {{by a variety of}} fishing methods, with inshore catches {{predominantly}} taken using beach seine nets and cast nets. Due to the alert nature of sillaginids, skill is required on <b>creeping</b> <b>up</b> quietly {{enough to be able to}} net fish with a cast net, with experienced fishers often paddling into the sun toward a school and drifting slowly upon it before casting the net. In deeper waters, commercial trawlers and longliners take the most fish, with a number of sillaginids taken in prawn trawls as bycatch. The fish are normally marketed fresh locally under various names, with [...] "Ashuos" [...] commonly used in many countries for various sillaginids. At least one export fishery exists in Australia whereby S. flindersi is exported to Thailand where the fish are repackaged and sent to Japan frozen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{choice of}} Hitachi units, which would see little final {{manufacturing}} in the UK over the foreign-owned but domestically manufactured Bombardier option, was controversial, {{particularly in the}} area that would have manufactured them, leading to a campaign to reverse the decision. It was, however, economics which became a sticking point with the weight of the design <b>creeping</b> <b>up</b> (though some accused the Dft of producing impossible specification requirements) and reportedly difficult negotiations over the final unit price and production balance between the different power options. The inability or reluctance of the financial markets to provide the necessary capital was the final straw, leading to the announcement in February 2010 of a three-month independent review into the value for money of the programme [...] and looking at alternative options such as life extension of existing IC125 stock.|$|E

2500|$|The {{heightened}} sense of crisis prompted Iorga to issue appeals against defeatism and reissue Neamul Românesc from Iași, explaining: [...] "I realized at once what moral use {{could come out of}} this for the thousands of discouraged and disillusioned people and against the traitors who were <b>creeping</b> <b>up</b> all over the place." [...] The goal was again reflected in his complementary lectures (where he discussed the [...] "national principle") and a new set of works; these featured musings on the Allied commitment (Relations des Roumains avec les Alliès, [...] "The Romanians' Relations with the Allies"; Histoire des relations entre la France et les roumains, [...] "The History of Relations between France and the Romanians"), the national character (Sufletul românesc, [...] "The Romanian Soul") or columns against the loss of morale (Armistițiul, [...] "The Armistice"). His ideal of moral regeneration through the war effort came with an endorsement of land reform projects. Brătianu did not object to the idea, being however concerned that landowners would rebel. Iorga purportedly gave him a sarcastic reply: [...] "just like you've been shooting the peasants to benefit the landowners, you'll then be shooting the landowners to benefit the peasants." ...|$|E

Palace Malice started very poorly and was unable to get into contention until the straight, when he finished strongly to finish fourth, beaten a nose, three quarters of a length and a nose again by Will Take Charge, Moreno and Orb.
