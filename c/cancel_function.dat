The particular guidelines examined included the naturalness, specificity, frequency of use, and form (words or symbols) of the command names: and the relationship among the commands within a set (i. e., congruency). Four command sets were studied: a noncompliant set that violated all five guidelines: a mixed set that adhered to all five guidelines: and a symbolic and a verbal set that both violated the form guideline. examined: performance (time, errors, and the use of help and <b>cancel</b> <b>functions)</b> : recall: and preference measures. The results of the study indicate that the extent to which guidelines can be combined differ depending on the type of dependent variable examined. Further, the results do not support the conclusion that the more guidelines followed, the better the user's performance. The conclusions discussed include how to interpret guidelines based on past research, suggestions for combining existing guidelines, and implications for future research.

40|$|Interlocking {{tables are}} the {{functional}} specification defining the routes {{on which the}} passage of the train is allowed. Associated with the route, the states and actions of all related signalling equipment are also specified. It is well-known that designing and verifying the interlocking tables are labour intensive, tedious and prone to errors. To assist the verification process and detect errors rapidly, we formally model and analyse the interlocking tables using Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs). Although a large interlocking table can be easily modelled, analysing the model is rather difficult due to the state explosion problem and undesired safe deadlocks. The safe deadlocks are when no train collides but the train traffic cannot proceed any further. For ease of analysis we incorporate automatic route setting and automatic route <b>cancelling</b> <b>functions</b> into the model. These help reducing the number of the deadlocks. We also exploit the new features of CPN Tools; prioritized transitions; inhibitor arcs; and reset arcs. These help reducing the size of the state spaces. We also include a fail safe specification called flank protection into the interlocking model. Comment: In Proceedings FSFMA 2014, arXiv: 1407. 195...|$|R

During the process of handling many engineering problems, the complex computation is often needed. So the method of mixed-language {{programming is}} often used in developing project software.

Recently, unsupervised learning of log-linear models for word alignment has re-ceived considerable attention as it combines the merits of generative and discriminative approaches. However, a major challenge still re-mains: it is intractable to calculate the expectations of non-local fea-tures that are critical for capturing the divergence between natural lan-guages. We propose a contrastive approach that aims to differentiate observed training examples from noises. It not only introduces prior knowledge to guide unsupervised learning but also <b>cancels</b> out parti-tion <b>functions.</b> Based on the observation that the probability mass of log-linear models for word alignment is usually highly concentrated, we propose to use top-n alignments to approximate the expectations with respect to posterior distributions. This allows for efficient and ac-curate calculation of expectations of non-local features.

The cross-antagonistic regulation of Th-POK and Runx 3 seems to be essential for CD 4 / 8 thymocyte lineage commitment. However, the process for determining which pivotal factor acts dominantly has not been established. To explore the determining process, we used an in vitro culture system in which CD 4 or CD 8 single-positive cells are selectively induced from CD 4 / 8 double-positive cells. Surprisingly, we found that control of G 1 cell cycle phase progression is critical for the determination. In the CD 4 pathway, sustained TCR signal, as well as Th-POK, induces G 1 -phase extension and represses CD 8 expression in a G 1 extension-dependent manner. In the CD 8 pathway, after {{receiving a}} transient TCR signal, the IL- 7 R signal, as well as Runx 3, antagonizes TCR signal-mediated G 1 extension and CD 8 repression.

We begin by reviewing the idea that lighting effects due to geometry and light colour can,under certain reasonable simplifying assumptions,both be modelled using simple scalar multipliers. We nowtake logarithms and turn geometry and light colour dependency into additive processes. We show how in this log color space two simple projection operators lead to invariance to geometry and light colour. Moreover,because projection operators are idempotent, illuminant invariance is achieved in a single step. Experiments demonstrated that log comprehensive normalisation used as a preprocessing step supports accurate colour based object recognition independent of lighting conditions...|$|R

We conducted RNA sequencing of mouse mammary gland epithelial (NMuMG) cells and identified a long non-coding RNA, termed lncRNA-Smad 7, which has anti-apoptotic functions, as a target of TGF-beta lncRNA-Smad 7 was located adjacent to the mouse Smad 7 gene, and its expression was induced by TGF-beta {{in all of the}} mouse mammary gland epithelial cell lines and breast cancer cell lines that we evaluated.

Small interfering RNA for lncRNA-Smad 7 did not alter the process of TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, phosphorylation of Smad 2 or expression of the Smad 7 gene, suggesting that the contribution of this lncRNA to TGF-beta functions may be restricted to apoptosis.

Using a yeast two-hybrid interactive screen, we have now isolated a novel cyclin D-interacting myb-like protein (designated DMP 1), which binds specifically to the nonamer DNA consensus sequences CCCG(G/T) ATGT to activate transcription. A subset of these DMP 1 recognition sequences containing a GGA trinucleotide core can also function as Ets-responsive elements. DMP 1 mRNA and protein are ubiquitously expressed throughout the cell cycle in mouse tissues and in representative cell lines. DMP 1 binds to D-type cyclins directly in vitro and when coexpressed in insect Sf 9 cells. In both settings, it can be phosphorylated by cyclin D-dependent kinases, suggesting that its transcriptional activity may normally be regulated through such mechanisms.

We review the available theoretical results for these quantities and conclude that, contrary to the production cross sections, the ratios R(x,Q^ 2) and A(x,Q^ 2) are stable under radiative QCD corrections in wide region of the variables x and Q^ 2. This implies that large radiative contributions to the structure <b>functions</b> <b>cancel</b> {{each other in the}} ratios R(x,Q^ 2) and A(x,Q^ 2) with good accuracy. Then we consider some experimental and phenomenological applications of the observed perturbative stability. We provide compact analytic predictions for R(x,Q^ 2) and azimuthal cos(2 φ) asymmetry in the case of low x≪ 1. It is demonstrated that our obtained results will be useful in the extraction of the structure functions from measurements of the reduced cross sections. Finally, we analyze the properties of R(x,Q^ 2) and A(x,Q^ 2) within the variable-flavor-number scheme (VFNS) of QCD. We conclude that the Callan-Gross ratio and azimuthal asymmetry are perturbatively stable but sensitive to resummation of the mass logarithms of the type α_s(Q^ 2 /m^ 2). For this reason, the quantities R(x,Q^ 2) and A(x,Q^ 2) will be good probes of the heavy-quark content of the proton.
