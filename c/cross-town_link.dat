25|$|In 1957 Parliament {{authorised}} Liverpool Corporation {{to flood}} {{a section of}} the line by damming the Afon Tryweryn. Monies were made available to divert the route round the dam, but it was decided that improving the road from Bala to Llan Ffestiniog would be of greater benefit. Road transport alternatives were established for groups such as schoolchildren and workers. The plans afoot for rail serving Trawsfynydd nuclear power station were to be catered for by building the long-discussed <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> between the two Blaenau standard gauge stations. The estimated financial savings to be made were £23,300 by withdrawing the passenger service and £7000 in renewal charges.|$|E
2500|$|Coinciding {{with the}} new <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> {{established}} between Fendalton and Brighton in December 1972, the Woolston portion of the Opawa service was joined to the Marshland Road route. [...] Also, as the Lyttelton suburban rail services had recently ceased operation, the Lyttelton bus service was rerouted to follow the railway line and collect passengers from around the railway stations, {{and in so doing}} largely followed the Hillsborough section of the Opawa service.|$|E
2500|$|The {{replacement}} diesel {{bus service}} was extended several times, first to Joy Street from 25 August 1958, then to Briggs Road, {{and throughout the}} 1980s it followed {{the development of the}} north-eastern suburbs through Burwood, Parklands, Waimairi Beach, and North Beach to end up at New Brighton. [...] A <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> with the Opawa route was established in December 1972 that lasted to 1980/81 when it was switched to a combined Marshland Road–Avonhead route.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cross-town</b> <b>links</b> {{included}} the Wharenui route from October 1955 to 4 September 1967 {{at which point}} the service terminated at Cathedral Square, and with the Mays Road route from 1972.|$|R
50|$|Apart from a {{short-lived}} service to Weston Road, this route remained unaltered after the 1920s. It {{was part of}} two <b>cross-town</b> <b>links,</b> from 25 May 1953 with the Brighton route and from late 1972 with the Wainoni route. By the 1950s the route had {{become known as the}} Mays Road service.|$|R
50|$|The L113 - {{a country}} road without <b>cross-town</b> <b>links</b> runs through {{the western part of}} the city. This street goes from Breisach - Riegel to Freiamt, and then meets the L115 near Niederrotweil. The L115 goes on to Bötzingen and Umkirch. The {{different}} districts are connected with a net of district roads.|$|R
2500|$|Midland Motorways held {{a license}} to operate bus {{services}} on Memorial Avenue out to the Airport, a situation that prevented the Board from extending the Fendalton service along this route. [...] When it obtained its own license for Memorial Avenue, services were extended to Ilam Road from 6 January 1958. [...] Further extensions included Grahams Road (30 June 1958), Avonhead Road (2 December 1963), and Withells Road (1977). [...] The Fendalton route's <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> was changed to Brighton in 1972, ending its association with Opawa.|$|E
50|$|The {{districts of}} Grod, Beuren, Möllen, Wohmbrechts and Hergatz are {{located at the}} Bundesstraße 12 (federal road 12) Munich - Lindau, {{approximately}} 20 km from Lindau. The B 12 forms a <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> in Wohmbrechts.|$|E
50|$|Appenzeller Bahnen (AB) has {{contracted}} Stadler Rail {{to deliver}} seven new Tango {{for use on}} the new St. Gallen <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> from Trogen to Appenzell starting from 2017. So far, the western line from St. Gallen to Appenzell is operated by heavy rail with a rack section.|$|E
50|$|Brighton {{services}} were connected with other routes to provide <b>cross-town</b> <b>links.</b> From 25 May 1953 Brighton buses ran a combined route with the Mays Road service, which, while not {{as successful as}} the Board had hoped, remained in effect for nearly two decades. Next, Brighton {{services were}} connected to the Fendalton route from 1972, which {{proved to be more}} successful, and they remained this way until deregulation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{planning}} for the Tube network immediately before and after World War II considered several new routes. The main {{results of this study}} concerned two major routes: the south-to-northeast [...] "line C", and lines 3 and 4, new <b>cross-town</b> routes, <b>linking</b> the northeast suburbs to Fenchurch Street, Wapping and variously Lewisham and Hayes. Line C opened as the Victoria line, in stages, from 1968 to 1972. Work on the northeast–southwest route continued.|$|R
5000|$|GoRaleigh {{provides}} {{public transportation}} to areas known colloquially as inside the beltline and outside I-440, {{as well as}} contracted service to the Town of Wake Forest and to Wake Tech Community College. The system operates on a hub and spoke-style layout, with most routes beginning and ending at the newly renovated GoRaleigh Station, formerly known as Moore Square Station, in downtown Raleigh. The [...] "L" [...] routes circulate through an area or operate as a <b>cross-town</b> route and <b>link</b> with one one or more [...] "spoke" [...] routes. The [...] "X" [...] routes are express routes which operate non-stop or with limited stops along {{the body of the}} route. Stops on these routes are generally available only {{at the beginning and end}} points of the route. Longer distance routes are operated by the intercounty GoTriangle system.|$|R

5000|$|Twenty {{years later}} the <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> was slewed {{to the north and}} FR rails were laid {{alongside}} to their south, both leading to a brand new interchange station on the site of Blaenau Ffestiniog Central, which had itself been built on the site of [...] station almost a hundred years earlier. The standard gauge part opened on 22 March 1982, followed by the FR part on 25 May 1982.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} gauge {{line through the}} site of Duffws (F&BR) station closed to passengers in 1960 and completely in 1961 but it was mothballed pending building the long-discussed <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> to enable trains to run along the Conwy Valley Line, through Blaenau and on to Trawsfynydd nuclear power station which was then being built. This link was built and a new line through the site opened on 24 April 1964, but none of Blaenau Ffestiniog Central's facilities were brought back to life.|$|E

The line past the site of Tan-y-Manod station, the engine shed and transshipment sidings reopened on 24 April 1964, but none of Tan-y-Manod's facilities were brought back to life. The line closed again in 1998 as the nuclear plant was being decommissioned. Once more the route was mothballed in case a future use is found.|$|E
50|$|In 1957 Parliament {{authorised}} Liverpool Corporation {{to flood}} {{a section of}} the line by damming the Afon Tryweryn. Monies were made available to divert the route round the dam, but it was decided that improving the Bala to Llan Ffestiniog Road would be of greater benefit. Road transport alternatives were established for groups such as schoolchildren and workers. The plans afoot for rail serving Trawsfynydd nuclear power station were to be catered for by building the long-discussed <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> between the two Blaenau standard gauge stations. The estimated financial savings to be made were £23,300 by withdrawing the passenger service and £7000 in renewal charges.|$|E
5000|$|The station {{buildings}} were demolished {{in the early}} 1960s, but the standard gauge platform remained in place. The <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> was built, passing the disused platform but not adjacent to it. The link enabled trains from the Conwy Valley Line to access the mothballed line from Blaenau southwards to a siding {{near the site of}} [...] where a large ("Goliath") gantry was erected to load and unload traffic for the then new Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. The link and the mothballed line were reopened on 20 April 1964, the main goods transported were nuclear fuel rods carried in nuclear flasks. The line was also used during the late 1980s for freight traffic to a siding at [...] serving the explosives factory in Penrhyndeudraeth.|$|E
5000|$|The Festiniog Railway {{closed in}} 1946. In the mid-1950s visionary preservationists started the herculean task of {{rebuilding}} the line, {{primarily as a}} tourist railway. The FR had always had a track between their [...] and what became Blaenau Ffestiniog Central, they also owned the land beneath. In the Nineteenth Century they used this to block extensions southeast by the LNWR or northwest by the GWR which would have threatened their hold on their core business - slate traffic. Although the FR closed in 1946, it was not dissolved, meaning the preservationists had this line of route {{through the heart of}} Blaenau. They used this to facilitate rather than block radical change in the early 1960s, coming to an accommodation with British Railways whereby BR would build their <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> from [...] through the remains of Blaenau Ffestiniog Central {{in such a way that}} room could be found for the FR to fit alongside if and when it returned to Blaenau.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{formulate}} a method for estimating the costs and welfare losses of all types that congestion on <b>cross-town</b> <b>link</b> roads causes to the social fabric of the areas affected. Eight main costs are identified, most of them financial or environmental, and techniques are proposed to measure and, where relevant, price {{the total cost of}} congestion compared to smooth traffic flows. The intention is for this method to provide results that can be used by public-sector decision-makers to draw up a more efficient overall transport system. ...|$|E
