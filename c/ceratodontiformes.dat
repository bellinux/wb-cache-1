The Lepidosireniformes are more closely related to the Australian lungfish and its relatives than most orders of fossil lungfish. [...] They are known from as early as the Early Devonian. Fossil ancestors of the order have been located in Cretaceous Africa and South America for the Protopteridae and Lepidosirenidae, respectively.|$|E
