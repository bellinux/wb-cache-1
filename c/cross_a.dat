50|$|A {{worst case}} can be {{imagined}} on IBM System/370 and comparable mainframes. An execute instruction <b>crossing</b> <b>a</b> page boundary could point to a move instruction that also <b>crosses</b> <b>a</b> page boundary, which is set to move data from <b>a</b> source that <b>crosses</b> <b>a</b> page boundary to <b>a</b> target that <b>crosses</b> <b>a</b> page boundary. This single instruction references eight pages; if not all are in RAM, it will cause a page fault. If the operating system could not allocate eight pages to this program, then remedying the page fault would discard another page the instruction needs, and any restart of the instruction would fault again.|$|R

5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander {{who claimed to have}} had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.|$|E

South of campus, I-496/US127 crosses back into Lansing and has an interchange with Jolly Road before entering Delhi Township. About two-thirds of a mile (1.1km) south of Jolly Road, I-496 meets I-96 and terminates; US127 continues southward as a freeway toward Jackson.|$|E

A ball must completely <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E

Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules.|$|E

5|$|Five people drowned {{after their}} cars were {{swept away by}} floodwaters while trying to <b>cross</b> <b>a</b> flooded stream. The floods also damaged 4,000-6,000 homes and {{buildings}} and significantly disrupted water and communications {{for an extended period}} of time. The hurricane's storm surge damaged many boats and yachts in ports along the peninsula's coast, most of them beyond repair. Minor beach erosion was reported at San Felipe, Baja California. As a result, the Baja California Sur municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comond√∫, and Muleg√© were declared national disaster areas. 6,000 people were affected and total damage from the storm was $100 million.|$|E

Total damage from Odile amounted to approximately MX$16.6billion (US$1.22billion), with most of the damage coming from the infrastructural and agricultural sectors of the economy.|$|E

In October 2006, BA became involved in a civil rights dispute when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace bearing the <b>cross,</b> <b>a</b> religious symbol.
