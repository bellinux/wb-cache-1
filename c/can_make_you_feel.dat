500|$|The lyrics for [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] {{are written}} in first person, about Cyrus' {{relocation}} from Nashville, Tennessee to Hollywood, California. In the verses, she details occurrences in Hollywood, such as peers questioning her attire, that cause for her to feel homesick and intimidated. Towards the conclusion of each verse, the protagonist listens to her favorite Jay-Z and Britney Spears song, respectively, {{which leads to the}} refrains describing how her favorite songs make her feel more confident. Vicki Lutas of BBC interpreted, [...] "However cringe it sounds, your favourite song <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> okay and feel more confident, even if you're not really." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2004, the newspaper's then-public editor Daniel Okrent, {{wrote an}} opinion piece {{in which he}} said that The New York Times did have a liberal bias in news {{coverage}} of certain social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. He stated that this bias reflected the paper's cosmopolitanism, which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City. He wrote, [...] "if you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world." [...] Okrent wrote that the Times Arts & Leisure; the Sunday Times Magazine, and Culture coverage trend to the left.|$|E

[...] Movie Reviews |last = Travers|first = Peter|work=Rolling Stone|date = February 28, 1992|accessdate =December 6, 2011}} Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that the}} film's [...] "story {{is as old as}} the movies, but The Mambo Kings is so filled with energy, passion and heedless {{vitality}} that it seems new, anyway." [...] Ebert and his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a [...] "Two Thumbs Up" [...] rating on their syndicated television program, Siskel and Ebert and the Movies. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised the film's director, writing that [...] "Glimcher shows an epicure's taste in his choice of both cast and crew. The look of [...] "The Mambo Kings" [...] is doubtless richer than the text, which is, however, strengthened by Glimcher's nostalgia for the teenage, eager America of the 1950s." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The Mambo Kings is most fun when it practically dares you to swoon. It's a movie you don't have to believe to enjoy." [...] Betty Goodwin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's visual style: [...] "The innocence of the pre-MTV '50s mambo scene is expressed through meticulously real details and honest styling." ...|$|E

Ruel found Carroll to be charming, noting [...] "Pete's like a {{beautiful}} woman. The closer you get, you better look out. He is very charismatic. He <b>can</b> smile and <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like a million dollars." [...] His players at USC included Sam Baker, Winston Justice, Ryan Kalil, Deuce Lutui, Fred Matua, Chilo Rachal, Drew Radovich, Matt Spanos, and Kyle Williams. After Pete Carroll signed with the Seahawks, Ruel was released from USC on January 20, 2010 and joined the Seahawks five months later after Alex Gibbs sudden retirement.|$|R
500|$|The subplot of Homer {{entering}} the childproofing business {{was inspired by}} an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children. In an interview with Star-News, Payne commented: [...] "You hire this person to come into your home to look for changes <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make.</b> They <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like the most horrible {{person in the world}} and that your house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|R
500|$|Rachel Saltz of The New York Times reviewed, [...] "The {{pleasure}} {{principle is}} palpable in the giddy, slick Dhoom 2, a satisfying {{example of the}} new, thoroughly modern Bollywood. It may represent the newfangled Bollywood, but old-fashioned star power is what animates and elevates it above its occasional narrative flaws and longueurs." [...] Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter said, [...] "Dhoom 2 has all {{of the benefits of}} a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences. It makes no lasting contributions to world cinema, but if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse." [...] L.A. Weeklys David Chute stated the film was, [...] "A movie meal as satisfying as this one <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that nothing else matters." [...] Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave it a two-star rating, writing [...] "By roping in acclaimed action director Alan Amin {{to take care of the}} thrills and spills, you'd expect Gadhvi to have spent time crafting out a sophisticated storyline instead of simply sending his cast on a cat-and-mouse chase around the globe. It's only Roshan's charismatic performance as the criminal mastermind, and the sizzling chemistry he shares with Rai's sassy cohort, that rescues this adventure from becoming an elongated tourism commercial." [...] Manish Gajjar, Bollywood Correspondent for BBC Shropshire said, [...] "With its high-powered action sequences matching Hollywood standards, Dhoom 2 is a winner all the way at the box office!" ...|$|E

Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about calling upon the love of that special one when times get tough. For Aguilera, the song [...] "is about that sort of perfect love, which we all dream. This kind of song <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> safe and warm anytime of the year. And there's no one better to turn to for that than my own mother," [...] she claimed. [...] "For a shield, from the storm for a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm, I turn to you/For the {{strength}} to be strong, for the will to carry on/For everything you do, for everything that's true, I turn to you," [...] she sings in the chorus.|$|E

2500|$|Ciara first premiered [...] "Sorry" [...] at {{listening}} {{party for}} [...] in New York, New York on June 6, 2012, with it {{being one of}} the records that was highlighted by listeners. On August 13, 2012, Ciara posted a letter online via Instagram, which featured some of the lyrics from the song, and ended with [...] "Sorry 8/20", and premiered the song's single cover on August 20, 2012. Ciara's label, Epic Records went on to confirm that it would serve as the lead single from One Woman Army on September 10, 2012, with it replacing [...] "Sweat", which had originally been confirmed for the position. In speaking on [...] "Sorry"'s release, Ciara stated that she viewed it and its follow-up [...] "Got Me Good" [...] as the album's dual lead singles, stating [...] "Those two just make a cool marriage. ‘Got Me Good’ is living in the moment of being ‘Got Good’. Like when someone makes you feel real good and no one <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like they feel. So it’s ‘you got me good’, then it’s ‘you had me good’ and then {{it got to the point}} where a ‘Sorry’ was necessary." [...] The single premiered on Vevo, alongside its music video, on September 13, 2012. [...] "Sorry" [...] was released via digital download in North America, Australia, and in select European countries on September 25, 2012, and impacted US Urban contemporary and Rhythmic radio stations on October 9, 2012.

2500|$|Following ALFs conclusion, Clausen was {{unemployed}} {{for seven}} months. Clausen's friend suggested {{him to a}} producer from the Fox animated series The Simpsons who {{were looking for a}} new composer. Clausen [...] "had no interest in doing animation" [...] and [...] "wanted to be a drama composer." [...] However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him [...] "we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, and we would like it scored that way." [...] Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the [...] "emotion [...] scored first and the action scored second", unlike many other cartoons, and that [...] "scoring the emotions of the characters" [...] was the primary aim for The Simpsons. Clausen's first episode was [...] "Treehouse of Horror", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles {{through the end of the}} 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: [...] "The greatest composing challenge has been to try to make some kind of musical sense out of the cues when I have only a few seconds to make a musical statement. We have a joke on the scoring stage that I <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> five ways in thirteen seconds. We say it in jest, but the reality of the situation is that I am required to do just that quite often." [...] Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead [...] " [...] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies." [...] He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode [...] "Cape Feare", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene.|$|E
