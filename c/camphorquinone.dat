These mixtures comprise the monomers and photoinitiators. Other materials constituting the composition of the dental resin composite brands are the different fillers. Many studies have been done to study the effects of the monomers in their pure forms on the cellular viability and mutational effects (Schmalz et al. 1999; Janke et al. 2003; Issa et al. 2004; Theilig et al. 2000; Moharamzadeh et al. 2007; Lai et al. 2004).|$|R
30|$|Upon {{taking the}} spectra of {{different}} pure basic materials (EDMA, EGDMA, TEGDMA, and bis-A) and photoinitiators (<b>camphorquinones),</b> {{it was found}} that the spectra look almost the same as each other. That explains why dental resin composite materials with different combinations of some of these mixtures still look almost the same. It was also noticed that some of these pure material spectra have the same band positions found in the resin composite spectra but with sharper and more intense peaks in the low molecular size pure materials. This could be explained by the fact that dental resin composite surface composition is a polymerized mixture of materials, so the presence of other bands and convolution of the bands are a logical explanation of the wider and convoluted band spectra. Also, the spectra of the pure materials are missing the wide band at 1, 200 to 800 cm- 1, which corresponds to the silica stretch found in the dental resin composites. The silica stretch found in the dental resin composites is due to the presence of the inorganic filler particles.|$|R

To overcome the disadvantages of this method, such as a short working time, light-curing resin composites were introduced in the 1970’s. The first light-curing units used ultra-violet light to set the material, however this method had a limited curing depth and was a high risk to patients and clinicians. Therefore, UV light-curing units were later replaced by visible light-curing systems which used <b>Camphorquinone</b> as a light source and overcame the issues produced by the UV light-curing units.|$|E

Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. The filler gives the composite wear resistance and translucency. A coupling agent such as silane is used to enhance the bond between these two components. An initiator package (such as: <b>camphorquinone</b> (CQ), phenylpropanedione (PPD) or lucirin (TPO)) begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when external energy (light/heat, etc.) is applied.

5000|$|Dental composites, {{also called}} [...] "white fillings", are {{a group of}} {{restorative}} materials used in dentistry. Crowns and in-lays {{can be made in}} the laboratory from dental composites. These materials are similar to those used in direct fillings and are tooth-colored. Their strength and durability is not as high as porcelain or metal restorations and they are more prone to wear and discolouration. As with other composite materials, a dental composite typically consists of a resin-based matrix, which contains a modified methacrylate or acrylate. Two examples of such commonly used monomers include bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (BISMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA), together with tri-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGMA). TEGMA is a comonomer which can be used to control viscosity, as Bis GMA is a big molecule with high viscosity, for easier clinical handling. Inorganic filler such as silica, quartz or glasses, are added to reduce polymerization shrinkage by occupying volume and to confirm radio-opacity of products due to translucency in property, which can be helpful in diagnosis of dental caries around dental restoration. The filler particles give the composites wear resistance as well. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. A coupling agent such as silane is used to enhance the bond between resin matrix and filler particles. An initiator package begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when external energy (light/heat, etc.) is applied. For example, <b>camphorquinone</b> can be excited by visible blue light with critical wavelength of 460-480 nm to yield necessary free radicals to start the process.|$|E

Results for <b>camphorquinone</b> show a strong temperature dependence, with diffusion coefficients changing as much as two orders of magnitude between 25 and 50 degrees C, and showing high activation energies for diffusion approximate to 125 kJ mol(- 1). No sharp change in the activation energy for diffusion was observed as the glass transition is crossed. The pre-exponential factor for the diffusion coefficient decreased dramatically through the glass transition. The diffusion coefficients of small penetrants in glassy polymers appear strongly dependent on the molecular size. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Experimental and theoretical investigations are undertaken to understand the observed differences induced by the addition of a tertiary amine co-initiator species. Indeed, it is shown experimentally that in the presence of a co-initiator, when the maximum of monomer conversion is reached, the concentration of <b>camphorquinone</b> starts to decrease, whereas a new compound that absorbs at 390 nm is produced. It is proposed here on the basis of theoretical calculations that this species is the charge transfer complex [CQc /aminec+], which is stabilized in high viscous media.

Materials and Methods Three light-polymerized resin composites (Z 100 (3 M ESPE), Tetric Ceram (Ivoclar Vivadent) and Aelite LS Posterior (Bisco)) with different photoinitiator systems were used. The resin composites were packed into a Teflon mold (8 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness) on a cover glass. After packing the composites, they were light cured with single-peak and dual-peak LEDs. The Knoop microhardness (KHN) and color difference (ΔE) for 30 days were measured. The data was analyzed statistically using a student's t-test (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Free-radical/cationic hybrid photopolymerizations of {{acrylates}} and epoxides {{were initiated}} using a three-component initiator system comprised of <b>camphorquinone</b> as the photosensitizer, an amine as the electron donor, and a diaryliodonium salt. Thermodynamic considerations {{revealed that the}} oxidation potential of the electron donor must be less than 1. 34 V relative to SCE for electron transfer with the photoexcited <b>camphorquinone</b> to take place. This electron transfer leads {{to the production of}} the active centers for the hybrid polymerization (two radicals and a cation). Further investigation revealed that only a subset of electron donors that meet the oxidation potential requirement resulted in polymerization of the epoxide monomer; therefore, a second requirement for the electron donor (pK(b) higher than 8) was established. Experiments performed using a combination of electron donors revealed that the onset of the hybrid system 2 ̆ 7 s cationic polymerization can be advanced or delayed by controlling the concentration and composition of the electron donor(s). These studies demonstrate that a single three-component initiator system can be used to initiate and chemically control the sequential curing properties of a free-radical/cationic hybrid photopolymerization and is a viable alternative to separate photoinitiators for each type of polymerization.

A narrow (Smartlite, Dentisply) and a broad spectrum (Bluephase G 2, Ivoclar Vivadent) LEDs were used for photo-activation (20 J/cm(2)). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to {{evaluate the}} cure efficiency for each composite, and CIELab parameters to evaluated color stability (Delta E- 00) after aging. The UV-vis absorption spectrophotometric analysis of each photoinitiator and reducing agent was determined. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons (alpha = 0. 05). Results: Higher cure efficiency was found for type-I photoinitiators photo-activated with a broad spectrum light, and for CQ-systems with a narrow band spectrum light, except when combined with an aliphatic amine (DMAEMA). Also, when combined with aromatic amines (EDMAB and DMPOH), similar cure efficiency with both wavelength LEDs was found. TPO had no cure efficiency when light-cured exclusively with a blue narrowband spectrum. CQ-systems presented higher color stability than type-I photoinitiators, especially when combined with DMPOH. Conclusions: After aging, CQ-based composites became more yellow and BAPO and TPO lighter and less yellow. However, CQ-systems presented higher color stability than type-I photoinitiators, as BAPO-and TPO-, despite their higher cure efficiency when photo-activated with corresponding wavelength range.

40|$|International audienceAminothiazonaphthalimide {{derivatives}} (ATNDs) {{can act as}} photoinitiators (when {{combined with}} iodonium salt, amine, 2, 4, 6 -tris(trichloromethyl) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine or N-vinylcarbazole) to start the ring-opening cationic polymerization of epoxides or the radical polymerization of acrylates upon exposure to visible LEDs (405 nm or 455 nm) or a polychromatic visible light delivered by a halogen lamp. The photoinitiating ability {{of some of these}} systems is even better than that of the well-known <b>camphorquinone</b> based systems and the commercial bisacylphosphine oxide type I photoinitiator, unambiguously showing their outstanding performance. The structure/reactivity relationships as well as the particular role played by the position of the aminothiazo-substituent in the ATNDs is revealed by mechanistic studies using steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, fluorescence, laser flash photolysis, and electron spin resonance spin trapping technique...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNovel {{naphthalene}} derivatives {{have been}} designed to be used as versatile photoinitiators upon a laser diode (405 nm), a polychromatic halogen lamp, or an UV LED (385 nm) exposure. The reactive species produced from photoinitiating systems based on one particular naphthalene derivative (NA 3) and an iodonium salt, N-vinylcarbazole, an amine or 2, 4, 6 - tris(trichloromethyl) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine were particularly efficient for cationic, radical, IPN and thiol−ene photopolymerizations upon low light intensity exposure. The best proposed systems exhibit a higher efficiency than references systems for visible lights (i. e., <b>camphorquinone</b> CQ-based photoinitiating systems). The mechanisms for the photochemical generation of reactive species (i. e., radicals and cations) were studied by electron spin resonance spin-trapping, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, and steady state photolysis technique...|$|E
