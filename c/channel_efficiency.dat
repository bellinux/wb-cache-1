50|$|For example, {{the maximum}} frame size in Ethernet is 1526 bytes: up to 1500 bytes for the payload, eight bytes for the preamble, 14 bytes for the header, and four bytes for the trailer.

This {{corresponds to a}} maximum channel utilization of 1526 / (1526 + 12) × 100% = 99.22%, or a maximum channel use of 99.22 Mbit/s inclusive of Ethernet datalink layer protocol overhead in a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet connection.

50|$|Protocol {{spoofing}} addresses {{this problem}} by having the local modem generate a false ACK message {{as soon as the}} packet is completely sent to the modem.

This allows the packets to be sent continually, greatly improving <b>channel</b> <b>efficiency.</b> However, this also requires the link between the two systems to be error free, as the modem has already ACKed the packets even before they have been sent. This was normally addressed by using a modem-level error correction protocol, like Microcom Networking Protocols.|$|E

50|$|Channel {{utilization}} {{is instead}} a term {{related to the}} use of the channel disregarding the throughput. It counts not only with the data bits but also with the overhead that makes use of the channel. The transmission overhead consists of preamble sequences, frame headers and acknowledge packets. The definitions assume a noiseless channel. Otherwise, the throughput would not be only associated to the nature (efficiency) of the protocol but also to retransmissions resultant from quality of the channel. In a simplistic approach, <b>channel</b> <b>efficiency</b> can be equal to channel utilization assuming that acknowledge packets are zero-length and that the communications provider will not see any bandwidth relative to retransmissions or headers.

The spacecraft received the uplink carrier at 401.8 MHz and converted it to a 378.2 MHz signal using a 16/17 coherent oscillator circuit. The telemetry system phase modulated a 512 Hz subcarrier, which was in turn amplitude modulated at 64, 8, or 1bit/s. The spacecraft was unable to aim its antennas, and so had no high-gain dish antenna common on later spacecraft. Instead, the system could introduce a 150W amplifier into its normally 5W transmitter circuit. It was powered by a battery of 28 F-size NiCd cells recharged by the solar paddles, allowing up to eight minutes of high power communications before risking damage to the batteries.
