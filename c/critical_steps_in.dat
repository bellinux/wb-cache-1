2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2014, New York Representative Carolyn B. Maloney visited the Chengdu Panda Base in Sichuan, China and {{announced}} her plan to bring giant pandas to New York City. Initially, she aimed to exhibit them at the Central Park Zoo, though switched her attention to Bronx after deciding the 6.5-acre zoo didn't {{have the resources to}} care for the animals. Maloney and her supporters, which include Maurice R. Greenberg, Newt Gingrich, and John A. Catsimatidis, have been met with many obstacles throughout their campaign. Initially, the largest issues were the lack of support from Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Hall, and Chinese officials insisting that no more pandas be brought to the United States. However, in October 2015, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai announced that China was willing to enter preliminary talks with New York over the matter, and soon after de Blasio and City Hall signed a letter appealing to Chinese officials, which was drafted by Maloney in 2014. Despite her efforts, Maloney's campaign still has yet to overcome two <b>critical</b> <b>steps</b> <b>in</b> acquiring pandas: funding and the zoo's consent. Both de Blasio and the Wildlife Conservation Society refuse to fund the project, not wanting taxpayer or vital zoo money to go towards the highly expensive project. David Towne, chairman of the American-based Giant Panda Conservation Foundation, estimated that the cost of bringing pandas to NYC would be around $50-million. The foundation has also said that the cost of keeping just one animal is about $1-million a year, including food, trainers, and habitat upkeep. Additionally, China loans out their pandas for a hefty fee. A study published by the Washington Post in 2005 found that the four U.S. zoos holding pandas (Memphis Zoo, San Diego Zoo, Smithsonian National Zoological Park, and Zoo Atlanta) had spent $33-million more on the animals than revenue made off of them between 2000 and 2003. Despite the figures, Maloney believes pandas in NYC will do better since the city has a higher population than those four cities combined, and received a record-breaking 56.4-million visitors in 2014. Still, the WCS continues to steer away from the aspect of bringing in pandas. In 2014, a senior official from the WCS said Maloney's campaign had reached [...] "a new level of absurdity" [...] when it was announced she intended to bring a Chinese delegation to the Central Park Zoo and, in November 2015, Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President and Bronx Zoo Director, released a statement saying: ...|$|E

5000|$|Glycoside {{hydrolase}} family 79 includes endo-beta-N-glucuronidase [...] and heparanase (CAZY GH_79). Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a {{key role}} in the self- assembly, insolubility and barrier properties of basement membranes and extracellular matrices. Hence, cleavage of heparan sulphate (HS) affects the integrity and functional state of tissues and thereby fundamental normal and pathological phenomena involving cell migration and response to changes in the extracellular microenvironment. Heparanase degrades HS at specific intrachain sites. The enzyme is synthesized as a latent approximately 65 kDa protein that is processed at the N-terminus into a highly active approximately 50 kDa form. Experimental evidence suggests that heparanase may facilitate both tumour cell invasion and neovascularisation, both <b>critical</b> <b>steps</b> <b>in</b> cancer progression. The enzyme is also involved in cell migration associated with inflammation and autoimmunity.|$|E

Issues like weighing accuracy, dust control (LAF booths, glove boxes), during manual handling, lot control of each ingredient, material movement into and out of dispensary should be considered during dispensing.|$|E

The purpose of the review was to ensure that complete and thorough technical checks were carried out and that all non-essential personnel were clear during the start-up operation. Once completed, the PSSR would be signed off by refinery operations and safety managers, authorising the start-up work but this essential safety procedure was not completed. In addition, {{there were a number of}} serious issues with items of safety critical equipment which had not been resolved prior to the start-up commencing including an inoperative pressure control valve (PV-5002), a defective high level alarm in the splitter tower (LSH-5102), a defective sight glass used to indicate fluid levels at the base of the splitter tower and the vital splitter tower level transmitter had not been calibrated.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} <b>critical</b> <b>steps</b> <b>in</b> the SELEX {{procedure}} is obtaining single stranded DNA (ssDNA) after the PCR amplification step. This will serve as input for the next cycle so it is of vital importance that all the DNA is single stranded and {{as little as possible}} is lost. Because of the relative simplicity, one {{of the most}} used methods is using biotinylated reverse primers in the amplification step, after which the complementary strands can be bound to a resin followed by elution of the other strand with lye. Another method is asymmetric PCR, where the amplification step is performed with an excess of forward primer and very little reverse primer, which leads to the production of more of the desired strand. A drawback of this method is that the product should be purified from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other left-over material from the PCR reaction. Enzymatic degradation of the unwanted strand can be performed by tagging this strand using a phosphate-probed primer, as it is recognized by enzymes such as Lambda exonuclease. These enzymes then selectively degrade the phosphate tagged strand leaving the complementary strand intact. All of these methods recover approximately 50 to 70% of the DNA. For a detailed comparison refer to the article by Svobodová et al. where these, and other, methods are experimentally compared.|$|E

In this report, we show that neuregulin–erbB receptor signaling plays {{a crucial role in the}} {{migration of}} cerebellar granule cells along radial glial fibers. Granule cells express neuregulin (NRG), and radial glia cells express erbB 4 in the developing cerebellum and in vitro. When the glial erbB receptors are blocked, neurons fail to induce radial glia formation, and their migration along radial glial fibers is impaired. Moreover, soluble NRG is as effective as neuron–glia contact in the induction of radial glia formation. These results suggest that the activation of glial erbB 4 by NRG is an early <b>critical</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the neuronal migration program...|$|R
