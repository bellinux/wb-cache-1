5|$|Flyers {{distributed}} to recruit participants said {{the attack was}} to begin at 8pmAEST on 10 February. On that day, government websites were targeted by denial-of-service attacks. The Communications Department said the hackers had not infiltrated government security, but had instead swamped government <b>computer</b> <b>servers.</b> Sites were left unavailable for sporadic periods throughout the attack. At one point, the Australian Parliament's website was offline for about two days due to the high volume of requests. Rudd's government site was also inaccessible for some time. As a primary target, the Communications Department also received {{a large amount of}} traffic. Government offices were also flooded with e-mail spam, junk faxes, and prank phone calls. The Prime Minister's homepage was vandalized with pornographic images. The flyer released before the attack called for the faxes to focus on cartoon pornography, female ejaculation, and small-breasted pornography.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT upgrades include software and hardware such as new <b>computer</b> <b>servers,</b> modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital workstations for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, data, and information in-flight between B-52s and ground command and control centers, allowing the transmission and reception of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous in-flight target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows machine-to-machine transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT upgrades will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. Funding has been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT upgrades per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E

2500|$|In a September 2015 {{interview}} with Michael Isikoff, Fiorina said that, {{in the weeks}} following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, she {{received a phone call}} from Michael Hayden, then the director of the National Security Agency, asking her assistance in providing HP <b>computer</b> <b>servers</b> to the NSA for expanded surveillance. Hayden confirmed that he had made the request for HP servers as part of Stellar Wind, a 2001–2007 NSA warrantless surveillance program, but the details were not revealed to Fiorina at the time. Fiorina [...] "acknowledged she complied with Hayden's request, redirecting trucks of HP <b>computer</b> <b>servers</b> that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in Tennessee to the Washington Beltway, where they were escorted by NSA security" [...] to the agency's Fort Meade headquarters. In 2015, Fiorina said: [...] "I felt it was my duty to help, and so we did," [...] adding, [...] "They were ramping up a whole set of programs and needed a lot of data crunching capability to try and monitor a whole set of threats. ... What I knew at the time was our nation had been attacked." [...] Hayden also requested that Fiorina provide advice to the agency [...] "on how the CIA could maintain its undercover espionage mission in a culture of increasing government leaks and demands for greater public accountability and openness." [...] According to Fiorina, she advised the agency to be [...] "as transparent as possible, about as much as possible".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, the New Jersey Legislature {{passed a}} bill {{sponsored}} by Raymond Lesniak to allow online gambling by New Jersey residents {{over the age of}} 21. Because the state constitution only allows casino gambling in Atlantic City, the legislation specified that the <b>computer</b> <b>servers</b> operating the online gambling websites must be located at licensed casinos in Atlantic City. The Lesniak bill evaded possible federal prohibitions against online gambling by authorizing the Casino Control Commission to create regulations to ensure that the bets were placed from inside New Jersey. However, Governor Chris Christie vetoed the legislation because of concerns that [...] "allowing customers to bet through any computer terminal left open the chance of commercial businesses such as nightclubs and cafes becoming gambling hubs around the state", and [...] "the bill further created a legal fiction that a bet placed anywhere in New Jersey counted as an Atlantic City bet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics of the theory's {{extension}} to computer networks also note greater theoretical {{problems with the}} applicability of a real property theory to intellectual property. In order to explain why real property theories might extend to the Internet, proponents equate [...] "cyberspace" [...] with real land, arguing that owners of <b>computer</b> <b>servers</b> {{should have the same}} right of inviolability as owners of land receive to promote greater efficiency in transactions. However, even if some aspects of cyberspace resemble real space, detractors contend that cyberspace is not like real land at all because [...] "the 'placeness' of cyberspace is a matter of ongoing social construction." [...] Furthermore, even if granting property rights might help to avoid problems of inefficiency and under-cultivation in the context of real property, critics note that nothing suggests that the same principles would also be effective in the context of computer networks—especially because the problem of under-cultivation does not tend to occur online.|$|E

With the simulation having served its purpose, the <b>computer</b> <b>servers</b> are shutting down, and Elohim wants Uriel to help these other AIs prepare for [...] "ascension": uploading their knowledge and memories into the main plot's protagonist. As Uriel explores this realm, the robot finds that many of the other AIs have created their own ideas about what humanity might have been from the records, and have various attitudes from doubt to acceptance for Uriel's intentions and the pending ascension. Uriel can observe the communication of the AIs through their makeshift message board, where they discuss the nature of Gehenna, as well as their understanding of humanity, which some of them try to express through prose and interactive fiction.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 August 2010, {{two hours}} before the {{transfer}} window closed, Tottenham Hotspur made an offer of £8million for Van der Vaart. According to Spurs manager Harry Redknapp, an £18million transfer to Bayern Munich had collapsed the day before and Van der Vaart had suddenly become much cheaper, although such a price reduction was later denied by Real Madrid. Due to problems with <b>computer</b> <b>servers</b> used in the transaction between Tottenham and Real Madrid, preventing the necessary paperwork from being completed, Spurs requested special dispensation from the Premier League to allow the transfer to proceed. The Premier League confirmed on 1 September that the transfer had been permitted after they gave Tottenham special dispensation due to [...] "technical problems". He signed a four-year contract at White Hart Lane. It was announced that Van der Vaart would wear the number 11 shirt for Spurs.

30|$|To use cloud <b>computer</b> <b>server</b> facility, {{it is much}} faster, more {{reliable}} solution than private client-server model (c/s). This is the biggest factor to use cloud <b>computer</b> <b>server</b> and run SaaS today [4]. SaaS is also involving PaaS and IaaS. But there are several issues to achieving these requirements, scalable, configurable, multi-tenant-efficient SaaS model. To meet these requirements, SaaS infrastructure is required to have scale-out architecture with data interoperable function without any data contamination. It also needs short latency of time service because Web service is online and follows the remote client-server model. If service response time does not meet these timeliness requirements, users will not use SaaS application services again.|$|R
