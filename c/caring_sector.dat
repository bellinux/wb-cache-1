40|$|In {{this paper}} we use British Household Panel Survey data {{to examine the}} {{relationship}} between unionization and unpaid overtime in Britain. The findings indicate that in the for-profit, non-caring sector of the economy, union covered employees supply fewer unpaid overtime hours than noncovered ones due to union protection and the weakening of economic incentives caused by union bargaining. On the other hand, in the non-profit, <b>caring</b> <b>sector,</b> union members offer more unpaid extra hours than covered non-members because of their specific pro-social motivations. Additional evidence is presented that confirms that union members are actually characterized by a specific pro-social ethos. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse how the broad context of nursing {{practice}} plays a stimulating and/or a restricting role in the process of ethical caring. Three areas of special attention are noted. First, on the societal level, some developments that influence the state of affairs in the <b>caring</b> <b>sector</b> are indicated. Secondly, concerning the nursing and medical professions, an interprofessional dialogue based on specific competence is outlined. Thirdly, there is a discussion of how health care institutions can evolve from a business undertaking to a pedagogic-moral area where nurses can learn the moral attitudes that are essential to achieve 'good care'status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Trade {{unions have}} {{traditionally}} focused on working time aspects and have campaigned extensively against long working hours in Britain. An {{aspect of this}} long working hours “culture ” is the phenomenon of unpaid overtime, which has increased in extent and importance in Britain and other industrialized countries during the last decades. This paper examines the relationship between unionization and unpaid overtime in Britain. We suggest {{that the impact of}} union status on the amount of unpaid overtime will depend {{on the nature of the}} firm and the sector in which it operates. Analysis of the first seventeen waves of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) confirms these hypotheses. In the for-profit, non-caring sector of the economy, being covered by a trade union in the workplace leads to less unpaid overtime, probably because unions protect employees from employer coercion and negotiate standardized reward and promotion procedures which provide no long-term incentives to work extra hours. On the other hand, in the non-profit, <b>caring</b> <b>sector,</b> union members work more unpaid overtime than covered non-members. Evidence is presented in favour of a specific pro-social ethos of union members: being a union member is associated with a higher probability of belonging to any other social or interest group organization in Britain. It appears the pro-social attitudes of union members lead them to donate extra working time in the non-profit, <b>caring</b> <b>sector,</b> while union coverage has no effect. The above results are important for two different reasons. First, they enhance our understanding of what unions do in the contemporary British labour market, contributing to the broad literature of union effects on various aspects of the employment relationship. Second, they can form the basis of further research on the overall attitudes and beliefs of union members, something that has been ignored in the economic analysis of the union membership decision.

40|$|In {{the current}} context of deep {{recession}} since 2008, acute Eurozone crisis since 2009 and fragile recovery as of 2013, managing effectively labour migration is crucial {{and at the}} same time it may seem a balancing act between opposed concerns: why would we need immigration if domestic unemployment is high? Why don’t we encourage more intra-EU mobility to deal with differences in member state labour markets and further restrict immigration from third countries? This policy paper argues that there are some labour market sectors where ethnicisation (these are “migrant” jobs) persists and resists the crisis effects: natives do not want to take jobs in cleaning and caring even if they are unemployed. Moreover, to be unemployed does not make someone skilled for working in the cleaning and <b>caring</b> <b>sector.</b> Such sectors have been so far outside the scope of EU policy initiatives for managing labour migration and there is a gap there that needs to be addressed. We propose here an EU level sectorial approach, particularly looking at the domestic work sector...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{initiatives}} {{have been taken}} to attract more men into caring occupations. However, there has been much less focus on retaining these new male workers. This article builds on qualitative interviews with 11 Danish men who after working in the <b>caring</b> <b>sector</b> decided to leave for other occupations. A factor often presented as influential for the men’s exit concerns the social working environment. In the interviews, the men discuss the pressure to assimilate to the existing and established female-dominated culture. They feel excluded and socially isolated. Several of them have been directly criticized or disqualified as not being “real” men by their female colleagues. As a result of a growing bureaucratic demand for control and registration of work procedures, several men feel {{that they do not have}} adequate resources and time to provide the level of care that is needed. They become disillusioned and frustrated and choose to seek employment elsewhere. Some men cannot come to terms with close physical contact and “smells,” for example, changing diapers on infants or bathing old people. They cannot handle the thought of having their intentions misinterpreted, for example, when playing and being physical with children, and being potentially seen as sexually abhorrent. Finally, some men never intended to remain permanently in caring occupations. Their exit is driven by an ambition to pursue a career in another field or at what they view as a more challenging career level...|$|E
30|$|Another {{limitation}} {{already mentioned}} above is that, {{with the data}} at hand, {{it is not possible}} to fully assess whether the results are due to the fact that selection of prosocially motivated individuals into public sector jobs does not take place or whether selection is active at the recruitment stage, but prosocial motivation dissipates over time and thus is no longer present at later stages of the career. Our analysis of heterogeneity along the tenure dimension suggests that this may not be the case, but, as mentioned in Section 5.3, there are some limitations to this analysis. So, potentially, this could explain the difference between our results and the ones discussed in the literature review, where a significant difference between the two sectors is usually found. Other explanations could be related to the fact that most of these studies do not control for occupation, a variable we have shown in Section 4.2 to be important in explaining differences in prosocial motivation across sectors. In addition, some of these studies only consider a subgroup of workers (workers in the <b>caring</b> <b>sector</b> in Gregg et al. 2011; teachers in Dohmen and Falk 2010) or find a difference only for a subset of the population, as in Dur and Zoutenbier (2014), where altruism needs to be combined with confidence in political parties to increase the likelihood of working in the public sector. Likewise, in our analysis, when we split the public sector into its main components in Section 5.1, we find that public sector former workers in education are more prosocial than comparable workers both in the public and the private sector. Moreover, as reported in the country-specific analysis in Section 5.5, the difference in prosociality persists in some countries even after adding controls.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Medical errors {{can result}} in the devastating {{consequences}} of life-long suffering for the individual patient. Studies have also shown that the fear of making mistakes, {{as well as the}} fear and threat of being reported, contribute to the psychological pressure experienced by personnel in the health <b>care</b> <b>sector.</b> Therefore, improving safety is vital from the work environment perspective. There are many indicators showing that risks in the health <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> are increasing, despite the fact that fewer reports are being sent to the monitoring authorities. This study attempts to analyze whether the methods of risk management used by civil aviation have any relevance to the health <b>care</b> <b>sector.</b> A comparison shows that the health <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> lacks an organization on both the local and national levels that specifically deals with safety-related matters. The system of risk reporting and management used in civil aviation can provide valuable insight in designing a similar system within the health <b>care</b> <b>sector.</b> Requirements for periodic proficiency testing and regulation of the length of work shifts are other areas in which aviation can {{serve as a model for}} improving safety in health care. The study shows that the safety-related efforts made in civil aviation are in many cases highly relevant to the health <b>care</b> <b>sector,</b> even in relation to the formulation of legislation...|$|R

30|$|The <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in the German economy. It employs 760, 577 workers who are subject to social {{insurance}} contribution. Within the last years, the sector has increased continually leading to a growing demand for qualified carers for the elderly. It is the only industry in the health sector with a minimum wage, according to the Posted Workers Act (AEntG). Due to the different organisational institutions in the <b>care</b> <b>sector,</b> there is no representative collective agreement, which according to §  7 AentG is a necessary condition for a sectorial minimum wage. Therefore, a separate section was added to the AEntG in 2009 enabling for the introduction of a minimum wage specifically for the <b>care</b> <b>sector.</b> According to this section, a commission of eight representatives of employers and employees in the <b>care</b> <b>sector</b> set a minimum wage.|$|R
