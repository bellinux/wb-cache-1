5|$|On May 24, Judge Singleterry heard {{arguments}} from the plaintiff {{and the defense}} on the request for the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue.</b> On June 7, he denied {{a request for a}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> after considering that the defendant failed to prove that there was prejudice against him in the Hidalgo community. On July 19, Feit appeared in court for a prehearing. The trial was expected to place on September 11. However, on September 10, the court decided to push the trial due to scheduling conflicts with one of the attorneys and because of delays in another high-profile case in the Hidalgo County. Feit appeared in court on September 11 – for the first time without prison uniform – expecting to face trial that week. The initial phase of jury selection was done in mid-September; the trial was pushed for mid-October.|$|E
5|$|Between 1973 and 1977, in New York and New Jersey, Shakur {{was indicted}} ten times, {{resulting}} in seven different criminal trials. Shakur {{was charged with}} two bank robberies, the kidnapping of a Brooklyn heroin dealer, the attempted murder of two Queens police officers stemming from a January 23, 1973 failed ambush, and eight other felonies related to the Turnpike shootout. Of these trials, three resulted in acquittals, one in a hung jury, one in a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue,</b> one in a mistrial due to pregnancy, and one in a conviction; three indictments were dismissed without trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue.</b> He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the heated}} {{political}} {{environment of the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, allies of his father claimed that the governor's political enemies had framed his son. The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> for the trial, and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case. Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, {{the judge in the}} case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors saved his life, reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. Shortly after the suicide attempt, Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son.|$|E
50|$|The fourth annual Damnation Festival {{was held}} on 22 November 2008 and saw the festival move to another new <b>venue</b> at University <b>of</b> Leeds, Leeds, England. The <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venues</b> allowed the festival to expand to three stages {{incorporating}} seventeen bands with headliners Carcass, Cathedral and Pitchshifter. Tickets for the festival were priced at £29.|$|R
40|$|Courts are {{becoming}} increasingly receptive to the admission {{of the results of}} public opinion polls to show community attitudes and prejudgments as to certain criminal cases in which continuances or <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> are sought by the defendants. Mr. Sherman concludes that polls may provide a degree of evidentiary certainty now lacking, but he warns that polls can also be tricky unless properly conducted and interpreted...|$|R
25|$|The <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> and {{leadership}} {{resulted in a}} constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, {{even though it had}} been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school, and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of his father to secure a {{favorable}} venue, judge, and defense team, on January 31, 1825, the jury convicted Isaac Desha of murder and sentenced him to hang. Rowan immediately requested a new trial upon grounds of jury interference, and Shannon granted the request on February 10. Jury selection proved problematic, occupying at least parts of four terms of the Harrison County Circuit Court. In September 1825, a jury was finally empaneled. The judge, Harry O. Brown, had been temporarily appointed to his position by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. Desha was again found guilty, and sentenced to hang on July 14, 1826. Judge Brown overturned the verdict because the prosecution had not proven that the murder took place in Fleming County, as alleged in the indictment against Desha. The state argued that this was of no consequence, since a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> had already been granted, but the judge's ruling stood, and Governor Desha's reputation took a further hit.|$|E
5|$|Governor Desha's {{reputation}} was further tarnished {{because of a}} pardon issued to his son. On November 2, 1824, Isaac B. Desha had brutally murdered Francis Baker, a Mississippian who was visiting Kentucky. On November 24, 1824, John Rowan, one of the governor's allies in the General Assembly, introduced legislation ordering the Fleming County Circuit Court to convene a special session on January 17, 1825, for Isaac Desha's trial and providing that the accused should {{have the option to}} request a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> to Harrison County at that time. Miles from the scene of the murder, Harrison County was the governor's home county, and he possessed a great deal of influence with officials there. Governor Desha appeared before the legislative committee considering the bill on November 26 and asked that they report it favorably to the full legislature. This was done, and the bill was approved on December 4, 1824.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the confirmation of charges hearings in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the hearings in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding the hearings in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the hearings in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|E

Attorney Lewis attempted {{to obtain a}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> so that the defendants might be tried in a more neutral setting than the superheated environment of Yuba County. In addition to pervasive bias against the IWW in the local community, Lewis noted that {{the judge in the}} case, E.P. McDaniel, was a personal friend of the dead district attorney. The request for the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> was denied and Governor Johnson likewise declined to appoint a new judge in the case.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{investigation}} of the FBI, Hale, his Burkhart nephews, and one of the ranch hands they hired were charged with the murder of Mollie's family. Hale was formally charged with the murder of Henry Roan, who had been killed on the Osage Reservation land, making it a Federal crime. Two of his accomplices had died before the FBI investigation was completed. Hale and his associates were finally convicted in state and federal trials from 1926 to 1929, which had <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>venues,</b> hung juries, appeals and overturned verdicts. In 1926, Ernest George Burkhart pleaded guilty to being part of the conspiracy.|$|R
