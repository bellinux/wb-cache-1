The {{objectives of the}} study were to measure the impact strength of maxillary <b>complete</b> <b>dentures</b> fabricated with high impact acrylic resin and to evaluate the effect of woven E-glass fiber and silane treated glass fiber reinforcement on the impact strength of the Maxillary <b>complete</b> <b>dentures.</b> Methods:One commercially available heat cured acrylic resin (Trevalon HI) was selected.

The mean impact strength of dentures reinforced with preimpregnated woven E-glass fibers was 165. 91 +/- 12. 929 J at crack initiation, and 187. 06 +/- 17. 972 J at complete fracture.

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Background: Most edentulous {{patients}} have expectations regarding <b>complete</b> <b>dentures</b> {{that are not}} only dependant on past experiences but also the information they received from others. These expectations may impact {{on the level of}} satisfaction the patient would have when receiving their <b>complete</b> <b>dentures.</b> When determining levels of satisfaction, factors such as comfort, speech, aesthetics, mastication, retention, fit / stability and occurrence of pain should be assessed. The dental student should be able to clinically apply theoretical knowledge to provide the patient with a stable and retentive denture that fulfils their expectations on function and aesthetics. Not much has been written regarding this link between patients' expectations and satisfaction with <b>complete</b> <b>dentures</b> at the University of the Western Cape, thus it warranted further investigation. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether patients' expectations influence their satisfaction with new <b>complete</b> <b>dentures</b> constructed by undergraduate dental students. Objectives:- 1. To determine the expectations of the edentulous patients prior to receiving new <b>complete</b> <b>dentures.</b> 2. To determine if patients’ expectations influences satisfaction with new <b>complete</b> <b>dentures.</b> 3. To investigate the influence of socio-demographic factors on patients' satisfaction wearing <b>complete</b> <b>dentures.</b> 4. To determine if the level of experience of the undergraduate student influences patient satisfaction. Methodology: This was an observational study using two questionnaires for data collection namely the Patient Expectation Questionnaire and the Oral Health Impact Profile- 20. Socio-demographic data was collected as part of the first questionnaire. Each participant was given an individual case number that corresponded on both questionnaires. This facilitated correlation between the expectations and satisfaction results of individual patients. Results: The age range for the majority of the patients was between 56 - 65 years. Females made up 72 % of the sample with 85 % of the sample of coloured ethnicity. Statistical analysis included reliability testing of the Patient Expectation Questionnaire and the Cronbach's Alpha of. 773 was recorded, which indicates good reliability. Results following analysis of the Oral Health Impact Profile- 20 showed high levels of satisfaction in most domains. The correlation between patients' expectations and satisfaction with new <b>complete</b> <b>dentures</b> was not proven using Pearson correlation. However, the comparison between the expectations questionnaire and Oral Health Impact Profile- 20 frequency distribution showed positive results and most expectations of the patient were met or even exceeded for certain domains. Conclusion: Once analysis of both questionnaires was completed high levels of expectations were recorded and these expectations were met in most domains. Even though the statistical relationship between patient expectations and satisfaction was not proven, analysis of the questionnaires yielded positive results. No association was found between pre-treatment expectation and patient satisfaction with <b>complete</b> <b>dentures.</b> Some socio-demographic factors influenced patient satisfaction with <b>complete</b> <b>dentures.</b> High levels of patient satisfaction were recorded regardless of the clinical experience of the undergraduate dental student...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to this resorption of bone in the vertical and anterioposterior dimensions, the alveolus also resorbs faciolingually, thus diminishing {{the width of the}} ridge. [...] What initially began as a sort of tall, broad, bell curve-shaped ridge (in the faciolingual dimension) eventually becomes a short, narrow, stumpy sort of what doesn't even appear to be a ridge. [...] Resorption is exacerbated by pressure on the bone; thus, long-term <b>complete</b> <b>denture</b> wearers will experience more drastic reductions to their ridges that non-denture wearers.

2500|$|Support is the {{principle}} that describes how well the underlying mucosa (oral tissues, including gums) keeps the denture from moving vertically towards the arch in question during chewing, and thus being excessively depressed and moving deeper into the arch. [...] For the mandibular arch, this function is provided primarily by the buccal shelf, a region extending laterally from the back or posterior ridges, and by the pear-shaped pad (the most posterior area of keratinized gingival formed by the scaling down of the retro-molar papilla after the extraction of the last molar tooth). Secondary support for the complete mandibular denture {{is provided by the}} alveolar ridge crest. The maxillary arch receives primary support from the horizontal hard palate and the posterior alveolar ridge crest. [...] The larger the denture flanges (that part of the denture that extends into the vestibule), the better the stability (another parameter to assess fit of a <b>complete</b> <b>denture).</b> [...] Long flanges beyond the functional depth of the sulcus are a common error in denture construction, often (but not always) leading to movement in function, and ulcerations (denture sore spots).|$|E
2500|$|Problems with {{dentures}} {{may arise}} because patients {{are not used}} to having something in their mouth that is not food. The brain senses the appliance and interprets it as 'food', sending messages to the salivary glands to produce more saliva and to secrete it at a higher rate. This usually only happens in the first 12 to 24 hours, after which the salivary glands return to their normal output. [...] New dentures can also be the cause of sore spots as they compress the denture-bearing soft tissues (mucosa). [...] A few denture adjustments in the days following insertion of the dentures can take care of this problem. [...] is another problem encountered by a minority of patients. [...] At times, {{this may be due to}} a denture that is too loose, too thick or extended too far posteriorly onto the soft palate. [...] At times, gagging may also be attributed to psychological denial of the denture. Psychological gagging is the most difficult to treat since it is out of the dentist's control. [...] In such cases, an implant-supported palateless denture may have to be constructed. Sometimes there could be a gingivitis infection under the completed dentures, caused by the accumulation of dental plaque. One of the most common problems for wearers of new upper <b>complete</b> <b>denture</b> is a loss of taste sensations.|$|E

Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty (59 men and 61 women) geriatric patients admitted to a convalescent and rehabilitation hospital were recruited. Three biochemical and hematologic parameters (albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte count) were used for analysis. Malnutrition was defined as Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18. 5 and albumin level under 35 g/L. The number of natural or prosthetic teeth in the dentate patients, {{and the presence of}} one or both dentures in the edentate patients, were recorded. Risk factors associated with malnutrition were investigated, namely: (1) edentulism among all patients, (2) edentulism without a set of <b>complete</b> <b>dentures</b> among all patients, (3) edentulism without a set of <b>complete</b> <b>dentures</b> among the edentate patients, (4) decreased number (. 05).
