2500|$|The Alexander Chaplin & Co. distilling {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} initially {{for use on}} board steam vessels where it could be supplied with steam from either the main boiler or a donkey boiler with cooling water circulation from a pump driven from the main engine or an auxiliary. The subsequent addition of a steam powered <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> integral with the apparatus meant it could then {{also be used as}} a standalone apparatus on any vessel equipped with an existing donkey (auxiliary) boiler, such as a sailing ship equipped with steam winches. The apparatus consisted of a coiled condensing pipe approximately [...] in length placed inside a cylindrical casing filled with constantly changed cooling water. The casing was cast iron and the coils were made of copper. The coils were supplied with steam either from the exhaust of the engine, or from a feed directly from the boiler. A <b>circulating</b> <b>pump,</b> either driven from the main engine on a steam ship, or integrated with the apparatus on a sailing ship, supplied a constant stream of cooling water flowing through the condenser. A covered brass cup with small adjustable holes around the circumference was fitted at {{the upper end of the}} steam coil. In operation, a steam jet drew air in from the circumferential openings in the cup and filled the coils with a mixture of air and steam, both cooling the steam and reducing its pressure. As it passed down the coil, the air/steam mixture was further cooled by the surrounding water, and condensed as water droplets on the walls of the coil. The aerated water would collect as a clear, bright and odourless liquid at a temperature of about [...] at the bottom of the coil, to be drawn off for use. The machine could supply approximately [...] of water per hour. [...] "The samples of water subjected to analysis were collected at different times directly from the Patent Apparatus on board ship... and the results of my experiments with the water distilled in Alexander Chaplin & Co.'s are conclusive in showing that is of excellent quality in every particular." ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> - {{a device}} that causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in {{circuits}} (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The circulating pumps are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> can be arranged in one axis (in-line <b>circulating</b> <b>pump,</b> typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating radial pump). The mechanical energy delivered to the <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in pressure (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> rotor, {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the pump operation, there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the suction port. In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the pumped liquid, causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the suction port (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the net positive suction head (NPSH).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Experiments were {{conducted}} on a physical hydraulic model of a <b>circulating</b> water <b>pump</b> sump structure. The cooling water intake structure consisted of two <b>circulating</b> water <b>pumps</b> and two auxiliary water pumps withdrawing flow {{from one end of}} a cooling tower basin. The objective of the hydraulic model study was to evaluate the performance of the initial design of the pump sump and to develop modifications to eliminate flow problems such as severe vortexing, intense swirl, or uneven flow distribution at the pump bell. The initial design of the intake structure developed high levels of pre-swirl and strong vortices were observed entering the <b>circulating</b> <b>pumps.</b> Modifications were developed in the model to reduce the level of flow pre-swirl and vortex activity and to improve the flow conditions entering the <b>circulating</b> water <b>pumps.</b> Proposed modifications to the sump included the installation of sidewall fillets, back-wall fillets and center floor splitters. Modifications also included the installation of a curtain wall set at El. 1089. 95 om and 3. 71 om from the back-wall of the sump. With these modifications installed in the model, flow pre-swirl, vortex activity and pump throat velocities were all within acceptable limits for the range of operating conditions examined in the model. The minimum recommended water level in the cooling tower basin to prevent the formation of a hydraulic jump and to avoid the potential for adverse hydraulics and degradation in pump performance in the sump was El. 1089. 90 om...|$|R
50|$|A solar {{controller}} is {{an electronic}} device {{that controls the}} <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> in a solar hot water system to harvest as much heat {{as possible from the}} solar panels and protect the system from overheating. The basic job of the controller is to turn the <b>circulating</b> <b>pump</b> on when there is heat available in the panels, moving the working fluid through the panels to the heat exchanger at the thermal store. Heat is available whenever the temperature of the solar panel is greater than the temperature of the water in the heat exchanger. Overheat protection is achieved by turning the pump off when the store reaches its maximum temperature and sometimes cooling the store by turning the pump on when the store is hotter than the panels.|$|E
