40|$|Abstract. The {{reduction}} of SO 2 on different carbons {{in the presence}} of the nitrates and sulfides of sodium, potassium and <b>calcium</b> and potassium <b>polysulfides</b> was studied. The presence of salts increased the initial rate 2 - 5 fold for all of them and did not change the product distribution. The catalysis was not determined by the cation and there was no difference in the catalytic reactivity between nitrates and sulfides. The sulfur content of the activated carbon increased during the reaction on account of the stable reactive intermediates in the {{reduction of}} SO 2. In the presence of NaNO 3 or Na 2 S, the amount of sulfur incorporated was in the molar ratio Na:S = 3 ± 0. 3, and the XPS spectra of the residual carbon showed an increase of ca. 9 % of the non-oxidized form of sulfur in the intermediates. In the absence of salt, it is proposed that after the adsorption of SO 2 on the carbon, a 1, 3, 2 -dioxathiolane or 1, 2 -oxathietene 2 -oxide are formed and that decompose to produce CO 2 and atomic sulfur. The non-oxidized sulfur intermediate would be an episulfide 3, formed from the reaction of the atomic sulfur with the nearest double bond and followed by consecutive reactions of insertion of atomic sulfur to form a trisulfide. Extrusion of S 2 from the trisulfide would regenerate the episulfide, establishing a sulfide...|$|R

40|$|Batch {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to assess the potential use of ferrous sulfate and <b>calcium</b> <b>polysulfide</b> for the remediation of chromite ore processing residue (COPR). The remediation process entails addition of ferrous sulfate or <b>calcium</b> <b>polysulfide</b> to chemically reduce hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI) ] to trivalent chromium [Cr(III) ] in slurry form and pH adjustment to precipitate Cr(III) as chromium hydroxide. The present study investigates the effects of COPR particle size, treatment pH, and chemical dosage {{on the performance of}} the treatment. Smaller particle size resulted in increases in alkaline digestion and Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) Cr(VI) concentrations for the untreated samples. The chemical reduction of Cr(VI) with ferrous iron and sulfides was non-stoichiometric. Four times the stoichiometric amount of ferrous iron of two times the stoichiometric amount of polysulfide were needed to meet both the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) regulatory limit of 240 mg/kg for Cr(VI) and EPA TCLP regulatory limit of 5 mg/L for chromium [C,r]. pH adjustment was necessary to prevent the formation of ettringite, a swell causing mineral, upon the introduction of sulfate to the COPR material via ferrous sulfate or <b>calcium</b> <b>polysulfide.</b> The slow hydration of some COPR minerals caused the pH of the treated COPR to creep upward during the curing period.

Phytophagous and predatory mites were counted throughout the season in blocks ranging from 0. 4 - 1. 6 ha in size treated with four codling moth insecti-cides. In one year of the study (2006), five out of six orchards experienced elevated mite densities relative to the standard. In four orchards, novaluron caused a 3. 0 - 16. 9 × in-crease in mite populations; acetamiprid caused a 2. 6 - 3. 4 × increase, and thiacloprid caused a 1. 7 - 13. 8 × increase.

O teste de bancada realizado com o reagente químico polissulfeto de cálcio demonstrou ser eficiente para reduzir as concentrações de cromo hexavalente em solo e água subterrânea. Com base nos dados adquiridos neste teste foi possível calcular a dose de injeção do polissulfeto de cálcio. Foram realizados setenta pontos de sondagem, pela técnica direct push, para injetar duzentos e cinquenta e dois mil e trinta litros de solução de polissulfeto de cálcio e água, sendo aproximadamente três mil e quinhentos litros por ponto de injeção. Os resultados após a injeção demonstraram que o polissulfeto de cálcio conseguiu remover o cromo hexavalente que estava adsorvido ao solo e reduziu a concentração de cromo hexavalente na água subterrânea entre quarenta e seis e sessenta e sete e noventa e nove e noventa e cinco por cento, após dezenove meses da injeção.

The study area is located in the Rio de Janeiro city and was occupied by a glass factory for forty years and purchased for construction of residential condominiums. Chromium is an important metal for the industry and is used in various products and processes, such as electroplating, leather treatment, pulp, wood preservation, and refractory manufacturing. The trivalent chromium is essential from a nutritional point of view, non-toxic and poorly absorbed in the body, acting in the maintenance of some functions. Cr(III) is the most common being found and occurs naturally, since the element Cr(VI) can occur naturally, but in low concentrations, if the groundwater has geochemical conditions the Cr (III) can be oxidize to Cr (VI). The hexavalent chromium is the most dangerous valence state and, according to ATSDR (two thousand and twelve), have greater mobility in the groundwater, being carcinogenic by inhalation of high doses of soluble chromate salts. The mobility of hexavalent chromium is high in soil and groundwater because it is not adsorbed by the soil in that valence state, on the other hand when it is in trivalent form is strongly adsorbed by the soil, forming insoluble precipitates, having low mobility in soil and groundwater. The hexavalent chromium remediation by in situ chemical reduction using <b>calcium</b> <b>polysulfide</b> {{has been the subject of}} several field studies documented in the literature, both for soil and groundwater from the Chromite Ore Processing Residue (COPR) (Storch, et al., two thousand and two; Graham, et al., two thousand and six; Charboneau, et al., two thousand and six; Wazne, et al., two thousand seven a; Wazne, et al., two thousand seven b; Chrysochoou, et al., two thousand and ten; Chrysochoou & Ting, two thousand and eleven; Pakzadeh & Batista, two thousand and eleven; Chrysochoou, et al., two thousand and twelve). <b>Calcium</b> <b>polysulfide</b> is a fertilizer to soil and commercially available and has been used in some remediation studies cases for reducing hexavalent chromium in soil and groundwater. Being commercially available and used as fertilizer, it is a relatively cheap chemical reagent in comparison with other chemical compounds exclusively developed for this purpose. The stoichiometric demand and the chemical kinetics of the reduction of Cr (VI) by the <b>calcium</b> <b>polysulfide</b> in aqueous solution was studied by Graham et al. (two thousand and six) from the chromite ore processing residue (COPR). With this study it was reported that a molar ratio of a point sixty-six is required (close to the theoretical value of one point five) and a first-order kinetics with an initial concentration of twenty-six eight point mg/L and pH of the CPS solution around eleven point five, with the presence of oxygen. Thus, the hexavalent chromium is reduced to chromium hydroxide, slightly water soluble compound which is precipitated to the soil. The trivalent chromium has low solubility, toxicity, mobility, reactivity and is considered stable. There are various application techniques of chemical reagents in the underground environment, and choosing the most appropriate method for each area depends on the type of contaminant, geological environment, groundwater and surface interference, depth, thickness and size of the contaminated area.

The effectiveness of CaS 5 treatment was assessed using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), alkaline digestion, and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analyses. The formation of ettringite, known as a heaving agent, was investigated following the treatment of CaS 5, using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) along with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Overall, after a curing period of 18 months, the TCLP total chromium (Cr) and alkaline digestion (Cr 6 +) results obtained from the treatability study showed that the concentrations were lower than 5 mg L− 1 and 9 mg kg− 1, respectively. However, XANES results obtained from samples cured for 18 months showed that all of the treated samples had higher Cr 6 + concentrations than shown using alkaline digestion. The lowest XANES Cr 6 + concentration of 610. 2 mg kg− 1 was obtained from the sample with a particle size less than 0. 075 mm and a pH value of 9. Particle size reduction prior to the addition of the reductant, along with pH reduction was found to be strongly associated with the treatment performance. Ettringite formation, due to pH increase over time in the samples, where the initial pH was adjusted to 9, was verified by XRPD and SEM-EDX analyses, indicating that a pH less than 9 should be maintained to avoid ettringite formation.

Foam delivery technology (FDT) has been developed as a potential solution to overcome these limitations for remediating subsurface and deep vadose zone environments using reactive amendments. Although there are many advantages to utilizing FDT for treatment in the deep vadose zone, little information is available on how the addition of these surfactants and remedial amendments affect the indigenous microbial communities in the deep vadose zone {{as well as the}} impact of biological transformations of surfactant-based foams on remediation efforts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a rapid method for assessment of microbial communities in contaminated subsurface environments. This research was divided into two phases: (1) assess the toxicity of proposed FDT components on a single bacterial species, Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1; and (2) determine the effects of these components on a microbial community from the vadose zone. In Phase I, S. oneidensis MR- 1 was exposed to proposed FDT components to assess potential growth inhibition or stimulation caused by these chemicals. S. oneidensis MR- 1 cultures were exposed to the surfactants sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB), and NINOL 40 -CO, and the remedial amendment, <b>calcium</b> <b>polysulfide</b> (CPS). Results from this phase revealed that the relative acute toxicity order for these compounds was SDS 3 ̆e 3 ̆eCPS 3 ̆e 3 ̆eNINOL 40 -CO 3 ̆eSLES≥CAPB. High concentrations of SDS were toxic to the growth of S. oneidensis MR- 1 but low concentrations were stimulatory. This benchtop system provided a capability to assess adverse microbial-remediation responses and contributed to the development of in situ remedial chemistries before they are deployed in the field. For Phase II, sediments from the BC Cribs and Trenches (BCCT) area of the Hanford Site, WA, were characterized before and after exposure to potential FDT components. First, the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of sediment from the BCCT was assessed by sequencing the microbial community and measuring the metabolic activity. The sediment was also incubated with various concentrations of SDS, CAPB, and CPS. Phylogenetic analysis detected phylotypes from the Alpha-, Beta-, Delta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Unlike the S. oneidensis MR- 1 studies conducted in Phase I, the surfactants and CPS stimulated the metabolic activity of the native microbial communities. The observed stimulation could be caused by sorption of the chemicals to the sediment particles, or utilization of the surfactants by the microbial communities. These findings emphasize the importance of monitoring microbial activity at remediation sites in order to determine short and long term efficacy of the treatment, compliance with regulatory mandates, and act as an early warning indicator of unintended changes to the subsurface...|$|E
40|$|The major {{objectives}} of the proposed study were to: 1.) determine the leaching characteristics of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI) ] from contaminated sediments collected from 100 Area spill sites; 2.) elucidate possible Cr(VI) mineral and/or chemical associations that {{may be responsible for}} Cr(VI) retention in the Hanford Site 100 Areas through the use of i.) macroscopic leaching studies and ii.) microscale characterization of contaminated sediments; and 3.) provide information to construct a conceptual model of Cr(VI) geochemistry in the Hanford 100 Area vadose zone. In addressing these objectives, additional benefits accrued were: (1) a fuller understanding of Cr(VI) entrained in the vadose zone that will that can be utilized in modeling potential Cr(VI) source terms, and (2) accelerating the Columbia River 100 Area corridor cleanup by providing valuable information to develop remedial action based on a fundamental understanding of Cr(VI) vadose zone geochemistry. A series of macroscopic column experiments were conducted with contaminated and uncontaminated sediments to study Cr(VI) desorption patterns in aged and freshly contaminated sediments, evaluate the transport characteristics of dichromate liquid retrieved from old pipelines of the 100 Area; and estimate the effect of strongly reducing liquid on the reduction and transport of Cr(VI). Column experiments used the < 2 mm fraction of the sediment samples and simulated Hanford groundwater solution. Periodic stop-flow events were applied to evaluate the change in elemental concentration during time periods of no flow and greater fluid residence time. The results were fit using a two-site, one dimensional reactive transport model. Sediments were characterized for the spatial and mineralogical associations of the contamination using an array of microscale techniques such as XRD, SEM, EDS, XPS, XMP, and XANES. The following are important conclusions and implications. Results from column experiments indicated that most of contaminant Cr travels fast through the sediments and appears as Cr(VI) in the effluents. The significance of this for groundwater concentrations would, however, depend on the mass flux of recharge to the water table. adsorption of Cr(VI) to sediments from spiked Cr(VI) solution is low; calculated retardation coefficients are close to one. <b>Calcium</b> <b>polysulfide</b> solutions readily reduced Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in column experiments. However a significant amount of the Cr(VI) was mobilized ahead of the polysulfide solution front. This has significant implications for in-situ reductive remediation techniques. The experiments suggest that {{it would be difficult to}} design a remedial measure using infiltration of liquid phase reductants without increasing transport of Cr(VI) toward the water table. The microscopic characterization results are consistent with the column studies. Cr(VI) is found as ubiquitous coatings on sediment grain surfaces. Small, higher concentration, chromium sites are associated with secondary clay mineral inclusions, with occasional barium chromate minerals, and reduced to Cr(III) in association with iron oxides that are most likely magnetite primary minerals. Within the restricted access domains of sediment matrix, ferrous iron could also diffuse from in situ, high-surface-area minerals to cause the reductive immobilization of chromate. This process may be favored at microscale geochemical zones where ferrous iron could be supplied. Once nucleated, micrometer-scale precipitates are favored as growing locales for further accumulation, causing the formation of discrete zones of Cr(III) ...|$|E
