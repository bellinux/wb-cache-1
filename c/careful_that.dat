5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E

He was <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> his own people, the Burmans, not flaunt themselves before other peoples. He continued to show regard for the Pyus, who had recently fallen from greatness. He retained the name Pyu for his kingdom although it was {{under the leadership of}} the Burmans. He showed regard for the Mons, and encouraged his people to learn from the Mons.|$|E
25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must be <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E

In November 2007 on BBC Radio 4 she {{described}} how a journalist once produced a profile on {{her with the}} assumption that she had had at least [...] "one sexual relationship", to which Widdecombe replied: [...] "Be <b>careful,</b> <b>that's</b> the way you get sued". When interviewer Jenni Murray asked if she had ever had a sexual relationship, Widdecombe laughed [...] "it's nobody else's business".|$|R

[...] He created a website called Eckhart Tolle TV, with streaming video of monthly group meditations and other videos. [...] He gives speeches and workshops in English and occasionally in German or Spanish. He also travels for various speaking engagements, such as seminars and retreats. In a 2003 interview with the Telegraph Magazine, Tolle indicated {{that he had no}} intention of creating [...] "a heavy commercial structure", [...] nor of setting up an ashram or centre. He believes one [...] "could develop organically" [...] and said [...] "one needs to be <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> the organization doesn’t become self-serving".|$|E
500|$|For {{the guitar}} sound, the group tried to balance Grohl's [...] "playing the rhythm {{straight}} up the middle", Shiflett's [...] "sharp and clean sense of melodic playing", and Smear's more aggressive sound, with Grohl declaring that [...] "with three guitars, {{you have to}} be <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> it doesn't become a huge fucking mess. But when everybody's playing their thing really well, it sounds perfectly orchestrated." [...] Smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar, which would both contrast with Grohl and Shiflett and add a heavier sound - as Grohl declared, [...] "if we ever felt like a section wasn't heavy enough, we put the fuckin' baritone on it, and it became huge." [...] Hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills at the suggestion of Vig, as buzz rolls were a trademark of one of the producer's favorite drummers, Ian Paice.|$|E
500|$|New York Times public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd {{wrote in}} 2016 that [...] "Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview" [...] and accuse it of {{harboring}} a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze {{the substance of}} the claim, but did opine that the Times is [...] "part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources." [...] Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: [...] "We have to be really <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times. I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No." ...|$|E

500|$|The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster {{was used}} as the {{location}} for the wedding. The scenes were shot in the old nave of the church, which was surrounded by [...] "rough-hewn sandstone and glowing stained glass windows." [...] Liz Guiver, the former vicar's secretary and administrator, revealed that many of the church's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set. Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age, Guiver recalled [...] "The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, so we had to be <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday. Then we waited for months until the episode was aired, and most parishioners were glued to the set." [...] Scenes featuring the character's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively. Recalling the shoot, Donovan told the Herald Suns Nui Te Koha, [...] "I don't remember that particular day well, but when you do set ups like weddings it takes a long, long time to put things together." ...|$|E
500|$|Research {{was a major}} {{component}} of the developmental stages of Murder on the Orient Express. Most of the research was focused on Yugoslavia in 1934, the game's setting. Sheldon focused on the political and scientific situation of this era, and explained his intensive research, saying [...] "all of the puzzles have to be contextual. They all have to either help character, help story or define period." [...] The developers also drew influence from a train museum outside Miami with an original Pullman carriage - the same as the carriages used on the Orient Express in the 1930s. The museum also contained a locomotive similar to the one the developers were looking for. The developers ended up using the train museum, several books about the Orient Express, the 1974 film version of Christie's novel, and the internet as research resources. With Murder on the Orient Express being the first Poirot game produced, Sheldon was <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> the game fitted into Christie's timeline of Poirot's exploits. The television series often took liberties with the time in which stories were set, but Sheldon was determined to keep everything in strict accordance with Christie's work. There are several references in the game to Poirot's earlier cases, all of which are chronologically accurate. This was partly so that Sheldon could use the culture of specific eras of time, and also so that in the future other Poirot-based games will be chronologically accurate.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Jordan {{had in his}} head an image of Samuel Beckett's play Krapp's Last Tape. The script was 27 pages long, instead of the normal average of about 65, {{due to lack of}} stage directions. Clive Arnold was asked to direct the episode, and was allowed to input more into the script than would be normal, which he said was due to his good working {{relationship}} with Jordan. Jordan also gave Brown the opportunity to change anything she wanted to. Arnold was <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> the episode would not alienate regular EastEnders viewers by making it too left of field, ensuring that it would be recognisable as an EastEnders episode, and made sure viewers would identify with the character, emphasising her state of mind with visual links. Brown found her lines for the episode easy to learn as they [...] "flowed" [...] and the script was well written. Arnold and Brown worked closely together, rehearsing and working on the script in detail. Rehearsals went on for a number of weeks and after being able to judge the pace of the episode, Arnold was able to introduce choreography and stage directions. He stated that the rehearsals were invaluable as he, Brown and Jordan could work together to develop and tweak the script as they progressed. He broke the script down into scenes to aid Brown's performance by giving her one scene to concentrate on per day of filming.|$|E

500|$|... "Humbug" [...] {{received}} {{praise from}} critics. In a 2010 {{review of the}} episode, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff gave it a [...] "Grade A" [...] rating. He noted {{the difference between the}} style of the episode and previous stories of the series, saying that at first, it [...] "feel like it might be a very special Murder, She Wrote or something," [...] and that later, [...] "we're clearly in some other show entirely, the only links in the continuity chain being Mulder and Scully themselves." [...] Including Morgan's other scripts for the show, VanDerWerff called his writing [...] "deeply, deeply funny", but said that [...] "Humbug" [...] "may be [...] weakest script". He particularly praised the ending of the episode, saying [...] "there are few other TV writers that would come up with something as haunting and as perfectly understanding of the human condition as the final reveal of who the killer is." [...] Also writing for The A.V. Club in 2010, Zack Handlen called it [...] "a terrific episode ... well-written and odd". Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called [...] "Humbug" [...] "the pivotal episode of The X-Files." [...] Robert Goodwin said of the episode [...] "Talk about offbeat. It's very theatrical and grandiose. The trick was being <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> it didn't become like a bad Vincent Price movie, but it worked out well." [...] Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade. Reviewers for website IGN named [...] "Humbug" [...] the tenth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series. Topless Robot named it the sixth funniest episode of the series.|$|E

This could happen to individuals who choose poorly {{in the balance of}} endowments or who have only certain forcibles available, but the more usual cause is the death of one or more dedicates, resulting in the loss of their attributes.

2500|$|Wallace's {{adventure}} {{story is}} told {{from the perspective of}} Judah Ben-Hur. On occasion, the author speaks directly to his readers. Wallace understood that Christians would be skeptical of a fictional story on Christ's life, so he was careful not to offend them in his writing. Ben-Hur [...] "maintains a respect for the underlying principles of Judaism and Christianity". In his memoirs, Wallace wrote:The Christian world would not tolerate a novel with Jesus Christ its hero, and I knew it ... He should not be present as an actor in any scene of my creation. The giving a cup of water to Ben-Hur at the well near Nazareth is the only violation of this rule ... I would be religiously <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> every word He uttered should be a literal quotation from one of His sainted biographers.|$|E

He said, [...] "The crawl {{is such a}} hard thing {{because you have to}} be <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem." [...] Lucas showed his draft to his friends. Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: [...] "The crawl at the beginning looks like it was written on a driveway. It goes on forever. It's gibberish." [...] Lucas recounted what De Palma said {{the first time he saw}} it: [...] "George, you're out of your mind! Let me sit down and write this for you." [...] De Palma helped to edit the text into the form used in the film.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{example of}} the [...] "story within a story" [...] {{technique}} {{can be found in}} the One Thousand and One Nights, which can be traced back to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably the Panchatantra of ancient Sanskrit literature. The Nights, however, improved on the Panchatantra in several ways, particularly in the way a story is introduced. In the Panchatantra, stories are introduced as didactic analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase [...] "If you're not <b>careful,</b> <b>that</b> which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you." [...] In the Nights, this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story, but instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.|$|E
2500|$|After {{arriving}} back in Shanghai in 1929, Zhou {{began to work}} underground, establishing and overseeing a network of independent Communist cells. [...] Zhou's greatest danger in his underground work was the threat of being discovered by the KMT secret police, which had been established in 1928 with the specific mission of identifying and eliminating Communists. In order to avoid detection, Zhou and his wife changed residences {{at least once a}} month, and used a variety of aliases. Zhou often disguised himself as a businessman, sometimes wearing a beard. Zhou was <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> only two or three people ever knew his whereabouts. Zhou disguised all urban Party offices, made sure that CCP offices never shared the same buildings when in the same city, and required all Party members to use passwords to identify one another. Zhou restricted all of his meetings to either before 7AM or after 7PM. Zhou never used public transportation, and avoided being seen in public places.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2014, Atlus {{announced}} that the game would see an English release {{in the second half}} of 2014. The localization was handled internally by Atlus, and followed the precepts of their policy for the Persona series: they kept the text as close as possible to the Japanese original, except where some aspects such as humor would be difficult for a Western audience to understand. They also sought to avoid the localization adjustments that would seem out of context with the visuals, citing the changes to the Ace Attorney games as a type of localization they wished to avoid. As Persona Q was a spin-off from two popular games, the team were extra <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> they remained faithful to both the original and fan expectations for the characters. A compromise that was made was that players did not have enough space in the naming screen to use the [...] "Yu Narukami" [...] title for the Persona 4 protagonist.
