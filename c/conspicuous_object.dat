40|$|Searching for objects {{is part of}} {{our daily}} life. Generally, this cannot be {{accomplished}} without eye movements. These eye movements form a path towards the target. In this thesis we focus on several factors that shape this path. Eye movements in search often aim for objects resembling the target. Nevertheless, observers also frequently select <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects</b> that do not resemble the target, particularly following short saccade latencies. In Chapter 2 we focus on the selection of <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects</b> {{as a function of the}} saccade latency. We find that following short saccade latencies only <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects</b> that can be processed quickly are selected. While following longer latencies less <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects</b> requiring longer processing time are also selected. This suggests that the temporal aspects of encoding visual information are a determining factor in saccadic selection. When a target is surrounded by similar objects this can deteriorate the quality of peripheral information, a phenomenon known as crowding. When a target is inconspicuous due to crowding the selection of <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects</b> will not result in an efficient strategy. However, little research has been devoted to the role of crowding in search. In Chapter 3 we show that when a target can be distinguished peripherally, eye movements are indeed biased towards locations where there is little crowding and the target is more conspicuous. Interestingly, when the target cannot be discriminated peripherally, this bias reverses to areas with strong crowding, where the target is least <b>conspicuous.</b> The surrounding <b>objects</b> are only part of what determines the perception of the target. The background of the target is also an important factor. In Chapter 4 we investigate the role of the background in search. Manipulating the orientation or spatial frequency of the background (while keeping the properties of target and distractor constant) results in search times that are longest for a small target-background contrast. When varying the background luminance, however, we find that the longest search times occur when the background is darker than both target and distractors, regardless of the target-background contrast. Thus, background plays an important role in search. This role depends on the individual contrast of both target and distractors with the background and the type of contrast (luminance, orientation or spatial frequency). Finally, it is tempting to assume that each eye movement is the result of analysis during the directly preceding fixation. However, it is also possible that a single decision is made for several consecutive eye movements. In Chapter 5 we demonstrate that the latter is in fact the case. We show that up to three eye movements are planned ahead in visual search. Furthermore, the ability to deviate from the planned path depends on whether new or not visual information can be processed sufficiently fast. In all, we have presented studies focusing on fundamental aspects of selection by eye movements that have not received much attention in previous studies using artificial displays...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of cryptic and conspicuous coloration in pelagic ecosystems, few researchers have investigated the optimal reflectance spectra for either trait. In this study, the underwater radiance distribution in tropical oceanic water was modelled using measured inherent optical properties and radiative transfer calculations. The modelled light field was then used to predict the reflectance spectra that resulted in minimal or maximal object contrast {{as a function of}} depth, viewing angle, azimuth and solar elevation. The results matched commonly observed trends in the coloration of many pelagic organisms and showed that optimal coloration for either crypticity or conspicuity is a complex function of the parameters examined. The effects of viewing angle and depth were substantial and non-intuitive, showing that red coloration is most cryptic at depth. The effects of viewing azimuth were less significant and the effects of solar elevation were minor. White coloration and black coloration were equally cryptic/conspicuous when viewed from below. Although <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects</b> viewed from below had the lowest contrast when viewed from a short distance, they had the longest sighting distances. The contrast of maximally <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects</b> viewed from short distances was greatest at wavelengths displaced from the wavelength of maximum light penetration...|$|R

40|$|Models of {{low-level}} saliency {{predict that}} when we first look at a photograph our first few eye movements should be made towards visually <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects.</b> Two experiments investigated this prediction by recording eye fixations while viewers inspected pictures of room interiors that contained objects with known saliency characteristics. Highly salient objects did attract fixations earlier than less <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects,</b> but only in a task requiring general encoding of the whole picture. When participants were required to detect {{the presence of a}} small target, then the visual saliency of nontarget objects did not influence fixations. These results support modifications of the model that take the cognitive override of saliency into account by allowing task demands to reduce the saliency weights of task-irrelevant objects. The pictures sometimes contained incongruent objects that were taken from other rooms. These objects were used to test the hypothesis that previous reports of the early fixation of congruent objects have not been consistent because the effect depends upon the visual conspicuity of the incongruent object. There was an effect of incongruency in both experiments, with earlier fixation of objects that violated the gist of the scene, but the effect was only apparent for inconspicuous objects, which argues against the hypothesis. © 2006 The Experimental Psychology Society...|$|R

A few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display, either with visitor centers on their bases, or with viewing areas farther away.

60|$|After much {{deliberation}} and two {{or three}} essays by moonlight, Richard ended the affair by boldly covering the whole beneath a color that he christened “sunshine,” a cheap way, as he assured his cousin the Judge, of always keeping fair weather over his head. The platform, as well as the caves of the house, were surmounted by gaudily painted railings, and the genius of Hiram was exerted in the fabrication of divers urns and mouldings, that were scattered profusely around this part of their labors. Richard had originally a cunning expedient, by which the chimneys were intended to be so low, and so situated, as to resemble ornaments on the balustrades; but comfort required that the chimneys should rise with the roof, in order that the smoke might bc carried off, and they thus became four extremely <b>conspicuous</b> <b>objects</b> in the view.|$|R
