The following studies were done to further investigate this reversibility.

40|$|Plant {{responses}} {{to a combination of}} drought and bacterial pathogen infection, an agronomically important and altogether a new stress, are not well studied. While occurring concurrently, these two stresses can lead to synergistic or antagonistic effects on plants due to stress-interaction. It is reported that plant {{responses to}} the stress combinations consist of both strategies unique to <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> and those shared between <b>combined</b> and individual <b>stresses.</b> However, the <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> response mechanisms governing stress interaction and net impact are largely unknown. In order to study these adaptive strategies, an accurate and convenient methodology is lacking even in model plants like Arabidopsis thaliana. The gradual nature of drought stress imposition protocol poses a hindrance in simultaneously applying pathogen infection under laboratory conditions to achieve <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> In present study we aimed to establish systematic <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> protocol and to study physiological responses of the plants to various degrees of <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> Here, we have comprehensively studied the impact of combined drought and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 infection on A. thaliana. Further, by employing different permutations of drought and pathogen stress intensities, an attempt was made to dissect the contribution of each individual stress effects during their concurrence. We hereby present two main aspects of <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> viz., stress interaction and net impact of the stress on plants. Mainly, this study establishes a systematic protocol {{to assess the impact of}} combined drought and bacterial pathogen stress. It was observed that as a result of net impact, some physiological responses under <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> are tailored when compared to the plants exposed to individual stresses. We also infer that plant responses under <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> in this study are predominantly influenced by the drought stress. Our results show that pathogen induced disease symptoms were ameliorated by drought <b>stress</b> in <b>combined</b> <b>stressed</b> plants. <b>Combined</b> <b>stressed</b> plants also displayed reduced ROS generation and declined cell death which could be attributed to activation of effective basal defence responses.

40|$|There is {{currently}} limited knowledge {{on the role}} of hormones in plants responses to combinations of abiotic and pathogen stress factors. This study focused on the response of tomato near-isogenic lines (NILs) that carry the Ol- 1, ol- 2, and Ol- 4 loci, conferring resistance to tomato powdery mildew (PM) caused by Oidium neolycopersici, to combined PM and salt stress. These NILs were crossed with the notabilis (ABAdeficient), defenceless 1 (JA-deficient), and epinastic (ET overproducer) tomato mutants to investigate possible roles of hormone signaling in response to <b>combined</b> <b>stresses.</b> In the NILs, marker genes for hormonal pathways showed differential expression patterns upon PM infection. The epinastic mutation resulted in breakdown of resistance in NILOl- 1 and NIL-ol- 2. This was accompanied by reduced callose deposition, and was more pronounced under <b>combined</b> salt <b>stress.</b> The notabilis mutation resulted in H 2 O 2 overproduction and reduced susceptibility to PM in NIL-Ol- 1 under <b>combined</b> <b>stress,</b> but lead to higher plant growth reduction under salinity and <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> Resistance in NIL-ol- 2 was compromised by the notabilis mutation, which was potentially caused by reduction of callose deposition. Under <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> the compromised resistance in NIL-ol- 2 was restored. PM resistance in NIL-Ol- 4 remained robust across all mutant and treatment combinations.

Jejunum and colon were collected to measure: transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER; a measure of epithelial barrier function); gene expression of tight junction molecules; mast cell density. Plasma corticosterone concentration was increased in all three stress conditions versus sham, with highest concentrations in the <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> condition. TEER in the jejunum was decreased in all stress conditions, but was significantly lower in the <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> condition than in the other groups.

Exposure to stress during pregnancy can change many babies' normal physiological processes. The separate and combined effects of three common types of prenatal stress were investigated on motor learning of male offspring of rats. Methods: In the present study, pregnant NMRI rats were used. Except the control group, the other groups were stressed on the eighth day of gestation for 10 days. The motor learning of 40 male offspring rats were tested using the rotarod performance test 75 days after the experiment. The length of time that each rat could maintain its balance was recorded automatically. The study groups included control, electromagnetic field stress (intensity 1. 2 mT, 50 Hz), immobility stress (for 0. 5 hour - 2 times/day), social stress (6 rats kept in a small cage), and <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> (all 3 of the above stresses).

Half of the pots were kept adequately watered throughout, but water was withheld from the others from the initiation of seed filling until the relative leaf water content reached 50 % of the irrigated plants (drought stress); all plants were rewatered thereafter until seed maturit.

To understand {{the mechanism of}} maize responses to the drought and heat combination stress, phosphoproteomic analysis was performed on maize leaves by using multiplex iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic and LC-MS/MS methods. Five-leaf-stage maize was subjected to drought, heat or their combination, and the leaves were collected. Globally, heat, drought and the <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> significantly changed the phosphorylation levels of 172, 149 and 144 phosphopeptides, respectively.

40|$|Salinity and {{waterlogging}} are {{two major}} factors affecting crop production {{around the world and}} often occur together (e. g. salt brought to the surface by rising water tables). While the physiological and molecular mechanisms of plant responses to each of these environmental constraints are studied in detail, the mechanisms underlying plant tolerance to their <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> are much less understood. In this study, whole-plant physiological responses to individual/combined salinity and waterlogging stresses were studied using two barley varieties grown in either vermiculite (semi-hydroponics) or sandy loam. Two weeks of combined salinity and waterlogging treatment significantly decreased plant biomass, chlorophyll content, maximal quantum efficiency of PSII and water content in both varieties, while the percentage of chlorotic and necrotic leaves and leaf sap osmolality increased. The adverse effects of the <b>combined</b> <b>stresses</b> were much stronger in the waterlogging-sensitive variety Naso Nijo.

40|$|Projections on {{the impact}} of climate change on {{agricultural}} productivity foresee prolonged and/or increased stress intensities and enlargement of a significant number of pathogens habitats. This significantly raises the occurrence probability of (new) abiotic and biotic stress combinations. With stress tolerance research being mostly focused on responses to individual stresses, our understanding of plants’ ability to adapt to <b>combined</b> <b>stresses</b> is limited. In an attempt to bridge this knowledge gap, we hierarchized in chapter 1 existing information on individual abiotic or biotic stress adaptation mechanisms taking into consideration different anatomical, physiological and molecular layers of plant stress tolerance and defense. We identified potentially crucial regulatory intersections between abiotic and biotic stress signalling pathways following the pathogenesis timeline, and emphasized the importance of subcellular to whole plant level interactions by successfully dissecting the phenotypic response to <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> We considered both explicit and shared adaptive responses to abiotic and biotic stress, which included amongst others R-gene and systemic acquired resistance as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS), redox and hormone signalling, and proposed breeding targets and strategies.   In chapter 3 we focused on salt stress and powdery mildew combination in tomato, a vegetable crop with a wealth of genetic resources, and started with a genetic study. S. habrochaites LYC 4 was found to exhibit resistance to both salt stress and powdery mildew. A LYC 4 introgression line (IL) population segregated for both salt stress tolerance and powdery mildew resistance. Introgressions contributing to salt tolerance, including Na+ and Cl- accumulation, and powdery mildew resistance were precisely pinpointed with the aid of SNP marker genotyping. Salt stress (100 mM NaCl) combined with powdery mildew infection increased the susceptibility of the population to powdery mildew in an additive manner, while decreasing the phenotypic variation for this trait. Only a few overlapping QTLs for disease resistance and salt stress tolerance were identified (one on a short region at the top of Chromosome 9 where numerous receptor-like kinases reside). Most genetic loci were specific for either salt stress tolerance or powdery mildew resistance indicating distinct genetic architectures. This enables genetic pyramiding approaches to build up <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> tolerance. Considering that abiotic stress in nature can be of variable intensities, we evaluated selected ILs under <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> with salinity ranging from mild to severe (50, 100 and 150 mM NaCl) in chapter 4. Mild salt stress (50 mM) increased powdery mildew susceptibility and was accompanied by accelerated cell death-like senescence. On the contrary, severe salt stress (150 mM) reduced the disease symptoms and this correlated with leaf Na+ and Cl- content in the leaves. The effects of salt stress on powdery mildew resistance may be dependent on resistance type and mechanisms. Near Isogenic Lines (NILs) that carry different PM resistance genes (Ol- 1 (associated with slow hypersensitivity response, HR), ol- 2 (an mlo mutant associated with papilla formation) and Ol- 4 (an R gene associated with fast HR) indeed exhibited differential responses to <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> NIL-Ol- 1 resembled the LYC 4 ILs response, while NIL-ol- 2 and NIL-Ol- 4 maintained robust resistance and exhibited no senescence symptoms across all combinations, despite the observed reduction in callose deposition in NIL-ol- 2. Increased susceptibility, senescence and fitness cost of NIL-Ol- 1 under <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> coincided with high induction of ethylene and jasmonate biosynthesis and response pathways, highly induced expression of cell wall invertase LsLIN 6, and a reduction in the expression of genes encoding for antioxidant enzymes. These observations underlined the significance of stress intensity and mechanism of resistance to the outcome of salt stress and powdery mildew combination, underscoring the involvement of ethylene signalling to the susceptibility response under <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> To examine the significance of hormone signalling in <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> responses we evaluated crosses of tomato hormone mutants notabilis (ABA-deficient), defenseless 1 (JA-deficient) and epinastic (ET overproducer) with NIL-Ol- 1, NIL-ol- 2 and NIL-Ol- 4 in chapter 5. The highly pleiotropic epinastic mutant increased susceptibility of NIL-Ol- 1, but decreased the senescence response under <b>combined</b> <b>stress,</b> and resulted in partial breakdown of NIL-ol- 2 resistance, accompanied by reduced callose deposition. The effects of ET overproduction on susceptibility were more pronounced under <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> ABA deficiency in notabilis on the other hand greatly reduced susceptibility of NIL-Ol- 1 under <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> at the expense of stronger growth reduction, and induced ROS overproduction. Partial resistance breakdown in the ol- 2 xnotabilis mutant accompanied by reduced callose deposition was observed, and this was restored under <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> Jasmonic acid deficiency phenotypic effects in defenseless mutants were subtle with modest increase in susceptibility for NIL-Ol- 1 and NIL-ol- 2. For NIL-ol- 2 this increased susceptibility was reverted under <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> NIL-Ol- 4 resistance remained robust across all mutant and treatment combinations. These results highlight the catalytic role of ET and ABA signalling on susceptibility and senescence under <b>combined</b> <b>stress,</b> accentuating concomitantly the importance of signalling fine tuning to minimize pleiotropic effects. The potential of exploiting transcription factors to enhance tolerance to multiple stress factors and their combination was investigated in chapter 6 through the identification and functional characterization of tomato homologues of AtWRKYs 11, 29, 48, 70 and 72. Thirteen tomato WRKY homologues were identified, of which 9 were overexpressed (using transformation with A. tumefaciens) and 12 stably silenced via RNAi in tomato cultivar Money Maker (MM). SlWRKY 11 -OE and SlWRKY 23 -OE overexpressors and RNAi lines of SlWRKY 7 and SlWRKY 9 showed both increased biomass and relative salt tolerance. SlWRKY 6 -OE exhibited the highest relative salt stress tolerance, but had strongly decreased growth under control conditions. Exceptional phenotypes under control conditions were observed for SlWRKY 10 -OE (stunted growth) and SlWRKY 23 -RNAi (necrotic symptoms). These phenotypes were significantly restored under salt stress, and accompanied by decreased ROS production. Both lines exhibited increased resistance to powdery mildew, but this resistance was compromised under salt stress combination, indicating that these genes have important functions at the intersection of abiotic and biotic stress adaptation. SlWRKY 23 appears to have a key regulatory role in the control of abiotic stress/defense and cell death control. Experimental observations are critically discussed in the General Discussion with emphasis on potential distinctive responses in different pathosystems and abiotic and biotic stress resistance mechanisms as well as genetic manipulations for effectively achieving <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> tolerance. This includes deployment of individual common regulators as well as pyramiding of non-(negatively) interacting components such as R-genes with abiotic stress resistance genes, and their translation potential for other abiotic and biotic stress combinations. Understanding and improving plant tolerance to stress combinations can greatly contribute to accelerating crop improvement towards sustained or even increased productivity under stress.                            ...|$|R

There is currently limited knowledge on their {{significance in the}} response to stress combination. Using near isogenic lines (NILs) that carry the Ol- 1, ol- 2 and Ol- 4 gene for resistance to tomato powdery mildew caused by Oidium neolycopersici, this study focused on the responses of these NILs to powdery mildew and salt stress combination. In these NILs, marker genes for monitoring hormonal pathways showed differential expression pattern upon powdery mildew infection. Further by crossing these NILs with tomato mutants notabilis (ABA-deficient), defenseless 1 (JA-deficient) and epinastic (ET overproducer) the cross-talk among hormonal pathways was further investigated. Among the mutants, epinastic resulted in increased susceptibility of NIL-Ol- 1 and breakdown of NIL-ol- 2 resistance, accompanied by reduced callose deposition, effects that were more pronounced under combination with salt stress. On the other hand notabilis, resulting in H 2 O 2 overproduction greatly reduced susceptibility of NIL-Ol- 1 under <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> accompanied however by heightened sensitivity to salt stress. Callose deposition reduction led to partial resistance breakdown in NIL-ol- 2 which was reversed under <b>combined</b> <b>stress.</b> NIL-Ol- 4 resistance remained robust across all mutant and treatment combinations. We discuss the critical role that hormone signalling appears to have for the outcome of <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> and powdery mildew in terms of resistance and plant fitness integrating observations from physiological, histochemical and gene expression analyses. These significant insights obtained extend our understanding of hormonal regulation of <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> responses and can aid in narrowing down targets for improving crop performance under stress combinations...|$|R

Materials and methods: the study included 57 male patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome who underwent stress EchoCG using dipyridamole in high doses in combination with dobutamine, as well as coronary angiography. Results: stress EchoCG could bring up to the diagnostic criteria in all the patients, of whom 9 patients were found at coronary angiography to have no coronary lesion, 34 and 14 patients had one- and many-vessel lesions, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> EchoCG were significantly higher than those of EchoCG used in the diagnosis of CHD. Conclusion: stress EchoCG using dipyridamole in combination with dobutamine is a highly informative safe noninvasive technique for diagnosing CHD, its helps to identify patients with atypical acute coronary syndrome and to form a group of patients to be subject to urgent coronarography and angiosurgical intervention. The pattern of segmental contractile disorders at the height of exercise during <b>combined</b> <b>stress</b> Echo-CG makes it possible to define the site of stenotic coronary atherosclerosis with 97. 3 % sensitivity and to diagnose many-vessel lesion with 100 % sensitivity and 100 %specificity. </p...|$|R
