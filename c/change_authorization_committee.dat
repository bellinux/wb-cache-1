The historical background and elements of strategic sealift are explained. The composition {{and size of}} the strategic sealift budget is examined, as are the structure and tools of congressional oversight. The budget for strategic sealift is examined from presidential request through final appropriations over the 14 year period between 1980 and 1993. Changes made during the authorization and appropriations sequences are explained, and differences between the House and Senate support are identified. Congress and the executive branch did not agree on the priority to be given to strategic sealift programs, with Congress approving significantly larger budgets for this program than DoD requested. The Senate was slightly more supportive of sealift programs than was the House.

50|$|Prior to 1990, {{the field}} of M&S was marked by {{fragmentation}} and limited coordination between activities across key communities. In recognition of these deficiencies, Congress directed the Department of Defense (DoD) to “... establish an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) level joint program office for simulation to coordinate simulation policy, to establish interoperability standards and protocols, to promote simulation within the military departments, and to establish guidelines and objectives for coordination sic of simulation, wargaming, and training.” (ref Senate <b>Authorization</b> <b>Committee</b> Report, FY91, DoD Appropriations Bill, SR101-521, pp. 154-155, October 11, 1990) Consistent with this direction, the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) was created, and shortly afterwards many DoD Components designated organizations and/or points of contact to facilitate coordination of M&S activities within and across their communities. For over a decade, {{the ultimate goal of}} the DoD in M&S is to create a LVC-IA to assemble models and simulations quickly, which create an operationally valid LVC environment to train, develop doctrine and tactics, formulate operational plans and assess warfighting situations. A common use of these LVC environments will promote closer interaction between operations and acquisition communities. These M&S environments will be constructed from composeable components interoperating through an integrated architecture. A robust M&S capability enables the DOD to meet operational and support objectives effectively across the diverse activities of the military services, combatant commands and agencies.|$|R

However, security-related issues, especially integrity protection in mobile agent technology, still hinder {{the widespread use of}} software agents: from the agent’s perspective, mobile agent integrity should be protected against attacks from malicious hosts and other agents. In this paper, we present Code-on-Demand(CoD) mobile agents and a corresponding agent integrity protection scheme. Compared to the traditional assumption that mobile agents consist of invariant code parts, we propose the use of dynamically upgradeable agent code, in which new agent function modules can be added and redundant ones can be deleted at runtime. This approach will reduce the weight of agent programs, equip mobile agents with more flexibility, enhance code privacy and help the recoverability of agents after attack.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Each year, Congress appropriates {{billions of dollars to}} pay and support U. S. military personnel at home and overseas. In fiscal year 2003, military personnel (MILPERS) appropriations amounted to more than $ 109 billion. Once the funds are appropriated, the military services are responsible for ensuring that the funds are properly obligated and disbursed. Their end-of-the-fiscal-year review is critical to the next year's budget formulation process because the services use the obligations for the most recent fiscal year completed as a point of reference in developing their new budgets, and Congress uses this information as a point of comparison in its review of the new budget requests. In our prior work for the House and Senate appropriation and <b>authorization</b> <b>committees,</b> reviewing the services' budget justifications, we found that although the services were conducting annual reviews and certifications, the services did not review transactions by matching obligations to individual disbursements in all of the years that disbursements can occur, as required by the Department of Defense (DOD) Financial Management Regulation. We also found that the services disbursed some obligations for purposes other than those reported in their budget submission, but their year-end reviews did not show how these funds were actually disbursed. As a result of our work, the report by the conferees for the House and Senate defense appropriations committees for fiscal year 2004 directed "the Secretary of Defense to ensure that the services strengthen the annual review process by including a review of the accuracy of prior year appropriations below the budget activity level. To facilitate this review, the financial management improvement initiative should include financial decision-making processes that provide transparency of disbursements at the same level as the budget submission. " In its report for fiscal year 2005, the House Appropriations Committee reiterated this direction. For this letter, we examined whether the military services are reviewing the accuracy of their MILPERS obligation balances as required by DOD's Financial Management Regulation and as directed by congressional conferees, and, if not, what factors are preventing the services from doing this. ...|$|R
