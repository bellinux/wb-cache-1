5000|$|La Belle Iron Works, {{also known}} as La Belle <b>Cut</b> <b>Nail</b> Works, is a {{historic}} factory complex and national historic district located at Wheeling, Ohio County, West Virginia. The district includes four contributing buildings; three Italianate style brick buildings dated to {{the founding of the}} company in 1852, and a tin plate mill built 1894-1897. After 1902, the buildings were combined under a single roof, although the truss systems date to different periods achieving the configuration visible today. When listed in 1997, it was known as the [...] "La Belle <b>Cut</b> <b>Nail</b> Plant, The Largest in the World, Wheeling Corrugating Company, A Division of Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corporation." [...] The <b>cut</b> <b>nail</b> machinery still in use by La Belle dates to 1852 and the 1860s. The machinery at La Belle along with the different processes were documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey team during the summer of 1990.|$|E

50|$|The {{slitting}} mill, {{introduced to}} England in 1590, simplified {{the production of}} nail rods, but the real first efforts to mechanise the nail-making process itself occurred between 1790 and 1820, initially in the United States and England, when various machines were invented to automate and {{speed up the process}} of making nails from bars of wrought iron. These nails were known as <b>cut</b> <b>nails</b> or square nails because of their roughly rectangular cross section. <b>Cut</b> <b>nails</b> were one of the important factors in the increase in balloon framing beginning in the 1830s and thus the decline of timber framing with wooden joints. Though still used for historical renovations, and for heavy-duty applications, such as attaching boards to masonry walls, <b>cut</b> <b>nails</b> are much less common today than wire nails.|$|R

50|$|A {{native of}} County Cavan in Ireland, Brown came to Port Hope from New York in 1818 {{to make a}} new home for his family in Upper Canada. By 1823, he was so {{well-established}} that he had built the first brick building in the village as a home for his family, at the foot of Walton Street. As a businessman involved in many fields, he owned a <b>cut</b> <b>nail</b> factory, a distillery, a general store, and, one mile north, a complex he called 'Brown Stone Mills', comprising flouring mills, a saw mill, a blacksmith shop, a cooper shop, store houses, and a granary. In 1829, he was elected president of the Harbour Company of Port Hope, of which he was the principal owner.|$|E
5000|$|Barbour began owning and {{operating}} water-powered mills in Culpeper County, {{two of which}} were purchased by John Strode. Barbour's manufacturing interests extended from cotton gins to the making of nails. On May 29, 1805, the Virginia Herald carried an advertisement for Barbour's <b>cut</b> <b>nail</b> manufactory in Fredericksburg, Virginia [...] "where they will sell, Cut and wrought Nails, Brads, Springs, Sadler's Tacks of all sizes". Fredericksburg land tax records from 1805 indicate Barbour rented properties owned by John Brownlow and Charles Julian. Records also indicate Barbour acquired a merchants license in 1806 from George W. B. Spooner, Commissioner of Revenue for the District of Fredericksburg, for the sum of $15. Barbour was a resident of Fredericksburg until 1808 when he relocated to Petersburg.|$|E
30|$|Fixed {{effects of}} the three {{recommended}} models explained 51 – 60  % {{of the variation in}} MOE, and random effects a further 8 – 10  %. The unexplained variation could be due to other factors, such as knots, bark, and other wood defects not examined here. Moisture content may also have been a contributing factor. Moisture content of Douglas-fir timber when green is about 45  % (Rietz 1999) and values of 24  % are typical for air-dried timber. Though the latter moisture content, which was used in this study, may appear to be high, {{it should be noted that}} “Douglas-fir is unique among all softwood species in that it is naturally dimensionally stable, having the ability to season well in position. Many builders prefer to <b>cut,</b> <b>nail</b> and fasten Douglas-fir in the “green” or unseasoned condition, allowing it to air dry during construction” (WWPA 2002). Therefore, the MC values used in this study are accepted values, and appropriate. Beyond wood-related factors, further variation could be due to human factors associated with application of the acoustic tools. For example, Paradis et al. (2013) demonstrated that acoustic velocities are sensitive to probe depth, with increased acoustic velocity (of about 0.25  km s− 1) associated with increased penetration depth (from 1.5  cm to 3.0  cm); therefore, with a team of people facilitating data collection, it is highly possible that there was variation amongst operators. However, the somewhat lower acoustic velocity of logs in this study, in comparison to those reported by Wang et al. (2013), are thought to be due to age differences of the study trees, with velocity, and MOE, being lower for younger trees.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of cheap wire nails, the use of wrought iron for nail making quickly declined, as more slowly did the production of <b>cut</b> <b>nails.</b> In the United States, in 1892 more steel-wire nails were produced than <b>cut</b> <b>nails.</b> In 1913, 90% of manufactured nails were wire nails. Nails went from being rare and precious to being a cheap mass-produced commodity. Today almost all nails are manufactured from wire, but the term [...] "wire nail" [...] has come to refer to smaller nails, often available in a wider, more precise range of gauges than is typical for larger common and finish nails.|$|R

40|$|Test {{excavations}} {{were conducted}} at Site 41 FY 111 by Alan J. Wormser {{of the cultural}} resources staff at the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT). The excavation was completed between March 30, and April 2, 1987, {{as part of a}} bypass project along SH 71 north of La Grange, Fayette County, Texas. Although the prehistoric remains were scattered over a broad area, most of the site was concentrated on top of knoll of cherty gravel deposits. Sixteen 1 X 1 meter test units were excavated to depths of between 10 and 50 cm below the surface. This resulted in the recovery of 3474 pieces of chipped lithic debris, 9 cores, 8 tested cobbles (cobbles with minimal flake removal), and 2872 fragments of burned rock. There were also 2 projectile points, 1 gouge, 3 other bifaces, 4 modified flakes, and 1 <b>cut</b> <b>nail.</b> Only one of the items, a Pedernales dart point, was diagnostic of any particular time period (ca. 2000 B. C. to A. D. 1). Most of the cultural material was concentrated within the upper 20 cm of deposits. No cultural features were found and the field containing the site appeared to have been terraced to control erosion. The site was used prehistorically as a source of chert. Major activities at the site included primary reduction of chert, and heating of rock for cooking. Due to the superficial nature of the deposits, lack of features, probable disturbance by artificial terracing, and the ubiquitous nature of similar quarry/workshop sites within the region, 41 FY 111 is not considered to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, and does not warrant designation as a State Historic Landmark...|$|E
