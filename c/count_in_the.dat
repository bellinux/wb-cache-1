5|$|Burton next {{argued that}} his {{prosecution}} violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Specifically, Burton argued that his acquittal {{on the third}} <b>count</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first trial barred his conviction on the third and seventh counts in the second trial. The Court rejected this argument. The Court held that the earlier and later counts did not describe the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Ford ran for {{lieutenant}} governor, {{this time}} against {{the wishes of}} Breathitt and Combs, whose pick was state attorney general Robert Matthews. Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes, 0.2% of the total vote <b>count</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary. He ran an independent campaign and won {{in the general election}} even as Combs-Breathitt pick Henry Ward lost the race for governor to Republican Louie B. Nunn. Republicans and Democrats split the state offices, with five going to Republicans and four going to Democrats.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} <b>count</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood falls {{below the}} normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, {{it is generally}} not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the platelet count will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E

5|$|The 1963 season {{unfolded}} for the Mets {{much like}} the previous year's, though they lost only eight games to begin the season, rather than nine, but they still finished 51–111, in last place. One highlight, though it did not <b>count</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> standings, was the Mayor's Trophy Game on June 20 at Yankee Stadium. Stengel played to win; the Yankees under Houk possibly less so, and the Mets beat the Yankees, 6–2.|$|E
5|$|Though Lieder {{herself has}} not {{specified}} a new {{date for the}} object's return, many groups have taken up her idea and cited their own dates.

Several writers published books connecting the encounter with 2012. Despite that date having passed, many websites still contend that Nibiru/Planet X is en route to Earth.|$|E
5|$|On the Sunday, Jenkyns was {{involved}} in an incident after he and an acquaintance staked a quart of beer on a bicycle race. Solihull Police Court later heard how, after Jenkyns lost the race, he knocked his opponent off his bicycle, hit another man, {{and returned to the}} public house where he struck a third man in the face. He was convicted on three counts of assault, and fined 20s plus costs on each <b>count.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following day's visit to Everton, Small Heath had Oliver and Charles Partridge to thank for the score being restricted to 5–0.|$|E

The host nation, Yugoslavia, collected its first-ever medal at the Winter Olympics: a silver by alpine skier Jure Franko in the men's giant slalom. This was the third time that the Winter Olympics host team failed to win a gold medal, after France in 1924 and Switzerland in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Universe {{published}} {{its first}} {{issue in the}} midst of this publishing boom. The issue, in digest format, was dated JuneJuly 1953, and was priced at 50 cents. This was higher than any of its competition, but it also had the highest page <b>count</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field at the time, with 196 pages. The initial editorial team was Leo Margulies as publisher, and Sam Merwin as editor; this was a combination familiar to science fiction fans from their years together at Thrilling Wonder Stories, which Merwin edited from 1945 to 1951. The publisher, King-Size Publications, also produced The Saint Detective Magazine, which was popular, so Fantastic Universe enjoyed good distribution from the starta key factor in a magazine's success. The first issue included stories by Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, and Ray Bradbury. According to Donald Tuck, the author of an early SF encyclopaedia, the magazine kept a fairly high quality through Merwin's departure after a year, and through the subsequent brief period of caretaker editorship by Beatrice Jones. Margulies took over the editor's post with the May 1954 issue.|$|E
5|$|Wrestle Kingdom 9 {{featured}} {{two main}} event matches. In the first, Shinsuke Nakamura defended the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Kota Ibushi. Ibushi ridiculed Nakamura and used {{several of the}} champion's moves, including the corner vibration boot, the reverse powerslam, and the Boma Ye knee strike. Nakamura, responding aggressively, {{kicked out of the}} latter at one. Nakamura used a variety of knee-based strikes, and Ibushi's attacks included a standing corkscrew moonsault, a roundhouse kick, an elevated sit-out powerbomb, and a double stomp to the chest. Ibushi also jumped on the top rope, grabbing Nakamura on the apron, and German-suplexed him back into the ring for a two <b>count.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> finishing sequence, Ibushi got up immediately after receiving a knee from the second rope {{to the back of his}} head; both attempted the Boma Ye, but Nakamura recovered first with the Landslide and then the Boma Ye knee to retain the title at 20 minutes and 12 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers bumped fists.|$|E

25|$|Some jurisdictions {{that hold}} runoff {{elections}} allow absentee (only) voters to submit IRV ballots, because {{the interval between}} votes is too short for {{a second round of}} absentee voting.
