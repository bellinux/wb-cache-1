5|$|Pacific {{populations of}} the false <b>catshark</b> were once {{regarded}} as a separate species, P. acrales. However, morphological comparisons have failed to find any consistent differences between P. microdon and P. acrales, leading {{to the conclusion that}} there is only one species of false <b>catshark.</b> The closest relatives of the false <b>catshark</b> are the gollumsharks (Gollum). Pseudotriakis and Gollum share a number of morphological similarities. Phylogenetic analysis using protein-coding genes has found that the amount of genetic divergence between these taxa is less than that between some other shark species within the same genus. This result suggests that the many autapomorphies (unique traits) of the false <b>catshark</b> evolved relatively recently, and supports the grouping of Pseudotriakis and Gollum together in the family Pseudotriakidae.|$|E
5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan {{described the}} tiger <b>catshark</b> in a 1904 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Annals and Magazine of Natural History, based on two specimens presented to the British Museum by J. F. Queckett. He placed the species in the genus Scyllium (a synonym of Scyliorhinus) and gave it the specific epithet , because the type specimens were reportedly collected off the Natal coast of South Africa (though there is suspicion that they were mislabelled and actually came from Algoa Bay). Later authors reassigned this species to the genus Halaelurus. The lined <b>catshark</b> (Halaelurus lineatus) was once treated as conspecific to the tiger <b>catshark,</b> until it {{was described as a}} separate species in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} <b>catshark</b> feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and {{invertebrates}} from on or near the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger <b>catshark</b> is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>catsharks</b> (Scyliorhinidae) and the finback <b>catsharks</b> in {{the genus}} Proscyllium {{are the only}} members of their order that lay eggs.

50|$|<b>Catsharks</b> are ground sharks of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae. They {{are one of the}} largest {{families}} of sharks with around 160 species placed in 17 genera. Although they are generally known as <b>catsharks,</b> many species are commonly called dogfish or gato. Like most bottom feeders, they feed on benthic invertebrates and smaller fish. <b>Catsharks</b> are not harmful to humans.|$|R
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak <b>catshark</b> feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak <b>catshark</b> is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Only nine quagga <b>catshark</b> {{specimens}} {{have been}} recorded. In addition to Alcock's type specimen, four males were trawled from off the eastern Somalian coast {{by the research}} ship RV Anton Bruun in 1964. Four more individuals, two male and two female, were found amongst the contents of commercial fishing trawls conducted off Quilon, India in 2010. A male specimen reported from the Gulf of Aden in 1939 was later re-identified as a speckled <b>catshark</b> (H. boesemani).|$|E
5|$|Constantine Samuel Rafinesque briefly {{described}} the blackmouth <b>catshark</b> in his 1810 Caratteri di alcuni nuovi generi e nuove specie di animali e piante della Sicilia: con varie osservazioni sopra i medesimi, wherein he referenced the distinctive black interior of its mouth (from which the specific epithet melastomus is derived). No type specimen was designated. This species {{may also be}} called the black-mouthed dogfish. A 2005 phylogenetic analysis that included five Galeus species, based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found that G.melastomus forms a clade with G.murinus, apart from the clade of G.eastmani, G.gracilis, and G.sauteri. The oldest documented blackmouth <b>catshark</b> fossils come from the northern Apennines and date to the Lower Pliocene (5.3â€“3.6 Ma).|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy <b>catshark</b> adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced}} in the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The cloudy <b>catshark</b> is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with bottom fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} bottom longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The bottom trawl fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy catsharks annually, which are also discarded.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the tiger}} <b>catshark</b> is caught {{incidentally}} by bottom trawlers, recreational anglers, and rarely squid fishers. Though edible, {{it is not}} a valued catch and is usually discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data to assess its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Slow-swimming but active, the blackmouth <b>catshark</b> is a generalist that preys on a {{wide variety}} of crustaceans, cephalopods, and fishes. Its visual and electroreceptive systems are adept at {{tracking}} moving, bioluminescent prey. This species is oviparous, with females producing batches of up to 13 egg cases throughout the year. Because of its abundance, the blackmouth <b>catshark</b> forms a substantial part of the bycatch of deepwater commercial fisheries across much of its range. It has low economic value and is usually discarded, though the largest sharks may be marketed for meat and leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as there is no indication that its numbers have declined despite fishing pressure.|$|E
40|$|Sexual dimorphisms in head morphology, {{integument}} and dentition of some elasmobranch {{species have}} been established. These dimorphisms are reportedly linked to reproductive behaviour, whereby male biting during copulation results in a dimorphism in head dimensions and dentition and, as a result, differences in skin thickness. The findings for Scyliorhinus canicula from the Solent support the findings of other authors, whereby adult males were found to possess longer, narrower mouths and a longer head than adult females. Juvenile male <b>catsharks</b> were found to possess a longer mouth than females. No head, mouth or jaw dimorphisms for hatchling <b>catsharks</b> were found. Adult male <b>catsharks</b> were found to possess unicuspid teeth, with large central cusps, {{in contrast to the}} pentacuspid form of female and immature <b>catsharks.</b> A sexual dimorphism was found in the tooth row numbers for hatchling and adult <b>catsharks,</b> with hatchling males possessing a greater number of tooth rows than hatchling females on the lower jaw and adult males possessing a greater number of tooth rows than adult females in the upper jaw. Seasonal comparisons were made to ascertain whether morphological changes occurred that could indicate a mating season for the Solent population of S. canicula. Adult head length, mouth length and mouth width were found to be significantly different. Adult males sampled in all seasons possessed a longer mouth than females sampled in all seasons, whilst the lower jaw length was significantly greater for adult males in all seasons compared to adult females. Juvenile female <b>catsharks</b> were found to possess a thicker epidermis than juvenile male <b>catsharks</b> in all seasons of the year, whilst adult females possessed a thicker epidermal layer than adult males, findings not previously reported in this species. Adult females were found to possess a thicker dermal layer in all seasons compared to adult male <b>catsharks.</b> Adult females also possessed wider and longer dermal denticles on the pectoral fins than adult males. Hatchling <b>catsharks</b> had a greater dermal denticle density on both fins indicating the possession of smaller dermal denticles than hatchling females. A sexual dimorphism was found in the Ampullae of Lorenzini with male <b>catsharks</b> possessing a greater number of alveoli than adult females, possibly both an ecological and reproductive adaptation. The seasonal and sexual dimorphisms found in this study do not directly indicate a specific mating season for this species in the Solent.

5|$|The Izak <b>catshark</b> is {{harmless}} and of no commercial value. It {{is regularly}} caught incidentally (and discarded) by a bottom trawl fishery targeting hake south of Cape Town. In contrast to most cartilaginous fishes, its {{numbers have been}} increasing {{in the presence of}} commercial fishing. The reasons for this may include its high reproductive rate, its breeding in less-fished shallower waters, its hardiness allowing for high post-capture survival, and its opportunistic diet. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has consequently listed the Izak <b>catshark</b> under Least Concern, while still noting that it merits continued population monitoring because of its highly restricted range.|$|E
5|$|The blackmouth <b>catshark</b> (Galeus melastomus) is {{a species}} of <b>catshark,</b> {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, common in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Senegal, {{including}} the Mediterranean Sea. It is typically found over the continental slope at depths of , on or near muddy bottoms. The youngest sharks generally inhabit shallower water than the older juveniles and adults. This slim-bodied species is characterized by the black interior of its mouth, a marbled pattern of pale-edged brownish saddles or blotches along its back and tail, and a prominent saw-toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin. It reaches lengths of , with sharks in the Atlantic growing larger than those in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth <b>catshark</b> swings {{its head}} from side to side to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, and less on smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is {{greatest}} along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited by most of the organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the blackmouth <b>catshark</b> has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E

5|$|With flabby {{muscles and}} a large oily liver, the false <b>catshark</b> is a slow-moving {{predator}} and scavenger {{of a variety of}} fishes and invertebrates. It has a viviparous mode of reproduction, featuring an unusual form of oophagy in which the developing embryos consume ova or egg fragments released by the mother and use the yolk material to replenish their external yolk sacs for later use. This species typically gives birth to two pups at a time. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of the false <b>catshark.</b> While neither targeted by fisheries nor commercially valuable, it is caught incidentally by longlines and bottom trawls, and its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to population depletion.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, the blackmouth <b>catshark</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} sharks over the upper and middle continental slope. It is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups. Relatively slow, this shark swims with strong eel-like (anguilliform) undulations of its body. It often cruises just above the sea floor, perhaps taking advantage of the ground effect (a reduction in the drag on a wing when close to the ground) to save energy. It has also been seen resting motionless on the bottom. Known predators of the blackmouth <b>catshark</b> include the kitefin shark (Dalatias licha) and the European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus). Parasites that have been documented from this species include the tapeworm Ditrachybothridium macrocephalum and the protist Eimeria palavensis.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal in habits, after dusk {{the leopard}} <b>catshark</b> hunts for small, benthic bony fishes and {{invertebrates}} in shallow water. In daytime, it generally rests inside caves and crevices, sometimes in groups. This species {{has been documented}} ambushing spawning chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi) within their spawning grounds. Reproduction is oviparous and proceeds year-round. Females produce rectangular, light-colored egg capsules two at a time, attaching them to structures on the sea floor. Small and harmless, the leopard <b>catshark</b> adapts well to captivity and is often exhibited in public aquariums. It is caught by commercial and recreational fishers as bycatch, and often killed as a pest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; its numbers {{do not seem to}} be declining, but heavy human activity occurs within its native waters. The possibly fragmented nature of its distribution also merits caution for each local population.|$|E

25|$|Redspotted <b>catsharks</b> have a {{negative}} economic impact on humans. They feed heavily on near shore benthic crustaceans. This is a detriment to commercial fisherman because crustaceans in this area have a large economic importance. <b>Catsharks</b> are also a frequent bycatch of nearshore fishing trawlers, which, while not economically significant, can cause damage to nets as well as time lost in removing the bycatch from the viable catch.|$|R
50|$|Some shark species, such as <b>catsharks,</b> Scyliorbinus carnicula, {{exhibit a}} {{different}} form of convenience polyandry. These sharks fertilize internally, but then lay their fertilized eggs onto algae or rocky surfaces. <b>Catsharks</b> {{tend to have a}} prolonged mating season, allowing females to store sperm and lay eggs hundreds of days after copulation from multiple males, displaying a high frequency of multiple paternity within a single clutch.|$|R
5|$|Some {{species are}} oviparous {{like most other}} fish, laying their eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, an egg case with the {{consistency}} of leather protects the developing embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. Once empty, the egg case {{is known as a}} mermaid's purse, and can wash up on shore. Oviparous sharks include the horn shark, <b>catshark,</b> Port Jackson shark, and swellshark.|$|E
5|$|The quagga <b>catshark</b> is {{harmless}} {{and is not}} {{utilized by}} humans. It is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in bottom trawls and potentially other gear; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters, though specific data on this species is lacking. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} <b>catshark</b> suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18â€“25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false <b>catshark</b> found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E
