Gillies in {{drafting}} {{a history of}} the early development of hydro-electricity in Tasmania, pioneered by Gillies' father, James Hynde Gillies (1861 - 1942). J. H. Gillies, a metallurgist, developed an electrolytic process for extracting zinc from <b>complex</b> <b>ores</b> and in 1908 he started the <b>Complex</b> <b>Ores</b> Co. in Melbourne. He proposed to establish works in Tasmania, using hydro-electric power from the waters of the Great Lake and the Shannon River. The hydro scheme was suggested by Harold Bisdee. a Midlands land owner, and Alexander McAulay, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Tasmania. The project was authorised in 1909 by the <b>Complex</b> <b>Ores</b> Act, which also allocated a site at Electrona, North West Bay for the refining works. A subsidiary of the <b>Complex</b> <b>Ores</b> Co., the Hydro-Electric Power and Metallurgical Co. was established and on 17 December 1910, at an informal ceremony, Mrs. McAulay turned the first sod for the water power development on land owned by Professor McAulay. A severe winner and other problems delayed work however. In 1914 the Hydro-Electric undertaking was sold to the Government. In 1916 the Government authorised a rival firm, Amalgamated Zinc, to establish a zinc works at Risdon and agreed to supply hydro-electricity for it. Gillies retained a Carbide Electro Products project but this did not start producing until 1921 and in 1924 was taken over by the Hydro-Electricity Department. The draft history was based on original records of the <b>Complex</b> <b>Ores</b> Co. and the Hydro-Electric Power and Metallurgy Co. as well as Gillies' private papers, and includes some extracts, but the original papers were burnt after A.

40|$|Due to the {{depletion}} of coarser grained <b>ores,</b> more mineralogically <b>complex</b> <b>ores</b> are being treated. These <b>complex</b> <b>ores</b> usually have finer grained valuable minerals. Liberation of these finer grained valuable minerals lies in grinding finer. Grinding to these fine sizes is energy intensive and using standard ball mills are energy inefficient at these sizes (P 80 < 75 μm). Therefore, stirred mills are becoming increasingly prevalent in the mineral processing industry. In order to optimize these mills, the effects and mechanisms of the significant variables need to be understood. This project investigated operating parameters against performance in a laboratory scale vertical stirred mill (Deswik mill), in an ultrafine grinding (UFG) application of MG 2 reef in the bushveld igneous complex. The operating variables that were investigated are stirrer speed, solids concentration, media size and media filling. The Kwade stress energy model was tested on the grinding results.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the metal-bearing mineral grains within a particulate ore prepared for leaching, {{and the impact of}} this spatial heterogeneity on overall extraction efficiency is of key importance to a mining industry that must continuously target ever-reducing grades and more <b>complex</b> <b>ore</b> bodies.

We present an in situ analysis using X-ray computed tomography to quantify the rates of volume reduction of sulfide mineral grains in low grade agglomerated copper bearing ores during a miniature laboratory scale column leaching experiment. The data shows the scale of the heterogeneity in the leaching behaviour, with an overall reduction of sulphide mineral grains of 50 %, but that this value masks significant mm 3 to cm 3 scale variability in reduction.

40|$|As {{the trends}} in mineral {{processing}} move towards the beneficiation of finer grained and more <b>complex</b> <b>ore</b> bodies, so too do the methods {{needed to understand}} and model these processes. During the heap leaching of low-grade ore bodies, the crack distribution and mineral dissemination in ore particles are important characteristics that determine the performance of sub-processes, such as the diffusion of reagents {{in and out of}} particle pores. Recent developments in X-ray computed tomography (CT) as an advanced diagnostic and nondestructive technique have indicated the potential for the technology to become a tool for the acquisition of 3 -D mineralogical and structural data. The spatial distribution of cracks and mineral dissemination in particles derived from a sphalerite ore in the Northern Cape, South Africa, was characterized using a high-resolution industrial X-ray CT system. This paper describes the use of image analysis techniques including image segmentation, which uses a combination of thresholding and other methods to characterize and quantify crack and mineral dissemination in the sphalerite particles.

40|$|After initial {{interest}} in it during the initial rush, the Tui portion of the Te Aroha field was largely ignored until Clem Cornes made a discovery in 1885 that produced great hopes for obtaining gold and silver. Investors were quickly interested, but raising sufficient capital was a continual problem; although in time British investors became involved, all the syndicates and companies were under-funded. In addition, there was no agreed method to treat the refractory ore, which was heavily impregnated with base metals, and several processes were tried without success. In addition, the topography of the area required {{the construction of an}} access track and, in 1889, of an aerial tramway to transport ore from high on the mountain to the flat.
