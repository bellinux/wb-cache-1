25|$|In 1930, Henrik Sjögren (1899–1986), an {{ophthalmologist}} in Jönköping, Sweden, {{observed a}} patient with low secretions from the lacrimal and salivary glands. Sjögren introduced the term keratoconjunctivitis sicca for the symptom of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis). In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis, describing 19 females, {{most of whom were}} postmenopausal and had arthritis, showing clinical and pathological manifestations of the syndrome. Sjögren clarifies that keratoconjunctivitis sicca, resulting from water deficiency, had no relation to xerophthalmia, resulting from vitamin A deficiency. Sjögren's thesis was not well received as the Board of Examiners criticized some <b>clinical</b> <b>aspects.</b>|$|E

INNOCENZI Aim of our study is to evaluate the modifications of the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> and of {{the quality of life in}} 115 patients (64 male, 51 females, 19 years average age) affected by intermediate acne treated with four different antibiotics (lymecycline, doxycycline, methacycline, azythromycin). Our study clearly showed that azythromycin, doxycycline, lymecycline and methacycline are effective in the treatment of the acne, considerably improving the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> of the patients and the quality of life. There were not significant differences concerning sex. Regarding quality of life, female subjects showed, at the end of the therapy, a more evident improvement compared with male patients. The subjects between 25 and the 39 years presented, at the end of the treatment, a remarkable improvement of the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> compared with patient of different age. In conclusion systemic antibiotics therapy determinates improvement of the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> and of the quality of life in patients with intermediate acne. Such improvement is not related to sex. Subjects aged between 25 and the 39 years have a most important improvement compared with patients of different age...|$|R

25|$|In 1953, {{while working}} in New York City, Fanti started the {{psychotherapy}} of a diplomat who was representing his country {{in a series of}} international conferences. His treatment was a man of success with a brilliant career but anguished to the extreme of considering his life senseless. Fanti and his patient completed nine sessions of 45 minutes. Suddenly the diplomat was transferred to another country due to professional requirements and he therefore interrupted his treatment. A few months later, Fanti received a thankful letter from his client for all the work done with him but announcing he had committed suicide. This tragic event disturbed Fanti profoundly. He reflected about the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspects</b> of his client's case, trying to understand what he should have done differently so as to avoid his client committing suicide. He had a sense that if during those 15 days the psychoanalysis had lasted they could have done more frequent and longer sessions, his client {{would have been able to}} discharge enough anxiety as to permit him to pull through temporally. At a later stage he could have continued a psychoanalysis to seek a definitive equilibrium.|$|E
