25|$|The {{most common}} {{diagnostic}} dilemma in otherwise normal boys is distinguishing a retractile testis from a testis {{that will not}} descend spontaneously into the scrotum. Retractile testes are more common than truly undescended testes and {{do not need to}} be operated on. In normal males, as the <b>cremaster</b> <b>muscle</b> relaxes or contracts, the testis moves lower or higher ("retracts") in the scrotum. This cremasteric reflex is much more active in infant boys than older men. A retractile testis high in the scrotum can be difficult to distinguish from a position in the lower inguinal canal. Though there are various maneuvers used to do so, such as using a cross-legged position, soaping the examiner's fingers, or examining in a warm bath, the benefit of surgery in these cases can be a matter of clinical judgment.|$|E

Electron microscopy shows interendothelial gaps; the media is massively infiltrated with blood components and fibrin. The medial smooth muscle cells are stretched and at times necrotic; inflammatory cells are scarce. On the basis of these features the lesion was named focal arteriolar insudation (FAI).

BaH 4 is a 69 kDa protein with a pI of 5. 3. It was recognized by antibodies raised against hemorrhagic metalloproteinase BaH 1 isolated from B. asper venom, with a reaction of partial immunologic identity. BaH 4 shows proteolytic activity on biotinylated casein, hide powder azure and fibrin, although having lower activity than crude B. asper venom and metalloproteinase BaP 1 {{isolated from the}} same venom. BaH 4 hydrolyzed fibronectin, laminin and type IV collagen in vitro, albeit at a relatively high enzyme:substrate ratio. Proteolytic activity was inhibited by chelating agents and 2 -mercaptoethanol, but not by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Prominent hemorrhage developed in gastrocnemius and <b>cremaster</b> <b>muscles</b> after administration of BaH 4. Moreover, it induced lethality in mice after intravenous injection, with an LD 50 of 0. 37 μg/g.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors probed endothelium-dependent {{dilation}} and {{endothelial cell}} Ca 2 + handling in myogenically active resistance arteries. METHODS: First-order arteries {{were removed from}} rat <b>cremaster</b> <b>muscles,</b> cannulated, and pressurized (75 mmHg). Vessel diameter and endothelial cell Ca 2 + were monitored using confocal microscopy, and arterial ultrastructure was determined using electron microscopy. RESULTS: Acetylcholine (ACh) stimulated elevations and oscillations in endothelial cell Ca 2 +, and concentration-dependently dilated arteries with myogenic tone. NO-independent dilation was blocked by 35 mM K+. Combined IK(Ca) (1 microM TRAM- 34) and SK(Ca) (100 nM apamin) blockade partially inhibited NO-independent relaxations, with residual relaxations sensitive to BK(Ca) or cytochrome P- 450 inhibition (100 nM iberiotoxin, and 20 microM 17 -ODYA or 10 microM MS-PPOH). 11, 12 -EET stimulated iberiotoxin-sensitive dilation, but did not affect endothelial cell Ca 2 +. 15 mM K+ evoked dilation sensitive to inhibition of K(IR) (30 microM Ba 2 +) and Na+/K+-ATPase (10 microM ouabain), whereas these blockers did not affect ACh-mediated dilations. Homo- and heterocellular gap junctions were identified in radial sections through arteries. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that rises in endothelial cell Ca 2 + stimulate SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels, leading to hyperpolarization and dilation, likely due to electrical coupling. In addition, a component was unmasked following SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) blockade, attributable to activation of BK(Ca) channels by cytochrome P- 450 metabolites...|$|R

Labeled NRA-spinal neurons {{at the level of the}} decussation of the corticospinal tract were most numerous after tracer injections into the thoracic and upper lumbar cord. They were medium-sized and had axons that descended through the contralateral cord. A group of small neurons was labeled in the NRA immediately rostral to the decussation of the corticospinal tract after cervical and thoracic, but not after lumbar injections. This group projected mainly via an ipsilateral pathway. The main projections from the caudal NRA involved motoneurons in the thoracic and upper-lumbar cord that supply abdominal wall and <b>cremaster</b> <b>muscles.</b> Pelvic floor motoneurons did not receive substantial input. NRA-spinal projections, especially those involving the upper lumbar cord, were sexually dimorphic, being more extensive in males than in females.

The unique features of the caudal NRA-spinal pathway in the mouse are discussed in the framework of possible functions of this system, such as mating behavior and related social behaviors, parturition, thermoregulation, and control of balance.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that adenosine and nitric oxide can be sensed by capillaries and are implicated in the remote arteriolar dilatation initiated by muscle contraction. We also explored a role for KATP channel activity in this response. Small bundles of muscle fibres underlying a group of capillaries in <b>cremaster</b> <b>muscles</b> of anaesthetized hamsters were electrically stimulated to contract for 2 min at each of 2, 4 and 8 Hz. Diameter changes were measured in the inflow arteriole {{to the group of}} capillaries after muscle contraction in {{the presence or absence of}} 10 − 6 m xanthine amine congener (XAC) to block A 1 and A 2 adenosine receptors, 10 − 4 or 10 − 3 mNω-nitro-l-arginine (LNNA) to block nitric oxide production, or 10 − 5 m glibenclamide to block KATP channel activity. Dilatations were unchanged with XAC (3. 0 ± 0. 5, 3. 9 ± 0. 7 and 6. 1 ± 1. 0 μm), but were significantly reduced with LNNA (to 1. 8 ± 0. 6, 3. 5 ± 0. 7 and 4. 9 ± 0. 7 μm) or glibenclamide (to 0. 4 ± 0. 3, 0. 8 ± 0. 7 and 1. 9 ± 0. 6 μm). Neither KATP channel activity nor nitric oxide was required for transmission or manifestation of the dilator response. Thus, muscle contraction can be sensed by capillaries and the signalling mechanism for the ensuing remote dilatation depends on KATP channel activity and on NO, but not adenosine. Local application of 10 − 4 m adenosine, 10 − 4 m sodium nitroprusside or 10 − 5 m pinacidil directly to capillaries initiated remote arteriolar dilatations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{suffering}} from diabetes show defective bacterial clearance. This study investigates {{the effects of}} elevated plasma glucose levels during diabetes on leukocyte recruitment and function in established models of inflammation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Diabetes was induced in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice by intravenous alloxan (causing severe hyperglycemia), or by high fat diet (moderate hyperglycemia). Leukocyte recruitment was studied in anaesthetized mice using intravital microscopy of exposed <b>cremaster</b> <b>muscles,</b> where numbers of rolling, adherent and emigrated leukocytes were quantified before and during exposure to the inflammatory chemokine MIP- 2 (0. 5 nM). During basal conditions, prior to addition of chemokine, the adherent and emigrated leukocytes were increased in both alloxan- (62 ± 18 % and 85 ± 21 %, respectively) and high fat diet-induced (77 ± 25 % and 86 ± 17 %, respectively) diabetes compared to control mice. MIP- 2 induced leukocyte emigration in all groups, albeit significantly more cells emigrated in alloxan-treated mice (15. 3 ± 1. 0) compared to control (8. 0 ± 1. 1) mice. Bacterial clearance was followed for 10 days after subcutaneous injection of bioluminescent S. aureus using non-invasive IVIS imaging, and the inflammatory response was assessed by Myeloperoxidase-ELISA and confocal imaging. The phagocytic ability of leukocytes was assessed using LPS-coated fluorescent beads and flow cytometry. Despite efficient leukocyte recruitment, alloxan-treated mice demonstrated an impaired ability to clear bacterial infection, which we found correlated to a 50 % decreased phagocytic ability of leukocytes in diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that reduced ability to clear bacterial infections observed during experimentally induced diabetes is not due to reduced leukocyte recruitment since sustained hyperglycemia results in increased levels of adherent and emigrated leukocytes in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Instead, decreased phagocytic ability observed for leukocytes isolated from diabetic mice might account for the impaired bacterial clearance...|$|R

Leukocyte rolling flux and rolling velocity were assessed by intravital microscopy of the <b>cremaster</b> <b>muscles</b> of wild-type mice following perivenular micropipette injections of a control (LSIGRL) or PAR 2 -activating (SLIGRL) oligopeptide. Injection of SLIGRL increased mean rolling leukocyte flux fraction from 34 � 11 to 71 � 24 % (p < 0. 05) and decreased mean rolling velocity from 63 � 29 to 32 � 2 �m/s (p < 0. 05). No significant changes occurred with control peptide injection. To further evaluate the role of PAR 2 in inflammatory responses, PAR 2 -deficient mice were generated by gene targeting and homologous recombination. Perivenular injections of SLIGRL resulted in only a small increase in rolling leukocyte flux fraction (from 21 � 8 to 30 � 2 %) and no change in rolling velocity.

We found that the average rolling velocity in venules was not different in ICAM- 1 null mice (4. 7 �m/s) compared with wild-type mice (5. 1 �m/s). Similarly, leukocyte adhesion efficiency in ICAM- 1 null mice (0. 11 � 0. 01 mm) was similar to that in Mac- 1 �/ � (0. 12 � 0. 03 mm) mice but significantly increased compared with that in LFA- 1 �/ � (0. 08 � 0. 01 mm) mice and significantly reduced from that in wild type (0. 26 � 0. 04 mm). When both LFA- 1 and ICAM- 1 were blocked, rolling velocity increased, and adhesion efficiency and arrest decreased.

40|$|There is {{need for}} a {{consistent}} definition of structures caudal to the testis that variously are termed 'gubernaculum testis' {{as a basis for}} understanding the emergence and sexually dimorphic further growth and differentiation of this specifically mammalian structure. Rodent fetuses undergo a stage of development during which there is almost complete unanimity as to the definition of the 'gubernaculum' as a papilla-like structure (often called conus inguinalis) protruding from the area of the internal inguinal ring. This structure shows at least 3 readily distinguishable components before birth. Postnatally, the papilla-like gubernaculum starts to undergo inversion to become the tunica of the sac-like processus vaginalis. The 3 components of the fetal gubernaculum develop further uninterruptedly, but with a different spatial arrangement, as parts of the wall of a sac rather than as parts of a papilla-like structure. Comparison of this process in rodents with that in other mammals (pig, horse, man) revealed an essentially identical emergence of a papilla-shaped gubernaculum with similar constituents. Initial development of the processus vaginalis also began with the inversion of the gubernacular papilla. Cattle fetuses appeared exceptional as outgrowth of the processus vaginalis occurred without a preceding papilla-shaped gubernaculum {{in the area of the}} inner inguinal ring. The findings lead to the following conclusions. (1) In rodents, the whole of the postnatally developing processus vaginalis, including therefore its cremasteric muscles but without the attached genital mesentery, is to be viewed as the male postnatal gubernaculum. Sexual differentiation of the gubernacular primordia includes a sex-specific effect on the morphogenesis of all constituents of the processus vaginalis sac including cremasteric muscle cells.
