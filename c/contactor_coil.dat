50|$|Starters using {{magnetic}} contactors usually derive {{the power}} supply for the <b>contactor</b> <b>coil</b> {{from the same}} source as the motor supply. An auxiliary contact from the contactor is used to maintain the <b>contactor</b> <b>coil</b> energized after the start command for the motor has been released. If a momentary loss of supply voltage occurs, the contactor will open and not close again until a new start command is given. this prevents restarting of the motor after a power failure. This connection also provides a small degree of protection against low power supply voltage and loss of a phase. However since contactor coils will hold the circuit closed with as little as 80% of normal voltage applied to the coil, {{this is not a}} primary means of protecting motors from low voltage operation.|$|E
50|$|When current {{passes through}} the electromagnet, a {{magnetic}} field is produced, which attracts the moving core of the contactor. The electromagnet coil draws more current initially, until its inductance increases when the metal core enters the coil. The moving contact is propelled by the moving core; the force developed by the electromagnet holds the moving and fixed contacts together. When the <b>contactor</b> <b>coil</b> is de-energized, gravity or a spring returns the electromagnet core to its initial position and opens the contacts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an electronic device that enables AC contactors to ride through power quality disturbances. The proposed device {{is connected to}} the <b>contactor</b> <b>coil</b> and consists of a power conversion excitation and hold-in circuit, a control circuit, an immunity circuit and a shutdown circuit. It does not disturb contactor operation, is easy to use and can be built from cheap, commercially available components. Experimental tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed electronic device for improving the immunity of AC contactors during power quality disturbances, particularly voltage dips...|$|E
50|$|Sometimes an {{economizer}} circuit is also installed {{to reduce the}} power required to keep a contactor closed; an auxiliary contact reduces coil current after the contactor closes. A somewhat greater amount of power is required to initially close a contactor than is required to keep it closed. Such a circuit can save {{a substantial amount of}} power and allow the energized coil to stay cooler. Economizer circuits are nearly always applied on direct-current <b>contactor</b> <b>coils</b> and on large alternating current <b>contactor</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R
50|$|Contactors {{are often}} used to provide central control of large {{lighting}} installations, such as an office building or retail building. To reduce power consumption in the <b>contactor</b> <b>coils,</b> latching <b>contactors</b> are used, which have two operating coils. One coil, momentarily energized, closes the power circuit contacts, which are then mechanically held closed; the second coil opens the contacts.|$|R

50|$|A basic {{contactor}} {{will have}} a coil input (which may be driven by either an AC or DC supply depending on the <b>contactor</b> design). The <b>coil</b> may be energized at the same voltage as a motor the contactor is controlling, or may be separately controlled with a lower coil voltage better suited to control by programmable controllers and lower-voltage pilot devices. Certain <b>contactors</b> have series <b>coils</b> connected in the motor circuit; these are used, for example, for automatic acceleration control, where {{the next stage of}} resistance is not cut out until the motor current has dropped.|$|R

40|$|A {{voltage dip}} is an {{important}} power quality (PQ) disturbance mainly caused by short circuit faults. It can cause malfunctioning of sensitive equipment {{that leads to the}} disruption of industrial processes, which usually result in substantial financial losses. One way to solve the problems caused by voltage dips is to identify the weakest link of a process and make the manufacturing process more robust against voltage dips. This paper discusses the sensitivity of a simple industrial process and a possible mitigation strategy, based on experimental tests. The process consists of a contactor in series with an Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD) connected to the load. The immunity of the sensitive equipment to voltage dips are first tested under different conditions, and then compared with the immunity of the process to see the influence of the weakest links on the process. To improve the immunity of the performance of the <b>contactor,</b> a <b>coil</b> hold in device was installed in parallel to the AC contactor and tested under different conditions.

40|$|The {{undesirable}} {{phenomenon of}} the contact bounce causes severe erosion of the contacts and, as a consequence, their electrical life and reliability are greatly reduced. On the other hand, the bounce of the armature can provoke re-opening of the contacts, even when they have already been closed. This paper deals with {{the elimination of the}} bounce in both contacts and armature of a commercial dc core contactor. This is achieved by means of a current closed-loop controller, which only uses as input the current and voltage of the <b>contactorâ€™s</b> magnetizing <b>coil.</b> The logic control has been implemented in a low cost microcontroller. Moreover, the board control can be fed by either dc or ac, and either in 50 Hz or 60 Hz so as to extend its applicability. A set of data is obtained from the measurement of the position and velocity of the movable parts for different operating voltages, and the dynamic behavior of the contactor is discussed.

A novel permanent magnet (PM) actuator {{to drive a}} vacuum contactor with intrinsically safe and low supply voltage is proposed. PM is mounted on the static iron of the contactor to enhance its holding force and reliability. While only one coil is used to break the vacuum <b>contactor,</b> two series <b>coils</b> are deployed to yield a high magnetomotive force to realize the making operation. The electrical circuit equation, mechanical equation and magnetic field are all coupled in the simulation.
