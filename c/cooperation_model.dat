40|$|The multi-source {{cooperation}} integrating distributed low-density parity-check codes is investigated to jointly {{collect data}} from multiple sensor nodes to the mobile sink in the wireless sensor network. The one-round and two-round cooperative data collection schemes are proposed {{according to the}} moving trajectories of the sink node. Specifically, two sparse <b>cooperation</b> <b>models</b> are firstly formed based on geographical locations of sensor source nodes, the impairment of inter-node wireless channels and moving trajectories of the mobile sink. Then, distributed low-density parity-check codes are devised to match the directed graphs and cooperation matrices related with the <b>cooperation</b> <b>models.</b> In the proposed schemes, each source node has quite low complexity attributed to the sparse cooperation and the distributed processing. Simulation results reveal that the proposed cooperative data collection schemes obtain significant bit error rate performance and the two-round cooperation exhibits better performance compared with the one-round scheme. The performance can be further improved when more source nodes participate in the sparse cooperation. For the two-round data collection schemes, the performance is evaluated for the wireless sensor networks with different moving trajectories and the variant data sizes...|$|R

40|$|Managing {{the growing}} extent of fast, complex and {{uncertain}} construction projects {{is in many}} ways the focus within prevalent Lean Construction theories. An essential prerequisite to get a more effective and lean construction process is to use adequate procurement models to promote innovation and cooperation. This paper presents a study of how different project related prerequisites affect the choice of performance, remuneration and <b>cooperation</b> <b>models</b> when contracting. The results are based on a field survey among professional construction clients with the purpose to investigate how different factors such as short lead time, market competition, different kinds of uncertainties and strategic considerations are affecting the contracting process. Choosing the performance model is mainly connected to the distribution of responsibility of the design between the client and the contractor. However, project oriented and external factors can also impact this decision, e. g. lead time for project execution, technical complexity and lack of interested bidders increases the usage of design and build types of contracts. Decisions of remuneration and <b>cooperation</b> <b>models</b> are highly connected to the risk management of projects where short lead time, poor competition and different kinds of uncertainties are present. Under these circumstances and when the client wants to participate strategically in the construction process, transparent models of remuneration and cooperation during a partnership are favoured.

Looking at the disruptive impact of this convergence on the global payment market, this study investigates the incentives behind different reactions and <b>cooperation</b> <b>models</b> that have been adopted by providers in the Swedish mobile payment market. The methodology of the study has been built on a combination of both theoretical and empirical bases. The theoretical base constitutes a literature review along the line of concepts such as innovation management, disruptive innovation, business model innovation, resource-based theory of the firm and the transaction cost theories, to identify existing gaps within the literature. The empirical base constitutes of qualitative in-depth interviews with three providers in the Swedish mobile payment market. The study shows three main reactions from the Swedish mobile payment providers. These providers have reacted to disrupt the disruption, attract a critical mass of customers, and to wrap their solutions with the right context. Currently, there is no cooperation between all three key input providers of a mobile payment solution, the banks, the MNOs and the card payment systems thus there are no full-integration or partial-integration models in the Swedish mobile payment market.

Therefore, the <b>cooperation</b> <b>model</b> of industry, university, and research can have divided into two types as “demand for market demand” and “government macro-guidance” [17]. (1) The market demand traction <b>cooperation</b> <b>model</b> refers to the cooperation of industry, universities, and research institutes with the constraints of their own resources and market demands and other internal factors, and the cooperation mode between industry, universities, and research institutes {{in order to meet}} the demand of combination of technology and economy. According to the classification of technology circulation and service, the main cooperation modes include technology transfer, technology development, technical consultation, and technical services. (2) The macro-guided <b>cooperation</b> <b>model</b> of the government and the macro-guided <b>cooperation</b> <b>model</b> of the government refer to the high-level cooperation between industry, universities, and research institutes at all levels in order to enhance national and local technological and economic strength and accelerate the development of high-tech fields. According to the form of the combination of technology and economy, the common modes of cooperation mainly include joint scientific and technological research, co-construction engineering technology center, and co-construction university science park and high-tech industrial development zone. Any <b>cooperation</b> <b>model</b> has guided by the policies of the government’s competent authorities, creating a locally optimized internal and external environment for high-tech integration bases, and actively attracting industry-university-research cooperation partners to bring projects to the park for entrepreneurial development to facilitate the acceleration of high-tech commercialization.
