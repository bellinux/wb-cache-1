25|$|Narrow {{doors and}} small windows are often square topped, being bridged by a solid stone lintel {{which may be}} {{supported}} on projecting brackets. Some stone buildings have retained wooden lintels. Larger doorways and windows are topped with semi-circular arches, as are arcades and vaults. Large doorways in more elaborate dwellings are often set within three archivolts or mouldings and may also have corbels or <b>colonnettes</b> and capitals, as at the Jew's house at Lincoln. Square-topped windows are often set in groups, {{with two or three}} beneath a single lintel. Round-topped windows are often paired under a wide arch, and separated by stone mullions or <b>colonnettes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The cloisters form an {{irregular}} quadrangle of 46 bays with two entrances/exits and abut the former bishop's palace. Each bay has an arch {{divided into two}} parts by a <b>colonnette</b> and at every third bay there is a flying buttress. The cloisters date to between 1640 and 1668 and were mostly built during the bishopric of Jean de Ploeuc. The [...] "Maître d'oeuvres" [...] involved in the construction were Pierre le Tirrant and Roland le Besque, the carpentry was by Yvon Cogan and Pierre Nicholay and the granite used came from either the quarries of the Île Grande or from Pluzunet. In 1920, the Musėe archėoloogique of Saint-Brieuc placed several additional gisant along the cloisters' walkways, these of noble knights holding their swords, abbots holding the cross, cantors with their batons and one depicting a noblewoman called Jeanne. These gisant had been originally held in local chapels which had been destroyed.|$|E
50|$|The monastery Gradac {{was built}} from 1277 to 1282 {{and it is}} an {{endowment}} of Helen of Anjou, the wife of king Uroš I. She founded the first girls' school in medieval Serbia. Gradac Monastery is situated in Stara Raška region, on the wooded and secluded slopes of Golija Mountain on the place called by locals Petrov Krs. Gradac Monastery was built in the late 13th century, on the ruins of an earlier church. It is located west of the medieval fortress Brvenik. The monastery complex was included the large building Church of The Entry of the Most Holy Theotokos into the Temple, smaller temple St. Nicholas, dining room, quarters and economic building. The Church of Gradac Monastery is one nave structure with the dome, tripartite altar and rectangle choir, whose central part consists of two chapels, the main naos, and the altar. In the architecture of the shrine of Gradac Monastery that is example of monumental Serbian-Byzantine style of Raska school of architecture there are numerous Gothic, Romanesque elements, especially on the portals and on all bifocals, windows divided by a <b>colonnette</b> into two arches. The architectural plastic of the Gradac Monastery carries the properties of the mature and late Romanesque art, like some early Gothic, all being reflected primarily in the finishing of the portal capitol, mostly marble framed windows and a series of blind arcades of the roof corona.|$|E
50|$|The church {{interior}} contains galleries, high slender <b>colonnettes</b> of red marble {{with white}} stylized Corinthian capitals, and a lectern. The gallery's original ribs made from sandstone from Mittenwald have been preserved, {{but after the}} main vault was damaged by earthquake in the 17th century, it was rebuilt in the Baroque style.|$|R
2500|$|The solid templon first {{appeared}} in Christian churches around the 5th century and is still found in many Eastern Christian churches. Initially it was a low barrier probably {{not much different from}} the altar rails of many Western churches. It eventually evolved into the modern iconostasis, still found in Orthodox churches today. [...] It is usually composed of carved wood or marble <b>colonnettes</b> supporting an architrave (a beam resting on top of columns). Three doors, a large central one and two smaller flanking ones, lead into the sanctuary. The templon did not originally obscure the view of the altar, but as time passed, icons were hung from the beams, curtains were placed in between the <b>colonnettes,</b> and the templon became more opaque. In modern Orthodox churches, it is common for the openings of the templa to be constructed specifically to contain icons.|$|R
25|$|The Fisher House is {{a two-story}} frame Colonial Revival {{structure}} with a hipped roof and clapboard siding. The attic corners have gable returns, and a porch supported by wooden Tuscan <b>colonnettes</b> runs the full {{width of the}} front facade. Behind {{the house is a}} small single-story servants' quarters with clapboard siding and a cobblestone chimney.|$|R
5000|$|The three story {{building}} {{known as}} the Palace, is unquestionably the most unusual structure still standing at Xtampak. By any standard, this is a large and impressive building. There are twentyseven rooms on the ground level, twelve on the second level, including the two oneroom buildings at the southeast and southwest corners, and five on the third level, making a total of forty-four rooms in all. A broad stairway {{on the east side}} leads from the plaza level to a doorway in the free-standing wall {{at the head of the}} stairs, giving access to the open courtyard and rooms behind. There is no indication that this stairway would allow access to the second level nor is there any real indication of secondary stairways on the west side leading to the second level.The interior stairways, starting in Rooms 6 and 10 on the ground floor, wind up through all three levels, providing the only visible means of reaching the second level. At the second and third levels, these stairways open directly to the exterior, in contrast to the ground floor where it is necessary to pass through anterooms before gaining access to the stairways. The organization of the rooms on the ground floor is unusual since all of the rooms, with the exception of the three central rooms on the west side, consist of [...] "suites" [...] of two, three and four interconnected rooms. Six rooms (Rooms 3, 15, 17, 18, 24, 26) contain beds and all of these are interior rooms.The four-room suites at the northern and southern ends were singled out for special attention since the outermost gallery-like rooms (Rooms 16 and 25) have sculptured panels centered between the doorways to the rear rooms and there are groups of three inset colonnettes on the west and east sides of these doorways. The central <b>colonnette</b> of both groups is covered with relief carvings. The pier-like doorjambs of the outer rooms, and presumably the central piers as well, show recessed panels and capitals with Puuc-like profiles. The rooms on the second level, which are the least accessible, are quite spacious and six of the eight rooms have multiple doorways, which is seemingly at odds with the level of privacy afforded by the restricted access system. The free standing rooms at the southeast and southwest corners seem almost symbolic since the space in front of the doorways is too narrow to allow entry from the adjacent terraces. The tower-like buildings on the second level, with their ornaments in stucco,might well have carried large zoomorphic masks on their east facades, and that there were non-functional stairways in front, now fallen or covered with debris, creating modified Rio Bee style symbolic pyramid-temples similar to the variant Chenes forms seen at Hochob, Tabasqueno, and Dzibilnocac. The rooms on the third level, which can be reached by means of both the interior stairways on the west side and the monumental stairway on the east side, seem to represent the ceremonial portion of the building. Both the courtyard and the room behind seem ideally suited for formal rituals involving processionals proceeding up the stairway and into a sacred precinct while the general populace watched from the plaza below. The central portion of the east facade may have been conceived as a symbolic pyramid-temple in which the monumental east stairway with its stepped ramps represent the pyramid while the free-standing wall on the third level, with its portal surrounded by a gigantic zoomorphic mask, represents the temple. The combined stairway and symbolic temple have the same steep-sided tower-like configuration as seen in typical Rio Bee tower forms.In virtually every respect, the three-story Palace is a unique building which has no real counterparts elsewhere in the Chenes region itself. The monumental stairway on the east side, leading to a portal in a free-standing wall with an open court behind, immediately calls to mind Structure IV at Becan, however, which shows a very similar organization. The Palace also shows a vague similarity to the three-story Palace at Sayil, although the latter is larger and lacks the open courtyard on the third level at the head of the main stairway. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the Palace in Xtampak is that it appears to have been conceived at the outset as a multi-story structure, in contrast to multi-level buildings elsewhere in which the various levels were accretions over time. This is particularly noticeable in the Palace at Sayil, where the architectural and decorativefeatures of the facades on the various levels are considerably different. In contrast, the architectural and decorative features on all three levels of the Palace at Santa Rosa are virtually identical and there are only minor variations in the details of base, medial, and cornice moldings. The interior stair system also points to an initial three-story conception as it is difficult to see how these stairways could have been added at a later date. Several architectural features have been incorporated into this building which seem to anticipate certain elements of the classic Puuc architectural styles. These include the column-like piers creating the multiple doorways to several of the exterior rooms on all three levels.|$|E
