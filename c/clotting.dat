40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 A {{primary cause}} of {{bleeding}} and mortality after traumatic injury is failure of hemostatic <b>clot</b> formation at wound sites. After trauma, approximately 25 - 30 % of severe injured patients display trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC) which is a multifactorial condition that causes poor <b>clot</b> formation and performance. A decreased level of viscoelastic <b>clot</b> stiffness or strength and rapid <b>clot</b> breakdown by enzymatic degradation are hallmarks of this condition. <b>Clots</b> formed under these conditions are unable to withstand hemodynamic forces of flowing blood, and therefore are likely to repeatedly rupture, leading to progressive bleeding and worsening coagulopathy. Current research examines <b>clot</b> formation to understand TIC and to guide treatment. However, the most useful and clinically-relevant aspect of <b>clot</b> formation, for TIC, is <b>clot</b> durability (i. e. its resistance to breakdown) instead of the initiating events related to <b>clot</b> formation. Decreased <b>clot</b> viscoelastic firmness is among the first changes taking place during TIC, which can be detected using current viscoelastic monitors including thrombelastograpy (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). However, these devices (TEG/ROTEM) are not ideal modalities for assessing <b>clot</b> mechanical properties in trauma conditions due {{to the amount of}} time taken to obtain results, poor sensitivity, repeatability, and lack of standardization. Therefore, in this thesis, I examine <b>clot</b> durability and failure characteristics using a novel method to better understand TIC and develop new clinically-relevant point-of-care diagnostic. I developed a system that forms a <b>clot</b> in a small tube and then applies increasing pressure until the <b>clot</b> fails. I show that that <b>clot</b> failure is strongly associated with intrinsic mechanical properties of the <b>clot.</b> I show the effect of fibrinogen, factor XIIIa, platelet count on the in-vitro failure pressure of the <b>clot.</b> The <b>clot</b> failure system shows strong correlation with the maximum <b>clot</b> firmness obtained from ROTEM, suggesting that it could be used to diagnose TIC and inform the clinicians on the pressure at which <b>clots</b> will fail in patients, thus guiding patient care in trauma situations...|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but <b>clotting</b> in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent <b>clotting.</b> Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood <b>clotting),</b> {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in <b>clotting</b> that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E

An in vitro system equipped with time-lapse microscopy was used to evaluate recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) lysis of porcine and human <b>clots</b> in the same species or cross species plasma. Human and porcine whole blood <b>clots</b> were treated with rt-PA and an echo contrast agent, Definity®, and exposed to intermittent 120 kHz US. The rt-PA lytic efficacy observed for porcine <b>clots</b> in porcine plasma was 22 times lower than for human <b>clots</b> in human plasma reported previously.

40|$|Platelets in a dilute {{platelet-rich plasma}} <b>clot</b> {{formed by the}} {{addition}} of thrombin at 4 C do not lose their alpha-granules or develop platelet-fibrin interconnections. These <b>clots</b> do not retract or lyse. If after <b>clot</b> formation for 30 minutes the <b>clots</b> are transferred to 37 C, the alpha-granules then disappear from the platelet, extensive platelet-fibrin interconnections develop, and the <b>clots</b> retract and lyse. When the dilute plasma <b>clots,</b> however, are formed at 37 C, alpha-granules are quickly lost, few platelet-fibrin interconnections develop, and the <b>clots</b> do not retract or lyse.

Dynamic <b>clot</b> formation was evaluated by thromboelastometry using whole blood (WB), platelet-rich plasma, or platelet-poor plasma employing different concentrations of extrinsic (tissue factor) and contact activator (synthasil) and with variable concentrations of phospholipids.

Real-time microscopy revealed extensive RBC loss from <b>clots</b> formed {{in the absence of}} FXIIIa activity, and RBCs exhibited transient deformation as they exited the <b>clots.</b> Fibrin band-shift assays and flow cytometry did not reveal crosslinking of fibrin or FXIIIa substrates to RBCs, suggesting FXIIIa does not crosslink RBCs directly to the <b>clot.</b> RBCs were retained in <b>clots</b> from mice deficient in α 2 -antiplasmin, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, or fibronectin, indicating RBC retention does not depend on these FXIIIa substrates.

In a buffer milieu, all plasminogen activators had a similar fibrinolytic potency towards serum-rich <b>clots</b> (non-compressed plasma <b>clots</b> or non-retracted blood <b>clots)</b> : 50 % <b>clot</b> lysis in 4 h required 50 to 85 ng plasminogen activator per ml.

To study this issue, sheep blood <b>clots</b> and polyacrylamide (PA) synthetic <b>clots</b> were injected into a mock venous flow loop containing a clinical inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and their captures were observed. Testing was performed with <b>clots</b> of various diameters (3. 2, 4. 8, and 6. 4 mm), length-to-diameter ratios (1 : 1, 3 : 1, 10 : 1), and stiffness. By adjusting the chemical formulation, PA <b>clots</b> were fabricated to be soft, moderately stiff, or stiff with elastic moduli of 805 ± 2, 1696 ± 10 and 3295 ± 37 Pa, respectively. In comparison, the elastic moduli for freshly prepared sheep blood <b>clots</b> were 1690 ± 360 Pa. The outlying filter had a design that was characterized by peripheral gaps (up to 14 mm) between its wire struts. While a low <b>clot</b> capture rate was observed using large, stiff synthetic <b>clots,</b> the filter effectively captured similarly sized sheep blood <b>clots</b> and soft PA <b>clots.</b> Because the stiffer synthetic <b>clots</b> remained straight when approaching the filter in the IVC model flow loop, they were more likely to pass between the peripheral filter struts, while the softer, physiological <b>clots</b> tended to fold and were captured by the filter.
