5|$|Nonviolent Communication (abbreviated NVC, {{also called}} Compassionate Communication or Collaborative Communication) is a {{communication}} process developed by Marshall Rosenberg {{beginning in the}} 1960s. It focuses on three aspects of communication: self-empathy (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's own inner experience), empathy (defined as {{an understanding of the}} heart in which we see the beauty in the other person), and honest self-expression (defined as expressing oneself authentically {{in a way that is}} likely to inspire <b>compassion</b> <b>in</b> others).|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays <b>compassion</b> <b>in</b> the face of sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, {{with its emphasis on}} Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E

40|$|Background : Family {{caregivers}} for {{a parent}} with dementia often experience negative emotional consequences. These caregivers may also {{be at risk for}} compassion fatigue, a concept that was introduced to the health care community as feelings of anger, inefficacy, apathy, and depression resulting from a caregiver's inability to cope with devastating stress. Compassion fatigue was first observed in nurses and later in other caring professionals such as social workers and psychologists and the definition was adapted to focus on prolonged exposure to suffering as one of the primary causes. Although compassion fatigue has not been studied in family caregivers providing care at home, their experiences, particularly those of adult daughter caregivers for parents with dementia, appear to create a foundation for developing compassion fatigue. For this reason, it was important to investigate <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>in</b> this growing population of caregivers and this dissertation explored <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>in</b> daughter caregivers for parents with dementia. The dissertation aims were to 1) identify common themes across the literature on compassion fatigue and to apply these themes and the existing model of compassion fatigue to informal caregivers for family members with dementia, 2) analyze secondary data from Project ASSIST to substantiate a need for further study of <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>in</b> adult daughter caregivers of a parent with dementia, 3) explore the feasibility of studying <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>in</b> family caregivers, and 4) explore compassion fatigue and the contributing factors and potential outcomes of <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>in</b> adult daughter caregivers for parents with dementia. Methods : The dissertation consisted of three studies. The first study, {{a review of the literature}} addressed aim 1 of the dissertation as I applied the established model of compassion fatigue to family caregivers. The second study, a secondary analysis pilot study addressed aim 2 and aim 3 of the dissertation study. The third study of the dissertation was a qualitative study exploring the concept of <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>in</b> daughter caregivers for parents with dementia. Conclusions : The literature review found evidence to support the components of the established model of compassion fatigue and findings suggested additional work was needed on the concept of <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>in</b> family caregivers. Findings from the secondary analysis provided support for more in-depth exploration of the concept of <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>in</b> family caregivers. Findings from the larger qualitative study provided support for many of the factors related to compassion fatigue, but also suggested revisions to the established model of compassion fatigue were needed. A revised model was created based upon the findings from this dissertation. The revised model incorporates the contributing factors and moderators of <b>compassion</b> fatigue found <b>in</b> family caregivers and the model also proposes revised characteristics and outcomes of compassion fatigue. Findings from this dissertation also suggest new areas for research, specifically with all dementia caregivers and caregivers who do not utilize formal or informal support. Additional value from this dissertation derives from the detailed explanation of previous relationship quality, empathy, and caregiving experience. This dissertation is one of a few qualitative studies on compassion fatigue to provide this level of detail and serves to anchor future research on <b>compassion</b> fatigue <b>in</b> all family caregivers.

25|$|Many Wiccans also seek to {{cultivate}} a set of eight virtues mentioned in Doreen Valiente's Charge of the Goddess, these being mirth, reverence, honour, humility, strength, beauty, power, and <b>compassion.</b> <b>In</b> Valiente's poem, they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a dualism that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy. Some lineaged Wiccans also observe a set of Wiccan Laws, commonly called the Craft Laws or Ardanes, 30 of which exist in the Gardnerian tradition and 161 {{of which are in}} the Alexandrian tradition. Valiente, one of Gardner's original High Priestesses, argued that the first thirty of these rules were most likely invented by Gerald Gardner himself in mock-archaic language as the by-product of inner conflict within his Bricket Wood coven – the others were later additions made by Alex Sanders during the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Ejō's {{tenure as}} abbot {{attempted}} {{to keep things}} at Eihei-ji as they were. Unfortunately, he was not gifted with Dōgen's keen leadership abilities, {{and he had the}} most trouble with his former fellow students of the Darumashū, who saw him as an equal and not an authority figure. Problems also arose with the question of a successor. Dōgen had clearly considered Tettsū Gikai a preeminent disciple, which Ejō well knew. However, he disliked Gikai's desire to reintroduce aspects of Darumashū practice that Dōgen had rejected, and Dōgen himself had commented on his lack of <b>compassion</b> <b>in</b> his interactions with other monks. Nonetheless, Ejō formally made Gikai his heir in January 1256 after making him agree to uphold Dōgen's teachings above all else. After this, Ejō sent Gikai on a pilgrimage of Zen temples in Japan, which Gikai voluntarily extended to include a visit to China, whence he returned in 1262.|$|E
