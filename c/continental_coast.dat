5|$|French ornithologist Émile Oustalet {{described}} a specimen from Branco {{as a separate}} species Passer brancoensis in 1883, which was recognised as the subspecies Passer iagoensis brancoensis by W. R. P. Bourne, who claimed to observe differences between Iago sparrows from different islands. According to Bourne, birds of Passer iagoensis iagoensis on more wooded islands in the south are darker and larger, and also behave more like house or Spanish sparrows, competing with them better in human-altered habitats. He later wrote that the variations he saw comprised two clinal trends, of increasing darkness towards the south, and of smaller size further from the <b>continental</b> <b>coast.</b> Charles Vaurie, examining differences in plumage and measurements of specimens in major museums, {{did not find any}} significant variation, and neither Vaurie nor Summers-Smith recognised any subspecies.|$|E

25|$|The {{bar jack}} is widely {{distributed}} through the tropical and subtropical {{waters of the}} western Atlantic Ocean, and is a common species throughout most of its range. The northernmost limit of its range is New Jersey in the northern United States, with its range extending south along the <b>continental</b> <b>coast</b> to Venezuela. It inhabits a number of offshore islands and archipelagos including Bermuda, {{as well as the}} West Indies. The bar jack is most abundant in the Gulf of Mexico, the West Indies and Caribbean, but in the Gulf of Mexico is limited to offshore waters. There have been reliable reports of the species from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and far offshore at Saint Helena in the south central Atlantic, which would extend the species southern limit significantly if correct.|$|E

25|$|The {{island of}} Heligoland is a {{geological}} oddity; {{the presence of}} the main island's characteristic red sedimentary rock {{in the middle of the}} German Bight is unusual. It is the only such formation of cliffs along the <b>continental</b> <b>coast</b> of the North Sea. The formation itself, called the Bunter sandstone or Buntsandstein, is from the early Triassic geologic age. It is older than the white chalk that underlies the island Düne, the same rock that forms the white cliffs of Dover in England and cliffs of Danish and German islands in the Baltic Sea. In fact, a small chalk rock close to Heligoland, called witt Kliff (white cliff), is known to have existed within sight of the island to the west until the early 18th century, when storm floods finally eroded it to below sea level.|$|E
2500|$|Metal tools first {{appeared}} in Wales about 2500 BC, initially copper followed by bronze. The climate during the Early Bronze Age (c. 2100-1400 BC) {{is thought to have}} been warmer than at present, as there are many remains from this period in what are now bleak uplands. Much of the copper for the production of bronze probably came from the copper mine on the Great Orme, where prehistoric mining on a very large scale dates largely from the middle Bronze Age. In particular copper from the Great Orme mines appears to have been used for the production of bronze implements of the Acton Park Complex, named after a hoard found at Acton Park near Wrexham. These tools, particularly axeheads, were developed {{towards the end of the}} Early Bronze Age and are innovative in both metallurgy and design. They were widely exported, with examples being found along the <b>continental</b> <b>coast</b> from Brittany to north Germany.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{patterns}} of distribution of macroalgal coralligenous assemblages {{in relation to}} depth and evaluates the role of different environmental conditions on these patterns. Two depths (30 and 40 m) were investigated off small islands and off <b>continental</b> <b>coasts</b> in order to select two different environmental conditions. Results showed differences between depths {{in the structure of}} assemblages around islands, while along the <b>continental</b> <b>coasts</b> these patterns were not evident. Moreover, differences between assemblages related to different environmental conditions were more evident in the shallower zone of distribution of the coralligenous habitat. This correlative study did not allow us to identify any cause-effect relationship, but patterns we detected agree with those of other studies, suggesting that alterations in the environmental conditions may be the cause of the decrease in differences among assemblages developing at different depths and may lead to a higher spatial homogenization and an impoverishment of the whole subtidal system...|$|R
