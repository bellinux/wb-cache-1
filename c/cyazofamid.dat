5000|$|Chemical Control - Chemical {{control is}} highly {{recommended}} because downy mildew is an aggressive and destructive disease and satisfactory control {{without the use}} of fungicides is unlikely. Both protectant and systemic products should be applied. Fungicides are most effective when applied prior to infection and reapplied at 5- to 7-day intervals. The following products have proven to be the most effective fungicides in cucumber downy mildew control in North Carolina trials conducted annually from 2004 to 2008: Presidio (fluopicolide, Valent), Ranman (<b>cyazofamid,</b> FMC), Previcur Flex (propamocarb, Bayer), Curzate (cymoxanil, DuPont), Tanos (famoxadone and cymoxanil, DuPont),and Gavel (zoxamide and mancozeb, Dow AgroSciences). These products should be applied in a program to prevent pathogen resistance, that is, rotated with fungicides of a different mode of action. Protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil and mancozeb should be used as mixing partners.|$|E

The effect of <b>cyazofamid</b> was tested by seed treatment alone, seed treatment followed by foliar application and foliar application alone. Seed treatment with <b>cyazofamid</b> offered only 19. 7 % disease control, but seed treatment followed by a single foliar application to diseased plants provided good control over disease, seed treatment with two foliar applications was significantly superior and foliar application alone showed a high level of activity, with 10 mg mL(- 1) giving 97. 9 % disease control. Lack of systemic activity of <b>cyazofamid</b> was evident, root treatment giving disease levels {{on a par with the}} untreated control. The fungicide exhibited strong curative activity, but only moderate translaminar activity, with only marginal (34. 8 %) disease control after treatment of the adaxial leaf surface at 10 mg mL- 1. Loss of <b>cyazofamid</b> activity over time was very low, indicating stable residual and rainfastness activity. These results indicate that <b>cyazofamid</b> has a high potential to be an effective fungicide for the control of downy mildew disease of pearl millet. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{aiming to}} explore the efficacy of fungicides to protect newly developing potato leaves were carried out between 2000 and 2002. Contact, translaminar and systemic fungicides were applied in field trials at Lelystad in {{the centre of the}} Netherlands. Efficacy of the fungicides was established using a bioassay in which detached new grown leaflets (ev Bintje) were inoculated with Phytophthora infestans. The interval between the last fungicide application and picking the leaves {{to be used in the}} bioassay varied between 4 and 11 d. Disease incidence was assessed after incubation for approximately a week. Protection of the newly developed leaves depended on the intrinsic property of the fungicides, time since the last fungicide application and growth rate of potato leaves in the field since the last fungicide application. Shorter time intervals between spraying and inoculation resulted in better (re) distribution of (contact) fungicides on newly developed leaves resulting in better protection. Also, there was less dilution of the fungicide due to less leaf expansion during a 4 d compared with 7 d spray interval. A similar effect occurs when crop growth rate decreases. Ridomil Gold MZ, with the systemic active ingredient metalaxyl and Ramnan (<b>cyazofamid)</b> resulted in the best protection of newly developed leaves at the beginning of the growing season when crop growth rate was high.

Alcanzando un límite de cuantificación de 0, 01 ppm, una linealidad de respuesta (R 2 > 0, 998) y exactitud (70 - 110 %) y precisión con SD 0, 998) and an {{accuracy}} (70 - 110 %) and precision with SD< 20 %. In the wines made from grapes {{treated in the}} field under GAP, the LMR established for grapes were not surpassed. In the Tempranillo varieties under CPA treatments, kresoxim-metyl and metrafenone slightly exceeded the el LMR (1. 48 and 0. 84 versus 1 and 0. 5 ppm, respectively). In the wines fortified in the winery with fenhexamid, mepanipyrim and <b>cyazofamid,</b> the LMR were not exceeded. The presence of fungicide residues in the Tempranillo wines had no significant effect on their antioxidant activity. In the Graciano wines, boscalid+kresoxim-methyl and metrafenone presented significant differences in their antioxidant capacity. Residues of boscalid+kresoxim-methyl, fenhexamid and <b>cyazofamid</b> reduce the total polyphenols (Folin-Ciocalteu index) in Tempranillo. In contrast, metrafenone slightly increases it in Graciano. The most notable phenolic fraction in Tempranillo and Graciano is the antocianos (70. 45 and 77. 50 % respectively), followed by the hidroxicinnamic derivatives (18. 31 and 13. 64 %) and flavonols (14. 62 and 9. 95 %). The stilbenes in Graciano wines show slightly higher percentages than in Tempranillo (6. 34 versus 4. 98 %). The in vitro bioavailability of the fungicides in Graciano wine shows a positive matrix effect with respect to Tempranillo. Dialysis percentages range from 6. 1 % for kresoxim-metil in Tempranillo to 36. 6 % for boscalid in Graciano. Mepanipyrim in Tempranillo and boscalid in Graciano present the greatest bioavailability. It is confirmed that the clarification has a slight positive effect on bioavailability. In wines made from grapes treated under CPA, the dialyzation percentages of boscalid and kresoxim-methyl stood between 21 and 31 %, while metrafenone did not present dialyzation. No dialyzation occurred for <b>cyazofamid</b> added to the must. It {{has been shown that}} fungicide residues affect the bioavailability of both the phenolic fraction and the antioxidant activity, but no clear differences were found in the dialyzation of the phenolic fraction for either wine. The stilbenes were the phenolic compounds that showed the highest percentage of dialyzation (50 %). The total polyphenol content after the in vitro digestion of wine fell on average by 10 % with respect to the initial content in Tempranillo treated in the field and by more than 18 % in the case of <b>cyazofamid</b> added prior to vinification. The results were similar for Graciano, except in the treatments with the boscalid and kresoxim-methyl mix, where the bioavailability of the polyphenols increased by up to 25 %. The presence of the fungicides studied affects the bioavailability of the antioxidant activity of the Tempranillo wines, but not that of the Graciano ones. Finally, it has been shown that, in general, for all the pesticides studied the in vitro bioavailability does not exceed 37 % dialyzation with respect to the initial concentration present in the wine, which indicates a clear safety margin in toxicological terms...|$|E

40|$|Many anthropic activities, {{including}} the agricultural and food industries, {{give rise to}} environmental problems {{for which it is}} necessary to find solutions. The presence of undesirable substances in water, the soil and foodstuffs can pose a risk to the health and hygiene to humans and animals. It is therefore essential to study methods for removing pollutants from these matrices, as to make them compatible with the maintenance of healthy environmental conditions. This paper aims at verifying the possibility of using modified clays (or organic-clays) to remove contaminants from waste water coming from different areas. This work derives from the necessity to overcome the numerous, negative aspects of current techniques and offers new, effective, easy to use and economic methods. The adsorption of the different pesticides onto micelle-clay complexes and unmodified montmorillonite clay were measured to allow the determination of the maximum pesticide quantity adsorbed in order to obtain a dose-effect relationship for practical applications. The modified clay Cloisite 20 A was showed to be more efficient for use in treatment plants for the adsorption of chlorpyrifos and penconazole from aqueous solutions whereas metalaxyl is more efficiently removed by Cloisite 30 B. Adsorption tests in laboratory using Cloisite 20 A were also developed for <b>cyazofamid</b> and cyprodinil and the results showed a high affinity of the both fungicides for the organoclay. Therefore Cloisite 20 A was show to be the most efficient organoclay from those tested in this study. This, in part, is explained by the structure of the modifier quaternary salt which contains two aliphatic chains on the structure and determinate a higher space between the layers of the montmorillonite. Subsequently a depuration scheme was developed to test the practical applicability of the Cloisite 20 A organoclay and the results showed it to be efficient for decontaminating pesticide-containing water derived from vineyards. The adsorption tests in the pilot system show a removal of three of the pesticide considered, <b>cyazofamid,</b> penconazole and cyprodinil, to be similar to that predicted from the adsorption tests developed in the laboratory. The recovery of the modified clay after the adsorption was shown to be dependent on the presence of surfactants in the pesticide formulation. For the adsorption test of penconazole, which contains a higher quantity of surfactants in the formulation, if compared with the formulation of <b>cyazofamid,</b> the recovery of Cloisite 20 A was 20 % higher. For the fungicide cyprodinil, formulated with antifoaming agents, an alternative treatment of the clay-water suspension was necessary. After adsorption the suspension was passed through a compost layer which determinates the sedimentation of the clay at the compost surface. Concerning the waste disposal, for instance the organoclay composted after the adsorption, additional treatments appear to be necessary for pesticides with moderate and high persistence in soil as penconazole and cyprodinil. The fungicide <b>cyazofamid</b> shows a significant decrease after 90 days, in favourable conditions of compost humidity and environment temperature. The results of the modelling exercise shows that the FOCUS PEARL model, generally used for calculating leaching and drainage of PPP from open field cultivations to ground/surface water could be parameterised to simulate PPP emissions from greenhouses to surface water. For the case study, weather conditions were found to have a major role on the PPP emissions from glasshouses and the open field. The more controlled climate in the greenhouse prevented a substantial precipitation excess as was observed for the open field, which had a large effect on the leaching concentrations. Furthermore, in greenhouse cultivation it was noticed that the temperature has a slightly higher influence on CC-M emissions from the greenhouse than the irrigation excess volume. However, the main conclusion of this exercise was that there are potential PPP emissions to surface water associated with crop cultivation in greenhouses, contrary to what is stated in the European Council Regulation 1107 / 2009, article 3. Therefore a possible use of the outputs of this exercise is in future work to develop decontamination systems for greenhouses or for open field cultivation...|$|E

40|$|Johnson, Gordon C. Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) is an {{important}} crop for the Delmarva Peninsula, particularly Delaware, which plants more land area to lima bean than any other state. Yield loss due to diseases such as pod rot, caused by Phytophthora capsici, reduce profitability of the crop. Phytophthora capsici causes significant damage to lima beans during periods of high humidity and frequent rainfall. Symptoms include browning, drying, and abortion of the pod. Current management practices for pod rot are limited, and fungicide choices are few. Mefenoxam is {{the most widely used}} fungicide and it has been registered for use against P. capsici on lima bean since 2000, however, repeated applications have resulted in populations of P. capsici with resistance. <b>Cyazofamid</b> was approved for control of pod rot 2013, however use remains low because of the expense. The goal of this research was to identify new products and practices for managing pod rot of lima bean. These included identifying new fungicides with efficacy against P. capsici on lima bean, as well as evaluating biofumigation, biopesticides, and reduced tillage. All field experiments were conducted during the summer of 2013 and 2014 at the University of Delaware's Carvel Research and Education Center, Thurmond Adams Agricultural Research Farm located in Georgetown, Delaware. All 12 fungicides significantly reduced pod rot disease incidence compared to controls (P < 0. 05), and mefenoxam, <b>cyazofamid,</b> fluazinam, oxathiapiprolin, and potassium phosphite achieved the best control. Detached pod assays conducted in the laboratory with the fungicides listed above support the results observed in the field, and indicate that flat pods are more susceptible to P. capsici infection than full pods within 72 hours post inoculation (P = 0. 0378).

40|$|Phytophthora blight of peppers (Capsicum annuum) {{is caused}} by the oomycete {{pathogen}} Phytophthora capsici. In Arizona, the root and crown rot phase of the disease initially can appear on plants early in the growing season in areas of the field where soil remains saturated with water after an irrigation or rainfall event. Disease severity can increase dramatically due to summer rains during July and August in the southeastern Arizona production area. Fungicides are an important component of a Phytophthora disease management system, when used in combination with other management practices such as crop rotation, raised beds, and water management. The efficacy of the systemic fungicide mefenoxam (Ridomil Gold) for control of Phytophthora blight on pepper has been documented; however, in many pepper production regions, populations of the pathogen insensitive to this fungicide have developed. Other chemistries, including dimethomorph (Acrobat) as well as some new fungicides in development, have activity on some species of Phytophthora and associated diseases on crops other than pepper. The objective of the following study was to evaluate these additional chemistries for efficacy in suppressing development of root and crown rot on pepper plants grown in soil naturally infested with Phytophthora capsici in a greenhouse environment. The mean duration of survival for Aristotle bell pepper plants in untreated soil infested with P. capsici was 29 days. On the other hand, a significant increase in pepper plant survival was achieved when soil was treated with Reason (fenamidone) + Previcur Flex (propamocarb), SA- 110201, Ranman (<b>cyazofamid),</b> Omega (fluazinam), Ridomil Gold (mefenoxam), V- 10161 (fluopicolide), Forum (dimethomorph), NOA- 446510 (mandipropamid), IR- 6141 (kiralaxyl), and Maestro (captan). The data from this study suggest that several fungicides currently not registered for use on peppers may be effective components of a management program for Phytophthora crown and root rot.

40|$|Resistance to {{antimicrobial}} agents {{is a serious}} problem for both medicine and agriculture. The initial success of such toxins is due to absence of resistant genotypes in pathogen populations before treatment. The initial low frequency of resistance may be explained by negative pleiotropic effects of the resistance mutations on fitness {{in the absence of the}} toxin. However, when resistant and sensitive natural isolates are compared, no cost of resistance may often be seen. This high fitness of resistant genotypes is explained by the existence of compensatory mutations, i. e. mutations that ameliorate the negative effect of the initial resistance mutation. The accumulation of these compensatory mutations can only occur at a sufficient rate if the population of resistant genotypes is large, which in part depends on the pesticide use. As a result, resistance may be stably maintained in a population after pesticide treatment, whereas it was absent before pesticide treatment. Resistance to the phenylamide pesticide metalaxyl is common in populations of Phytophthora infestans, the oomycete that causes the late blight disease in potato. This resistance evolved within a few years after metalaxyl became commercially available in 1977. Such fast evolution of pesticide resistance may present a serious threat for potato production. However, fast evolution of resistance to other pesticides has not been described in P. infestans, whereas resistance to metalaxyl and other pesticides are common in other oomycetes. In the absence of metalaxyl, resistant isolates of P. infestans have a higher fitness during epidemics compared to sensitive isolates. This observation has led to the assumption that metalaxyl resistance has a direct positive effect on epidemic fitness. A reduction of the survival during the winter has been put forward as an explanation for the absence of resistance before the commercial release of metalaxyl. However, given a high mutation rate towards metalaxyl resistance, a direct positive effect of metalaxyl resistance would always lead to a high frequency of resistance, even in the absence of metalaxyl. In this thesis, we report on an experimental evolution approach to investigate the fast evolution and apparent stability of metalaxyl resistance in P. infestans. We used an experimental evolution procedure because it has several advantages. First, it enables a detailed inspection of the trajectory of evolutionary changes (e. g. in resistance phenotype). Second, it enables comparisons of fitness components between near-isogenic genotypes that only differ in their sensitivity to metalaxyl, whereas conclusions based on comparisons of field isolates and offspring from sexual crosses are hampered by differences in the genetic background. Two experiments were performed to investigate the rate of evolution of resistance to a number of pesticides. First, we used a fluctuation test to estimate the mutation rate towards resistance against metalaxyl, fluazinam and <b>cyazofamid.</b> This fluctuation test, however, was not suitable to estimate the mutation rate in P. infestans, due to background growth of sensitive genotypes for metalaxyl and due to the low amount of zoospores that can be obtained from a single colony for the other two pesticides. Second, we analyzed the response of selection on low pesticide concentrations. Serial transfer of zoospores on a constant low concentration of metalaxyl resulted in full resistance. The same procedure on a low concentration of <b>cyazofamid</b> with a similar effect on growth rate, however, did not result in full resistance. The genotypes that emerged after the selection procedure were compared with the sensitive ancestor with respect to a number of fitness components in the absence of metalaxyl. This approach did not reveal a cost of resistance. On the contrary, resistant genotypes showed a higher in vitro fitness compared to their sensitive ancestor. However, the results from a population survey during a nation-wide ban of metalaxyl containing pesticides in the Netherlands were suggestive of a negative effect of resistance on winter survival and on epidemic fitness. These results suggest that the relative high frequency of metalaxyl resistant isolates on untreated fields can only be explained by assuming that metalaxyl resistance has an initial cost that is followed by compensatory mutations that only restores epidemic fitness. A new selection procedure that included serial transfer of zoospores, revealed a small initial cost on in vitro performance by increasing the lag phase before the start of growth. Subsequent compensatory evolution under the selection conditions could then explain the absence of a cost of resistance in previous experiments. However, no such compensatory evolution was directly observed in this latter selection procedure. The results presented in this thesis suggest that metalaxyl resistance is selected on a wide range of concentrations, whereas this is not the case for (some) other pesticides. This may explain the relative fast evolution of resistance to metalaxyl relative to that for other pesticides. Additionally, the absence of resistance before the commercial release of metalaxyl can be explained by a negative effect due to delaying growth. Finally, the methodology of experimental evolution may be a valuable addition to the multitude of methods used to study the population dynamics of this important pathogen...|$|E
