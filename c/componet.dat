50|$|Previously {{known as}} Control and Information Protocol, CIP {{encompasses}} a comprehensive suite of messages {{and services for}} the collection of manufacturing automation applications - control, safety, synchronization, motion, configuration and information. It allows users to integrate these manufacturing applications with enterprise-level Ethernet networks and the Internet. It is supported by hundreds of vendors around the world, and is media-independent. CIP provides a unified communication architecture throughout the manufacturing enterprise. It is used in EtherNet/IP, DeviceNet, <b>CompoNet</b> and ControlNet.|$|E

In 2009, the JTA was terminated and EtherNet/IP became under the sole control of ODVA and its members. Today, EtherNet/IP is one of four networks that adapt CIP to an industrial network along with DeviceNet, ControlNet and <b>CompoNet.</b> All of these networks are managed by ODVA, Inc.|$|E

Such a description should be sufficiently precise in order to allow for automatic checking of correctness of component composition and component use, while easy to comprehend for application programmers and simple to write for component designers.
