The low absorption obtained at the working wavelength of 890 nm allows us to observe soliton propagation over lengths in the centimeter range. c ○ 2002 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (190. 0190) Nonlinear Optics; (190. 4420) Transverse effects; (190. 5530) Pulse propagation and solitons; (190. 5970) Semiconductor nonlinear optics Laser soliton beams have already been studied in a large variety of configurations and materials for both their fundamental interest and their potential applications in light-controlled devices and, more particularly, in reconfigurable optical interconnects. Among the nonlinear materials considered in the literature, liquid crystals have attracted only little attention {{in spite of their}} huge nonlinearities (10 6 to 1011 times the nonlinearity of glass). The nonlinearity in liquid crystals (beside thermal effects) is of reorientational nature, non local and strongly polarization dependent, which leads to a rich phenomenology {{that has yet to be}} investigated experimentally.

We aimed to explore the potential of digital pathology tools to obtain quantitative and reproducible measure of C 4 d deposition in the renal allograft tissue. 34 routine kidney allograft biopsies immunohistochemically stained for C 4 d {{were included in the}} study and were evaluated by a qualified pathologist twice, recording an approximate percentage of positive PTC and glomerular area. The same slides were scanned by Aperio ScanScope scanner. Two layers of annotations were created: layer of glomeruli and the remaining non-glomerular area. Image analysis was performed with Aperio Positive Pixel Count algorithm to quantify the proportion of C 4 d-positive pixels in the area analysed. The percentage of positive (defined as 2 + and 3 +) pixels in glomeruli and non-glomerular area was obtained and compared to the percentage of C 4 d-positive PTC and C 4 d-positive area of glomeruli recorded by the pathologist.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out whether acute massive {{pulmonary}} embolism can produce myocardial changes visible by light and electron microscopy. Ww therefore produced pulmonary embolism in rats using plastic microspheres (diameter, 15 +/- 5 mu). Two experimental protocols were used: lethal embolism, with a dose of microspheres known to kill in 3 to 15 hours (these rats were killed after 1 hour), and sublethal embolism, with a dose compatible with 100 % survival (these rats were killed after 24 hours). In both groups, the left ventricle was normal. The right ventricle showed two tyes of changes: a) A distinctive lesion of the myocytes, more diffuse after lethal enbolism and different from the "zonal lesion" of shock. It consisted primarily in a localized shredding of the myofibrillar system; hence, the name shredding is proposed. Earlier stages of this lesion were represented by focal dissolution of the Z line (Z lysis). The pathogenesis of these lesions appeared to be primarily mechanical. b) Necrosis was already apparent at 1 hour and was more extensive after 24 hours. The pathogensis of the necrotic lesions is best explained by a temporary ischemia followed by delayed reflow; a possible potentiating role of endogenous catecholamines cannot be excluded. Most <b>capilaries</b> in the necrotic foci remained functional; this explains the rapid rate of the healing process of such lesions. A comparison is drawn between the observed foci of necrosis and the human myocardial lesions knowns as "miliary infarcts" and "myocytolysis. " It is proposed that a factor common to all three is the preservation of the microcirculatory vessels and that our experimental model helps illuminate the pathogenesis of the human lesions. It is concluded that the right ventricle of acute cor pulmonale may develop cellular changes with a complex pathologenesis (mechanical, ischemic, and possibly hormonal). The nature of the changes found in our model could represent the morphologic substrate of right-sided failure; it can be correlated with the electrocardiographic abnormalities found in the comparable human condition...|$|R

Preliminary studies showed that the G tube was implanted more easily and fit better in the tissue {{when it was first}} transplanted as a substitute for part of the femoral artery or embedded subcutaneously before use. The surfaces of the G tubes anastomosed to the femoral artery or transplanted subcutaneously were covered by connective tissue with neogenesis of <b>capilaries</b> at week 4 - 27, and were soft. This suggests that the tube is accepted by the tissue. Histologically, fibroblast cells were attached to the inside and to the outside of the G tube. These cells had invaded {{in the direction of the}} Gore-Tex mesh, sometimes accompanied by the capillary vessel. Histologically, there was no substantial difference between the two types of operations. For ureteral substitution, the G tubes that had been transplanted subcutaneously for 6 weeks before operation were found to be preferable. Ureteral transplants: Two to six cm of the lower ureters of 13 dogs was removed, and the G tube was anastomosed end to end to the ureter with the other ends connected to the bladder or ureter. The dogs were observed for 4 - 18 weeks. A ureteral catheter could be passed through the ureters removed from only 4 dogs killed at week 4, 6, 16 or 18. IVP showed kidney function to be normal in only the two dogs killed at week 4 or 6. Histologically, mucosal regeneration had advanced to the outside of the G tube: After the mucus was regenerated, the G tube was gradually pushed into the bladder, and tended to be eliminated. Then, the transplantation site in the ureter became constricted, and hydronephrosis advanced rapidly. Histologically, mucosal regeneration appeared on the outside of the G tube in the dogs with urethral substitution as well. The newly generated mucus was abundant and plicate. The G tube was eliminated after mucosal regeneration even in 2 of the 4 dogs in which operation was thought to be successful. Urethral transplants: Three to four cm of the anterior or posterior urethra excluding the area near the baculum of 12 dogs was removed, and the G tube was anastomosed end to end to the urethra, Operation on the posterior urethra, a difficult procedure, was often not successful. Thus, the posterior urethra was used most often. The dogs were observed for 17 weeks at most. Four of the 8 dogs that had transplants to the posterior urethra had no abnormalities in urinary excretion at week 14 - 17, and a catheter could easily be passed through.

The analyses of n-alkanes (m/z 71) were performed with the temperature program: 80 °C (hold 2 min) to 270 °C at 4 °C/min and at 10 °C/min to 300 °C (hold 25 min). For the analyses of hopanes and homohopanes (m/z 191), 25 -norhopanes (m/z 177) and steranes (m/z 217) the temperature program was: 70 °C (2 min) to 190 °C at 30 °C/min, to 250 °C at 1.5 °C/min and at 2 °C/min to 300 °C (hold 20 min). All samples were analyzed in duplicate using 5 α-cholestan- 3 -one, 0.02 μg/mL, as internal standard for the quantitative analyses of biomarker biodegradation. The instrument response was regularly checked by injecting a mixture of n-alkanes.|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis Foaming {{properties}} of particle dispersions {{can be modified}} by addition of amphiphiles. The molar ratio between particles and amphiphiles will influence the wetting {{properties of}} the particles {{as well as the}} bulk concentration of the amphiphiles. This will have an effect on air/water interfacial composition {{as well as on the}} thin film and foam stability of the mixed system. Experiments In this research foams and thin films of hydrophilic silica particles in presence of β-casein (β-CN) were investigated with different particle sizes and varying β-CN/silica weight ratios (between 1 : 10 and 1 : 100). Samples were characterized for particles size, morphology as well as contact angle and related to their foaming, interfacial, and thin film properties. Findings A threshold weight ratio of β-CN/silica was found to be 1 : 50 for foam stabilization with mixtures containing silica particles no larger than 1 μm and 1 : 30 for film stabilization with mixtures containing larger particles. At the interface, the modified silica particles were rather diluted without much interaction for surface compressions up to 30 %. Large silica particles (0. 0015 % β-CN, Csilica ≤ 0. 15 %) were dragged to the periphery of the thin liquid films but no decrease of the inner film draining rate by a decrease of <b>capilary</b> pressure gradient across the film was observed. The depletion of β-casein in the bulk by particles played a major role in foam destabilization...|$|E
40|$|Giant mudskipper (Periophthalmodon schlosseri) {{is one of}} gobiidae {{members that}} does {{air-breathing}} and lives on intertidal zone with mangrove habitat. The ability of giant mudskipper to adapt with water to land environment is due to its gill histological structure. The objective {{of the present study}} was to observe the structure of giant mudskipper 2 ̆ 7 s gill and to identify sort of cells and its distributions descriptively. The gills of three adult giant mudskippers were taken and processed to histological slides with 4 µm thickness each. Samples were stained with hematoxyline-eosin (HE) method. The results indicated that Mudskipper gills consist of epithelial cells, such as squamous and cuboid on the lamellae surfaces contiguous with mucous and chloride cells that are spread at interlamellae zone and peripheral surfaces of fused secondary lamellae of mudskipper gills. Pillar cells sre found inside of secondary lamellae and form lacunae that split secondary lamellae with block to block spaces that fill with erythrocytes. Hyaline cartilages are found to form canals for transport veins inside primary lamellae and soft muscle connecting hyaline to basal membrane of primary lamellae surfaces. The difference of histological structures between giant mudskipper gills to other aquatic osteichthyes is that the secondary lamellae is fused in normal (non-pathological) condition. The fusion makes epithelial cells of the econdary lamellae are thicker. The fusion also makes oxygen diffusion path from water to <b>capilary</b> vein is a bit longer about 10 µm. The thickness of epithelial cells of secondary lamellae makes the mudskippers gills not an efficient organ for gas exchanges in water, but it is important in osmoregulation...|$|E

40|$|A packed {{capillary}} column switching {{system has been}} developed, suitable for solute focusing of large sample volumes on a short precolumn prior to temperature-programmed elution on an analytical column. The peptides angiotensin II, bradykinin, bombesin, corazonin, neurotensin and substance P were used as model compounds, and a mobile phase composition of acetonitrile:water:trifluoroacetic acid (22 : 77. 9 : 0. 1, v/v %) served as the eluting mobile phase. 3 cm 320 µm I. D. columns were used as precolumns, and 15 cm 320 µm I. D. as analytical column. For the analytical column and precolumn, the stationary phases used was 3. 5 µm Kromasil C 18 and 10 µm Kromasil C 18 particles, respectively. Sample volumes up to 1. 0 mL were focused on the precolumn, prior to column switching and temperature programming. The low back pressure of the precolumn allowed a sample loading flow rate of 250 µL/min. The mass limit of detection of the method was on average 1. 3 ng. This corresponds to a concentration limit of detection (cLOD) of 1. 3 µg/L when using an injection volume of 1. 0 mL using UV detection at 210 nm. The within assay precision and between assay precision for the method for peak areas were on average 5. 9 % and 4. 9 %, respectively. The method was applied for the determination of peptides in different spiked water samples. In spiked tap water peptides containing methionine, tryptophan and cystine were oxidized by hypochlorite. The oxidation products were further investigated and tentatively identified by packed <b>capilary</b> liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometer detection in the positive mode. Finally, the combined used of temperature gradient superimposed on a mobile phase gradient was shown to provide better selectivity for separation of the selected model peptides...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the variation of acid-base balance of human body during peloidotherapy. The secondary objectiv is balneal safetyness for the patient suffering of joint degenerative deaseases and post-traumatic sequelles of the limbs, undergoing mud therapy. This paper work presents only the results obtained on pH variations. Materials and methods. The study plot was composed by forty three patients undergoing mud therapy for rehabilitation in Techirghiol Balneal and Rehabilitation Sanatorium. Daily therapeutic intervention consists in: thermoneutral bath (alternativelly mud bath and salt bath), kinetotherapy, massage and electrotherapy. Proofs prelevations (<b>capilary</b> blood) were performed in four moments of the cure: at the bigining of the cure, immediatly after first balneal application, at twenty four hours after first application {{and at the end of}} the cure of ten balneal application. Blood determinations were made using CCX Nova Biomedical 6 analyser for critical care. Results obtained were interpretated in corelation with the results of VIASAN 317 / 2004 study upon variations of biochemical composition of mud after therapeutic use. In order to use results of VIASAN study we asked and we received aproval from the owner and incumbent of the study, Techirghiol Balneal and Rehabilitation Sanatorium. All patients get to know about the rithm of blood prelevation and possibility of results publication and they signed the informed consent. Statistic analysis were made with the soft SPSS 12. 0 upon witch Constanţa Ovidius University holds the licence of using. Rezults. Variations of blood pH in the four moments of cure were within physiological limits. They were statistically insignificant with one exception: immediatly after first salt bath application pH increased statistic significant but within physiological limits (p= 0. 02 < 0. 05). Conclusions. During peloidotherapy the acidity of blood masured throught pH, variates within the frame of physiological limits. This variation might be corelated with the variation of mud bath solution`s pH after application and possibly with skin`s pH variation.

40|$|No Instituto do Coração, de março de 1985 a fevereiro de 1986, 11 pacientes foram submetidos a transplante cardíaco ortotópico. Eram todos do sexo masculino, com idade variando de 39 a 54 anos; 6 com cardiopatia isquémica, 4 com cardiomiopatia dilatada e um com cardiomiopatia chagásica. Foi realizado estudo hemodinâmico através de catéter de Swan-Ganz, no pré-operatório, no pós-operatório, após estabilização na unidade de recuperação, e trinta ou mais dias após o transplante. Os dados mostram melhora progressiva em relação ao índice cardíaco, pressão em artéria pulmonar, pressão de capilar pulmonar, resistência {{vascular}} pulmonar e resistência vascular sistêmica. Três dos 11 pacientes apresentaram disfunção renal transitória no pós-operatório imediato e que regrediram até o 15 º dia, enquanto que 2 pacientes apresentaram aumento moderado da creatinina plasmática. Apenas 3 pacientes não apresentaram qualquer episódio de rejeição; nos demais, esses episódios foram um diagnóstico histológico sem repercussões clínicas. Complicações infecciosas ocorreram em 9 pacientes e foram de fácil controle clínico. No pós-operatório tardio, a hipertensão esteve presente em 8 pacientes, sendo mais acentuada em 2 deles. Não houve óbitos, nesta série de pacientes; todos estão assintomáticos e os 6 primeiros estão trabalhando.

40|$|The {{increase}} of ordinary age population diseases {{with a high}} mortality rate like severe sepsis comes to the fore especially {{in the view of}} economical aspects. With an incidence of 11 % represents the severe sepsis the third frequently cause of mortality in Germany. Within more than 90 % of septic patients bacterial events can be proved as a cause. Above all microcirculation dysfunktion leads in the end to the „multiple organ dysfunction syndrome“. In the centre of the endothelia dysfunction are the leucocytes. The damage is caused by the emission of cytikines, reaktive oxygen species and other mediators, as well as their following interactions in the terminal microvascular bed. It leads in the end to cell and tissue damage and results in a multi organ failure. The antoxidative effect of superoxide dismutase mimetic Tempol was proven in different other experimental studies and showed positive effects on the microcirculation and th inflammation reaction within experimental sepsis. Main focus of this work was to evaluate the effeciency of Tempol as an antioxidant substance using an animal sepsis model. Intestinal microcirculation, in particular the functional capillary density and the leukocyte- endothel-interaction, were analyzed. An animal sepsis model of the rate was chosen, because an investigation of the microcirculation of the intestinum is hardly possible in clinical investigations. In this study the endotoxemia was induced by a lipopolysaccharid infusion of 10 mg/ kg body weight. The investigation of the microcirculation was performed by intravital videomicroscopy. As a parameter of the intestinale microcirculation he functinal <b>capilary</b> density and as a expression of leucocyte activation the leucocyte-endothel-interaction was measured. The influence of Tempol on the oxidative stress in sepsis was estimated by measurement of serum levels of Malondialdehyd, peroxidconcentration, advanced oxidation protein products, antioxidative capacity and oxidized low- density lipoprotein. Furthermore clinical parameters as heart rate, lood pressure and respiratory rate were recorded. A significant decrease of the functional capillary density due to the administration of Tempol could be proved by intravital microscopy. The temporary leukocyte adherence in mesenterial venules was not influencend by Tempol. A significant reduction of the number of the firmly adherent leucocytes could be proved under the influence of Tempol. The clinical parameters; white blood cell count, Malondialdehyd concentration, peroxid concentration, advanced oxidation protein products, the antioxidative capacity and oxidized low density lipoprotein were not influenced by the administration of Tempol. In this study a decrease of the functional capillary density and the reduction of firmly adherent leucocytes due to the administration of Tempol in experimental sepsis were proven. Further investigations must show if there are other diagnostic parameters showing the effects of Tempol and if maybe a higher dosage of empol or a longer observation time can bring out more effects...|$|E
