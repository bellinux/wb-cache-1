40|$|This article {{examines}} the growth in accounting and finance PhD graduates across all Australian universities from 1965 to 2006. It investigates {{the impact of the}} major changes that were initiated in 1988 in higher education in Australia with the introduction of the Unified National Scheme (UNS) and, in 2002, with the Research Training Scheme (RTS). A data set of PhD thesis records provides data of actual PhD <b>completions,</b> as distinct from enrolments. Analyses show that both the number of accounting and finance PhD <b>completions</b> and the dispersion of these PhD <b>completions</b> across Australian universities increased from 1988 with the introduction of the UNS. There is also evidence that the proportion of accounting and finance-related PhD <b>completions</b> relative to total Australian PhD <b>completions</b> increased from 1988. While there is strong statistical support for the effect of the UNS on PhD <b>completions,</b> {{this is not the case}} for the more recent changes associated with the Research Training Scheme (RTS) ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Completion</b> Force sailed on 10February 1945 and was sighted leaving port by a Royal Navy submarine. However, {{attempts}} {{by it and}} several United States Navy submarines to attack between 11 and 14February were unsuccessful. More than 88 USAAF aircraft attempted to bomb the <b>Completion</b> Force on 13 and 14February, but were {{unable to do so}} because of bad weather. A further submarine attack on 16February did not damage any of the Japanese ships. As a result, the <b>Completion</b> Force reached its destination of Kure in Japan on 20February without having suffered any casualties. Despite this success, the Japanese Government was forced to discontinue its efforts to ship oil from Southeast Asia to Japan in March due to the heavy losses Allied submarines were inflicting on oil tankers, and all the ships of the <b>Completion</b> Force were sunk in or near Japanese home waters {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
