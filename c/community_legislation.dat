In 2008, the Association of Former Thule Workers took {{the case to the}} European courts. The petitioners claimed that Denmark's failure to comply with the rulings led to delays in detecting their illnesses, resulting in worsened prognoses. The country joined the European Atomic Energy Community in 1973, and is therefore not legally bound by the European treaty with respect to events in 1968: [...] "When the accident occurred, Denmark was not a Member State and could not therefore be considered as being bound by the <b>Community</b> <b>legislation</b> applicable at that time.
