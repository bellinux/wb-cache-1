Portrayal of the 'Other' in Israeli and Palestinian School Books", were announced in February 2013, in a statement signed by {{most members of the}} advisory panel, with the exceptions of several members, including Jerusalem physician Elihu Richter, who believes the method might understate Palestinian incitement, and of Arnon Groiss, who had not read the final report and also had doubts about the methodology employed. The advisory <b>council</b> <b>statement</b> attested to the high quality of the scientific standards used, and underwrote the findings. Complaints were made that they had not been given an advanced copy of the final report. One anonymous SAP member likened the potential impact of the study to the Goldstone Report.|$|E

2500|$|Sweetland {{planned to}} the {{return for the}} 1899 {{football}} season even though he would be graduating. He planned to start his medical training at Cornell. After the 1898 season he became involved in a controversy between two factions on the future direction of the football program that came to {{the head with the}} election of captain for the 1899 season. Originally a three-year starter at left guard, Daniel A. Reed was elected captain over Sweetland for the 1899 season. A very close election caused a rift in the football team. Reed won by a vote of ten to nine. Later Reed resigned as captain and the team elected Sweetland unanimously. The Cornell Athletic Council refused to ratify the election of Sweetland, stating that their decision was [...] "in the interest of harmony among the various elements who co-operation is necessary for the success of Cornell athletics." [...] The <b>council</b> <b>statement</b> listed two specific reasons. The first was that the Council wanted to purge all leaders of the competing factional rivalries on the team. This included Coach Warner and Tom Fennell as well as Daniel A. Reed. All three stated they would not return for the 1899 season. The second reason was a large number of football alumni protested the election of Sweetland as captain. Additionally, a charge was leveled that Sweetland was a professional, not an amateur, since he was paid for playing football for Elmira Athletic Club in the fall of 1897. Sweetland denied the allegation only admitting that he received reimbursement for his expenses but not for playing. After the Athletic Council ruling the team elected fullback Raymond Starbuck as team captain.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{professional}} doctorate, the Juris Doctor {{is the degree}} that prepares the recipient {{to enter the law}} profession (as do the M.D. or D.O. in the medical profession and the D.D.S in the dental profession). While the J.D. is the sole degree necessary to become a professor of law or to obtain a license to practice law, it (like the M.D. or D.D.S.) is not a [...] "research degree". Research degrees in the study of law include the Master of Laws (LL.M.), which ordinarily requires the J.D. as a prerequisite, and the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D./J.S.D.), which ordinarily requires the LL.M. as a prerequisite.
