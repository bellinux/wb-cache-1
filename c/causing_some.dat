5|$|November 2–5, 1932 - A Category2 {{hurricane}} {{parallels the}} north coast of Venezuela and Colombia 75miles (120km) offshore, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> damage. Later, it passes to the northeast of Providencia Island, destroying 36 houses and ruining crops.|$|E

5|$|On 6 January 2009, the Windmill Hill bridge, just to {{the west}} of Bedminster station, was hit by a vehicle, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> delays to train {{services}} while it was assessed for damage. The bridge was struck again on 17 December 2009, which stopped services for 40 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Tornado {{warnings}} were {{in effect}} {{at the time}} and issued on average about 30 minutes before the tornado hit, but few people were alerted as many were asleep as the tornado hit in the overnight hours. The local NOAA Weather Radio transmitter was experiencing technical difficulties at the time, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> weather radios to not sound an alarm. Damages were estimated at around $85 million.|$|E
5|$|While {{the storm}} {{moved through the}} state of Georgia, {{moderate}} winds of up to 45mph (72km/h) occurred along the coastline. Rainfall ranged from 3–5inches (75–125mm) across the southeast portion of the state, with isolated higher maxima of up to 7.05inches (179mm) in Rincon. Alberto produced a storm tide of 8.53feet (2.6m) at Fort Pulaski National Monument, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> beach erosion along the coastline.|$|E

5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add either an edge connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting that tree to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are exactly the pseudoforests in which every component is a 1-tree.|$|E
5|$|A {{snow melting}} vehicle works by {{scooping}} snow into a melting pit {{located in a}} large tank {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a thin jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E
5|$|Across the Western Caribbean, {{the storm}} {{produced}} heavy rainfall, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> minor damage. In Florida, a moderate storm tide caused coastal damage and flooding, while Alberto's outer rainbands produced several tornadoes. The storm was indirectly responsible for two drownings {{off the coast}} of Tampa Bay. In North Carolina, heavy rainfall caused locally severe flooding, and one child drowned in a flooded storm drain near Raleigh. The remnants of Alberto produced strong winds and left four people missing in Atlantic Canada. Overall, damage was minor along Alberto's path.|$|E

5|$|Five {{deaths were}} {{attributed}} to Cindy, none of them near the storm's landfall. Two {{people were killed in}} Georgia, one in Alabama, and two in Maryland. Approximately 300,000homes and businesses in southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast lost electrical power and a storm surge of 4–6feet (1.2-1.8m) affected the same area, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> beach erosion near Grand Isle, Louisiana. Hurricane Cindy's total damage was estimated to be US$320million.|$|E
5|$|Most of Acapulco {{remained}} {{closed for}} at least a week after the hurricane. Initially, authorities around Acapulco gave preference to clean up tourist areas, which resulted in the scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed. Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back. One airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} earthquake, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered a ground stop along the East Coast, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> flight delays. The Air Traffic Control tower at John F. Kennedy International Airport was evacuated. Flights were delayed at several airports, {{including}} John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Dulles International Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport. At Ronald Reagan National Airport, ceiling tiles fell in one terminal, and flights were halted.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects were}} {{concentrated}} on Qeshm, where several buildings were destroyed, although minor damage was reported around Bandar Abbas. All {{of the seven}} reported deaths occurred on Qeshm, with the injured being transferred to Bandar Abbas by boat. There were no reports of damage to oil industry facilities in the area. High-rise buildings in Dubai swayed during the earthquake, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> {{of them to be}} evacuated, but there were no reports of damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} ultimately stayed {{far away}} from the coast, and the heavy rainfall and thunderstorms remained at least 50miles (85km) offshore. While nearly stationary, Hurricane Ella produced waves of 5 to 9feet (2 to 3metres) in height, as well as rip currents along the coast. The highest wind gust from the storm over land was 31mph (50km/h) at Diamond Shoal Light. The waves reached the dunes along most beaches, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> minor beach erosion; the depleted sand returned within a few days. Further north, along the coast of Virginia, no large waves were reported, which was considered unusual for how close the hurricane was to the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team {{was responsible for}} casting, but Microsoft maintained a final say. The decision to use Alex Puccinelli instead of Steve Downes, the previous voice artist of Master Chief, was approved by Microsoft. The actors playing the cadets attended a boot camp before shooting to raise their fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes. Cast members drove themselves to overexertion in the training, <b>causing</b> <b>some</b> to vomit, which they saw as a bonding experience.|$|E
