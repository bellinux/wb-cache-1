5|$|On 24 January 2009, Ofcom allowed {{electrical}} {{retailers to}} be granted a licence to rebroadcast DAB signals within their stores to demonstrate DAB radio sets within their stores. The United Kingdom consumer charity, Which? warned that consumers who could not get an adequate DAB signal could be misled by the in-store sets. The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where DAB signals are blocked out. The DRDB recommended that <b>consumers</b> <b>should</b> check DAB coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a DAB radio to avoid disappointment.|$|E

25|$|Co-operative Federalism is {{the school}} of thought favouring {{consumer}} co-operative societies. Historically, its proponents have included JTW Mitchell and Charles Gide, as well as Paul Lambart and Beatrice Webb. The co-operative federalists argue that <b>consumers</b> <b>should</b> form co-operative wholesale societies (Co-operative Federations in which all members are co-operators, the best historical example of which being CWS in the United Kingdom), and that these co-operative wholesale societies should undertake purchasing farms or factories. They argue that profits (or surpluses) from these co-operative wholesale societies should be paid as dividends to the member co-operators, rather than to their workers.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, SAORVIEW offered 98% {{coverage}} for all channels. This {{was a significant}} improvement in free-to-air television coverage. <b>Consumers</b> <b>should</b> seek advice from their specialist retailer or manufacturer if looking to make a purchase in the immediate future. Similar services such as Saorview available in the United Kingdom (i.e. Freeview) {{and other parts of}} Europe are not compatible with Ireland's DTT service. RTÉ recommends that consumers wishing to avail of the SAORVIEW service only purchase receivers that carry the SAORVIEW approved logo. In practice, however, most MPEG-4 DVB-T compatible equipment, such as that conforming to the UK's Freeview HD standard, is capable of receiving SAORVIEW transmissions, albeit with some limitations to the EPG function. As the Freeview HD system is based on the newer DVB-T2 standard, SAORVIEW reception is dependent on the backward-compatibility of such devices.|$|E

The traditional packaging shielded food against mechanical stress, humidity, light influence, contaminants, insect attack, microorganisms, off-flavours.

40|$|Apple {{is one of}} the {{well-known}} brand which provide users its innovative devices such as cell phones, computers, apple TV etc. To help the customers stay up to date with the newest cell phone device, the Apple company has introduced a concept of the apple upgrade plan which lets the customers upgrade to a newly launched cell phone device every year. This paper first compares the cell phone rates by studying the apple upgrade plan offered by Apple along with different carrier plans. Next, it studies the inflation rates (high, average, and low) along with the AppleCare+ option, and helps users find the most effective alternative in cost for three different types of consumers: perfect, average, and clumsy consumers. We conclude that in high and average inflation rates, the best alternative for a perfect and average consumer is to upgrade to iPhone through a carrier without purchasing AppleCare+, although the clumsy <b>consumer</b> <b>should</b> opt for apple upgrade plan. However, in the low inflation rate, the average <b>consumer</b> <b>should</b> choose apple upgrade plan if they expect next four years in a low economic development...|$|R

2500|$|In 2003, red yeast rice {{products}} {{began to}} reappear in the U.S. market. In 2007, the FDA sent Warning Letters to two dietary supplement companies.

The FDA also issued a warning press release. The crux of the release was that <b>consumers</b> <b>should</b> [...] "… not buy or eat red yeast rice products … may contain an unauthorized drug that could be harmful to health." [...] The rationale for [...] "… harmful to health …" [...] was that consumers might not understand that the dangers of monacolin-containing red yeast rice might be the same as those of prescription statin drugs.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the Regulatory Council for the La Rioja Denomination of Origin {{created a}} new logo to go on all bottles of wine {{produced}} under this designation. [...] From now on bottles of wine from the La Rioja Qualified Denomination of Origin will no longer bear the familiar logo. In an attempt to appeal to younger wine-lovers, the long-standing logo will now be replaced with a brighter, more modern logo with cleaner lines. The aim is to reflect the new, modern aspects of wine-growing in La Rioja without detracting from the traditional wines. In theory, the new logo represents a Tempranillo vine symbolising “heritage, creativity and dynamism”. [...] <b>Consumers</b> <b>should</b> start seeing the labels in October 2008.

2500|$|Paul proposes sharply {{reducing}} the government's regulation of medications and health supplements by {{reducing the}} role of, and ultimately eliminating, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In a 2011 interview, Paul said, [...] "Well, the FDA just serves the drug companies... they also prevent drugs from coming on the market [...] 10, 15 years later than other countries have it. So, yes, government just {{gets in the way}} on so many of those things." [...] He favors allowing FDA-approved prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries and sold at a lower cost than the same drugs otherwise sell for in the US – thereby allowing international markets to set drug prices in the US market – a practice that has been prohibited by the FDA. In the interest, as he sees it, of fighting for greater freedom of choice for consumers, he has also introduced bills that would significantly reduce the government's ability to prevent manufacturers or sellers of dietary supplements and certain other health products from making what government regulators believe to be false or misleading claims about the health effects of the products. He essentially feels that <b>consumers</b> <b>should</b> be able to buy whatever health aids they want from whomever they want, without the need for guidance by the government.|$|E
