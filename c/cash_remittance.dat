50|$|Chung's brother Chung Mong-hun, {{then the}} {{president}} of Hyundai Asan who pioneered South and North joint Mount Kumgang tour business, committed suicide on Aug 4, 2003 when he was investigated by prosecutors for his alleged $400 millions cash remit to North Korea shortly before 2000 North-South summit. Initially this suspicion was raised from US when Congressional Research Service reported such allegation from CIA source on March 5, 2002. Upon hearing of such report, Grand National Party made use of this suspicion to attack the legitimacy of President Kim Dae-jung's government, and demanded thorough investigation through hearings and independent special prosecutors. Several weeks before leaving his office, President Kim gave an apology and advised no investigation for this matter for fear of aggravating North and South's relation, and Chung Mong-hun also confessed much of the allegations to public in his final attempt to evade investigation. But Grand National Party was resolute in its demand for formal investigation. Shortly after Roh's inauguration, Grand National Party passed the law entitling special prosecutors to investigate this case, taking advantage of its majority seats in National Assembly. Roh's regime wasn't able to refuse the demand of investigation, and Chung Mong-hun committed suicide when he was investigated {{about the use of}} $15 millions worth of Korean won which was suspected to had been money laundered after its withdrawal from Hyundai's bank accounts. In fact, the money wasn't part of $400 millions <b>cash</b> <b>remittance</b> to North Korea. North Korea blamed Grand National Party immediately after Chung Mong-hun's suicide. So Chung Mong-joon has joined the party which could be considered to be responsible for his brother's death, but Chung blames President Roh instead. In his autobiography which was published in 2011, Chung argues that President Roh didn't refuse Grand National Party's demand of investigation because he believes Roh actually wanted to investigate his brother to revenge on his withdrawal of supporting Roh in 2002 presidential election.|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{migration}} occurred {{from the}} late 19 th century to the 1930 's. There were 3 directions: from north to northeast, from inland areas to the coastal big cities, and from the south to southeast Asia; the southward and northward labor migrations being roughly equal. There was a short-term, periodic migration of farm workers and the like along with long-term or permanent abode-oriented (immigration) type of migration. Agriculture and mining in the northeastern region, industry in the coastal region, and commerce and sugar or rubber plantations in southeast Asia, were popular. In each of these cases, the provincial, affiliated relations of the migrants’ native places were maintained without interruption and, based {{on the development of}} various organizations mediating the migration, labor migration was made easy. However, in terms of proficiency of the labor force and the relatively low correlation with industry should be noted. With regard to the transfer of funds, there existed locally a country-wide remittance network of Shanxi bankers and the Remitting Houses directing remittances of Chinese merchants residing abroad in southeast Asia, which formed an international remittance network. The latter possessed several remittance routes based on Singapore and Hong Kong along with diverse exchange remittance functions. The client in southeast Asia pays into the Remitting Houses with local currency. It is then remitted to the agent in Hong Kong by Hong Kong dollars, exchanged for the currency of the People's Republic of China, and sent to agents in Fujian and Guangdong from where it is submitted to the remittee through the agent at home. This route was the established mode of the Remitting Houses, but even within this process there existed such forms as cancellation by countervailing by exchange trading in Singapore and Hong Kong, the abbreviation of <b>cash</b> <b>remittance</b> through merchandise transactions, and countervailing through trade connections by forming directly a settling connection with Guangdong and Amoy where remittances were concentrated. Selection was made among these, depending upon the price of merchandise and exchange rate in the market, and involved a close relationship between the southern Chinese economy and the money markets in Hong Kong and Singapore. Based on these general background, this paper tried to examine the history of emigration of Chao-Zhou people in the east Guangdong province and their relationship with their home land...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the adoption of Integrated Striga Management (ISMA) technologies among maize farmers in Bauchi and Kano states of northern Nigeria. It employs a double-hurdle approach to analyse the factors influencing adoption and intensity of ISMA technologies among households, using cross-sectional data of 643 farmers from the two states. The {{results show that the}} estimated coefficients of exogenous income and proximity to extension office are negatively significant (P < 0. 05), while higher total farm income, polygamous households, past participation in on-farm trials, awareness of the technology, contact with extension agents and access to <b>cash</b> <b>remittances</b> are positive and significant (P < 0. 01), and are the most significant factors likely to influence ISMA technologies adoption. Marital status, household size, farm size and access to <b>cash</b> <b>remittances</b> are most significant factors influencing adoption intensity. Maize farmers in the study area who adopted ISMA technologies obtained higher output than the non-adopters, which resulted in a positive and significant effect on their total farm income. Hence, policies targeted at increasing maize productivity through Striga management need to include ISMA technologies as a potentially feasible option. The study recommends actions to improve farmers’ access to financial services to increase their liquidity. Nevertheless, the most immediate action will be improvement in farmers’ access to extension services as they have proved to be a reliable source of information in the rural areas. Peer Revie...|$|R

30|$|First, {{a broader}} {{definition}} of care assists {{in understanding the}} interactions between family members in different geographical locations. Baldassar and Merla follow Finch (1989) and define family care involving the following: financial and material support (including <b>cash</b> <b>remittances</b> or goods such as food, clothing, and paying household and other bills such as medical care); practical support (exchanging advice and assisting with tasks); emotional and moral support (aimed at improving psychological wellbeing); personal care (feeding and bathing); and accommodation (providing shelter and security).

However, for the exposure and sensitivity, all the variables were considered in the analysis. This is because adaptive capacity is considered as positively contributing to the reduction of vulnerability, while exposure and sensitivity are negatively contributing to vulnerability reduction.

40|$|Abstract: Pakistan and the Philippines are {{two leading}} source {{countries}} for international migration. Currently about 3. 75 million Pakistanis and 7. 0 million Filipinos {{are estimated to}} be living or working overseas. Both the countries have nearly 3 decades of experience of managing migration through sets of policies and programs aimed at promoting overseas employment opportunities for their citizens, maximizing the benefits of migration for migrants, protecting migrants against exploitation and hazards and improving the welfare of migrants and their families. Policies have also been introduced for maximizing the inflow of <b>cash</b> <b>remittances</b> through formal institutional channels. The relevance and adequacy of the policy measures is examined from the perspectives of making migration more “affordable ” to include more social groups, and productive use of capital and human assets resulting from migration for improved and sustainable livelihoods of migrants and their families.
