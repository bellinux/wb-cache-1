Our patient had an unusual case of liver disease and provided no history of prior bariatric surgery. Later, it was recognized {{that he had a}} JIB in the 1970 s, which was also responsible for the gamut of his illnesses. Patients with JIB are often not recognized, as they died of <b>complications,</b> <b>or</b> underwent <b>reversal</b> of their surgery or a liver-kidney transplant.

40|$|Several {{initiatives}} {{have started to}} transfer colorectal cancer follow-up (FU) from secondary to primary care. For this purpose, {{it is important to}} assess when and how recurrences of rectal carcinoma are detected after treatment with curative intent. Retrospective multicentre cohort study. Patients participating in an FU programme after curative intended treatment for rectal cancer stages I-III between 2007 and 2014. Of the 378 patients, 64 (17 %) developed recurrent disease (RD). Most were detected during scheduled FU consultations (n = 55) by (a combination of) radiological examinations and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and were asymptomatic (n = 53); outside scheduled FU consultations, RD was detected during the treatment of postoperative <b>complications</b> <b>or</b> ostomy <b>reversal</b> (n = 5), or due to symptoms (n = 4). Most frequent sites of recurrence were liver (50 %), lung (44 %), multiple (22 %) or locoregional (16 %). Treatment of RD with curative intent was performed more frequently when detected during scheduled FU (60 vs. 22 %). The only predictive factor for developing RD was stage III disease on initial presentation. The majority of rectal cancer patients are diagnosed with RD at an asymptomatic stage during scheduled FU consultations. Only a few patients presented with RD outside the FU programme. Arguably, general practitioners could order these same diagnostic tests during F...|$|R

40|$|Male {{patients}} with proven urethral strictures (total 210) were prospectively randomised to undergo either dilatation (106 patients) or internal urethrotomy (104 patients) as an outpatient procedure under local anaesthesia.
