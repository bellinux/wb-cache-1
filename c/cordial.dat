50|$|<b>Cordials</b> {{were used}} to renew the natural heat, {{recreate}} and revive the spirits, and free the whole body from the malignity of diseases. Many <b>cordials</b> were also considered aphrodisiacs, a view which encouraged their consumption in a social {{as opposed to a}} medical context. Other early varieties of alcoholic <b>cordials</b> were flavoured with spices and herbal ingredients which were thought to settle the stomach after excessive eating. These <b>cordials</b> were called Surfeit Waters, which were specifically created for treating overindulgence.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>cordials</b> and {{squashes}} contain preservatives such as {{potassium sorbate}} or (in traditional <b>cordials)</b> sulphites, {{as they are}} designed to be stored on shelves.

5|$|In the 1890s, mixed lodges {{following}} a standard Masonic ritual started {{to appear in}} France, and quickly spread to other countries. Women-only jurisdictions appeared soon afterwards. As a general rule, the admission of women is now recognised in Continental (Grand Orient) jurisdictions. In Anglo-American Freemasonry, neither mixed nor all-female lodges are officially recognised, although unofficial relations can be <b>cordial,</b> with premises sometimes shared.|$|E

50|$|The liquid center {{found in}} some <b>cordials</b> is made using {{invertase}} to hydrolyze sucrose in the filling, a process which {{can take up to}} two weeks.

There were numerous Imperial embassies to China from Japan, diplomatic missions {{that were not}} halted until 894 by Emperor Uda (r. 887–897), upon persuasion by Sugawara no Michizane (845–903). The Japanese Emperor Tenmu (r. 672–686) even established his conscripted army on that of the Chinese model, his state ceremonies on the Chinese model, and constructed his palace at Fujiwara on the Chinese model of architecture.|$|E

Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E

5|$|Harbaugh made {{headlines}} {{prior to the}} season by claiming 2007 would be Carroll's last year with USC before departing to the NFL, drawing a terse rebuke from Carroll; Harbaugh later called the 2007Trojans {{one of the best}} teams in history at the Pac-10 Media Day, reiterating the position in the week before their game. However, there were no hard feelings between the coaches. The two kept in <b>cordial</b> phone contact and Carroll made light of Harbaugh's comments several times during the season.|$|E

Meanwhile, Galdran's sister, the Marquise of Merindar, attempts to manipulate Mel into distracting Shevraeth from her covert plans to take the throne for herself, though this is largely unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Britain's Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901 left King George as the second-longest-reigning monarch in Europe. His always <b>cordial</b> {{relations}} with his brother-in-law, the new King Edward VII, continued to tie Greece to Britain. This was abundantly important in Britain's support of King George's son Prince George as Governor-General of Crete. Nevertheless, Prince George resigned in 1906 after {{a leader in}} the Cretan Assembly, Eleftherios Venizelos, campaigned to have him removed.|$|E
5|$|As {{it turned}} out, the {{relationship}} between SHAEF and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group was far from <b>cordial,</b> with the Deputy Supreme Commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, and the Deputy Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan, both frequently critical of Montgomery. In September 1944 an intelligence crisis similar to Kasserine arose, when the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park did not locate the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg in the Arnhem area, but information from the Dutch resistance and a consequent photo reconnaissance ordered by Major Brian Urquhart, the Intelligence Officer at I Airborne Corps, confirmed the German presence. Strong and Smith then flew to Brussels to warn Montgomery. However, Montgomery decided to accept the risk rather than alter the plans for Operation Market Garden.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through {{the support of his}} nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining <b>cordial</b> relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E
