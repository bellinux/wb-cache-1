40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{emphasis}} has moved towards integrating all a <b>building's</b> systems via <b>centralised</b> <b>building</b> <b>management</b> systems (BMS). To provide a more intelligent approach to the facility management, safety and energy control in <b>building</b> <b>management</b> systems (IBMS), this paper proposes a methodology for integrating the data within a BMS via a single multi-media networking technology and providing the BMS with artificial intelligence (AI) {{through the use of}} knowledge-based systems (KBS) technology. By means of artificial intelligence, the system is capable of assessing, diagnosing and suggesting the best solution. This paper outlines how AI techniques can enhance the control of HVAC systems for occupant comfort and efficient running costs based on occupancy prediction. Also load control and load balancing are investigated. Instead of just using pre-programmed load priorities, this work has investigated the use of a dynamic system of priorities which are based on many factors such as area usage, occupancy, time of day and real time environmental conditions. This control strategy which is based on a set of rules running on the central control system, makes use of information gathered from outstations throughout the building and communicated via the building's data-bus. ...|$|R

The aim of this research is to capture and represent <b>building</b> <b>management</b> rules using organizational semiotics methods. We implement Semantic Analysis, which determines semantic units in <b>building</b> <b>management</b> and their relationship patterns of behaviour, and Norm Analysis, which extracts and specifies the norms that establish how and when these management actions occur.

As this study aimed is at assessing <b>building</b> <b>management</b> concern in providing access and facilities for PWD in Klang Valley shopping malls, it has three objectives {{that need to be}} achieved. Firstly to identify related provisions of access and facilities for PWD in shopping malls, secondly to examine <b>building</b> <b>management</b> awareness, willingness, and readiness in providing access and facilities for PWD in shopping malls and last one is to recommend measures to increase <b>building</b> <b>management</b> awareness, willingness, and readiness in providing access and facilities for PWD in shopping malls. Ten shopping malls in Klang Valley were selected based on the capacity of customer visits which is that frequented by visitors including PWD. The research methodology that has been implemented during the research is through the visual observation about the access and facilities for PWD that has been provided in shopping malls and the structured interview has been conducted to obtain the information about the awareness, willingness, and readiness of <b>building</b> <b>management</b> in providing access and facilities for PWD in shopping malls and to fulfill the objectives. The data is obtained from the survey that has been carried out at the selected shopping malls or <b>building</b> <b>management.</b> All the data has been gathered and analyzed, and have been presented or shows into forms of table and charts. Findings show that the score among of respondents level of awareness, willingness and readiness in providing access and facilities for PWD in shopping malls selected in Klang Valley. The level of awareness is higher compare to the level of willingness and readiness. Most of the respondents and their <b>building</b> <b>management</b> have excellent awareness and willingness and good readiness in providing access and facilities for PWD in shopping malls. Recommendations are made to increase <b>building</b> <b>management</b> awareness, willingness, and readiness in providing access and facilities for PWD in shopping malls...|$|R
