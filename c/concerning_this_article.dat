5000|$|<b>Concerning</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> The Equal Rights Trust and the {{non-governmental}} Kenya Human Rights Commission said in 2012,While the Constitution {{does not}} explicitly provide for non-discrimination {{on grounds of}} sexual orientation and gender identity, there is scope {{for this to be}} rectified through the courts or subsequent legislation. Article 27(4) of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 provides that the [...] "state shall not discriminate directly or indirectly on any ground, including characteristics", while Article 27(5) states that persons shall not discriminate on any of the grounds [...] "specified or contemplated in clause (4)". Thus defined, the prohibition on discrimination by both the state and non-state actors should be read as inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity.|$|E

The committee made, <b>concerning</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> the following decision: The article contained inappropriate phrases and was published by a political newspaper read by broad sectors of society, and it also contained clear violations of legal determinants as well as exceeding the proper bounds of public criticism given that the present time requires selectivity with respect to topics and phrases.
