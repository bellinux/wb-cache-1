40|$|Many Emerging Church preachers {{claim the}} Bible is not viewed {{the same way}} it once was. Consequently ministers need to rethink some aspects of how they go about preaching and communicating. Emerging Church preachers argue that Christianity must develop a new way of describing, defining, and {{defending}} the gospel. The aim {{of this study is to}} answer the question: To what extent, if any, is preaching in the Emerging Church different than that of traditional expositional preaching in the Evangelical Church and how does one compare with the other as far as success in addressing the needs of post-modern Christians? Chapter one gives a brief introduction of the Emerging Church movement by briefly defining and describing the diverse movement (EC movement) that arose within Protestant Christianity due to a reaction to modernism in Western Christianity. Chapter two provides a literature study where definitions of both preaching styles are considered – emerging style(s) and expository preaching. Included with the emerging preaching style(s) and expositional preaching will be characteristics comprising these styles. Chapter three (methodology) consists of <b>charts,</b> <b>definitions,</b> and descriptions comparing both the modern and postmodern movement through their characteristics and values, purposes for the movements, and homiletics of the movements. Chapter four, "Findings From of The Comparisons From The Two Models of Preaching" consists of the results found from the research. Chapter five, "Conclusions Of Preaching For The Two Models Of Preaching" will consist of a critical analysis of the homiletics in both the Emerging Church and the Traditional Evangelical Church.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) enable educational and cultural institutions to rethink and experiment with their conduct of learning using digital social media and networking tools. Meanwhile, several well-known – yet distinct – initiatives within the OER world continue to purport {{a mission of}} education as a ‘public good’. In addition current thinking as well as emerging United Kingdom (UK) and international policy agendas on education are shifting {{from the idea of}} simply providing access to content, towards the notion of creating ‘open participatory learning ecosystems’ (cf. Smith and Casserly, 2006; Seely-Brown 2007; Seely-Brown & Adler 2008). At the core of these evolutionary trajectories of OER mediation, the notion of community and participation become more complex. Put simply, an OER community might consist of those who collaborate to create or reuse OER content. Alternatively a community may be formed by interactions between tutors and peers aggregating in the study and creative adaptation of particular OER units. Likewise, as the landscape of OER becomes more diversified (comprising of initiatives coming from both established educational institutions and from ‘alternative’ or informal social constellations of interest and practice), so does the configuration of social production of content in learning environments. The question then arises as to the appropriateness of community building tools or mediating artefacts that address different audiences’ inscriptions or goals to facilitate engagement. To address these questions we first <b>chart</b> <b>definitions</b> of, and affordances surrounding participation and community engagement in a diverse body of OER initiatives. Secondly, deploying Engeström’s framework on social production as a new landscape for learning (2007), we draw on a number of interviews with OER professionals and volunteers as well as on insights on learner behaviour to offer a mapping of learning situations across ‘informal’/’formal’ public spaces. We conclude by problematising the notion of collaborative communities or ‘relational networks’ within an OER context and by proposing a framework that takes into account a number of boundary issues concerning design of original and OER content (Wilson, 2007), and peer-production of content, including expertise, locus of agency and pedagogy (Conole et al., in press). ...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Design of products for case-of-disassembly is a key aspect of product recycling. Similarly, design tools which allow alternative designs to be compared with respect to case-of-disassembly are of great importance. An improved method for assessing the difficulty encountered in disassembling products for recycling is presented. The original version of the method relies on the evaluator's subjective judgments of disassembly task difficulty. The primary objective of the research is to reduce the subjectivity inherent in the evaluation procedure. A catalog of quantitative difficulty ratings for common disassembly tasks is generated. The scores are derived from work measurement analyses of the tasks and are based published motion-time data. The scores provide an analytical means for comparing disassembly tasks. The catalog is adapted to the previously developed ease-of-disassembly evaluation method. The evaluation procedure involves disassembling a product (or visualizing the process for conceptual designs), choosing difficulty scores from the catalog for the tasks involved, and recording the data in a spreadsheet-like evaluation <b>chart.</b> Task <b>definitions,</b> guidelines, and examples are included in the catalog and aid the evaluator in selecting appropriate scores. The revised disassembly evaluation procedure is demonstrated for both a computer keyboard and CPU.

In the preface, the author clearly defines the target audience and objectives of the text with the following statement: “If you are using a chromatography data system in the regulated areas of the pharmaceutical, medical device, active pharmaceutical ingredient and contract research organisations, you will need to validate the system. This book will be your guide through the regulations and jargon. It provides practical advice that can be used directly by you to meet regulatory requirements and allow a sustainable validation effort for your chromatography data system throughout its operational life. ” There are 25 chapters that range from introductory material on CDSs, regulatory requirements, computer validation and managing system risk, to implementation issues that cover user specification, planning, system selection, purchase and installation, and user training, and then to performance and review issues, and records management. The book is very detailed and is full of very practical advice and recommendations, useful flow <b>charts</b> and <b>definitions</b> that will all be extremely valuable for any person charged with responsibility for implementing such a CDS.

40|$|The {{operating}} conditions of urban drainage networks during storm events certainly {{depend on the}} hydraulic conveying capacity of conduits but also on downstream boundary conditions. This is particularly true in costal areas where {{the level of the}} receiving water body is directly or indirectly affected by tidal or wave effects. In such cases, not just different rainfall conditions (varying intensity and duration), but also different sea-levels and their effects on the network operation should be considered. This paper aims to study the behaviour of a seaside town storm sewer network, estimating the threshold condition for flooding and proposing a simplified method to assess the urban flooding severity as a function of either climate variables. The case study is a portion of the drainage system of Rimini (Italy), implemented and numerically modelled by means of InfoWorks CS code. The hydraulic simulation of the sewerage system has therefore allowed to identify the percentage of nodes of the drainage system where flooding is expected to occur.

Objective: To determine prevalence, incidence, and resolution rates of NP. Design, setting, and participants: A longitudinal, community-based study was conducted among 1688 men aged 50 - 78 yr in Krimpen aan den IJssel, The Netherlands (reference date: 1995), with planned follow-up rounds at 2, 4, and 6 yr. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: NP was determined with frequency-volume <b>charts.</b> Two <b>definitions</b> of NP were used: (1) a nocturnal urine production (NUP) of > 9 0 ml/h (NUP 90) and (2) the nocturnal voided volume plus first morning void being > 33 % of the 24 -h voided volume (NUV 33). Nocturia was defined as two or more voids per night. We determined the prevalence of NP at each study round. At first follow-up, we determined the incidence in men without baseline NP and the resolution in men with baseline NP. Prevalence of NP in men with or without nocturia was also determined. Results and limitations: At baseline, the prevalence of NUP 90 was 15. 0 % and increased to 21. 7 % after 6. 5 yr, whereas the prevalence of NUV 33 was 77. 8 % at baseline and 80. 5 % after 6. 5 yr. At 2. 1 yr of follow-up, the incidences of NUP 90 and NUV 33 were 13. 6 % and 60. 3 %, respectively, and the resolution rates were 57. 0 % and 17. 8 %, respectively. Because of this fluctuation in NP, no reliable long-term incidences could be calculated. At baseline, NUP 90 was prevalent in 27. 7 % of men with nocturia and in 8. 0 % of those without nocturia. At baseline, NUV 33 was prevalent in 91. 9 % of men with nocturia and in 70. 1 % of men without nocturia. Conclusions: Due to the fluctuation of NP, it is advisable to first determine its chronicity and cause before starting treatment. Because of the high prevalence of NP in men without nocturia, NUV 33 should be reconsidered as a discriminative definition of NP. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.

The normal corporate response to a “call for metrics ” is to panic, then paint the sky bright with an array of red, yellow, and green indicator boxes. Why do we treat metrics differently than we do a medication prescription? We never use that approach at a pharmacy.

Data were extracted to populate 2 × 2 tables relating birthweight standard with outcome, and meta-analysis was performed where possible.

40|$|Aims Obstructive {{symptoms}} such as slow stream, dribbling and straining {{are often}} reported by painful bladder syndrome and interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) patients. Our hypothesis was that some patients with PBS/IC have an associated measurable bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) secondary to dysfunctional voiding and that those patients with more severe PBS/IC {{are more likely to}} have BOO. Methods This is a retrospective chart review of female patients diagnosed with PBS/IC based on the NIDDK research <b>definition.</b> <b>Charts</b> were reviewed for clinical symptom severity, ulcer or non-ulcer PBS/IC on cystoscopy, and pressure-flow urodynamics (UDPF). Patients were excluded if they had a urinary infection at the time of urodynamics or did not meet study entry requirements. The cut-off values of ≤ 12 ml/sec and ≥ 25 cm of water was used to define BOO. Results Of the 231 women: 38 had ulcer PBS/IC and 193 had non-ulcer PBS/IC. MCC was 269 ml in non-ulcer PBS/IC and 200 ml in ulcer PBS/IC (P [*]=[*] 0. 006). One hundred eleven women (48 %) met criteria for obstruction. MCC was 298 ml in the non-obstructed group and 214 ml in the obstructed group (P [*]<[*] 0. 0001). The maximum flow with non-ulcer PBS/IC was 11. 0 ml/sec and in ulcer PBS/IC 8. 9 ml/sec (P [*]=[*] 0. 04) Detrusor pressure at maximum flow was 33. 3 cm H 2 O, in non-ulcer, and 37. 4 cm H 2 O in ulcer PBS/IC (P [*]=[*] 0. 01). Conclusions Forty-eight percent of our PBS/IC patients have BOO, and increasing severity of PBS/IC is associated with higher voiding pressure. Neurourol.
