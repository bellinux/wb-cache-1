5|$|After {{his band}} The <b>Crosswalk</b> was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, {{which he used}} as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{converted}} NY376's intersections {{with the}} main gate of Vassar College and College Avenue into roundabouts. Both of the roundabouts replaced traffic lights. A traffic signal used to control traffic for a pedestrian <b>crosswalk</b> was also removed {{as part of their}} construction. Another roundabout was constructed in 2008 at Fulton and Collegeview Avenues. NYSDOT has called the installation of roundabouts a success, stating that it has significantly calmed traffic, decreased congestion and increased traffic flow.|$|E

40|$|A driver-yielding {{enforcement}} {{program that}} included decoy pedestrians, feedback flyers, written and verbal warnings, and saturation enforcement for a 2 -week period was evaluated {{in the city}} of Miami Beach using a multiple baseline design. During baseline, data were collected at <b>crosswalks</b> along two major corridors. Treatment was introduced first at selected <b>crosswalks</b> without traffic signals along one corridor. A week later, enforcement was shifted to <b>crosswalks</b> along the second corridor. Results indicated that the percentage of drivers yielding to pedestrians increased following the introduction of the enforcement program in each corridor and that these increases were sustained for a period of a year with minimal additional enforcement. The effects also generalized somewhat to untreated <b>crosswalks</b> in both corridors, as well as to <b>crosswalks</b> with traffic signals...|$|R

5|$|SBS {{implementation}} on {{the corridor}} {{is planned for}} November 2017. In the Rockaways and in Broad Channel, due to less dense land uses, and due to lower utilization of stops, several existing Q52 and Q53 stops will be consolidated or discontinued. Q22 local service will continue to serve the stops in the Rockaways, while the low volume stops at Cross Bay Boulevard and 5th Road will be discontinued. A new stop at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 84th Street would replace stops at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two stops would be relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road would be moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road would be moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be adjacent to a <b>crosswalk.</b> Stops on Woodhaven Boulevard would be modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue would be moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to use the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow service road. Two SBS stops will be added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, and at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively. Stations on Woodhaven Boulevard at Jamaica Avenue, 91st Avenue and 101st Avenue, and at Cross Bay Boulevard at Liberty Avenue (northbound) and Rockaway Boulevard (southbound) would be new stations that {{were built in the}} median by the NYCDOT.|$|E
50|$|In North America, zebra {{crossings}} {{are almost}} exclusively called (marked) <b>crosswalks</b> and {{often do not}} incorporate stripes. In some areas, marked <b>crosswalks</b> are the only places where it is legal to cross the road (see jaywalking).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Crosswalks</b> between {{different}} vocabularies are an indispensable prerequisite for integrated and highquality search scenarios in distributed data environments. Offered through {{the web and}} linked with each other they act as a central link so that users could {{move back and forth}} {{between different}} data sources being online available. In the past, <b>crosswalks</b> between different thesauri have been primarily developed manually. In the long run the intellectual updating of such <b>crosswalks</b> requires huge personnel expenses. Therefore, an integration of automatic matching procedures, as for example Ontology Matching Tools, seems pretty obvious. On the basis of computergenerated correspondences between the Thesaurus for Economics (STW) and the Thesaurus for the Social Sciences (TheSoz) our contribution will explore crossborder approaches between ITassisted tools and procedures {{on the one hand and}} external quality measurements via domain experts on the other hand. Thus, we will present techniques to semiautomatically perform vocabulary <b>crosswalks.</b> Due to intellectually evaluated results of multiple matching tools in the forerun, quality statements concerning the reliability of further computergenerated <b>crosswalks</b> can be made. This way, the application of various tools and procedures gradually contributes to an increase in quality. Moreover, on the longterm it facilitates a continuous update of highquality vocabulary <b>crosswalks...</b>|$|R
25|$|Crosswalks at each entry/exit may {{be located}} {{at least one}} full car length outside the circle.

40|$|This paper aims at {{developing}} a pedestrian {{level of service}} (LOS) model for the overall unsignalized midblock crossings of road segments {{from the perspective of}} the pedestrian's perception of safety and convenience in Chinese midblock crossing environment. Firstly, the potential primary factors influencing pedestrian LOS at unsignalized midblock <b>crosswalks</b> were summarized from four respects: traffic conflicts, the distance between <b>crosswalks,</b> crossing facilities, and delay. Secondly, 948 participants’ real-time sense of safety and convenience when they were crossing the 30 selected unsignalized midblock <b>crosswalks</b> and the design and operational characteristics of the selected road segments were collected. The selected midblock <b>crosswalks</b> were typical of those prevalent in the medium-sized urban areas of China, and the participants of questionnaire survey covered a broad cross section of Chinese population of pedestrians. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis were carried out to develop pedestrian LOS model for the overall unsignalized midblock crossings of road segments. The results revealed that the factors significantly influencing pedestrian LOS of the overall unsignalized midblock crossings of road segments included volume of two-way motor vehicle, the distance between marked midblock <b>crosswalks,</b> and the distance between unmarked <b>crosswalks.</b> A reliable, statistically calibrated pedestrian LOS model was developed (R 2 = 0. 80) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{computer}} vision-based technique that mines existing spatial image databases for discovery of zebra <b>crosswalks</b> in urban settings. Knowing the location of <b>crosswalks</b> is critical for a blind person planning a trip that includes street crossing. By augmenting existing spa-tial databases (such as Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) with this information, a blind traveler may make more in-formed routing decisions, resulting in greater safety during independent travel. Our algorithm first searches for zebra <b>crosswalks</b> in satel-lite images; all candidates thus found are validated against spatially registered Google Street View images. This cas-caded approach enables fast and reliable discovery and localization of zebra <b>crosswalks</b> in large image datasets. While fully automatic, our algorithm could also be com-plemented by a final crowdsourcing validation stage for in-creased accuracy. ...|$|R

25|$|Under {{the plan}} {{approved}} in 2006, the Husky Stadium station would have three entrances, connected via underground walkways or overpasses: {{on the east}} side of Montlake Boulevard adjacent to Husky Stadium; on the north side of Pacific Place on the Burke-Gilman Trail; and on the west side of Montlake Boulevard near the University of Washington Medical Center. In 2007, the Seattle Design Commission recommended an overpass to cross Montlake Boulevard in lieu of the underground walkway, and Sound Transit updated the station's design plan accordingly with a bridge on the north side of the Rainier Vista triangle. The University of Washington unveiled its plans to redevelop the Rainier Vista triangle into a landscaped park, with a land bridge over Pacific Place, and requested that Sound Transit connect the station through a mid-block <b>crosswalk</b> instead of the bridge. The mid-block <b>crosswalk</b> was rejected by the FTA, and a compromise pedestrian overpass connecting to the center of the Rainier Vista triangle was adopted in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Traditional cycle lanes {{increase}} vehicle/bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist {{must look}} ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a <b>crosswalk.</b> As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To {{give way to a}} cyclist on the outside, requires the exiting motorist to look toward the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at St. John's roundabout in Newbury, Berkshire, England and at Museum Road, Portsmouth, England. The cycle lanes at Museum Road were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing, while the St. John's roundabout retains perimeter cycle lanes.|$|E
