40|$|Climate {{change is}} more and more said to be a problem of migration. The common refrain is that climate change will bear in some way on {{patterns}} of human mobility, resulting in either insecurity, humanitarian crises, or all manner of inventive adaptive responses. The inherent challenge in such claims is, however, that of causality: the degree to which climate change influences migration alongside the myriad social, political, and economic reasons people migrate. This challenge is far from being settled. Importantly, the unsettled question of causality exposes how the crisis of humanism is central to the construction of the <b>climate</b> <b>migrant</b> or climate refugee. Coming to terms with this crisis means having to confront how issues of power and knowledge shape how we understand the relationship between climate change and migration. But even more importantly it means having to ask probing questions {{about what it means to}} be human today.

40|$|The major {{research}} {{purpose is to}} critically assess {{the relationship between the}} use of renewable energies and socio-economic development of the rural people in Bangladesh. The research objectives are focused to explore the socio-economic development of rural people resulting from the application of renewable energies; to assess how Grameen Shakti distributes renewable energy technologies to improve socio-economic conditions of rural people; and to explain under what conditions the renewable energy usage can actually bring positive socio-economic changes in rural areas. The problem statement is focused on why many villagers are not using solar energies even if it is cheaper to buy. The research is conducted by qualitative research method and both secondary and primary data collection techniques are employed. The study is focused on Bangladesh because the number of solar energy installment is increasing vastly and it has become very cheap to buy. The study is conducted in two villages of Dumki Upazila of Patuakhali district of Bangladesh because there are many climate migrants live in this area and most of renewable energy users in this area are from <b>climate</b> <b>migrant</b> backgrounds. The study consists of 8 qualitative interviews with households who use solar energy and 8 more qualitative interviews with households who do not use solar energy. Focus group discussion is also conducted as an interview session with Grameen Shakti employees. A telephone interview is also conducted with UNO (Upazila Nirbahi Officer) of Dumki Upazilla to get information about how local government can help to increase the accessibility of solar energy. It is found that there are visible differences between the users and non-users of solar energies in rural areas; such as the households who use solar energy achieve comparatively more socio-economic and environmental benefits than the non-users of solar energy. Distribution and accessibility of renewable energies, how the company reaches their clients, and how they company uses their funds for offering renewable energies are found as major conditions to define whether the use of renewable energy can develop socio-economic conditions or not. The changes in socio-economic development caused by the renewable energy use are attempted to relate with energy and sustainable development theory. The research also attempts to identify the limitations that hinder the accessibility of renewable energies in rural areas and some major further scopes of the study are discussed. An ambiguous finding of the research is that many villagers do not use solar energies even if it is cheaper to buy, so, there can be more studies conducted to analyze psychological and cultural barriers that do not inspire them to utilize renewable energies...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade human {{understanding}} of the potential variety and range of climate change impacts has expanded. For example, besides physical and environmental impacts {{it is clear that}} climate change is a driver of social change. This is particularly apparent through {{the creation of a new}} social community of “climate migrants”. In 1995 there were about 25 million environmental refugees around the world but this number is anticipated to rise to 200 million by 2050, many of them as a result of climate change. One of the countries most severely affected by climate induced migration is Bangladesh.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{literature}} describing responses in the abundance, and distribution of species to recent climate change and a heightened concern {{about what will happen}} if global temperatures rise to 4 °C and beyond. There is an urgent need for clear guidance on where and how fast biodiversity is most likely to be affected so that management plans can accommodate expected consequences. One approach to providing rapid assessment, is the velocity of climate change which describes the speed and direction of shifting climate contours. We apply the velocity of climate change to derive trajectories for climatic niches. We use the collective properties of trajectories to classify areas with different implications for biodiversity. Coastlines act as barriers and locally cooler areas act as attractors, influencing the flow of trajectories and creating distinct climate source and sink areas. <b>Climate</b> <b>migrants</b> leaving source areas may not be replaced: sources lack climatic connections to environments from which new migrants may arrive. The non-replacement of <b>climate</b> <b>migrants</b> in thermal source regions, where the local climate departs from historical conditions of that and surrounding areas, may result in net losses of indigenous biodiversity, and facilitate the establishment of new species into the abandoned niches. Converging temperature isotherms in sinks may concentrate <b>climate</b> <b>migrants,</b> increasing local diversity, while certain classes of sinks such as those occurring where trajectories are blocked by coasts represent climatic dead-ends where species have nowhere to go to avoid warming, creating potential for high local extinction rates. The congruency in patterns of future projections with past reconstructions suggests that management actions for conserving biodiversity that are informed by current climate trajectories could remain effective into the future, and that the relative extent of source and sink areas depends on the rate of warming, with intense warming resulting in larger source areas...|$|R

40|$|In a {{changing}} climate, organisms can either {{adapt to the}} new environment or adopt new geographical distributions that match the new location of the previously experienced conditions. Shifts in distributions can be thus simply predicted from the rate and direction of shifting environmental conditions: the velocity of climate change. In this study we compare distribution shifts in marine species with predictions based on climate velocity. Shifts reported in the scientific literature have been compiled into a database and, by calculating specific velocities for the time period and location of those changes, have been compared with expectations based on simple tracking of shifting thermal environments. Velocity estimates alone cannot predict the likely changes in diversity patterns that result from these geographical shifts. We present a method involving the forward projection of velocity-based trajectories through geographical space that mimics the shifts of many species. The collective behaviour of trajectories identifies areas as sinks and sources for climate-related change in biodiversity, as well as areas of little change and high flux corridors. Sinks are typically found along poleward-facing coasts on land and equatorward-facing coasts in the ocean, {{as well as on}} mountaintops and in semi-enclosed seas. Sources occur in locally warmer areas: at the equator in the ocean, and along coasts on land. Sinks represent areas where <b>climate</b> <b>migrants</b> are blocked by geographical or thermal barriers and thus face local extinction.

40|$|High {{levels of}} human {{mobility}} {{brought on by}} global megatrends such as population growth, urbanisation, globalisation, coastward migration, environmental degradation, resource depletion, and sprawling of slums in developing countries {{are likely to be}} reinforced by climate change, making it plausible that human mobility will increase significantly during the 21 st Century. Within the academic, development and international community there is no uniform view how this potentiality should be faced, but projections typically agree that the majority of this migration can be expected to occur in developing countries characterised by high levels of poverty and vulnerability. Moreover, it can be observed that a significant amount of climate change related migration is already underway. A review of the literature reveals knowledge gaps with respect to both interdisciplinary and local-level research that expressly invites the perspectives of <b>climate</b> <b>migrants.</b> This dissertation responds to these gaps both by drawing on literature in several fields of inquiry, and by intentionally engaging with migration affected populations to identify what preferred solutions they envisage. Taking a humanitarian preparedness approach, this research seeks to identify what migrants want so that appropriate policy instruments for equitable macro-managed migration processes can be discussed, developed, drafted and legislated well before they are needed. To this end, this research aims to learn from various forms of current migrations {{which may or may not}} all be climate induced. At its simplest, this thesis argues that policy preparedness is the a priori policy posture of choice. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in Bolivia, Bangladesh and the Maldives, this research repositions <b>climate</b> <b>migrants</b> at the centre of a scholarly debate that has largely marginalised or even patronised them. It concludes: (1) inviting the contributions of migrants leads to preferable migration outcomes; (2) policy maker foresight is an important success factor; (3) targeted service provision can enable more positive migration outcomes; (4) many migrants wish to stay in their countries/communities, thereby highlighting the importance of in situ adaptation; (5) nomenclature is a non-problem in the minds of most migrants; (6) accountable and responsive government institutions have a key role to play in enabling anticipatory migrations; (7) education is the sine qua non for all future migration preparedness...|$|R

Climate change and human migration are two cross-cutting issues that demand immediate and appropriate responses from both international and national authorities. As a result of climate change, in the decades to come, large numbers of people may face the loss of homes, land and livelihoods due to environmental degradations such as rising sea levels, floods, droughts, famine and hurricanes. In Bangladesh alone, it is forecast that around 30 million people will be displaced by 2050. Despite staggering predictions and likely violations of human rights stemming from such displacement, the protection of persons displaced by climate change has remained largely beneath the domestic and international policy radar. [...] In this milieu, this thesis focuses on the matrix of human dimensions of climate change and population dynamics in Bangladesh. In doing so, it addresses the question of how, and to what extent, a legal and policy apparatus can be developed to address the existing protection gaps and legal vacuum in dealing with persons who are likely to be displaced by climatic effects. To this end, it reviews existing laws and policies to understand the status of this emergent migrants group, and it identifies the protection gaps in both national and international legal frameworks. It suggests integrating international human rights norms, principles and best practices in national laws and policies related to the protection of climate change induced displacement. The thesis closely examines the wide spectrum of adaptive strategies and their feasibility and effectiveness in addressing climate change induced migration. It sets out a roadmap showing how the policy interventions could contribute to better integrating the full spectrum of migration issues and concerns into overall environmental and developmental policy and vice-versa within Bangladesh. Finally, it offers certain pragmatic rights-based law and policy responses to address this issue in Bangladesh. [...] This thesis deals with a number of complex issues under international environmental law, human rights law, and migration and refugee law, which have important ramifications for the protection of climate change induced displacement at national, regional and international levels. The development of 'soft guidelines' suggested in this study would establish an international framework for the specific recognition, treatment and protection of climate change displaced persons and fill the legal gap with the specificity required by states and communities. Negating a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, a range of legal and policy options are suggested in this thesis, such as providing humanitarian assistance to forced <b>climate</b> <b>migrants,</b> pre-emptively managing migration with safety and dignity for climate-motivated migrants, and strengthening adaptation so that climate victims do not need to rely on migration for alternative livelihoods. These measures will capacitate Bangladesh to respond proactively to minimise the risks and maximise the benefits for <b>climate</b> change induced <b>migrants.</b> The suggested national legal and policy responses, although designed in the context of Bangladesh, {{could be used as a}} model or guideline for the protection of people who are at risk of displacement due to the effects of climate change in other developing countries and small island countries with similar socio-economic and environmental conditions.

Thelessons drawn from resettlements and planned 2020 relocations thus far most notably in the Carteret Islands of Papua New Guinea— underscore the importance of adequate funding, careful planning, restoring traditional livelihoods, and ensuring voluntary community participation throughout the entire process. Critical hurdles persist, however, particularly for the most vulnerable communities within nation-states. This article explores the importance of adequate funding and identifies the dangerous and nagging impediments present, even as climate-induced migration advances in the adaptation 2020 discourse.

At the same time, the public health community is investigating the health impacts of climate change, but these three dimensions have not often been linked. Climate and migration have got a complex, non-linear and unpredictable relationship that is caused by or causes many issues but also opportunities. Migration related to climate change impacts health, {{but at the same}} time it can create opportunities to improve health security. As an example for adverse health effects, the (re) mergence of vector-borne diseases driven by climate change might be amplified by migration flows to new territories. If food security has been addressed many times as a direct consequence of disruption of agricultural activities, other socio-economical, anthropological and political issues are often set aside.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} article covers the broader issues of climate-related migration {{and provides a}} legal analysis of climate migration. Although much of the discussion around climate change has focused on how its effects can be reduced, it is now generally accepted that climate change will have widespread impacts and that people {{must be ready to}} adapt to those impacts. One of the ways people are likely to adapt is by migrating, and {{in spite of the fact}} that this has become one of the most widely discussed areas of adaptation, there is, as yet, no solid grasp of its potential scope. Predictions range from 200 or 250 million to possibly a billion people moving by the middle of the 21 st century to escape climate change impacts such as sea level rise, drought and desertification, and greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Regions expected to produce the most <b>climate</b> <b>migrants</b> include Africa, heavily populated Asian mega delta areas, and small island nations.

This brief which is based on a recent study conducted by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (LC/CAR/L. 395) 1 provides a synthesis of the assessment of the economic and social impacts of climate change on the coastal and marine sector in the Caribbean which were undertaken. It provides Caribbean policymakers with cutting-edge information on the region’s vulnerability and encourages the development of adaptation strategies informed by both local experience and expert knowledge. It proceeds from an acknowledgement that the unique combination of natural resources, ecosystems, economic activities, and human population settlements of the Caribbean will not be immune to the impacts of climate change, and local communities, countries and the subregion as a whole need to plan for, and adapt to, these effects. Climate and extreme weather hazards related to the coastal and marine sector encompass the distinct but related factors of sea level rise, increasing coastal water temperatures, tropical storms and hurricanes. Potential vulnerabilities for coastal zones include increased shoreline erosion leading to alteration of the coastline, loss of coastal wetlands, and changes in the abundance and diversity of fish and other marine populations. The study examines four key themes in the analysis: climate, vulnerability, economic and social costs associated with climate change impacts, and adaptive measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} numbers of <b>climate</b> <b>migrants</b> caution that the dilemma of climate refugees is a well-substantiated concern of today not tomorrow. In 2011 large-scale flooding and landslides affected {{more than one million}} people in the Philippines. More than twenty million people were displaced after massive floods in Pakistan in 2010. A significant number of future projections show that climate change will lead tens, and perhaps hundreds, of millions of people to leave their homes and in some cases their countries. The crisis of human displacement, which entails immediate actions, raised the questions of legal and moral obligations to protect the displaced. Persons suffering climate displacement face a loss of their rights and states must take actions to ensure that they do not violate human rights. Recently, states are more inclined towards sealing their borders to stop the migration influx. Walls are being built and shorelines are heavily guarded to ensure that no one can migrate. The magnitude of the coming crises of Climatees (climate change refugees and displacees) is huge. It eventually will call into question meaning of “Universal Declaration of Human Rights. ” Climate change impacts pose a significant threat to many of broadly recognized rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international instruments. This thesis concludes that current national and international laws are inadequate to cope with the dilemma of climatic displacement. Nations must work together to fill in all gaps in the international legal and policy frameworks to cope with the emerging dilemma of Climatees. “Sit and wait” approaches can be very costly in terms of human life and financial cost...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, after the Cold War {{and the fall}} of the Berlin wall, the {{strengthening}} of overall population mobility is evident on local, regional, national and global scale. In addition, there are changes in the scope and direction of migration, their structural characteristics and increasing in the number of determining factors and consequences, which affects the complexity of this phenomenon. It is important to point out the emergence of new forms of migration as a result of intensifying pace of globalization, which {{is an integral part of}} the migration. The total number of migrants in the world (internal and external) in the first decade of the XXI century reached the highest value in history and is around one billion, with small, but continuous increase in share of total population. This means that one in every seven person in the world has changed place of residence, either within their own country (about 700 million of internal migrants) or moved to another country (244 million international migrants). Therefore some authors points out that all of us are becoming migrants. Also, the number of irregular migrants recently has reached its highest amount, which implies an intensification of government actions to regulate migration through the creation of effective policies, spatial mobility and intensification of bilateral, regional and international negotiations in this domain. Estimates show that the number of migrants will continue to grow, especially the number of <b>climate</b> <b>migrants,</b> persons who left their homes due to changes in the environment. That is why it is of crucial importance in a first place to understand migrations properly and then to create the steps towards the best solutions in solving the problems caused by population movement in space and create proper migration policies...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change and}} human {{migration}} are two cross-cutting issues that demand immediate and appropriate responses from both international and national authorities. This article {{deals with a}} number of complex issues under international environmental law, human rights law and migration and refugee law, which have important ramifications for the protection of climate-induced displacement in Bangladesh. It examines these legal frameworks to assess how appropriate they are in regulating climate-induced displacement and underscores current gaps or limitations within the international legal system for effective recognition and protection of <b>climate</b> change <b>migrants.</b> The development of 2 ̆ 7 soft guidelines 2 ̆ 7 suggested in this study would establish an international framework for the specific recognition, treatment and protection of climate change displaced persons and fill the legal gaps with the specificity required by states and communities...|$|R
30|$|If {{climate change}} resettlements become {{necessary}} in big numbers then Pacific Islanders {{do not want}} to become climate change refugees. To include environmental reasons in refugee conventions is not what Pacific Islanders want. They want to migrate in dignity, if it becomes unavoidable to leave their homes. There are good reasons to solve the challenges within Pacific Island societies and do not depend too much on metropolitan neighbours at the rim of the Pacific such as Australia, New Zealand and the USA. To rise to the challenge requires enhanced Pan-Pacific Island solidarity and South-South cooperation. This then would result in a reduction of dependencies. For metropolitan powers still much can be done in supporting capacity building in Pacific Island countries and helping the economies to proposer so that <b>climate</b> change <b>migrants</b> easier can be absorbed by expanding labour markets in Pacific Island countries.|$|R
30|$|Today {{the threat}} of climate change, sea-level rise {{and the risk of}} {{becoming}} inhabitable are real issues for many Pacific Islands. New motivations to go elsewhere appear on the horizon; yet there are little ideas how resettlement can be managed, if and once required. The paper thus is a beginning to envision how to avoid that <b>climate</b> change <b>migrants</b> become refugees. Migrant receiving countries do not wish to be flooded by huge waves of refugees putting strain on their social, economic and political systems. At the same time no migrant prefers to be a refugee; they all wish to be welcome wherever they have to turn to when their time at home runs out. All wish to be able to support themselves and their families through the skills they have acquired. No one wishes to live in uncertainty, without proper means of livelihoods and threatened to be sent away or punished just because it wasn’t possible to stay in the countries they came from.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} intersections of militarism, climate change, and environmental justice in U. S. literature {{and popular culture}} {{since the end of}} the Cold War. The project identifies different mechanisms enacting environmental military violence through discursive analysis of literary and cultural texts, and considers the ideas, values, and beliefs that support environmental military violence. In each chapter I trace a different dynamic of environmental violence structured through the logics of U. S. counterinsurgency theory by examining what I call “narrative political ecologies”—cultural texts that center concerns of ecology and broadly defined political economy. Chapter I establishes the stakes and questions of the dissertation. The next two chapters investigate the dynamics of environmental violence depicted within narrative political ecologies. Chapter II investigates how eruptive interpersonal violence secures more insidious, hidden forms of slow environmental violence in Héctor Tobar’s The Tattooed Soldier. Chapter III considers the U. S. -Mexico Borderlands and the environmental military violence responsible for the deaths of undocumented migrants by examining Luis Alberto Urrea’s The Devil’s Highway and the Electronic Disturbance Theater’s Transborder Immigrant Tool. Chapter IV turns to potential f wars and conflicts that may be caused by climate change as they have been depicted in speculative fiction. In novels depicting <b>climate</b> <b>migrants,</b> such as Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower (1993) and Parable of the Talents (2014), I show that even politically progressive, intersectional approaches to environmental endangerment naturalize conflict and occlude dialogic solutions to environmental change. The final chapter traces how the environmental refugee has become a paradigmatic figure in climate change discourse, particularly the aspects of this discourse where issues of national security are articulated. At the center of these texts is the figure of the migrant and narratives of migrations, and I argue that the figure of the environmental migrant offers a privileged vantage on the constitutive forces of the Anthropocene. The dissertation identifies the specific literary and rhetorical techniques that authors use to contest environmental militarization and expand the U. S. public’s capacity to creatively and compassionately reason around increased flows of environmental migrants— issues of vital importance for humane climate change adaptation...|$|R

European short-distance migrants, wintering in temperate areas, have been assumed to be more affected by change in the European <b>climate</b> than long-distance <b>migrants</b> wintering in the tropics. However, we show that tong-distance migrants have advanced their spring arrival in Scandinavia more than short-distance migrants. By analyzing a long-term data set from southern Italy, we show that long-distance migrants also pass through the Mediterranean region earlier. We argue that this may reflect a climate-driven evolutionary change in the timing of spring migration...|$|R
