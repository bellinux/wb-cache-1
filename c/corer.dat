Deepwater soil samplers are normally variants of Kullenberg-type samplers, a modification on a basic gravity <b>corer</b> using a piston (Lunne and Long, 2006).

25|$|Piston {{samplers}}. These samplers are thin-walled metal tubes {{which contain}} a piston at the tip. The samplers are {{pushed into the}} bottom of a borehole, with the piston remaining at the surface of the soil while the tube slides past it. These samplers will return undisturbed samples in soft soils, but are difficult to advance in sands and stiff clays, and can be damaged (compromising the sample) if gravel is encountered. The , developed by D. A. Livingstone, is a commonly used piston sampler. A modification of the Livingstone <b>corer</b> with a serrated coring head allows it to be rotated to cut through subsurface vegetable matter such as small roots or buried twigs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the efficiency of heave compensation in the Ocean Drilling Program, we de-veloped a device measuring the acceleration of the core barrels. First results show that heave compensation limits bit motion to 10 % of the surface heave. We also use the acceleration data to characterize the formation. On rotary <b>corers,</b> acceleration amplitudes decrease with increasing hardness of the formation. Comparison with geophysical logs shows that this relationship can resolve cm-scale features. On piston <b>corers,</b> the maximum ac-celeration is characteristic of the sediment shear strength.

5000|$|A more {{advanced}} {{version of the}} sounding weight is the gravity <b>corer.</b> The gravity <b>corer</b> allows researchers to sample and study sediment layers {{at the bottom of}} oceans. The <b>corer</b> consists of an open-ended tube with a lead weight and a trigger mechanism that releases the <b>corer</b> from its suspension cable when the <b>corer</b> is lowered over the seabed and a small weight touches the ground. The <b>corer</b> falls into the seabed and penetrates it to a depth of up to 10 m (33 ft). By lifting the <b>corer,</b> a long, cylindrical sample is extracted in which the structure of the seabed’s layers of sediment is preserved. Recovering sediment cores allows scientists to see {{the presence or absence of}} specific fossils in the mud that may indicate climate patterns at times in the past, such as during the ice ages. Samples of deeper layers can be obtained with a <b>corer</b> mounted in a drill. The drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution is equipped to extract cores from depths of as much as 1,500 m (4900 ft) below the ocean bottom. (See Ocean Drilling Program) ...|$|E

It originates from the Reineck box <b>corer</b> and the USNEL box <b>corer.</b> The device was developed by R. Hessler, Professor of Biological Oceanography, and P.A. Jumars at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in collaboration with the United States Naval Electronic Laboratory (USNEL) in San Diego to determine the faunal composition at the abyssal floor.Simple predecessors of devices to take sediment samples from vessels which are still in use (e.g. in studies of freshwater sediments and benthic communities) include the Van Veen Grab Sampler and the Ponar grab. These devices have a variable penetration depth that depends on the type of sediment.|$|E

40|$|Detailed and {{accurate}} mapping {{of the marine}} environment is important {{for a number of}} stakeholder groups, including energy companies (oil and gas, and, increasingly, offshore renewables), policy groups who require environmental data for marine spatial planning, resource and conservation management, and academic researchers who aim to better understand the processes that initially formed, and continue to shape these environments. Since the 1960 s both industry and researchers alike have undertaken systematic exploration of the UK offshore territory (e. g. Gatliff et al. 1994; Johnson et al. 1993; Ritchie et al. 2011 and references therein). More than 11, 000 industry exploration and production wells, and 580 scientific boreholes have been acquired in UK waters. Other physical sampling techniques such as Shipek Grabs that sample the seabed sediments, vibrocorers, gravity <b>corers,</b> piston <b>corers</b> and rock <b>corers</b> total more than 45, 000 samples in the territorial waters of the United Kingdom (UK). Integration of these physical samples with 2 D and 3 D seismic reflection data, and with multibeam echosounder data facilitate the production of detailed maps and an improved understanding of our offshore area. International programmes such as the International Ocean Discovery Program, are also a means by which researchers can acquire offshore data. This paper briefly summarises both traditional techniques and the development of newer tools for offshore data acquisition. Case studies from the central North Sea and offshore deep-water areas of the UK are presented to illustrate their application...|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} {{geographical}} coordinates, Kmax declinations were not consistent between the pairs {{of gravity and}} piston cores although they were taken at the same sites (Figure  3). For example, Kmax of the gravity core YK 0712 -GC 9 was dominantly oriented to northeast-southwest directions, whereas Kmax of the piston core MR 0604 -PC 5 dominantly aligned north-south. In the sample coordinates, Kmin axes were generally vertical, and Kmax and Kint axes were mostly horizontal. An interesting observation was that Kmax axes of the gravity <b>corers</b> (YK 0712 -GC 1, GC 8, and GC 9) were dominantly distributed in the Y-axis direction (90 ° to 270 °), whereas Kmax axes of the piston <b>corers</b> (MR 0604 -PC 7, PC 6, and PC 5) dominantly aligned the X-axis (0 ° to 180 °; Figure  3).
