5|$|The medical {{management}} of iron toxicity is complicated, and can include {{use of a}} specific <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> called deferoxamine to bind and expel excess iron from the body.|$|E
5|$|A <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> is a {{molecule}} {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The chelating agents used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
40|$|Chelation {{therapy has}} been the major {{treatment}} for heavy metal poisoning. Various <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> have been developed and tested for treatment of heavy metal intoxications, including mercury poisoning. It has been clearly shown that <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> could rescue the toxicity caused by heavy metal intoxication, but the potential preventive role of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> against heavy metal poisoning has not been explored much. Recent paper by Siddiqi and colleagues has suggested a protective role of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> against mercury poisoning, which provides a promising research direction for broader application of chelation therapy in prevention and treatment of mercury poisoning...|$|R
5|$|<b>Chelating</b> <b>agents</b> {{can have}} adverse effects; for example, {{chelation}} therapy can lower the body's levels of necessary nutrients like zinc. <b>Chelating</b> <b>agents</b> taken orally {{can increase the}} body's absorption of lead through the intestine.|$|R
30|$|Sokhanvarian et al. (2013) {{evaluated}} the thermal stability of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents.</b> They concluded that <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> start to decompose at temperatures greater than 350  °F and the thermal stability of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> {{can be enhanced}} by increasing the pH. Al-Ibrahim et al. (2015) concluded that no precipitation or emulsion was observed when mixing EDTA-based fluid with drill-in fluid (oil-based mud) and the removal efficiency of the formed filter cake was 93 % after soaking for 90  h. They stated that <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> are not compatible with reservoir formation water and they will form severe precipitation of insoluble damaging by-products when mixed with formation water.|$|R
5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E
25|$|When {{these agents}} chelate {{inorganic}} arsenic, it is converted into an organic form of arsenic {{because it is}} bound to the organic <b>chelating</b> <b>agent.</b> The sulfur atoms of the thiol groups are the site of interaction with arsenic. This is because the thiol groups are nucleophilic while the arsenic atoms are electrophilic. Once bound to the <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> the molecules can be excreted, and therefore free inorganic arsenic atoms are removed from the body.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chelating</b> <b>agents,</b> natural zeolite, {{activated}} carbon, resins, {{and liquid}} organics impregnated with <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> are all used to exchange cations or anions with the solution. Selectivity and recovery are {{a function of}} the reagents used and the contaminants present.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} been made on the {{bacteriostatic}} and fungicidal properties of oxine (8 -hydroxyquinoline) and other <b>chelating</b> <b>agents,</b> {{and it has been}} suggested that they might act, in part at least, by depriving cells of essential trace metals (Albert, 1951; Martell & Calvin, 1952). In an attempt to determine the trace element requirements of mammalian spermatozoa, White (1955) investigated the effect of several <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> on motility. A number were found to be toxic to ram, bull, rabbit and human spermatozoa. In fact some (e. g. sodium diethyl dithiocarbamate, i-nitroso- 2 -naphthol and ethyl potassium xanthate) were much more spermicidal than oxine, which has long been used as a chemical contraceptive in the form of Chinasol. Tests with bull semen showed that cobalt reduced the toxicity of sodium diethyl-dithiocarbamate, nitrosonaphthol and o-phenanthroline. Other mixtures of heavy metals and <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> were, however, more toxic than the <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> alone. Further studies on the interaction between metals and <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> in bull...|$|R
50|$|Leaching {{involves}} the use of aqueous solutions to extract metal from metal bearing materials which is brought into contact with a material containing a valuable metal. The lixiviant solution conditions vary in terms of pH, oxidation-reduction potential, presence of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> and temperature, to optimize the rate, extent and selectivity of dissolution of the desired metal component into the aqueous phase. Through the use of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents,</b> one can selectively extract certain metals. Such <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> are typically amines of schiff bases.|$|R
25|$|Currently, two iron {{chelators}} {{are available}} in the US, deferoxamine for intravenous use and deferasirox for oral use.

30|$|Elkatatny (2016) {{stated that}} <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> were heavily used in oil {{industry}} as iron control agents, scale removers, and recently introduced as stand-alone stimulation fluids in sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Mahmoud et al. (2011 a, 2014) performed several coreflooding experiments using {{different types of}} sandstone and limestone cores at high temperatures using <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> such as EDTA, GLDA, and HEDTA at different pH values and different concentrations. HEDTA and EDTA <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> are compatible with sandstone cores containing high percent of clay minerals such as illite and kaolinite. <b>Chelating</b> <b>agents</b> did not cause fines migration or clay swelling when injected through different types of sandstone cores (Mahmoud et al. 2011 b). Ali et al. (2005) concluded that HEDTA solutions (low pH) can stimulate sandstone and carbonate formations at high temperature.|$|R
40|$|Several of the cariogenic mutans streptococci produce cell wall-associated glucan-binding lectins (GBLs). The lectins bind alpha- 1, 6 -linked glucans {{and have}} no {{affinity}} for other polysaccharides or anomeric linkages. When citrate or lactate {{was included in the}} growth medium, expression of the activities of the GBLs of Streptococcus cricetus and S. sobrinus was prevented. Furthermore, <b>chelating</b> <b>agents,</b> including citrate, lactate, EDTA, and acetylacetone, were able to reversibly inhibit glucan-induced aggregation of GBL+ streptococci. In addition, the <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> prevented sucrose-dependent streptococcal adhesion to glass surfaces and dispersed preformed adherent masses of the streptococci. Neither citrate nor other <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> modified the activities of glucosyltransferases. Expression of the lectin could only be achieved by the addition of manganous ion to the growth medium. Chloramphenicol and other metabolic inhibitors prevented synthesis of GBL in cells obtained from manganese-deficient medium and shifted to manganous ion-sufficient medium. The GBL may be a manganoprotein, the manganese of which may be perturbed, but not removed, by <b>chelating</b> <b>agents.</b> During synthesis of the GBL, manganous ion may be required in order for the protein to achieve an active conformation. Citrate or other <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> may have promise as anticaries agents...|$|R
25|$|EDTA finds many {{specialized}} uses in the biomedical laboratories, {{such as in}} veterinary ophthalmology as an anticollagenase {{to prevent}} the worsening of corneal ulcers in animals. In tissue culture EDTA {{is used as a}} <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> that binds to calcium and prevents joining of cadherins between cells, preventing clumping of cells grown in liquid suspension, or detaching adherent cells for passaging.

25|$|The technetium-99m {{radioisotope}} is used predominantly in {{bone and}} brain scans. For bone scans, the pertechnetate ion is used directly, {{as it is}} taken up by osteoblasts attempting to heal a skeletal injury, or (in some cases) as a reaction of these cells to a tumor (either primary or metastatic) in the bone. In brain scanning, Tc-99m {{is attached to the}} <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> HMPAO to create technetium (99mTc) exametazime, an agent which localizes in the brain according to region blood flow, making it useful for the detection of stroke and dementing illnesses that decrease regional brain flow and metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Chitosan and chitin {{belong to}} a family of biopolymers {{composed}} of β(1–4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine subunits. Chitosan is formed by alkaline N-deacetylation of chitin, which {{is the second most}} abundant natural polymer after cellulose. Chitosan is a biodegradable polysaccharide that has been useful in many biomedical applications such as a <b>chelating</b> <b>agent,</b> drug carrier, membrane, and water treatment additive. Chitosan is soluble in dilute aqueous solutions, but precipitates into a gel at a neutral pH. It does not support neural cell attachment and proliferation well, but can be enhanced by ECM-derived peptide attachment. Chitosan also contains weak mechanical properties, which are more challenging to overcome.|$|E

25|$|Citric acid is an {{excellent}} <b>chelating</b> <b>agent,</b> binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It {{can be used to}} treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. By chelating the metals in hard water, it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for water softening. Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove hard water stains from glass without scrubbing. In industry, it is used to dissolve rust from steel. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to wash out wax and coloring from the hair.|$|E
500|$|The {{chemistry}} of astatine is [...] "clouded by the extremely low concentrations at which astatine experiments have been conducted, {{and the possibility}} of reactions with impurities, walls and filters, or radioactivity by-products, and other unwanted nano-scale interactions." [...] Many of its apparent chemical properties have been observed using tracer studies on extremely dilute astatine solutions, typically less than 10−10 mol·L−1. Some properties– such as anion formation– align with other halogens. Astatine has some metallic characteristics as well, such as plating onto a cathode, coprecipitating with metal sulfides in hydrochloric acid, and forming a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution. It forms complexes with EDTA, a metal <b>chelating</b> <b>agent,</b> and is capable of acting as a metal in antibody radiolabeling; in some respects astatine in the +1 state is akin to silver in the same state.

500|$|... 225Ac {{is applied}} in {{medicine}} to produce 213 in a reusable generator {{or can be}} used alone as an agent for radiation therapy, in particular targeted alpha therapy (TAT). This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than 213Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only 225Ac itself, but also its daughters, emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of 225Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver {{for a period of}} tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from 225Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its daughters might induce new mutations. To solve this problem, 225Ac was bound to a <b>chelating</b> <b>agent,</b> such as citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as HEHA(1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaazacyclohexadecane-N,N',N'`,N'``,N'``',N'``'`-hexaacetic acid) or DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor. The latter delivery combination was tested on mice and proved to be effective against leukemia, lymphoma, breast, ovarian, neuroblastoma and prostate cancers.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the earlier}} {{literature}} review, many experiments using <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> were conducted and reported by past researchers. These chelants {{could be applied}} to stimulate high-temperature well. The efforts of these past studies, focusing on the effectiveness of chelants at high-temperature condition, were highly appreciated. It was proven that these acid systems were suitable and reliable to gain extensively wide application in real-field practice. However, it should also be alerted that <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> are generally less suitable for clean homogeneous sandstones because of the silica precipitation during acidizing. Therefore, they are more suitable for heterogeneous carbonates and clay-rich sandstones. Another point of view that should be noticed is that chelants are very costly products as compared to mud acid, retarded acid and organic acids. Although <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> can reduce the cost of corrosion inhibitor used, it is still important to optimize the budget between the costly chelants and corrosion inhibitor. A summary of classification on the reviewed experimental works using <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> is presented in Table  9.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> can {{be associated with}} phytoremediation {{in order to reduce the}} time required for remediation of heavy metal contaminated soils. The present work has the purpose to test the use of easily biodegradable <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> in the assisted phytoextraction process and to evaluate their effect on soil and Mirabilis jalapa plant associated bacteria. Two easily biodegradable <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> were used (EDDS and MGDA) in two different dosages (4 and 8 mmol/kg of soil). Metal concentration in soil solution, in leaves and in leachate were determined during the phytoextraction process, while at the end of the experiment metal concentration was evaluated separately in roots, stalk and leaves. In untreated reactors Zn and Pb were accumulated in the roots, but only Zn was translocated to the shoots. Both <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> demonstrated to be very effective in Pb and Zn mobilization in soil solution. After chelate treatment, accumulation and translocation of the two metals was different: unaffected with regard to Zn and enhanced with regard to Pb. The <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> seem to have a positive influence on bacterial communities of bulk soil and rhizosphere by mitigating the selective pressure caused by Pb and Zn, whereas the endophytes are less affected...|$|R
500|$|The {{notion that}} {{thiomersal}} causes autism {{has led some}} parents to have their children treated with costly and potentially dangerous therapies such as chelation therapy, which is typically used to treat heavy metal poisoning, due to parental fears that autism {{is a form of}} [...] "mercury poisoning". As many as 2 to 8% of autistic children in the U.S., numbering as many as several thousand children per year, receive mercury-chelating agents. Although critics of using chelation therapy as an autism treatment point to a lack of any evidence to support its use, hundreds of doctors prescribe these medications despite possible side effects including nutritional deficiencies as well as damage to the liver and kidney. The popularity of this therapy caused a [...] "public health imperative" [...] that led the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to commission a study about chelation in autism by studying DMSA, a <b>chelating</b> <b>agent</b> used for lead poisoning, despite worries from critics {{that there would be no}} chance it would show positive results and it would be unlikely to convince parents to not use the therapy. Ultimately, the study was halted due to ethical concerns that there would be too much risk to children with autism who did not have toxic levels of mercury or lead due to a new animal study showing possible cognitive and emotional problems associated with DMSA. A 5-year-old autistic boy died from cardiac arrest immediately after receiving chelation therapy treatment using EDTA in 2005.|$|E
500|$|On June 11, 2007, {{the plaintiffs}} {{presented}} their first argument, {{in which they}} contended that Michelle Cedillo, {{as well as other}} children with autism, suffered from a [...] "mercury efflux disorder" [...] which was described by Aposhian, their first expert witness, as [...] "a problem with getting a metal, in this case mercury, out of a cell." [...] As evidence that such disorders have been documented before, he pointed to Wilson's disease. Aposhian based this claim, in part, on three peer-reviewed papers. The first such study was co-authored by Boyd Haley, and concluded that hair of children with autism contained less mercury than that of children without autism. Aposhian stated that [...] "we know that the hair is an excretory organ and that the hair is reflective of the mercury or the metal in the blood, and the blood {{is a reflection of the}} mercury in the tissues, and so the fact that the children with autism had less mercury in their hair was a hint or indication that perhaps there was mercury efflux disorder." [...] The second of these studies was conducted by James B. Adams, and found that baby teeth of children with autism had more than twice as much mercury as those of children without autism. Aposhian cited this study as evidence that [...] "autistic children have a greater body burden of mercury." [...] Another study which Aposhian used to back up this statement was one conducted by Jeff Bradstreet and Mark Geier, which gave dimercaptosuccinic acid, a <b>chelating</b> <b>agent,</b> to children and concluded that children with autism excreted much more mercury thereafter than children without autism. [...] Aposhian also cited a number of in vitro studies as evidence that thimerosal could cause immune system dysregulation.|$|E

The particle size, particle charge, creaming stability, rheology, and free-calcium {{concentration of the}} emulsions were then measured. In the absence of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents,</b> appreciable droplet aggregation occurred in emulsions held at temperatures from 80 to 120 °C, which led to increased emulsion particle diameter, shear-thinning behavior, apparent viscosity, and creaming instability. Addition of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> to the emulsions prior to heating decreased, but did not prevent, droplet aggregation in the emulsions. EDTA was more effective than citrate in decreasing droplet aggregation. Heat treatment increased the amount of <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> required to prevent droplet aggregation in the emulsions. Free-calcium concentration and droplet surface potential was independent of heat-treatment temperature, indicating that {{the performance of the}} <b>chelating</b> <b>agents</b> in binding calcium ions was not affected by the heat treatment.
