This {{was followed by}} the differently styled Sinad II and a coupe version, the Sinad III. In 2003 the Axon 5-door estate version of the Sinad was launched. The development of the car was undertaken by BMS Automotives Ltd of United Kingdom based on an existing Renault model and a concept by International Automotive Design. The air <b>conditioned</b> <b>vehicle</b> named Sinad in Iran and Sultan for export markets has a [...] Renault K7M engine and mechanical components. The Sinad body was manufactured using the Vacuum Injection Shell Process. The Sinad was successfully crash tested and obtained the MIRA/VCA certification allowing the Sinad circulation in the UK, Europe and {{in other parts of the}} world. After production of a claimed 900 units in the first year, the company said they would increase their production to 3,600 in 2002. Their production volume in 2003 was 100 cars. In a change of direction, Kish Khodro launched the Veek MPV in 2004, which is based on the first generation Renault Scenic but with a new front design.|$|E
40|$|Particulate matter {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the major environmental concerns in Pakistan. Over the past 20 years there has been a considerable increase in the number of motor vehicles. The present study was conducted to assess journey time and roadside exposure to particulate matter and carbon monoxide along major roads of Lahore during November, 2007. Measurements of particulate mass and carbon monoxide were carried out continuously inside an air <b>conditioned</b> <b>vehicle,</b> while commuting, and outside the vehicle at 36 different locations in the city. Additionally, monitoring was undertaken at a background site throughout the period. The overall mean journey-time concentrations of PM 10, PM 2. 5, PM 1, PM 10 - 2. 5 and CO were 103 μg/m 3, 50 μg/m 3, 38 μg/m 3, 53 μg/m 3 and 8 ppm, respectively. At the roadside average PM 10, PM 2. 5, PM 1, PM 10 - 2. 5 and CO concentrations were 489 μg/m 3, 91 μg/m 3, 52 μg/m 3, 397 μg/m 3 and 4 ppm, respectively. The highest levels were found at the sites with traffic congestion reflecting, not only, the large contribution of automobile exhaust but also the resuspension of road dust. The majority of public transport vehicles in Lahore are not air-conditioned and it is very likely that commuters are exposed to the similar high levels of pollution. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research...|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of pharmaceuticals mainly {{influenced by the}} rate of degradation reaction which in turn greatly affected by temperature variation. According to Arhenius Theory the rate of reaction is exponentially proportional to rise in temperature, and according to Q 10 Theory, the rate of reaction increase 2 to 4 folds every 10 °C rise in temperature. So, {{the concept of the}} Mean Kinetic Temperature was adopted as an expression for the fluctuating temperature. EMRO of WHO specifies 30 °C as the maximum transportation temperature for Sudan. Five drug products of different varieties and packaging were transported with electronic temperature and humidity recording devices to six Sudanese cities of different climates. The samples were tested before and after transportation using pharmacopoeial methods. The recorded temperatures were electronically treated by Stability System II software to calculate the Mean Kinetic Temperature. The resulted transportation MKT to all cities, including Khartoum and those using air flight vehicles, exceeded the specified limits. The MKT of Khartoum streets and traffics reached 48. 3 °C during summer seasons. The active pharmaceutical ingredients of most drug products utilized were greatly affected and consequently the expiration date will be earlier than that specified in the labels. The average change in Artemether products was 9. 7 % for tablets and 3. 13 % for injection. Metronidazole IV fluid lost water resulting in significant increase in concentration of the solute. Amoxicillin trihydrate powder for suspension and Rifampicin tablets lost 6. 9 % and 6. 16 % from their potency respectively. It is potentially recommended that transportation and distribution of medicines should be in a controlled specifically licensed <b>conditioned</b> <b>vehicle,</b> datalogger should be attached and the temperature should not exceed the specified limit. Special care should be given to Artemeter products for both quality and handling. Large volume parentrals in plastic container should be avoided whenever it is possible.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an engine test cycle that is representative of the real-world heavy-duty engine activity in the not-to-exceed (NTE) zone of operation. The test cycle is intended to provide an in-laboratory verification capability to determine if an engine exceeds the in-use emissions standards. By simulating the real-world driving pattern of the vehicle the test cycles provide the most realistic estimation of emission levels in the NTE zone of operation. It is well recognized that traditional laboratory test cycles do not provide an accurate representation of a vehicle’s operation on the road under present-day driving conditions. This cycle was developed by collecting and analysing engine activity data and statistical information on heavy-duty vehicle use for different applications under real-world <b>conditions.</b> A test <b>vehicle</b> instrumented with the West Virginia University mobile emissions measurement system (MEMS), a portable on-board tailpipe exhaust emissions measurement system, was used to obtain engine operating <b>conditions,</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed, and in-use brake-specific emissions of C...|$|R
