25|$|Whether or not {{non-ionizing}} radiation causes leukemia {{has been studied}} for several decades. The International Agency for Research on Cancer expert working group undertook a detailed review of all data on static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy, which occurs naturally and {{in association with the}} generation, transmission, and use of electrical power. They concluded that there is limited evidence that high levels of ELF magnetic (but not electric) fields might cause some cases of <b>childhood</b> <b>leukemia.</b> No evidence for a relationship to leukemia or another form of malignancy in adults has been demonstrated. Since exposure to such levels of ELFs is relatively uncommon, the World Health Organization concludes that ELF exposure, if later proven to be causative, would account for just 100 to 2400 cases worldwide each year, representing 0.2 to 4.9% of the total incidence of <b>childhood</b> <b>leukemia</b> for that year (about 0.03 to 0.9% of all leukemias).|$|E

The supervised learning algorithm k-nearest neighbor was utilized to build gene expression predictors that could classify the ALLs/AMLs according to clinically important subtypes with high accuracy. Validation experiments in an independent data set verified the high prediction accuracies of our classifiers. B-lineage ALLs with uncharacteristic cytogenetic aberrations or with a normal karyotype displayed heterogeneous gene expression profiles, resulting in low prediction accuracies. Minimal residual disease status (MRD) in T-cell ALLs with a high (40. 1 %) MRD at day 29 could be classified with 100 % accuracy already {{at the time of}} diagnosis. In pediatric leukemias with uncharacteristic cytogenetic aberrations or with a normal karyotype, unsupervised analysis identified two novel subgroups: one consisting mainly of cases remaining in complete remission (CR) and one containing a few patients in CR and {{all but one of the}} patients who relapsed.

Materials and Methods: Data from 62 consecutive cases of <b>childhood</b> <b>leukemias</b> referred to the Department of Pathology, Aga Khan University Hospital. (AKUH) between January 1995 and December 1998 was analyzed using Epi Info Version 6. Flow cytometry on all samples was performed using standard protocols. Results: The mean age of patients was 8. 2 years and 49 (79 %) were males. Fifty (81 %) had acute lymphoblastic leukemias of which 50 % were CD 1 O positive and 24 % CD 10 negative Pre-B cell leukemias. Among all Pre B cell All 98 % were positive for CD 19, 96 % for CD 22, 89 % for HLA-DR and 67 % for CD 10. Of the 10 AML cases, 100 % were positive for CD 33, 90 % for CD 13, 80 % for CD 19 and 70 % for HLA-DR. Conclusion: The mean age in this study population was significantly higher and percentage of CD 10 positive Pre-B All is lower than that in the West. Both these factors might be responsible for the poorer prognosis of these patients.

For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd.
