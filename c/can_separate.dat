5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> {{their calls}} and {{returning}} echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines <b>can</b> <b>separate,</b> compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E

25|$|Magma {{composition}} can {{be determined}} by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions.|$|E
25|$|The {{significant}} {{advantage of}} GC/pyrolysis method for hydrogen isotope measurement {{is that it}} <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> different compounds in the samples. It requires the smallest sample size (a typical size of ~ 200ng) relative to other methods and also has a high precision of 1~5 ‰. But this method is relatively slow and limited to the samples which can be applied in GC system.|$|E

50|$|A normal {{space is}} a topological {{space in which}} any two {{disjoint}} closed sets <b>can</b> be <b>separated</b> by neighbourhoods.

(However, the difficulty has been questioned.) In contrast the PUREX process was designed to separate plutonium only for weapons, and it also leaves the minor actinides (americium and curium) behind, producing waste with more long-lived radioactivity.|$|E
25|$|Married {{couples are}} {{encouraged}} to speak with local elders if they are having problems. Married couples <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> {{in the case of}} physical abuse and neglect, or if one partner attempts to hinder the other from being a Jehovah's Witness. Remarriage after divorce is permissible only on the grounds of adultery, based on their understanding of Jesus' words at Matthew 5:32 and Matthew 19:9.|$|E
25|$|Distillation of {{the residue}} at higher {{temperatures}} <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> lower-boiling transition metal fluorides and alkali metal (Cs, Rb) fluorides from higher-boiling lanthanide and alkaline earth metal (Sr, Ba) and yttrium fluorides. The temperatures involved are much higher, {{but can be}} lowered somewhat by distilling in a vacuum. If a carrier salt like lithium fluoride or sodium fluoride is {{being used as a}} solvent, high-temperature distillation is a way to separate the carrier salt for reuse.|$|E

Sixteen explains that Desmond's mind is broken, {{and the only way}} for him to repair it is by reliving his ancestors' memories until there is nothing left for them to show Desmond, at which point the Animus <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> Desmond from Ezio and Altaïr, and awaken Desmond from his coma.|$|E
25|$|The wh-word who is {{the direct}} object of the verb likes {{in each of these}} sentences. There appears to be no limit on the {{distance}} that <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> the fronted expression from its canonical position. In more technical terms, we can say that the dependency relation between the gap (the canonical, empty position) and its filler (the wh-expression) is unbounded in the sense that there is no upper bound on how deeply embedded within the given sentence the gap may appear.|$|E
25|$|However, negotiators {{need not}} {{sacrifice}} effective negotiation {{in favor of}} a positive relationship between parties. Rather than conceding, each side can appreciate that the other has emotions and motivations of their own and use this to their advantage in discussing the issue. In fact, perspective-taking can help move parties toward a more integrative solution. Fisher et al illustrate a few techniques that effectively improve perspective-taking in their book Getting to Yes, and through the following, negotiators <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> people from the problem itself.|$|E

25|$|The {{coupling}} of MS with LC {{systems is}} attractive because liquid chromatography <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> delicate and complex natural mixtures, which chemical composition {{needs to be}} well established (e.g., biological fluids, environmental samples, and drugs). Nowadays, LC-MS {{has become one of}} the most widely used chemical analysis techniques because more than 85% of natural chemical compounds are polar and thermally labile and GC-MS cannot process these samples. As an example, HPLC-MS is regarded as the leading analytical technique for proteomics and pharmaceutical laboratories. Other important applications of LC-MS include the analysis of food, pesticides, and plant phenols.|$|E
25|$|Benthic fishes {{are likely}} to be found, and are more diverse, on the {{continental}} slope, where there is habitat diversity and often food supplies. About 40% of the ocean floor consists of abyssal plains, but these flat, featureless regions are covered with sediment and largely devoid of benthic life (benthos). Deep sea benthic fishes are more likely to associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains, where invertebrate communities are established. Undersea mountains (seamounts) can intercept deep sea currents, and cause productive upwellings which support benthic fish. Undersea mountain ranges <b>can</b> <b>separate</b> underwater regions into different ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|On the {{continental}} slope, demersal fishes are common. They are more diverse than coastal demersal fish, {{since there is}} more habitat diversity. Further out are the abyssal plains.
