In contrast to most other azoles, benzotriazole reacts with phosgene in molar ratio 1 : 1 yielding carboxylic acid chloride (BtcCl, 1), which readily reacts with nucleophiles giving reactive compounds. These products can be easily transformed into carbamates, ureas, semicarbazides, <b>carbazides,</b> sulfonylureas, sulfonylcarbazides, nitroalkanic acid esters, etc. In addition, benzotriazole {{was used in the}} synthesis of various heterocyclic compounds: benzoxazine, kinazoline, triazinetrione, hydantoin and oxadiazine derivatives. The reaction of chloride 1 with amino acids enabled the use of benzotriazole in peptide chemistry, with triple role of benzotriazolecarbonyl group as N-protecting, N-activating, and both N-protecting/C-activating group. N-(1 -benzotriazolecarbonyl) -amino acids 25 are starting compounds in the synthesis of various amino acid, di- and tripeptide derivatives, hydantoic acids and hydroxyureas.

In Cu 2 +-inhibited thylakoids, diphenyl <b>carbazide</b> addition does not relieve {{the loss of}} Hill activity. The maximum yield of fluorescence induction restored by hydroxylamine in Tris-inactivated thylakoids is markedly reduced by Cu 2 +. This suggests that Cu 2 + does not act on the donor side of PSII but on the reaction center of PSII or on components beyond. Thermoluminescence and delayed luminescence studies show that charge recombination between the positively charged intermediate in water oxidation cycle (S 2) and negatively charged primary quinone acceptor of pSII (QA−) is largely unaffected by Cu 2 +. The S 2 QB− charge recombination, however, is drastically inhibited which parallels the loss of Hill activity.

Photosystem I activity was less affected. Photoinhibition of silicomolybdate reduction was largely reversible by an 8 minute dark incubation following the light treatment. Decreasing the O 2 concentration during photoinhibition below 2 % increased photoinhibition of whole chain electron transport. Addition of superoxide dismutase to the reaction medium did not affect photoinhibition. Photoinhibition of both photosystem I and photosystem II activity increased as the rate of electron transfer during the treatment increased, and was largely prevented when 3 -(3, 4 -diphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea was present during the photoinhibition period. Noncyclic photophosphorylation was decreased as a consequence of whole chain electron transfer photoinhibition.

40|$|Abstract- Hazardous metals such as {{chromium}} {{in industrial}} wastewater followed by leaching to ground water are {{threat to the}} environment because of their toxicity {{and their impact on}} our ecosystem. Among the different heavy metals, chromium (VI) is a common and very toxic pollutant being introduced into natural waters from a variety of industrial wastewaters. Chromium (III) is an essential element for organisms that can disrupt the sugar metabolism and cause heart conditions, when the daily dose is too low. Chromium (VI) is mainly toxic to organisms. It can alter genetic materials and cause cancer. Adverse health effects associated with Cr (VI) exposure include occupational asthma, eye irritation and damage, perforated eardrums, respiratory irritation, kidney damage, liver damage, pulmonary congestion and edema, upper abdominal pain, nose irritation and damage, respiratory cancer, skin irritation, and erosion and discoloration of the teeth. Some workers can also develop an allergic skin reaction, called allergic contact dermatitis.

Below 30 °C, however, the rate with the treated seedlings was lower than the control rate. The temperature dependence of the rate of photosystem I electron transport (2 - 6 -dichlorophenol indophenol-reduced → methyl viologen) in the treated system was similar to that in the control. At high temperatures (> 30 °C), with diphenyl carabazide as electron donor, the rates of electron transfer (diphenyl <b>carbazide</b> → methyl viologen) were similar in the treated and in the control thylakoids. Direct addition of BASF 13. 338 to the assay mixture for the measurement of rate of electron transport (H 2 O → methyl viologen) in the thylakoids isolated from the control plants did not cause any change in the temperature dependence of photosynthetic electron transport.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common sources of {{contamination}} in surface water is the discharge of waste water containing heavy metals from different industrial applications. Methods in the removal of contaminants like hexavalent chromium, Cr+ 6,that are available nowadays are too costly and difficult to operate efficiently. A new approach to solve such problem is Phytoremediation or the use of green plants in the removal of contaminants from wastewater that contains heavy metals. In this study, the effectiveness of water hyacinth (Eichhorniacrassipes) was evaluated for its capability in removing hexavalent chromium from simulated wastewater. The effect of a co-ion, specifically Cu 2 + ions, on the percentage removal of Cr 6 + was also studied. Diphenyl <b>carbazide</b> colorimetric method was used to quantify the amount of Cr 6 + left after treatment with water hyacinth. The percentage removal of Cr 6 + was determined under varying conditions. The parameters varied were concentration of Cr 6 + (3, 6, & 9 mg/L), contact time (4, 8, and 12 days) and concentration of Cu 2 + (0, 4, and 8 mg/L). Results showed that the percentage removal of Cr 6 + is directly proportional to the initial concentration of Cr 6 + and contact time but inversely proportional to the concentration of co-ions which is Cu 2 + ions. Results and statistical data showed that the optimum condition for phytoremediation of Cr 6 + using water hyacinth is 12 days of contact time, and initial concentrations of 9 mg/L and 4 mg/L of Cr 6 + and Cu 2 + respectively. Overall results indicated that Eichhorniacrassipes can be used for phytoremediation of Cr+ 6 contaminated wastewater...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} {{has focused on}} the ability of rumen {{consortium}} to absorb the heavy metals. It is well known that the chronic inhalation of hexavalent chromium compounds increases risk of lung cancer. There has been an increase in chromium pollution in surface waters because of Electroplating, leather tanning, Coal and oil combustion and textile industries. Hence, a new method of using rumen fluid collected from slaughter house to treat chromium polluted area has been tried out in this study. The rumen consortium was inoculated in nutrient broth containing metal solutions in the concentration of 50 - 200 ppm. The atomic absorption studies showed that the rumen consortium was able to tolerate a maximum of 150 ppm chromium solution and the chromium removal was found to be 12. 5 % after 48 hrs. The percentage of chromium removal decreased with increas-ing metal concentration. The absorption was also confirmed by diphenyl <b>carbazide</b> method which was analysed in spectrophotometer at 540 nm. From the studies mentioned above, it has been confirmed that the Cr(VI) in the maximum concentration of 150 ppm has been absorbed by rumen consortia. Summary of the paper: Heavy metal pollution has become a big environmental threat which slowly destroys the ecosystem in many ways either in water bodies or land. The removal of heavy metals using rumen consortia, slaughter house waste has been tried out in this study. The standard chromium solution which was prepared in the concentration of 100 ppm was used for the experiments. To summarise, rumen fluid has the capacity to remove chromium solution in a maximum concentration of 150 ppm. Hence this study wil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chromium is a {{transition}} metal most commonly found in the environment in its trivalent [Cr(III) ] and hexavalent [Cr(VI) ] forms. The EPA maximum total chromium contaminant level for drinking water is 0. 1 mg/l (0. 1 ppm). Many water sources, especially underground sources, are at low temperatures (less {{than or equal to}} 15 Centigrade) year round. It is important to evaluate the possibility of microbial remediation of Cr(VI) contamination using microorganisms adapted to these low temperatures (psychrophiles). Results Core samples obtained from a Cr(VI) contaminated aquifer at the Hanford facility in Washington were enriched in Vogel Bonner medium at 10 Centigrade with 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 1000 mg/l Cr(VI). The extent of Cr(VI) reduction was evaluated using the diphenyl <b>carbazide</b> assay. Resistance to Cr(VI) up to and including 1000 mg/l Cr(VI) was observed in the consortium experiments. Reduction was slow or not observed at and above 100 mg/l Cr(VI) using the enrichment consortium. Average time to complete reduction of Cr(VI) in the 30 and 60 mg/l Cr(VI) cultures of the consortium was 8 and 17 days, respectively at 10 Centigrade. Lyophilized consortium cells did not demonstrate adsorption of Cr(VI) over a 24 hour period. Successful isolation of a Cr(VI) reducing organism (designated P 4) from the consortium was confirmed by 16 S rDNA amplification and sequencing. Average time to complete reduction of Cr(VI) at 10 Centigrade in the 25 and 50 mg/l Cr(VI) cultures of the isolate P 4 was 3 and 5 days, respectively. The 16 S rDNA sequence from isolate P 4 identified this organism as a strain of Arthrobacter aurescens, a species that has not previously been shown to be capable of low temperature Cr(VI) reduction. Conclusion A. aurescens, indigenous to the subsurface, {{has the potential to be}} a predominant metal reducer in enhanced, in situ subsurface bioremediation efforts involving Cr(VI) and possibly other heavy metals and radionuclides. </p...|$|E
40|$|Part I: Indirect {{determination}} of trace Organic Functional Groups Via Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Three indirect analysis techniques for the {{determination of}} isothiocyanates, dialkyl disulfides, and carbonyls have been developed. ^ The isothiocyanate functional group is determined by conversion of the isothiocyanate to the substituted thiourea in an ammoniacal solution. The thiourea is desulfurized with a silver amine reagent, producing a silver sulfide precipitate. The precipitate is isolated by filtration, digested in acid, and diluted in an aqueous solution. The silver content is determined by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). ^ The technique has a 0. 5 - 20. 0 micromole working range with a 2 - 4 % relative standard deviation. ^ The dialkyl disulfide is determined by reduction of the disulfide in ammoniacal sodium sulfite at 50 (DEGREES). The resultant mercaptide is precipitated as the silver salt, isolated by filtration, dissolved, and determined by AAS. ^ The technique has a 1. 0 - 10. 0 micromole working range with a 4 - 8 % relative standard deviation. ^ The carbonyl functional group was determined by treating the carboxyl with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to form the oxime product and acid. A measured quantity of ammonia was added as a proton scavenger to force the reaction to completion. The excess ammonia was determined by adding a nickel dimethyl glyoxime solution to both the sample and blank. The change in nickel concentration (from the isolated precipitate) {{is proportional to the}} carbonyl content. The nickel was determined by AAS. The technique has a working range of 1. 0 - 10. 0 micromoles with a 4 - 8 % relative standard deviation. ^ Part II: Immobilized Functional Groups For The Selective Concentration Of Trace Organics. Three different types of functional groups have been immobilized on insoluble supports for the purpose of selectively concentrating trace organics from aqueous and non-aqueous media via functional group reactions. ^ A bis-dianilino ethane functional group was immobilized on a polyacrylate support which was selective for aldehydes in the presence of ketones. The capacity of the resin for various aldehydes was examined. The condensation product, a tetrahydroimidazole, may be acid hydrolyzed to the diamine and the original aldehyde compound. This reaction is employed to recover the sequestered compound. ^ Several hydrazine related functional groups were examined to evaluate their utility as immobilized functional groups for carbonyl concentrating procedures. Four functional groups were evaluated. <b>Carbazide,</b> semithiocarbazide, acid hydrazide, and hydrazine resins were prepared. The semithiocarbazide resin was found to be the most efficient for carbonyl uptake. ^ An isothiuronium salt was immobilized on a polystyrene backbone for the selective reaction with carboxylic acids. The resin was evaluated on the basis of batch equilibration studies, reaction kinetic studies, and column concentration/recovery studies. Solutions of 80 ppb of carboxylic acids were quantitatively recovered with a 100 fold concentration. ^ The intent of this work was to develop novel functional group analysis techniques which may be employed at trace level concentrations. ...|$|E
