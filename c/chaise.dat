25|$|Pickle was {{the first}} ship to bring the news of Nelson's victory to Great Britain, {{arriving}} at Falmouth on 4 November 1805, after a hard voyage in bad weather. Vice Admiral Collingwood, who had assumed command {{after the death of}} Nelson, chose her to carry his dispatches describing the battle and announcing Nelson's death.

After arriving in Falmouth, Lapenotière took a <b>chaise</b> to London to deliver the dispatches to the Admiralty, stopping 21 times to change horses.
