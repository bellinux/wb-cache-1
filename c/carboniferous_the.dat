5|$|In 1828 Alexandre Brongniart's son, the {{botanist}} Adolphe Brongniart, {{published the}} introduction to a longer work {{on the history of}} fossil plants. Adolphe Brongniart concluded that the history of plants could roughly be divided into four parts. The first period was characterized by cryptogams. The second period was characterized by the appearance of the conifers. The third period brought emergence of the cycads, and the fourth by the development of the flowering plants (such as the dicotyledons). The transitions between each of these periods was marked by sharp discontinuities in the fossil record, with more gradual changes within the periods. Brongniart's work is the foundation of paleobotany and reinforced the theory that life on earth had a long and complex history, and different groups of plants and animals made their appearances in successive order. It also supported the idea that the Earth's climate had changed over time as Brongniart concluded that plant fossils showed that during the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>the</b> climate of Northern Europe must have been tropical.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the <b>Carboniferous,</b> <b>the</b> {{climate of}} Euramerica became {{increasingly}} dryer. Macroneuropteris disappeared from the fossil record for the most part. It was limited to isolated wet areas. It continued into the early Asselian stage of the Permian in these isolated locations.|$|E
25|$|With {{the close}} of the <b>Carboniferous,</b> <b>the</b> amniotes became the {{dominant}} tetrapod fauna. While primitive, terrestrial reptiliomorphs still existed, the synapsid amniotes evolved the first truly terrestrial megafauna (giant animals) in the form of pelycosaurs, such as Edaphosaurus and the carnivorous Dimetrodon. In the mid-Permian period, the climate became drier, resulting in a change of fauna: The pelycosaurs were replaced by the therapsids.|$|E
50|$|Arthropleura became extinct {{at the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>Carboniferous</b> period, when <b>the</b> moist climate began drying out, {{reducing}} the rainforests of <b>the</b> <b>Carboniferous,</b> and allowing <b>the</b> desertification characteristic of the Permian.|$|R

25|$|In late Devonian {{and in the}} <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>the</b> {{archipelago}} Armorica {{of southern}} Europe, which had rifted off Gondwana after Avalonia later in the Ordovician, was pushed into Avalonia, creating a second range, the North American/European Variscan, {{to the east of}} the Caledonide/Appalachian. The collision of Gondwana proper with Laurussia followed in the early Carboniferous, when the Variscan belt was already in place and actively developing.|$|E
25|$|The {{variation}} of deposition {{is due to}} the long period over which the Karachaganak structure was formed. From the Late Devonian to the middle <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>the</b> field was an atoll, over which in the early Permian a system of reefs were built. At its greatest the reservoir is 1.5km thick. This type of reservoir structure has been seen in analogous fileds including Kenkiyak, Zhanazhol, Tengiz, and possibly Astrakhan fields. A west-east cross section through Karachaganak resembles the twin humps of a camel, indicating two separate reef highs.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the diadectomorphs, the terrestrial forms were moderately sized creatures that appeared in the early <b>Carboniferous.</b> <b>The</b> vertebrae of the group foreshadowed that of primitive reptiles, with small pleurocentra, which grew and fused to become the true centrum in later vertebrates. The most well known genus is Seymouria. Some members of the most advanced group, the Diadectomorpha, were herbivorous and grew to several meters in length, with great, barrel-shaped bodies. Small relatives of the diadectomorphs gave rise to the first reptiles in the Late Carboniferous.|$|E

25|$|With {{the high}} {{atmospheric}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} pressure, particularly during the <b>Carboniferous,</b> <b>the</b> primitive throat sac breathing would have been sufficient for obtaining oxygen even for the large forms. Getting rid of carbon dioxide would present a greater problem on land, and the larger labyrinthodonts probably combined a high tolerance for blood carbonic acid with returning to the water to dissipate the carbon dioxide through the skin. The loss of the armour of rhomboid scales of their piscine ancestors allowed for this as well as additional respiration through the skin as in modern amphibians.|$|E
25|$|The insect {{fossil record}} extends back some 400 million {{years to the}} lower Devonian, while the Pterygotes (winged insects) {{underwent}} a major radiation in the <b>Carboniferous.</b> <b>The</b> Endopterygota underwent another major radiation in the Permian. Survivors of the mass extinction at the P-T boundary evolved in the Triassic to what are essentially the modern Insecta Orders that persist to modern times. Most modern insect families appeared in the Jurassic, and further diversity probably in genera occurred in the Cretaceous. By the Tertiary, there existed many of what are still modern genera; hence, most insects in amber are, indeed, members of extant genera. Insects diversified in only about 100 million years into essentially modern forms.|$|E
25|$|Very early Blattopterans had a large, discoid pronotum and coriaceous {{forewings}} with {{a distinct}} CuP vein (a unbranched wing vein, lying near the claval fold and reaching the wing posterior margin). These were not true cockroaches, as they had an ovipositor, although through the <b>Carboniferous,</b> <b>the</b> ovipositor started to diminish. The orders Caloneurodea and Miomoptera are known, with Orthoptera and Blattodea {{to be among the}} earliest Neoptera; developing from the upper Carboniferous to the Permian. These insects had wings with similar form and structure: small anal lobes. Species of Orthoptera, or grasshoppers and related kin, is an ancient order that still exist till today extending from this time period. From which time even the distinctive synapomorphy of saltatorial, or adaptive for jumping, hind legs is preserved.|$|E

6000|$|Again, {{what can}} be more {{remarkable}} than the singular constancy of structure preserved throughout a vast period of time by {{the family of the}} Pycnodonts and by that of the true Coelacanths: the former persisting, with but insignificant modifications, from <b>the</b> <b>Carboniferous</b> to <b>the</b> Tertiary rocks, inclusive; the latter existing, with still less change, from <b>the</b> <b>Carboniferous</b> rocks to <b>the</b> Chalk, inclusive? ...|$|R
5000|$|Coal forests covered {{tropical}} Euramerica (Europe, eastern North America, northwesternmost Africa) and Cathaysia (mainly China). Climate change devastated these tropical rainforests during <b>the</b> <b>Carboniferous</b> period. <b>The</b> <b>Carboniferous</b> Rainforest Collapse {{was caused}} by a cooler drier climate that initially fragmented, then collapsed the rainforest ecosystem. [...] During most of <b>the</b> rest of <b>Carboniferous</b> times, <b>the</b> coal forests were mainly restricted to refugia in North America (such as the Appalachian and Illinois coal basins) and central Europe.|$|R
25|$|The Carboniferous {{was a time}} {{of active}} {{mountain}} building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe (Laurussia) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe, and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains. In the same time frame, much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains. There were two major oceans in the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>the</b> Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica, and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.|$|E
500|$|Over 3,000 {{species of}} mayfly in 42 {{families}} and over 400 genera are known worldwide, including about 630 species in North America. Mayflies are an ancient group of winged (pterygote) insects. Putative fossil stem group representatives (e.g. Syntonopteroidea-like Lithoneura lameerrei) are already {{known from the}} late <b>Carboniferous.</b> <b>The</b> largest mayfly of all times may have been Bojophlebia prokopi from the Upper Carboniferous of Moravia with a wingspan of [...] The name Ephemeroptera is from the Greek ἐφήμερος, [...] "short-lived" [...] (literally [...] "lasting a day", cf. English [...] "ephemeral"), and πτερόν, , [...] "wing", referring to the brief lifespan of adults. The English common name is for the insect's emergence in or around the month of May in the UK. The name shadfly is from the Atlantic fish the shad, which runs up American East Coast rivers {{at the same time}} as many mayflies emerge.|$|E
2500|$|The current {{geological}} {{structure of}} South China and South-East Asia {{is determined to}} be {{the response to the}} [...] "Indo-sinian" [...] collision in South-East Asia during the <b>Carboniferous.</b> <b>The</b> Indo-Sinian orogeny was followed by extension of the Indo-Chinese block, the formation of rift basins and thermal subsidence during the early Triassic.|$|E

50|$|Proterogyrinidae is an extinct {{family of}} {{tetrapods}} {{within the group}} Embolomeri that lived in <b>the</b> <b>Carboniferous</b> period. <b>The</b> most well-known genus is Proterogyrinus.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fossil record}} of Notostraca is extensive, {{occurring}} {{in a wide}} range of geological deposits, and reaching back to the <b>Carboniferous.</b> <b>The</b> lack of major morphological change since [...] has led to Notostraca being described as a living fossil. Kazacharthra, a group known only from Triassic and Jurassic fossils from Kazakhstan and Western China, are closely related to notostracans, and may belong within the order Notostraca.|$|E
2500|$|The {{systematic}} {{placement of}} groups within Labyrinthodontia is notoriously fickle. Several groups are identified, {{but there is}} no consensus of their phylogenetic relationship. Many key groups were small with moderately ossified skeletons, and there is a gap in the fossil record in the early <b>Carboniferous</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "Romer's gap") when most of the groups appear to have evolved. Further complicating the picture is the amphibian larval-adult life cycle, with physical changes throughout life complicating phylogenetic analysis. The Labyrinthodontia appear to be composed of several nested clades. The two best understood groups, the Ichthyostegalia and the reptile-like amphibians have from the outset been known to be paraphyletic. Tellingly, labyrinthodont systematics was the subject of the inaugural meeting of International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature.|$|E
60|$|If {{there were}} any harmony between the Miltonic account and the circumstantial evidence, {{we ought to have}} {{abundant}} evidence of the existence of birds in the <b>Carboniferous,</b> <b>the</b> Devonian, and the Silurian rocks. I need hardly say {{that this is not the}} case, and that not a trace of birds makes its appearance until the far later period which I have mentioned.|$|E

50|$|The unit {{consists}} of a stratigraphic sequence that was deposited between <b>the</b> Upper <b>Carboniferous</b> age of <b>the</b> <b>Carboniferous</b> period in <b>the</b> Mesozoic Era, and the Eocene epoch of the Paleogene period in the Cenozoic Era.|$|R
60|$|Much more extraordinary, however, is the {{presence}} in the Palaeozoic formations of ancestral forms of true insects, termed by Mr. Scudder Palaeodictyoptera. They consist of generalised cockroaches and walking-stick insects (Orthopteroidea); ancient mayflies and allied forms, {{of which there are}} six families and more than thirty genera (Neuropteroidea); three genera of Hemipteroidea resembling various Homoptera and Hemiptera, mostly from the Carboniferous formation, a few from the Devonian, and one ancestral cockroach (Palaeoblattina) from the Middle Silurian sandstone of France. If this occurrence of a true hexapod insect from the Middle Silurian be really established, taken in connection with the well-defined Coleoptera from the <b>Carboniferous,</b> <b>the</b> origin of the entire group of terrestrial arthropoda is necessarily thrown back into the Cambrian epoch, if not earlier. And this cannot be considered improbable in view of the highly differentiated land plants--ferns, equisetums, and lycopods--in the Middle or Lower Silurian, and even a conifer (Cordaites Robbii) in the Upper Silurian; while the beds of graphite in the Laurentian were probably formed from terrestrial vegetation.|$|E
60|$|There is one {{division}} of the Amphibia which offers especially important evidence upon this point, inasmuch as it bridges over {{the gap between the}} Mesozoic and the Palaeozoic formations (often supposed to be of such prodigious magnitude), extending, as it does, {{from the bottom of the}} Carboniferous series to the top of the Trias, if not into the Lias. I refer to the Labyrinthodonts. As the Address of 1862 was passing through the press, I was able to mention, in a note, the discovery of a large Labyrinthodont, with well-ossified vertebrae, in the Edinburgh coal-field. Since that time eight or ten distinct genera of Labyrinthodonts have been discovered in the Carboniferous rocks of England, Scotland, and Ireland, not to mention the American forms described by Principal Dawson and Professor Cope. So that, at the present time, the Labyrinthodont Fauna of the Carboniferous rocks is more extensive and diversified than that of the Trias, while its chief types, so far as osteology enables us to judge, are quite as highly organised. Thus it is certain that a comparatively highly organised vertebrate type, such as that of the Labyrinthodonts, is capable of persisting, with no considerable change, through the period represented by the vast deposits which constitute the <b>Carboniferous,</b> <b>the</b> Permian, and the Triassic formations.|$|E
60|$|The rise {{of geology}} had been rapid and brilliant. In {{the last century}} it had been almost universally {{believed}} that fossil organisms were the relics of submerged and destroyed worlds, strange remnants of successive terrible mundane catastrophes. Cuvier himself, who had rendered immense services to geological science by his almost unerring reconstructions of extinct animals, remained a partisan of the old theory of constant cataclysms and fresh creations throughout his whole life; but Lamarck, here as elsewhere the prophet of the modern uniformitarian concept of nature, had already announced his grand idea that the ordinary process of natural laws sufficed to account for all the phenomena of the earth's crust. In England, William Smith, the ingenious land surveyor, riding {{up and down on}} his daily task over the face of the country, became convinced by his observations {{in the first years of}} the present century that a fixed order of sequence could everywhere be traced among the various superincumbent geological strata. Modern scientific geology takes its rise from the moment of this luminous and luminiferous discovery. With astonishing rapidity the sequence of strata was everywhere noted, and the succession of characteristic fossils mapped out, with the result of showing, however imperfectly at first, that the history of organic life upon the globe had followed a slow and regular course of constant development. Immediately whole schools of eager workers employed themselves in investigating in separate detail the phenomena of these successive stages of unfolding life. Murchison, fresh from the Peninsular campaign, began to study the dawn of organic history in the gloom of the Silurian and Cambrian epochs. A group of less articulate but not less active workers like Buckland and Mantell performed similar services for the <b>carboniferous,</b> <b>the</b> wealden, and the tertiary deposits. Sedgwick endeavoured to co-ordinate the whole range of then known facts into a single wide and comprehensive survey. De La Beche, Phillips, and Agassiz added their share to the great work of reconstruction. Last of all, among those who were contemporary and all but coeval with Charles Darwin himself, Lyell boldly fought out the battle of 'uniformitarianism,' proving, with all the accumulated weight of his encyclopædic and world-wide knowledge, that every known feature of geological development could be traced to the agency of causes now in action, and illustrated by means of slow secular changes still actually taking place on earth before our very eyes.|$|E
