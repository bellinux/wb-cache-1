40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to study factors affecting moisture distribution in 290 -kilogram stirred-curd Cheddar <b>cheese</b> <b>blocks</b> cooled in stainless steel hoops. Uneven moisture distribution within <b>blocks</b> may create <b>cheese</b> with variable texture and flavor, which can be extremely costly to the producer. The effects of temperature, pH, and vacuum treatment on moisture distribution were investigated. Temperature, pH, moisture, and pressure profiles were presented. Also, comparisons were made between temperature profiles of 290 - kilogram stirred-curd Cheddar <b>cheese</b> <b>blocks</b> cooled in stainless steel and in plywood hoops, {{as well as between}} temperature profiles of 66 -kilogram Swiss <b>cheese</b> <b>blocks</b> cooled in cardboard and in plastic boxes. Moisture transferred from high to low temperature in the <b>cheese</b> <b>blocks.</b> Moisture may have transferred in response to thermally induced curd moisture-holding capacity gradients in the <b>cheese</b> <b>blocks.</b> Moisture also may have transferred in the <b>cheese</b> <b>blocks</b> by a mechanism similar to thermo-osmosis of liquids in porous solids. The cheese in the plywood or cardboard insulating materials cooled more uniformly than the cheese in the stainless steel or plastic containers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effect of {{elevated}} temperature (16 degrees C) on ripening of Dutch-type cheese. Three slices of each <b>cheese</b> <b>block</b> were further divided into three layers. The processes in the control samples of cheese ripening at 10 degrees C were also monitored. The contents of free amino acids in accelerated cheese were two times higher than were those in control samples. The highest contents of free amino acids were observed in the cores of all slices of cheeses ripening at both temperatures. The contents of tyramine, in layers of the studied slices, reached almost 500 mg kg(- 1) during 56 days of the experiment. The contents of biogenic amines in the edges grew even higher. Accelerated cheese showed faster equalisation of hardness than did control samples. The increase of temperature by 6 degrees C can reduce the ripening time in cellars by approximately one half.

40|$|Cheese is {{a staple}} food that is {{consumed}} throughout the world. Several million ton of cheese is produced worldwide {{and a large}} amount of this cheese is sliced. Therefore an optimal cheese cutting process is of great importance for the industry. Nowadays, the cheese cutting industry encounters several challenges and {{there is a need to}} study the slicing of cheese with an approach that takes the mechanical properties of the material to be cut, the properties of the cutting system and their interaction into account. A good method to perform such research is the use finite element modelling. In Belgium, hard Gouda-type cheese is very popular. Therefore the experiments in this research were limited to Gouda cheese. Other researchers who modelled the mechanical behaviour of cheese with finite elements considered cheese to be a homogeneous material. It is known that cheese is not homogeneous when it comes to its chemical composition and that this composition influences other cheese properties. This led to the assumption that Gouda cheese is a heterogeneous material regarding its mechanical behaviour and that it should be modelled as such. The heterogeneity of Gouda cheese was demonstrated and quantified, both within a <b>cheese</b> <b>block</b> and on a spatio-temporal level. In a <b>cheese</b> <b>block,</b> there was a significant heterogeneity regarding Young’s modulus, the Prony coefficients and the true stress and strain at fracture which could mainly be explained by the gradients in dry matter content. When examining cheese on a spatio-temporal level, most of the mechanical parameters were influenced by the sample location, by the ripening of the cheese and by the combination of these two variables. When both spatial and temporal variables were considered, not only dehydration of the cheese but also proteolysis influenced the mechanical parameters. The acquired knowledge about cheese heterogeneity influenced the design of the following experiments and the construction of the finite element models. The macroscopic cheese heterogeneity was takennbsp;account by creating cheese models on a sample scale instead of modelling an entire <b>cheese</b> <b>block.</b> This approach led to good validation results. After the cheese heterogeneity was thoroughly examined, it was tested whether cheese can be modelled as a linear viscoelastic material to simulate the cheese’s mechanical behaviour before fracture. The linear viscoelastic modelsnbsp;validated with experimental single edge notched bending tests. The experimental reaction forces on the probe corresponded well with the numerical results as long as small strains were considered. Thus the use of a linear viscoelastic material model allowed to model single edge notched bending tests on cheese up to the point of cheese fracture. The linear viscoelastic cheese models were used to develop a new method to determine a crack initiation criterion. A repeatable method for the determination of a critical stress criterion which combines experimental and numerical single edge notched bending tests was acquired. The applicability of the critical stress criterion was validated with wire cutting experiments and models. The order of magnitude of the reaction forces on the wire was the same. Furthermore, both the experimental and the numerical results followed the same trend, with a clear indentation and steady state cutting phase. Thus it can be concluded that the method to determine the fracture criterion as proposed in this work led to good results, both for the single edge notched bending tests as the wire cutting tests. The finite element models that were constructed in this research and the method that was developed to determine a crack propagation criterion for cheese form a sound basis for further research on the optimisation of the cutting of Gouda cheese. status: publishe...|$|E

A moderate high-pressure processing (HPP) treatment is proposed {{to accelerate the}} shredability of Cheddar cheese. High pressure processing (345 and 483 MPa for 3 and 7 min) applied to unripened (1 d old) stirredcurd Cheddar cheese yielded microstructure changes that differed with pressure level and processing time. Untreated and pressure-treated cheese shredded at d 27 and 1, respectively, shared similar visual and tactile sensory properties.

40|$|During the {{production}} process of cheese significant spatio-temporal changes in chemical and physical parameters are induced due to salt and water transfers during brining and water losses during ripening. In this research, the fundamental material parameters describing the visco-elastic behaviour of Gouda cheeses of 4, 8, 11 and 19 weeks were determined throughout the geometry of a <b>cheese</b> <b>block,</b> together with the hardness and dry matter content. Young’s modulus, fracture stress and strain and hardness were measured with uniaxial compression tests. 5 term Prony series were deduced {{from the results of}} stress-relaxation compression tests to study the visco-elastic properties. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the sample location in a cheese slice, {{and to a lesser extent}} the section of the cheese (the middle or the side of a block) have a significant influence on most parameters. Age has a significant effect on all parameters, except hardness and fracture strain. Ripening of the cheese causes a significant increase in dry matter content and decrease in Young’s modulus. Significant second order interactions also occur for most parameters, meaning that the age of the cheese influences the spatial gradients. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Defects in {{commercial}} cheese {{result in a}} downgrading of the final cheese and a consequential economic loss to the cheese producer. Developments of defects in cheese are often not fully understood and therefore not controllable by the producer. This research investigated the underlying factors {{in the development of}} split and secondary fermentation defect and of pinking defects {{in commercial}} Irish cheeses. Split defect in Swiss-type cheese is a common defect associated with eye formation and manifests as slits and cracks visible in the cut cheese loaf (Reinbold, 1972; Daly et al., 2010). No consensus exists as to the definitive causes of the defect and possible factors which may contribute to the defect were reviewed. Models were derived to describe the relationship between moisture, pH, and salt levels and the distance from sample location to the closest external block surface during cheese ripening. Significant gradients within the cheese blocks were observed for all measured parameters in cheeses at 7 day post/after manufacture. No significant pH gradient was found within the blocks on exit from hot-room ripening and at three months post exit from the hot-room. Moisture content reached equilibrium within the blocks between exit from hot-room and 3 months after exit from hot-room while salt and salt-to-moisture levels had not reached equilibrium within the cheese blocks even at three months after exit from hot-room ripening. A characterisation of Swiss-type cheeses produced from a seasonal milk supply was undertaken. Cheeses were sampled on two days per month of the production year, at three different times during the manufacturing day, at internal and external regions of the <b>cheese</b> <b>block</b> and at four ripening time points (7 days post manufacture, post hot-room, 14 days post hot-room and 3 months in a cold room after exit from hot-room). Compositional, biochemical and microbial indices were determined, and the results were analysed as a splitplot with a factorial arrangement of treatments (season, time of day, area) on the main plot and ripening time on the sub-plot. Season (and interactions) had a significant effect on pH and salt-in-moisture levels (SM), mean viable counts of L. helveticus, propionic acid and non-starter lactic acid bacteria, levels of primary and secondary proteolysis and cheese firmness. Levels of proteolysis increased significantly during hot-room ripening but also during cold room storage, signifying continued development of cheese ripening during cold storage (> 8 °C). Rheological parameters (e. g. springiness and cohesiveness) were significantly affected by interactions between ripening and location within cheese blocks. Time of day of manufacture significantly affected mean cheese calcium levels at 7 days post manufacture and mean levels of arginine and mean viable counts of NSLAB. Cheeses produced {{during the middle of the}} production day had the best grading scores and were more consistent compared to cheeses produced early or late during day of manufacture. Cheeses with low levels of S/M and low values of resilience were associated with poor grades at 7 days post manufacture. Chesses which had high elastic index values and low values of springiness in the external areas after exit from hot-room ripening also obtained good commercial grades. Development of a pink colour defect is an intermittent defect in ripened cheese which may or may not contain an added colourant, e. g., annatto. Factors associated with the defect were reviewed. Attempts at extraction and identification of the pink discolouration were unsuccessful. The pink colour partitioned with the water insoluble protein fraction. No significant difference was observed between ripened control and defect cheese for oxygen levels and redox potential or for the results of elemental analysis. A possible relationship between starter activity and defect development was established in cheeses with added coulourant, as lower levels of residual galactose and lactose were observed in defective cheese compared to control cheese free of the defect. Swiss-type cheese without added colourant had significantly higher levels of arginine and significantly lower lactate levels. Flow cell cytometry indicated that levels of bacterial cell viability and metabolic state differed between control and defect cheeses (without added colourant). Pyrosequencing analysis of cheese samples with and without the defect detected the previously unreported bacteria in cheese, Deinococcus thermus (a potential carotenoid producer). Defective Swiss-type cheeses had elevated levels of Deinococcus thermus compared to control cheeses, however the direct cause of pink was not linked to this bacterium alone. Overall, research was undertaken on underlying factors associated with the development of specific defects in commercial cheese, but also characterised the dynamic changes in key microbial and physicochemical parameters during cheese ripening and storage. This will enable the development of processing technologies to enable seasonal manipulation of manufacture protocols to minimise compositional and biochemical variability and to reduce and inhibit the occurrence of specific quality defects...|$|E

However, efficient control of coagulation requires a rigorous, objective, inline method to select the optimum time to proceed with clotting and cutting time. Therefore, a near-infrared (NIR) light backscatter fiber optic sensor was implemented in order to monitor coagulation of sheep milk and assess the possibility of estimating both clotting and cutting times during the manufacture of sheep’s <b>cheese.</b> A randomized <b>block</b> experiment with three replications was designed to determine optical, rheological, and visual coagulation parameters in sheep milk using four enzyme concentrations. The optical response of the sheep milk was found to be greater than in goat milk (15 – 20 %) but lower than cow milk (30 – 50 %). The standard error for the optical parameters during the coagulation of sheep milk was lower than those observed for the visual parameters. Optical variables were strongly correlated with both visually and rheologically defined coagulation parameters. Rheologically and visually determined clotting and cutting times were successfully predicted using only one optical parameter. Our results suggest that optical parameters generated from the NIR light backscatter profile adequately respond to the kinetic changes induced by varying the concentration of enzyme and that prediction of rheologically determined cutting time using NIR light backscatter is more precise than prediction of visually determined cutting time, i. e., ∼ 50 % lower SEP...|$|R
