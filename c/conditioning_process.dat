40|$|Within the {{autonomous}} robotics literature, bio-inspired models of navigation in organisms (e. g. rats) usually rely on instrumental <b>conditioning</b> <b>processes</b> {{based on the}} learning of associations between places in the environment and navigation actions leading to rewarded goal places. This paper presents a neural-network model capable of solving navigation tasks {{on the basis of}} Pavlovian <b>conditioning</b> <b>processes</b> (`autoshaping 2 ̆ 7) which allow transferring innate approaching behaviours from biologically salient stimuli (e. g., food) to neutral stimuli (e. g., a landmark seen from far away and close to the food). The overall architecture and functioning of the model is biologically constrained on the basis of relevant neuroscienti?c anatomical and physiological knowledge on amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and ventral tegmental area. The model is tested with a simulated robotic rat engaged in autoshaping and devaluation experiments. The results show that, although the model allows solving only simple navigation tasks, it produces fast learning and a ?exible sensitivity of behaviour to internal states typical of Pavlovian processes. The model is also important for the investigation of adaptive behaviour in general as it clari?es the nature of some Pavlovian core mechanisms which {{play a key role in}} several forms of learning...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{cybersex}} addiction, as {{one form}} of specific Internet addiction, has been receiving growing attention in the past years. However, {{there is no consensus}} regarding the phenomenology, classification, and diagnostic criteria of cybersex addiction and respectively Internet addiction, so far. Some approaches suggest similarities to substance dependencies for which <b>conditioning</b> <b>processes,</b> approach/avoidance tendencies, and implicit associations are seen to be crucial mechanisms regarding development and maintenance. In the course of this dissertation, three studies that aim at investigating these mechanisms in the context of cybersex addiction were conducted. Each study adapted an experimental paradigm used in substance dependence research while it was expected to obtain comparable results. First, to investigate <b>conditioning</b> <b>processes,</b> a Standard Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer Task (Hogarth, Dickinson, Wright, Kouvaraki, & Duka, 2007) was modified. Second, an adapted version of the Approach Avoidance Task (Rinck & Becker, 2007) was used for investigating a potential role of approach/avoidance tendencies. Third, to assess effects of implicit associations on cybersex addiction, an Implicit Association Test was adapted (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). All experimental paradigms were modified with pornographic pictures. Results revealed that <b>conditioning</b> <b>processes,</b> approach/avoidance tendencies as well as implicit associations had an effect on tendencies towards cybersex addiction. Moreover, all three studies could show that self-reported symptoms of cybersex addiction were particularly high if the investigated mechanisms interacted either with specific predispositions towards sex (i. e. sexual excitation or problematic sexual behaviors) or subjective craving due to watching pornographic pictures. Overall, the findings of this dissertation provide further empirical evidence for similarities between cybersex addiction and substance dependencies. Therefore, similarities between dual-process models of addiction (Bechara, 2005; Wiers & Stacy, 2006) and the theoretical framework of cybersex addiction by Laier and Brand (2014) are discussed. Furthermore, extensions of the cybersex addiction framework by Laier and Brand (2014) are proposed. At last, practical implications are discussed, while limitations and future directives are pointed out...|$|R

5000|$|Since Watson {{developed}} {{the theory of}} behaviorism, behavior analysts have held that motor development represents a <b>conditioning</b> <b>process.</b> This holds that crawling, climbing, and walking displayed by infants represents conditioning of biologically innate reflexes. In this case, the reflex of stepping is the respondent behavior and these reflexes are environmentally conditioned through experience and practice. This position was criticized by maturation theorists. They believed that the stepping reflex for infants actually disappeared over time and was not [...] "continuous". By working with a slightly different theoretical model, while still using operant conditioning, Esther Thelen was {{able to show that}} children's stepping reflex disappears as a function of increased physical weight. However, when infants were placed in water, that same stepping reflex returned. This offered a model for the continuity of the stepping reflex and the progressive stimulation model for behavior analysts.|$|E

50|$|Mary Cover Jones was {{the first}} to show the {{effectiveness}} of the counter <b>conditioning</b> <b>process</b> in her rabbit experiments.

Eventually the boy was able to pet the rabbit without any sign of fear because of the unpleasant and feared stimulus of the rabbit was now replaced by the pleasant stimulus of the food.
