40|$|Computational {{cluster is}} used for heavy {{computation}} that emphasizes various requirements for network functionality. Most of the computing software uses TCP/IP for their computation. But it has lot of disadvantages. This paper proposes a specialized networking protocol based on cluster computation <b>called</b> <b>Command</b> Transfer Protocol (CTP) which {{is used for}} message transfer and heavy computation between computers in cluster. Here group of computers are called clusters and messages sent between the clusters are <b>called</b> <b>commands.</b> CTP uses various functionalities which are absent in UDP and it is more efficient than TCP. This paper implements CTP in message transfer between computers and compares it with TCP/IP and UDP...|$|R
