Contudo, mesmo já existindo um grande conhecimento dos genes e proteínas envolvidas, ainda existe uma lacuna na integração dos mesmos nas redes biológicas dos respectivos microorganismos. O número e qualidade das redes biológicas existentes (Transcriptional Regulatory Network - TRN and Protein-protein Interactions - PPI) para os fenómenos chave tais como, quorum sensing, formação de biofilmes, resistência a antibióticos e patogenecidade, não evidenciam a importância de alguns destes genes no fenómeno de crosstalking. Esta tese apresenta-se como a primeira tentativa de colocar em evidência os genes e proteínas envolvidos em <b>cross-talking,</b> associando-os aos parceiros de interacção nas respectivas redes biológicas de cada microorganismo. Primeiramente, utilizou-se um processo de integração de redes para os dois microrganismos, levando ao aumento do conhecimento geral sobre os processos de patogenecidade dos dois microorganismos, e por fim os genes envolvidos em <b>cross-talking,</b> identificados na literatura, foram evidenciados nestas redes integradas. Com esta tese pretende-se dar algumas pistas sobre como é que estes genes de <b>cross-talking</b> estão envolvidos em importantes processos biológicos e também de algum modo apontar novos potenciais drug targets. The {{study of}} the <b>cross-talking</b> {{phenomenon}} between P. aeruginosa and C. albicans has been focus on the processes of quorum sensing and biofilm formation, identifying the genes and proteins involved in this relationship. Although, there is a present knowledge on the genes and proteins involved, {{there is still a}} lack in the understanding on how these genes are integrated into biological regulatory networks of the respective microorganisms. The number and quality of the existing biological networks (i. e. Transcriptional Regulatory Network - TRN and Protein-protein Interactions - PPI) for key phenomena, such as quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis does not highlights the importance of some genes and proteins in the <b>cross-talking</b> phenomenon. In this thesis, constitutes the first attempt to put in evidence the genes involved in <b>cross-talking,</b> associating them to the interacting partners within the biological networks of the two microorganisms. First, the two microorganisms passed through a process of network integration, leading to an augmentation in the general knowledge on pathogenic processes, and then over those networks the <b>cross-talking</b> genes identified in literature were highlighted. With this thesis we expect to give some new perspectives on how these <b>cross-talking</b> genes are interconnected to important biological processes of the two microorganisms and to point some new potential drug targets...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{concept of}} linear pathways is being increasingly challenged by network representations, which emphasize the 	 importance of interactions between {{components of a}} biological system, and motivates for adopting a system‐level approach in 	 biology. We have developed a dynamical system that integrates quantitative, dynamic and topological representation of network of 	 ERK 5 (Extracellular signal‐regulated kinases 5), JNK(c‐Jun N‐terminal kinases) and P 38 kinase cascades. We have observered that, 	 the transient activation of ERK 5, JNK 1 and P 38 β kinase, and the persistent activation of JNK 2, JNK 3 and P 38 δ 	 kinase does not get affected due to the <b>cross‐talks</b> between ERK 5, JNK and P 38 kinase cascades.

The impacts of one‐way <b>cross‐talks</b> between the cascades are insignificant and differ from the impact of 	 two‐way <b>cross‐talks.</b> We generate a hypothesis that, signaling pathways should be studied as a system by considering the 	 <b>cross‐talks</b> between the two adjacent cascades...|$|R
25|$|In {{practical}} fibers, the cladding {{is usually}} {{coated with a}} tough resin coating and an additional buffer layer, which may be further surrounded by a jacket layer, usually plastic. These layers add strength to the fiber but do not contribute to its optical wave guide properties. Rigid fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing ("dark") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another. This reduces <b>cross-talk</b> between the fibers, or reduces flare in fiber bundle imaging applications.|$|E
25|$|Dedicated {{regions of}} the brain are {{specialized}} for given functions. Increased <b>cross-talk</b> between regions specialized for different functions {{may account for the}} many types of synesthesia. For example, the additive experience of seeing color when looking at graphemes might be due to cross-activation of the grapheme-recognition area and the color area called V4 (see figure). This is supported by the fact that grapheme-color synesthetes are able to identify the color of a grapheme in their peripheral vision even when they cannot consciously identify the shape of the grapheme.|$|E
25|$|The myriad and often-conflicting effects {{mediated}} by the above pathways indicate the existence of extensive <b>cross-talk.</b> For instance, NF-κB enhances the transcription of C-FLIP, Bcl-2, and cIAP1 / cIAP2, inhibitory proteins that interfere with death signaling. On the other hand, activated caspases cleave several components of the NF-κB pathway, including RIP, IKK, and the subunits of NF-κB itself. Other factors, such as cell type, concurrent stimulation of other cytokines, or the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can shift the balance in favor of one pathway or another. Such complicated signaling ensures that, whenever TNF is released, various cells with vastly diverse functions and conditions can all respond appropriately to inflammation.|$|E

40|$|Signal {{transduction}} is {{a complex}} protein signaling process with a rich network of multifunctional interactions that occur in 			a non‐linear fashion. Mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways regulate diverse cellular 			processes ranging from proliferation and differentiation to apoptosis.

25|$|Ephaptic {{transmission}} is when two nerves {{communicate with each}} other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a myelin sheath that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent <b>cross-talk</b> between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to “cross-talk” and send action potentials in both directions.|$|E
25|$|For short-distance applications, such as {{a network}} in an office {{building}} (see FTTO), fiber-optic cabling can save space in cable ducts. This is because a single fiber can carry much more data than electrical cables such as standard category 5 Ethernet cabling, which typically runs at 100 Mbit/s or 1 Gbit/s speeds. Fiber is also immune to electrical interference; there is no <b>cross-talk</b> between signals in different cables, and no pickup of environmental noise. Non-armored fiber cables do not conduct electricity, which makes fiber a good solution for protecting communications equipment in high voltage environments, such as power generation facilities, or metal communication structures prone to lightning strikes. They {{can also be used}} in environments where explosive fumes are present, without danger of ignition. Wiretapping (in this case, fiber tapping) is more difficult compared to electrical connections, and there are concentric dual-core fibers that are said to be tap-proof.|$|E
25|$|Activity {{of these}} HDACs can be {{affected}} by phosphorylation. An increased amount of phosphorylation (hyperphosphorylation) leads to increased deacetylase activity, but degrades complex formation between HDACs 1 and 2 and between HDAC1 and mSin3A/YY1. A lower than normal amount of phosphorylation (hypophosphorylation) leads to {{a decrease in the}} amount of deacetylase activity, but increases the amount of complex formation. Mutation studies found that major phosphorylation happens at residues Ser421 and Ser423. Indeed, when these residues were mutated, a drastic reduction was seen in the amount of deacetylation activity. This difference in the state of phosphorylation is a way of keeping an optimal level of phosphorylation to ensure there is no over or under expression of deacetylation. HDACs 1 and 2 have been found only exclusively in the nucleus. In HDAC1 knockout (KO) mice, mice were found to die during embryogenesis and showed a drastic reduction in the production but increased expression of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors (CDKIs) p21 and p27. Not even upregulation of the other Class I HDACs could compensate for the loss of HDAC1. This inability to recover from HDAC1 KO leads researchers to believe that there are both functional uniqueness to each HDAC as well as regulatory <b>cross-talk</b> between factors.|$|E
30|$|It is {{postulated}} {{that there are}} <b>cross-talks</b> between signaling pathways: hormone signaling and the PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Hormone receptor positive tumors rely on hormone-mediated signaling for growth. However, as hormone treatment continues, adaptive upregulation of growth factor mediated signaling, such as the PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathway, reinforces <b>cross-talks</b> leading to constitutive activation of the cell growth pathways, rendering the patients resistant to hormone treatment [35, 44 – 47]. Everolimus, by inhibiting the PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR signaling, {{has been shown to}} restore hormone sensitivity [48].

30|$|We present here a {{multiplex}} {{network model}} {{for the analysis of}} multivariate time series. In particular we analysed the behaviour of the intracranial pressure (ICP) and the heart rate (HR) in a cohort of 27 pediatric brain traumatic patients. We first applied some basic statistical techniques, such as recurrence plot, to study the behaviour of the two time series. Afterwards we applied a naive sliding window approach to detect the presence of <b>cross-talks</b> and non <b>cross-talks</b> events. We then modelled our system using the multivariate time series horizontal visibility graph approach as described in (Lacasa et al. 2014). In particular we analysed the behaviour of the multivariate system considering two multilayer network metrics: the average edge overlap and the interlayer mutual correlation. We decided to use these two measures as classical indicators adopted in the literature for a first endeveour to analyse the system. We evaluated the average trend of these two metrics on 10 <b>cross-talks</b> and non <b>cross-talks</b> events for each patient. Findings suggest that while the average edge overlap seems to have a more stable behaviour between the two situations, the mutual interaction on the other hand shows a more clear trend. In particular the average value increases when cross talks events are detected, meaning that the two time series behaves more similarly in this case. Future directions of research includes the integration of further parameters that are monitored in this cohort of patients, and that could help in the analysis and understanding of the cross talks behaviour. We therefore plan to extend our multiplex model, also considering further multiplex network properties and measures in the analysis and integrating the biological knowledge regarding the system into its network representation.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that estrogen and progesterone have a mitogenic effect on leiomyoma cells and also act by influencing (directly and indirectly) {{a large number of}} growth factors, cytokines and apoptotic factors as well as other hormones. Furthermore, the actions of estrogen and progesterone are modulated by the <b>cross-talk</b> between estrogen, progesterone and prolactin signaling which controls the expression of the respective nuclear receptors. It {{is believed}} that estrogen promotes growth by up-regulating IGF-1, EGFR, [...] TGF-beta1, TGF-beta3 and PDGF, and promotes aberrant survival of leiomyoma cells by down-regulating p53, increasing expression of the anti-apoptotic factor PCP4 and antagonizing PPAR-gamma signaling. Progesterone is thought to promote the growth of leiomyoma through up-regulating EGF, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, and promotes survival through up-regulating Bcl-2 expression and down-regulating TNF-alpha. Progesterone is believed to counteract growth by downregulating IGF-1. Expression of transforming growth interacting factor (TGIF) is increased in leiomyoma compared with myometrium.

40|$|Fibrosis is a {{pathological}} process characterized by massive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) such as type I/III collagens and fibronectin that are secreted by an expanded pool of myofibroblasts, which are phenotypically altered fibroblasts with more contractile, proliferative, migratory and secretory activities. Fibrosis occurs in various organs including the lung, heart, liver and kidney, resulting in loss of normal tissue architecture and functions. Myofibroblasts could originate from multiple sources including tissue-resident fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells through mechanisms of epithelial/endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT/EndMT), and bone marrow-derived circulating progenitors called fibrocytes. Emerging evidence {{in recent years}} shows that sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) acts on several types of target cells and is engaged in pro-fibrotic inflammatory process and fibrogenic process through multiple mechanisms, which include vascular permeability change, leukocyte infiltration, and migration, proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation of fibroblasts. Many of these S 1 P actions are receptor subtype-specific. In these actions, S 1 P has multiple <b>cross-talks</b> with other cytokines, particularly transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), which {{plays a major role}} in fibrosis. The <b>cross-talks</b> include the regulation of S 1 P production through altered expression and activity of sphingosine kinases in fibrotic lesions, altered expression of S 1 P receptors, and S 1 P receptor-mediated transactivation of TGFβ signaling pathway.

2500|$|OFDM {{requires}} {{very accurate}} frequency synchronization between {{the receiver and}} the transmitter; with frequency deviation the sub-carriers {{will no longer be}} orthogonal, causing inter-carrier interference (ICI) (i.e., <b>cross-talk</b> between the sub-carriers). Frequency offsets are typically caused by mismatched transmitter and receiver oscillators, or by Doppler shift due to movement. While Doppler shift alone may be compensated for by the receiver, the situation is worsened when combined with multipath, as reflections will appear at various frequency offsets, which is much harder to correct. This effect typically worsens as speed increases, and is an important factor limiting the use of OFDM in high-speed vehicles. In order to mitigate ICI in such scenarios, one can shape each sub-carrier in order to minimize the interference resulting in a non-orthogonal subcarriers overlapping. For example, a low-complexity scheme referred to as WCP-OFDM (...) consists of using short filters at the transmitter output in order to perform a potentially non-rectangular pulse shaping and a near perfect reconstruction using a single-tap per subcarrier equalization. Other ICI suppression techniques usually increase drastically the receiver complexity.|$|E
2500|$|Numerical example: Analog FM {{requires}} 0.2MHz per programme.

This results in a system spectral efficiency of 1 / 15 / (0.2 MHz) = 0.30 programmes/transmitter/MHz. DAB with 192 kbit/s codec requires 1.536MHz * 192 kbit/s / 1,136 kbit/s = 0.26MHz per audio programme.

[...] This is 3.2 times as efficient as analog FM for local stations. For single frequency network (SFN) transmission, for example of national programmes, the channel re-use factor is 1, resulting in 1/1/0.25MHz = 3.85 programmes/transmitter/MHz, which is 12.7 times as efficient as FM for national and regional networks.|$|E
