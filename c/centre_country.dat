40|$|Master of EducationThis study {{offers a}} history of the Victorian Arts <b>Centre</b> <b>Country</b> Access programme. The study explores the {{relationship}} that exists between education and the performing arts, as experienced by participants in the Victorian Arts <b>Centre</b> <b>Country</b> Access programme: teachers, students and artists. Data related to the programme have been collected over a twelve year period from 1982 to 1994. To describe and analyse the programme within its broadest contexts, the study first considers historical and other contextual data (the "grand tour") before specifically focussing on particular aspects of the programme (the "mini tours"). The study identifies and explores factors such as the role of teachers, artists, workshops, performances and community involvement in the development of learning and appreciation in an art education programme. It explores the relationships that exist between "creation", "appreciation" and "re-creation"; with particular emphasis on a consideration of the contributions, roles and perspectives of teachers and artists. The study attempts to identify and consider the relationships that exist between factors which contribute to long-term learning and appreciation in the performing arts i. e. to consider the relationship that exists between education and the performing arts.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{validity}} {{real interest rate}} parity (RIP) for a sample of 19 OECD and Asian developing economies. The distinction {{of this paper is}} that we exploit both linearity and non-linear unit root tests as advocated by Dufrenot et al. (Applied Economics, 38, pp. 203 - 229, 2006) to validate the parity. The major finding are: (i) the alignments from real interest rate differentials (RIDs) are corrected in a non-linear fashion and that the adjustments is asymmetric in both size and speed; (ii) that RIP holds for the developed and developing countries; and (iii) the empirical results are invariant with respect to the US, Japan or Germany as the <b>centre</b> <b>country.</b> Real interest rate differentials, non-linear, non-stationarity, capital mobility, market integration,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between {{monetary}} policies of large industrial countries and international credit cycles. Based on an overinvestment framework, we show that in the prevailing asymmetric world monetary system, monetary policies of large <b>centre</b> <b>countries</b> can fuel credit booms in emerging markets. We argue that the absorption of inflationary pressure by emerging markets during boom periods {{as well as the}} fear of feedback effects of crises in emerging markets encourage delayed monetary tightening in <b>centre</b> <b>countries.</b> The paper helps explain asymmetric monetary policy patterns in <b>centre</b> <b>countries</b> and why the current global low interest rate environment is likely to prevail...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{examining}} {{the presentation of}} the cultures of <b>Centre</b> and Periphery <b>countries</b> in regional ELT textbooks. Four ELT regional reading textbooks named, Interactions/Mosaic reading series, were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed through content analysis research technique in order to investigate the assumption that <b>Centre</b> <b>countries</b> are favoured over Periphery countries. The recording units used in the study were: 'paragraph' and 'picture'. Byram's cultural checklist (1993) was used to collect and categorize the cultural content of Center and Periphery countries. However, pictures were simply classified under one of the following categories: Center countries, Periphery countries, and shared. The study data consisted of 670 paragraphs and 327 pictures. The study concluded that Interactions/Mosaic series contained cultural presentations of different countries from the world. The cultural content constitutes two thirds of the series. <b>Centre</b> <b>countries</b> occupied 29. 11 % of the series content, whereas Periphery countries occupied 32. 69 %. The administration of T-test showed that there was no statistically significant difference at the p< 0. 05 level between Periphery and <b>Centre</b> <b>countries</b> in the four ELT reading textbooks. Under picture analysis, the percentage of the presentation of Center countries is 37. 31 %; and the presentation of Periphery countries is 33. 33 %. The presentation of <b>Centre</b> and Periphery <b>countries</b> in pictures and paragraphs is quantitatively balanced. Paragraphs and pictures coded under Periphery Countries presented cultures from the Middle East, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, India, Puerto Rico, etc. The qualitative analysis showed that this series has followed Gray's (2002) description of new ELT global textbooks. The topics achieved neutrality, diversity and appropriacy. No stereotypical presentations or ideological content were detected in the series...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{contribution}} to the literature argues that the present international monetary system in many ways operates like the Bretton-Woods system. Asia is the new periphery {{of the system and}} pursues an export-led development strategy based on undervalued exchange rates and accumulated foreign reserves. The United States remains the <b>centre</b> <b>country,</b> pursuing a monetary-policy strategy that overlooks the exchange rate. Under both regimes the United States does not take external factors into account in conducting monetary policy while the periphery does take external factors into account. We provide results of a test of this hypothesis. Then, we present a new method for decomposition of a seasonally adjusted series the business cycle and other components using a time-varying-coefficient technique that allows us to test the relationship between the cycle and macroeconomic policies under both regimes.

40|$|Beam Output Auditing (BOA) is one {{key process}} of the EORTC {{radiation}} therapy quality assurance program. Here the results obtained between 2005 and 2014 are presented and compared to previous results. For all BOA reports the following parameters were scored: <b>centre,</b> <b>country,</b> date of audit, beam energies and treatment machines audited, auditing organisation, percentage of agreement between stated and measured dose. Four-hundred and sixty-one BOA reports were analyzed containing the results of 1790 photon and 1366 electron beams, delivered by 755 different treatment machines. The majority of beams (91. 1 %) were within the optimal limit of[*]≤[*] 3 %. Only 13 beams (0. 4 %; n[*]=[*] 9 electrons; n[*]=[*] 4 photons), {{were out of the}} range of acceptance of[*]≤[*] 5 %. Previous reviews reported a much higher percentage of 2. 5 % or more of the BOAs with > 5 % deviation. The majority of EORTC centres present beam output variations within the 3 % tolerance cutoff value and only 0. 4 % of audited beams presented with variations of more than 5 %. This is an important improvement compared to previous BOA results...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{contribution}} to the literature argues that the present international monetary system in many ways operates like the Bretton-Woods system. Asia is the new periphery {{of the system and}} pursues an export-led development strategy. The members of the new periphery peg their currencies to the U. S. dollar at undervalued exchange rates and accumulate foreign reserves. In contrast, the old periphery - - consisting of Western Europe, Canada and parts of Latin America - - interacts with the centre with flexible exchange rates; its aggregate current account has been roughly in balance. As under the older system, the United States remains the <b>centre</b> <b>country,</b> pursuing a monetary-policy strategy that overlooks the exchange rate. An implication of this argument is the following asymmetry hypothesis: under both regimes the United States does not take external factors into account in conducting monetary policy while the periphery does take external factors into account. We provide results of a test of the asymmetry hypothesis. Then, we present a new method for decomposition of the business cycle using a time-varying-coefficient technique that allows us to test the relationship between the cycle and macroeconomic policies. We apply this technique to five countries for three sub-periods over the 1959 to 2007 period.

40|$|Does the <b>centre</b> <b>country</b> of the International Monetary System {{enjoy an}} 'exorbitant privilege' that {{significantly}} weakens its external constraint {{as has been}} asserted in some European quarters? Using a newly constructed dataset, we perform {{a detailed analysis of}} the historical evolution of US external assets and liabilities at market value since 1952. We find strong evidence of a sizeable excess return of gross assets over gross liabilities. Interestingly, this excess return increased {{after the collapse of the}} Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system. It is mainly due to a return discount: within each class of assets, the total return (yields and capital gains) that the US has to pay to foreigners is smaller than the total return the US gets on its foreign assets. We also find evidence of a composition effect: the US tends to borrow short and lend long. As financial globalization accelerated its pace, the US transformed itself from a World Banker into a World Venture Capitalist, investing greater amounts in high yield assets such as equity and FDI. We use these findings to cast some light on the sustainability of the current global imbalances. dollar exchange rate; financial adjustment channel; gross positions; net foreign assets; sustainability; trade adjustment channel...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{transformation}} of the Turkish religious right in its view to the major goals and orientation of Turkish foreign policy from National View parties to the Justice and Development Party. The main argument of the paper is that foreign policy vision of Turkish religious right has shifted from a substantially cultural to a pragmatist and rational one. While the National View parties were opposed to develop relations with the West and were rather in favour of integration with the Muslim countries of the Middle East, the Justice and Development Party is motivated to integrate with the West and the East {{at the same time in}} search of achieving advanced political, economic and social institutions at home and in Turkey’s neighbourhood. It is a major goal of the Justice and Development Party to ensure Turkey’s membership to the EU which was formerly identified by the National View as a union of Christian states. The Justice and Development Party is also in cooperation with the USA in its goal to institute more democratic and peaceful regimes in the Middle East. While trying to promote contemporary political institutions in the Middle East, the Justice and Development Party is also in search of greater cooperation and partnership in economic,diplomatic and cultural terms. Behind this seemingly contradictory attitude lies the belief on the part of the Justice and Development Party deputies that democracy, human rights, rule of law, good governance are indisputable ideals of 21 st century politics and that they are not in conflict with different cultural values enjoyed by the world community. The Justice and Development Party endeavours to make Turkey a <b>centre</b> <b>country,</b> a regional and global power, an advanced democracy and a respectable member of the international community...|$|E
