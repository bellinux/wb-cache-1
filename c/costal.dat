5|$|A. m. croceum: Orange dorsal {{color on}} tail {{breaking}} into patches along black body and into tiny dots on head, often absent anterior to eyes. Sides have whitish flecks. Number of <b>costal</b> grooves equals 13.|$|E
5|$|A. m. sigillatum: Wax {{yellow to}} tan dorsal stripe forming spotty to {{irregular}} shaped blotches along body ending in dots or specks of dorsal color on head. Number of vomerine teeth equals 44. Number of <b>costal</b> grooves equals 13.|$|E
5|$|The floury {{baker is}} {{distinguished}} {{from a similar}} undescribed species A. sp. nr curvicosta (the little floury baker) by {{the structure of the}} male genitalia and an audibly distinct call. Members of Aleeta and Tryella are easily distinguished from other Australian cicadas as they lack tymbal covers, while the <b>costal</b> margin of their forewings gets larger toward the point where the wing is attached to the body. In these genera it is clearly wider than the <b>costal</b> vein.|$|E
5|$|A. m. krausei: Yellow to tan dorsal stripe, {{continuous}} blotches to spots along body {{ending in}} widened blotches with spot patterns distributed on the head. White flecks {{along the sides}} and underside remaining as separate small flecks. Number of vomerine teeth equaling 32. Number of <b>costal</b> grooves equals 12.|$|E
5|$|A. m. macrodactylum: Citrine, dull citrine, to tan {{dorsal stripe}} that is diffuse and {{continuous}} along grayish body. Pattern ending in diffuse specks of stripe color or absent on head and snout. White flecks on sides sometimes {{coming together to}} form larger flecks. Number of vomerine teeth equaling 33, forming a distinguished transverse arc. Number of <b>costal</b> grooves equals 13.|$|E
5|$|The humeral {{plate is}} usually a small {{sclerite}} on the anterior margin of the wing base, movable and articulated with {{the base of the}} <b>costal</b> vein. Odonata have their humeral plate greatly enlarged, with two muscles arising from the episternum inserted into the Humeral plates and two {{from the edge of the}} epimeron inserted into the axillary plate.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{arise from}} the meso- and meta-thoracic {{segments}} and are similar in size in the basal groups. In more derived groups, the meso-thoracic wings are larger with more powerful musculature at their bases and more rigid vein structures on the <b>costal</b> edge.|$|E
5|$|The right lung {{has both}} more lobes and {{segments}} than the left. It {{is divided into}} three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower, by two fissures, one oblique and one horizontal. The upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from the middle lobe. It begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the fourth <b>costal</b> cartilage; on the mediastinal surface it may be traced backward to the hilum.|$|E
5|$|Most {{veins and}} crossveins {{occur in the}} {{anterior}} area of the remigium, {{which is responsible for}} most of the flight, powered by the thoracic muscles. The posterior portion of the remigium is sometimes called the clavus; the two other posterior fields are the anal and jugal ares. When the vannal fold has the usual position anterior to the group of anal veins, the remigium contains the <b>costal,</b> subcostal, radial, medial, cubital, and postcubital veins. In the flexed wing the remigiumturns posteriorly on the flexible basal connection of the radius with the second axillary, and the base of the mediocubital field is folded medially on the axillary region along the plica basalis (bf) between the median plates (m, m') of the wing base.|$|E
5|$|The costa (C) is {{the leading}} {{marginal}} vein on most insects, although sometimes {{there is a small}} vein above the costa called the precosta, although in almost all extant insects, the precosta is fused with the costa; The costa rarely ever branches because it is at the leading edge, which is associated at its base with the humeral plate. The trachea of the <b>costal</b> vein is perhaps a branch of the subcostal trachea. Located after the costa is the third vein, the subcosta, which branches into two separate veins: the anterior and posterior. The base of the subcosta is associated with the distal end of the neck of the first axillary (see section below). The fourth vein is the radius (R), which is branched into five separate veins. The radius is generally the strongest vein of the wing. Toward the middle of the wing, it forks into a first undivided branch (R1) and a second branch, called the radial sector (Ra), which subdivides dichotomously into four distal branches (R2, R3, R4, R5). Basally, the radius is flexibly united with the anterior end of the second axillary (2Ax).|$|E
25|$|Traube's (semilunar) {{space is}} an {{anatomic}} space of some clinical importance. It is a crescent-shaped space, encompassed by {{the lower edge}} of the left lung, the anterior border of the spleen, the left <b>costal</b> margin and the inferior margin of the left lobe of the liver. Thus, its surface markings are respectively the left sixth rib superiorly, the left mid axillary line laterally, and the left <b>costal</b> margin inferiorly.|$|E
25|$|The <b>costal</b> surface {{superior}} of the scapula is {{the origin}} of 1st digitation for the serratus anterior origin.|$|E
25|$|The manubrium joins {{with the}} body of the sternum, the clavicles and the cartilages of the first pair of ribs. The {{inferior}} border, oval and rough, is covered with a thin layer of cartilage for articulation {{with the body}}. The lateral borders are each marked above by a depression for the first <b>costal</b> cartilage, and below by a small facet, which, with a similar facet on the upper angle of the body, forms a notch for the reception of the <b>costal</b> cartilage of the second rib. Between the depression for the first <b>costal</b> cartilage and the demi-facet for the second is a narrow, curved edge, which slopes from above downward towards the middle. Also, the superior sternopericardial ligament attaches the pericardium to the posterior side of the manubrium.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: ground colour {{similar but}} of a {{slightly}} paler shade in all the specimens I have seen. Forewing: <b>costal</b> and terminal margins edged more broadly with black than in thetis, the inner margin of this colour forms a regular strongly curved arch from base of wing to tornus, not angulate at all opposite apex of wing, the edging of the <b>costal</b> margin not jagged on the inner side. Hindwing: the <b>costal</b> margin not pale but somewhat broadly dusky black; the terminal black edging broader than in thetis, not linear, produced for a very short distance up each vein. The irroration of dusky scales at the bases of both forewings and hindwings and along the dorsal area of the hindwing heavier and more broadly diffused, especially on the latter. Underside: as in the typical form. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen similar.|$|E
25|$|Several {{treatment}} initiatives, {{for example}} the McGuire programme, and the Starfish Project advocate diaphragmatic breathing (or <b>costal</b> breathing) as {{a means by which}} stuttering can be controlled.|$|E
25|$|The {{chest wall}} is elastic, {{gradually}} stiffening over age. Non-surgical treatments {{have been developed}} that aim at gradually alleviating the pectus excavatum condition, making use of the elasticity of the chest wall, including the <b>costal</b> cartilages, in particular in young cases.|$|E
25|$|B.subser. Longistyles was {{formally}} defined as containing those taxa with {{very long and}} slender styles, and with smoothly convex perianth limbs without a <b>costal</b> ridge and with thickened margins. The epithet Longistyles is from the Latin longus ("long") and stylus (style).|$|E
25|$|The {{hallmark}} of the condition is a sunken appearance of the sternum. The most common form is a cup-shaped concavity, involving {{the lower end of}} the sternum; also a broader concavity involving the upper <b>costal</b> cartilages is possible. The lower-most ribs may protrude ("flared ribs"). Pectus excavatum defects may be symmetric or asymmetric.|$|E
25|$|The humeral {{plate is}} usually a small {{sclerite}} on the anterior margin of the wing base, movable and articulated with {{the base of the}} <b>costal</b> vein. Odonata have their humeral plates greatly enlargened, with two muscles arising from the episternum inserted into the humeral plates and two {{from the edge of the}} epimeron inserted into the axillary plate.|$|E
25|$|The muscle fibres of the {{diaphragm}} emerge from many surrounding structures. At the front, fibres insert into the xiphoid process {{and along the}} <b>costal</b> margin. Laterally, muscle fibers insert into ribs 6-12. In the back, muscle fibres insert into the vertebra at T12 and two appendages, {{the right and left}} crus, descend and insert into the lumbar vertebrae at L1 & L2.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{the main}} citadel, three of Cividade de Terroso's {{outposts}} are known: Castro de Laundos (the citadel's surveillance post), Castro de Navais (away from the citadel, a fountain remains to this day), and Castro de Argivai (a Castro culture farmhouse in the <b>costal</b> plain). Cividade de Terroso is located just 6,3 km from Cividade de Bagunte {{both in the}} North bank of the Ave river.|$|E
25|$|This species resembles Papilio palinurus, but {{the male}} {{generally}} has, on the upperside {{of the outer}} half of the forewing, cottony or hairy scent-streaks {{similar to those in}} Papilio polyctor, only the streak in interspace 1 is always missing. Other differences are seen in the upper wing. The forewing has the discal transverse bluish-green band slightly sinuous, narrower, more curved than in P. palinurus and more distinctly decreasing in width towards the <b>costal</b> margin; in the female it is more sinuous than in the male. The hindwing has the transverse bluish-green band very variable in width but the inner margin is much straighter than in P. polyctor; this band that in P. polyctor stops short of vein 7, continues to the <b>costal</b> margin, it is however much and abruptly narrowed above vein 7; tornal ocellus claret-red with a large black centre inwardly edged with blue; the bright ochraceous subapical lunule of P. polyctor replaced by a dull whitish spot; the subterminal diffuse green lunules restricted to interspaces 2,3 and 4; the spatular apex of the tail with a small patch of bluish-green scales.|$|E
25|$|The {{ossification}} centers {{appear in}} the intervals between the articular depressions for the <b>costal</b> cartilages, in the following order: in the manubrium and first piece of the body, during the sixth month of fetal life; {{in the second and}} third pieces of the body, during the seventh month of fetal life; in its fourth piece, during the first year after birth; and in the xiphoid process, between the fifth and eighteenth years.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} two-lined salamander is a small salamander, {{with adults}} ranging from 65–120mm in total length. This salamander is yellow or yellowish-brown, with two black stripes running down the back which tends to break up after {{the base of the}} tail. The flanks are mottled grayish or brown. The belly is pale yellowish, nearly transparent. There are four toes on the fore feet and five toes on the hind feet. On the side of the body are 14–16 <b>costal</b> grooves.|$|E
25|$|Female: Hindwing: {{the black}} on the <b>costal</b> margin as in cerberus, {{but there is}} always a large yellow spot at base of {{interspace}} 7; interspace 1 black, with a pale patch in the middle; the black terminal border broader, the inwardly extended cone-shaped markings prominent, those in interspaces 2 and 3 with pale buff lateral edgings, extended inwards to the postdiscal spots. In both male and female the hindwing on the upperside is clothed with soft, silky, long brownish-black hairs from base along the dorsal area.|$|E
25|$|Upperside dull {{brownish}} black. Forewing: a broad outwardly oblique white transverse {{band that}} crosses {{from a little}} beyond the basal third of the <b>costal</b> margin to the dorsum, its outer half hyaline (glass like), followed by a hyaline triangular area that does not reach the costa or the termen but is traversed by conspicuously black veins. Between the semihyaline transverse band and the hyaline area the black forms {{a more or less}} even band slightly narrower in the middle; the black edging to the costa and termen broad, broadened towards the apex; cilia black.|$|E
25|$|The {{front of}} the scapula (also known as the <b>costal</b> or ventral surface) has a broad {{concavity}} called the subscapular fossa, to which the subscapularis muscle attaches. The medial two-thirds of the fossa have 3 longitudinal oblique ridges, and another thick ridge adjoins the lateral border; they run outward and upward. The ridges give attachment to the tendinous insertions, and the surfaces between them to the fleshy fibers, of the subscapularis muscle. The lateral third of the fossa is smooth and covered by the fibers of this muscle.|$|E
25|$|Male: Hindwing: {{the black}} along the dorsal and {{terminal}} margins both on upper and undersides much broader; on the upperside entirely filling interspace 1, {{on the underside}} with only a narrow streak of yellow at the angle between the median vein and vein 2; the cone-shaped black markings on the terminal margin shorter and broader; on the <b>costal</b> margin the black is narrower than in cerberus, barely extended below vein 8 except at the base and apex of the wing where it broadens; the abdomen is dull yellow above and below not shaded with black.|$|E
25|$|Female upperside tawny, veins black. Forewing: the dorsal margin broadly black; the apical area {{beyond a}} line curving from the tornus, round {{apex of the}} cell and a little beyond it, {{to the base of}} the costa also black, the wing crossed preapically by a conspicuous, broad, oblique white bar, and three sub{{terminal}} white spots. Hindwing: dorsal margin dusky; terminal broadly, <b>costal</b> margin more narrowly, black; a subterminal series of four white spots. Underside tawny, with markings similar to those in the male; the pale whitish markings more extensive; the dorsal margin broadly without striae.|$|E
25|$|Underside: fuliginous (sooty) {{brown or}} {{brownish}} black, {{more or less}} suffused with pink along the <b>costal</b> margin, on apical area and along the outer margin of the discal markings on the forewing, broadly along the dorsal and terminal margins and at base on interspaces 6 and 7 on the hindwing; markings similar to those on the upperside but less clearly defined and somewhat more grey in tint. Hindwing black, inwardly red-margined spots superposed on the pink area in interspaces 6 and 7. Cilia very narrow, pale pink. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, thorax above and the abdomen on the sides streaked with greenish grey; beneath: ochreous grey touched on the thorax with pink.|$|E
25|$|Present on the thorax {{are three}} {{contrasting}} black and grey longitudinal stripes; these stripes do not continue onto the abdomen. Sarcophaga have 4, {{rather than the}} normal 2 or 3, notopleural bristles, and 3 sternopleural bristles. A prominent row of black bristles (setae) {{can be found on}} each side of the thorax, just above the base of the hind leg and just under the base of the wing. These two sets of bristles are what differentiate Sarcophagidae from Muscidae. S. bullata lacks the postscutellum, the large swelling underneath the scutellum of the thorax, which distinguishes the flesh fly from Tachinid. S. bullata have black legs, translucent wings, and do not have a <b>costal</b> spine.|$|E
25|$|Valiants, {{which were}} {{assembled}} {{and sold in}} Mexico from 1963 through 1976, were essentially the same A-body models as their US counterparts with minor differences. The Mexican Valiant lineup included a unique 2-door hardtop produced from 1967 to 1969 called the Acapulco named after the <b>costal</b> resort city. Based on a V200 Signet, the Acapulco was only sold locally in Latin America. The most notable features included a cobra snakeskin vinyl roof and emblems of Acaplulco in the interior and on the trunk lid. Other features included bucket seats, upgraded interior and remote controlled passenger side mirrors. The car was powered by 2bbl 225 Slant-6 which was being used concurrently in the Australian market; the manual transmission was operated by a four-on-the-floor Hurst gearshift.|$|E
25|$|Most {{veins and}} cross-veins {{occur in the}} {{anterior}} area of the remigium, {{which is responsible for}} most of the flight, powered by the thoracic muscles. The posterior portion of the remigium is sometimes called the clavus; the two other posterior fields are the anal and jugal areas. When the vannal fold has the usual position anterior to the group of anal veins, the remigium contains the <b>costal,</b> subcostal, radial, medial, cubital, and postcubital veins. In the flexed wing, the remigium turns posteriorly on the flexible basal connection of the radius with the second axillary, and the base of the mediocubital field is folded medially on the axillary region along the plica basalis (bf) between the median plates (m, m') of the wing base.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: yellow, {{variable}} in tint from sulphur to rich lemon yellow according to locality {{with a light}} or heavy rainfall. Forewing: apex and termen deep black, this colour continued narrowly along the <b>costal</b> margin to base of wing, near which it often becomes diffuse; the inner margin of the black area from costa to vein 4 very oblique and irregular, between veins 2 and 4 excavate on the inner side, this excavation outwardly rounded between the veins and inwardly toothed on vein 3; below vein 2 the black area is suddenly dilated into a square spot which occupies {{the whole of the}} tornal angle; the inner margin of this dilatation is variable, in the typical form slightly concave. Hindwing: terminal margin with a narrow black band which is attenuated anteriorly and posteriorly; dorsal margin broadly paler than the ground colour.|$|E
25|$|Nasal defects {{involving}} {{either the}} bone or the cartilage of the lateral nose are best managed with free grafts of flat septal bone and of cartilage. Small defects {{of the nasal}} dorsum can be covered with cartilage grafts harvested from either the septum or the concha of the ear. The correction of large-area defects of the nasal dorsum requires the stable support of a bone graft affixed either with a lag screw or with a low-profile plate. A <b>costal</b> graft (from the rib cage) is ideal for such a repair, {{because it can be}} harvested with an attached extension of cartilage that can be sculpted to blend into the nasal tip; other potential donor sites for nasal dorsum reconstruction materials are the outer table of the skull, the iliac crest, and the inner table of the ilium proper.|$|E
25|$|Inhalation and {{exhalation}} {{are brought}} about by alternately increasing and decreasing {{the volume of the}} entire thoraco-abdominal cavity (or coelom) using both their abdominal and <b>costal</b> muscles. During inhalation the muscles attached to the vertebral ribs (Fig.17) contract angling them forwards and outwards. This pushes the sternal ribs, to which they are attached at almost right angles, downwards and forwards, taking the sternum (with its prominent keel) in the same direction (Fig.17). This increases both the vertical and transverse diameters of thoracic portion of the trunk. The forward and downward movement of, particularly, the posterior end of the sternum pulls the abdominal wall downwards, increasing the volume of that region of the trunk as well. The increase in volume of the entire trunk cavity reduces the air pressure in all the thoraco-abdominal air sacs, causing them to fill with air as described below.|$|E
