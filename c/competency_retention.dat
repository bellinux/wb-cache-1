40|$|The <b>competency</b> <b>retention</b> rate of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) among nurses was poor. The {{knowledge}} {{retention rate}} {{among those who}} have completed an ACLS course rapidly declined to 37 % at three months, and 14 % at one year. Extending the course duration did not show any improvement in the retention rate. Structured debriefing may be a possible solution, but its efficacy on knowledge retention among nurses has not been examined. The aims of this thesis are to perform linguistic and psychometric evaluation of a Chinese version of Student Satisfaction and Self-confidence (SSSC), and to assess the effects in knowledge retention of nurses in a simulation-based resuscitation training, using the Gather-Analysis- Summary (GAS) model of structured debriefing. In this thesis, the reliability and scale structure of the Chinese SSSC were assessed in 161 nurses when they attended an ACLS course. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a two-factor structure had satisfactory with χ^ 2 = 92. 12 (df = 54), RMSEA =. 07 (90 % CI =. 04 to. 09), CFI =. 98 and NNFI = 0. 96. The two factors are the satisfaction and self-confidence which had high internal reliability with Cronbach's alpha as. 95 and. 97, respectively. The Chinese SSSC is a reliable and valid tool to assess student satisfaction and self-confidence in simulation training. A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to assess the efficacy of the GAS model. The primary outcome in this study was knowledge competency. It was assessed by the written test of the American Heart Association ACLS provider course. The secondary outcomes in this study were perceived skills, and self-efficacy. They were assessed using our validated Chinese SSSC and the General Self-Efficacy scale. In the intervention arm, the instructor conducted 18 scenarios and structured debriefing using the GAS model. Each GAS model of debriefing session consisted of three phases, namely: "Gather", "Analysis", and "Summary". The debriefing session was conducted to help participants to self-reflect on the learning objectives. Each debriefing session lasted about 5 to 10 minutes. In the control arm, participants had 36 scenario as usual teaching plan instead of debriefing {{at the end of each}} scenario. A follow-up assessment were conducted at Day Two and Week 24. A total of 161 nurses were recruited in this study. They were divided into 32 groups and randomized by groups to either the intervention arm (n= 85, 15 groups) or the control arm (n= 76, 17 groups). The effects of the GAS model were examined using a linear mixed effects model to take account of the extra-covariance among participants in the same group. The test showed that the GAS model debriefing improved knowledge retention after Day Two follow-up. However, it was marginally significant (estimated coefficient= 2. 56, 95 % CI=. 17 to 4. 95, d=. 22, p=. 036). Perceived skills (estimated coefficient=. 01, 95 % CI= -. 24 to. 27, d=. 15, p=. 918), and self-efficacy (estimated coefficient= -. 01 95 % CI= - 1. 27 to 1. 24, d=. 06, p=. 984) were also not significant. After adjusting the baseline by adding three significant different baseline factor, namely: education level, rank, and prior ACLS certification, the knowledge (estimated coefficient= 1. 54, 95 % CI=- 1. 06 to 4. 16, d=. 22, p=. 242). Perceived skills (estimated coefficient=. 01, 95 % CI= -. 26 to. 28, d=. 15, p=. 967), and self-efficacy (estimated coefficient= -. 31, 95 % CI=- 1. 64 to 1. 02, d=. 06, p=. 648) were insignificant. There were 73 nurses (45. 3 %) dropped out before 24 weeks. Overall, only 22 out of the remaining 88 (25 %) nurses passed the follow-up written test. Although debriefing based on the GAS model showed a sizable effect on knowledge retention at Week 24. the improvement was not significant (estimated coefficient= 5. 01, 95 % CI= - 1. 02 to 11. 04, d=. 17, p=. 101). The effects of debriefing on perceived skills (estimated coefficient=. 09, 95 % CI= -. 89 to 2. 7, d=. 22, p=. 317), and self-efficacy (estimated coefficient=. 51, 95 % CI= - 2. 19 to 3. 2, d=. 12, p=. 707) were also not significant. After the baseline adjustment, the debriefing effects on knowledge (estimated coefficient= 2. 15, 95 % CI= - 4. 26 to 8. 56, d=. 17, p=. 503), perceived skills (estimated coefficient=. 92, 95 % CI= -. 98 to 2. 82, d=. 22, p=. 336), and self-efficacy (estimated coefficient= -. 11, 95 % CI= - 3. 02 to 2. 79, d=. 12, p=. 938) remained insignificant. This is the first RCT to assess the effect of structured debriefing in ACLS simulation. The study showed that the GAS model of structured debriefing has potential effect on knowledge retention after 24 weeks. However, further larger-scale studies with stronger incentives are needed. published_or_final_versionNursing StudiesDoctoralDoctor of Nursin...|$|E

40|$|Positive youth {{development}} outcomes {{are influenced by}} a competent, highly trained work force that enjoys their work with young people. The youth work field has struggled with how to keep and motivate front line youth workers given the heavy workloads, low pay, lack of recognition and irregular time demands to compete with family responsibilities. Professional development is a key strategy for retaining and motivating youth workers. A model of professional development called the Western 4 -H Institute has been developed and held now for two sessions. Results from participants indicate that this strategy can have {{a positive influence on}} job satisfaction, <b>competencies,</b> and <b>retention.</b> In fact, only 10 percent of participants had left during the intervening 5 years, and job satisfaction had increased significantly over time. Organizational loyalty among participants is not high, but with early career professionals, they may still be trying to find their niche. A regional training model has shown itself to be effective in supporting 4 -H youth professionals and is building a sustainable workforce for the future...|$|R
30|$|Table  2 {{demonstrates}} that SCS retention over 8  months was variable for different <b>competencies.</b> This <b>retention</b> of confidence {{is likely to}} be related to the trainees’ actual surgical experiences over the 8 -month interim. For example, trainees were almost as confident at the start of day 2 as the end of day 1 for procedures that were simple and likely to be a common part of supervised clinical training, such as sterilisation and opening and closing the abdomen. The greatest reduction in SCS between the two training days was for hysterectomy. This {{is likely to be}} because hysterectomy is more complex to undertake and trainees have less opportunities for supervised clinical training. Table  3 shows that despite some loss of confidence for some of the surgical competencies, trainees were universally more confident at the start of day 2 than day 1. This would suggest that the intervention of cadaveric simulation combined with supervised clinical training is an effective approach to teaching surgical procedures. Simulation training is an important adjunct rather than an alternative to clinical experience [24] but is likely to be of greatest value when simulation is timed to clinical exposure.|$|R
40|$|M. B. A. This {{dissertation}} {{evaluates the}} aim: Organisations engaged in transformation need to connect competency with their change framework {{and that this}} influences {{the quality of the}} contribution made towards competitive advantage Companies who use change methodologies actually cultivate their distinct capabilities / competencies through these initiatives and if 3 m are these similar to actual theories documented and if no how can this be incorporated into a model. This dissertation places the research into context by focusing on the identification of past theory, methodology and examples and by comparing this to three chosen companies to establish its credibility and usefulness. Primary data for the comparison was obtained through separate case study interviews. This data surrounded areas such as — core <b>competency</b> development, <b>retention</b> and acquisition and its association with competitive advantage, the basic understanding of the change initiative, method used and finally the actual change process employed. An extensive literature research was conducted to review current global thinking and knowledge on change, distinct capabilities and competencies. It was concluded that although the companies reviewed did change well only one of the three linked competence through its change processes. The other developed its capabilities through a variety of change programmes (in this case intentional), it could therefore qualify that it had in fact used change to develop a competence, and that therefore a model such as the one formulated has a basis for developmen...|$|R
40|$|Background: Effective {{teamwork}} {{and communication}} among healthcare professionals {{are essential to}} ensure quality patient care and safety. The use of high-fidelity human patient simulation scenarios enhances learning and {{has been used in}} various health professions education. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy and retention of teaching team-based competencies to interprofessional student teams using high-fidelity simulation. Methods: Quasi-experimental, pre/post-test design was used. The study was a teaching intervention using high-fidelity human patient simulation with crisis resource management techniques to teach team based competencies. A convenience sample of students from medicine, nurse anesthesia, undergraduate nursing, and physical therapy participated. There were pre/post data collected for fall and spring simulations from both participants and observers. Key variables were the various teamwork competencies. Participants and trained observers rated teamwork behaviors, each using two measures. Mean scores on participant and observer rated tools were compared using paired samples t -tests. Results: A total of 35 students underwent training in the fall of 2009 and 25 of the students returned in the spring of 2010 for repeat training. Participant paired samples t -tests showed a significant increase from simulation scenario one to two (p Conclusions: High-fidelity simulation appears to improve both perceived and actual team-based <b>competencies</b> with <b>retention</b> over time. Findings support the benefit to students of repeat training in a six month period and provide some validation for faculty time and effort in repeated simulations...|$|R
40|$|In a 4 -year {{longitudinal}} study, {{the authors}} investigated effects of retention {{in first grade}} on children’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors; social acceptance; and behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement. From a large multiethnic sample (n = 784) of children below the median on literacy at school entrance, 124 retained children were matched with 251 promoted children {{on the basis of}} propensity scores (probability of being retained in first grade estimated from 72 baseline variables). Relative to promoted children, retained children were found to benefit from retention in both the short and longer terms with respect to decreased teacher-rated hyperactivity, decreased peer-rated sadness and withdrawal, and increased teacher-rated behavioral engagement. Retained children had a short-term increase in mean peer-rated liking and school belongingness relative to promoted children, but this advantage showed a substantial decrease in the longer term. Retention had a positive short-term effect on children’s perceived school belonging and a positive longer term effect on perceived academic self-efficacy. Retention may bestow advantages in the short-term, but longer term detrimental effects on social acceptance may lead to the documented longer term negative effects of retention. Keywords grade retention; growth curve model; propensity score; optimal matching; psychosocial outcomes For at least the past 4 decades, grade retention, the practice of having a student who has been in a given grade level for a full school year to remain at that level for a subsequent school year, has been a common but controversial educational practice (Holmes, 1989; Jackson, 1975; Lorence, 2006).

40|$|Background: The new {{graduate}} {{transition to}} practice process affects <b>retention,</b> <b>competency</b> development, healthcare costs, quality, and assimilation into the profession. During the transition, new graduate nurses compare {{the way they}} have conceptualized nursing to what they actually experience in practice. If the observed reality is not congruent with their ideal perception, role conflict and a compromised socialization may occur. Residency programs have been instituted at some healthcare facilities to promote a positive organizational socialization process. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the differences in role conception of new graduates. The relationship of role conception and various anticipatory socialization variables such as age, gender, type of education and previous healthcare experience are examined. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of an existing national database of new graduate nurses who completed a residency program during the years 2011 - 2013. Results: New graduate nurses were found to have high role conception in professional, competence and service scenarios. There was no relationship between role conception and age, gender, educational level or previous healthcare experience. Role conception did not significantly impact job satisfaction. Conclusion: Adequate role socialization will aid in the new graduate nurse's assimilation into the role of the professional nurse. Continued study on role conception in new graduate nurses is warranted...|$|R
40|$|The Foundation Coalition (FC), one {{of eight}} {{engineering}} coalitions funded by the National Science Foundation, was established {{as an agent of}} systemic renewal for the engineering educational community. Arizona State University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University, University of Alabama, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and University of Wisconsin are the partner institutions that have focused on major curricular restructuring {{in the first two years}} of the engineering curriculum with downstream changes motivated by this restructuring. Restructuring has been guided by seven ideas that are informed by a number of theories about learning and change (for example, social learning theory and constructivist learning theory). The seven ideas, referred to as FC core competencies, are (1) active/cooperative learning, (2) student teams in engineering, (3) curriculum integration, (4) technologyenabled learning, (5) increasing participation of women and underrepresented minorities in engineering, (6) individual and organizational change, and (7) continuous improvement through assessment, evaluation, and feedback. The fundamental proposition on which the FC was created is that engineering curricula restructured to be consonant with the core <b>competencies</b> would improve <b>retention</b> and graduation rates, especially for women and underrepresented minorities, and improve the quality of engineering graduates, as defined by the characteristics preferred by employers of these graduates. The paper presents data-based narratives that help explore the extent to which the proposition has been demonstrated...|$|R
