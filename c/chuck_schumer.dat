25|$|On August 31, 1991, {{the beach}} was closed again due to the {{presence}} of medical waste, with over 500 items found including needles and medicine vials of the painkiller Nubain. The beach was closed for a single day. Due in part to the reoccurrence of waste on the beach, the park saw declining patronage that year. During that year, a $20 million rehabilitation of the bathhouse began, which included the removal of asbestos. The project, however, was not completed, and the bathhouse remained closed and decaying. In 1999, $450,000 from the federal government was earmarked for the rehabilitation of Riis Park, projected to be complete by 2004. By 2001, $4.1 million in additional funds were secured by then-Senators Hillary Clinton and <b>Chuck</b> <b>Schumer</b> and then Congressman Anthony Weiner, particularly targeted at the bathhouse. One of the early plans for the project was to construct a pool with the $4 million, as hinted in a press release from Senator Schumer, possibly located in the bathhouse. The National Park Service planned to use the money for general renovations. After a preliminary study, the pool plan was cancelled as the pool would lead to a financial deficit. Through 2005, numerous improvements were performed on the bathhouse, with plans to repave the central courtyard. By July 2006, however, the repairs had not been finished.|$|E
