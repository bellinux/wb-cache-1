Finally, the effect of uptick constraints {{on the relationship between}} the short and put <b>call</b> <b>ratios</b> is studied through the use of impulse response functions. Both the general and alternative uptick rules are found to decrease informational efficiency in hypothetical financial markets, have no statistically significant positive effects on key financial market metrics, and the change in sign from negative to positive in the response of the put <b>call</b> <b>ratio</b> to a positive shock in the short ratio may be seen as evidence of the use of the options market to avoid short-sale constraints. ...|$|R

30|$|Power traffic sharing (PTS). A PTS {{controller}} tunes cell {{transmit power}} on a per-cell basis {{to balance the}} <b>call</b> blocking <b>ratio</b> of a source cell against the average <b>call</b> blocking <b>ratio</b> of its neighbors. Cells start at their maximum transmit power and decrease (increase) their power if their <b>call</b> blocking <b>ratio</b> is larger (smaller) than that of their neighbors. Transmit power {{is limited to the}} maximum default value. For simplicity, no synchronization between neighbors is considered and, consequently, cell overlapping can be affected. Likewise, it is assumed that both data and pilot power are jointly tuned. Thus, traffic steering is effective not only for connected users, but also for idle users (i.e., it has an impact on both CR and HO processes).|$|R

One {{is based on}} the number of calls, which are accepted or not, the other {{is based on the}} interference level. The proposed CAC can regulate the call attempts with packet by adopting measured interference used for matrix. A function, specifically a linear interpolation function based on Inverse Transform theory is used to convert controlled predictive average admission <b>ratio</b> in a <b>call</b> rejection <b>ratio.</b> Then, a <b>call</b> admission <b>ratio</b> is obtained from the <b>call</b> rejection <b>ratio.</b> Numerical results show that the proposed scheme yields better performance than the conventional scheme does under the heavy calls on a hot-spot cell...|$|R
