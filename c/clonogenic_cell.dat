There is a log linear relationship between <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cell</b> survival and duration of adriamycin exposure in monolayers, and biphasic curve with a lesser degree of cell kill for disaggregated spheroid cells. Using fluorescent microscopy we have demonstrated, qualitatively, that the more lipophilic analogue partitions into the spheroid more rapidly and to a greater degree than adriamycin.

An [131 I]-labeled benzamide- [131 I]MIP- 1145 - selectively targets melanin, reduces melanoma tumor burden and increases survival in preclinical models. Our purpose was to determine the potential of radiosensitizers to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of [131 I]MIP- 1145. Melanotic (A 2058) and amelanotic (A 375 and SK-N-BE(2 c)) cells were treated with [131 I]MIP- 1145 as a single agent or in combination with drugs with radiosenitizing potential. Cellular uptake of [131 I]MIP- 1145 and toxicity were assessed in monolayer culture. The interaction between radiosensitizers and [131 I]MIP- 1145 was evaluated by combination index analysis in monolayer cultures and by delayed growth of multicellular tumor spheroids. [131 I]MIP- 1145 was taken up by and was toxic to melanotic cells but not amelanotic cells. Combination treatments comprising [131 I]MIP- 1145 with the topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan or the PARP- 1 inhibitor AG 014699 resulted in synergistic <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cell</b> kill and enhanced delay of the growth of spheroids derived from melanotic melanoma cells.

The number of micronuclei did not rank the cell lines {{in the same order}} of radiosensitivity as <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cell</b> survival, which showed a surviving fraction at 2 Gy of 0. 38 ± 0. 02 for JR 8, 0. 34 ± 0. 05 for M 14 and 0. 22 ± 0. 007 for A 2780.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{simultaneous}} whole-body heat (45 min 41 degrees C) on cyclophosphamide (CTX) and BCNU toxicity to normal mouse marrow stem cells {{and to the}} RIF- 1 tumour in C 3 H/He mice has been studied. Marrow stem-cell survival was assayed by the spleen-colony technique at both 2 and 24 h after treatment, and also by following peripheral WBC count during the weeks after treatment. Heat potentiation of CTX toxicity to marrow stem cells was similar at both times and 24 h after treatment heat was dose-modifying with a DMF of 2. 0. The heat potentiation of BCNU toxicity to stem cells was much greater at 24 h than at 2 h, and at 24 h had a DMF of 2. 1. Peripheral WBC counts supported the results from 24 h assay for both drugs. RIF- 1 tumour response was assayed by <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cell</b> survival measured 24 h after treatment, and by growth delay. For clonogenic tumour-cell survival after CTX, heated and unheated curves were parallel at doses above 75 mg/kg, yielding DMFs varying between 1. 9 and 1. 4 according to dose. DMFs for BCNU were also dose-dependent, lying between 2. 0 and 1. 6, the RIF- 1 tumour being much less sensitive to BCNU than to CTX. Growth-delay data agreed with <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cell</b> survival. Therapeutic ratios for the combination of heat with CTX or BCNU fell in the range 0. 91 [...] 0. 69, according to dose, i. e. no gain or even therapeutic loss under the conditions of this study...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Novel {{radiotherapy}} techniques increasingly use {{very large}} dose fractions. It {{has been argued}} that the biological effect of large dose fractions may differ from that of conventional fraction sizes. The purpose was to study the biological effect of large single doses. Material and Methods: <b>Clonogenic</b> <b>cell</b> survival of MCF 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells was determined after direct X-ray irradiation, irradiation of feeder cells, or transfer of conditioned medium (CM). Cell-cycle distributions and the apoptotic sub-G 1 fraction were measured by flow cytometry. Cytokines in CM were quantified by a cytokine antibody array. cH 2 AX foci were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Results: The surviving fraction of MCF 7 cells irradiated in vitro with 12 Gy showed an 8. 5 -fold decrease (95 % c. i. : 4. 4 – 16. 3; P, 0. 0001) when the density of irradiated cells was increased from 10 to 506103 cells per flask. Part of this effect was due to a dose-dependent transferrable factor as shown in CM experiments in the dose range 5 – 15 Gy. While no effect on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution was observed, and no differentially expressed cytokine could be identified, the transferable factor induced prolonged expression of cH 2 AX DNA repair foci at 1 – 12 h. Conclusions: A dose-dependent non-targeted effect on <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cell</b> survival was found in the dose range 5 – 15 Gy. The dependence of SF on cell numbers at high doses would represent a ‘‘cohort effect’ ’ in vivo. These results support the hypothesis that non-targeted effects may contribute to the efficacy of very large dose fractions in radiotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Hypoxia is {{well known}} to limit curability of tumors by {{ionizing}} radiation. Here, we show that hypoxia treatment of tumor cells causes coexpression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) and phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface. Colocalization of Hsp 70 and PS, as determined by confocal microscopy, also occurs when exogenous FITC-labeled Hsp 70 protein is added to normoxic and hypoxic tumor cells. Moreover, the interaction of Hsp 70 with PS was demonstrated in artificial unilamellar phosphatidylcholine/ phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) liposomes at the physiological ratio of 8 / 2. Indeed, the Hsp 70 -liposome interaction gradually increased with elevating PS molar ratios (8 / 2 ≥ 7 / 3 < 5 / 5 < 4 / 6 < 3 / 7 < 2 / 8). In contrast, only a weak Hsp 70 interaction was detected in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol (PC/PG) liposomes, thus demonstrating that the interaction was not a charge-related effect. The interaction of Hsp 70 with surface PS significantly reduces <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cell</b> survival in normoxic (EC 50 of Hsp 70 = 85 μg/ml) and hypoxic (EC 50 of Hsp 70 = 55 μg/ml) tumor cells. The radiation-induced tumor cell killing was significantly enhanced {{by the addition of}} Hsp 70 protein (50 μg/ml). Since apoptosis was not significantly enhanced in normoxic and hypoxic tumor cells by the addition of Hsp 70, we hypothesize that the Hsp 70 protein-induced reduction in <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cell</b> survival might be through necrosis rather than apoptosis. —Schilling, D., Gehrmann, M., Steinem, C., De Maio, A., Pockley, A.

40|$|Chronic {{myelogenous leukemia}} (CML) is a lethal {{malignancy}} {{of the human}} hematopoietic stem cell. Here we report that coexistent benign, primitive hematopoietic progenitors can be distinguished from their malignant counterparts in CML bone marrow by differences in cell surface antigen expression. Selection of bone marrow cells expressing the CD 34 antigen but lacking the HLA-DR antigen results in recovery of small lymphocyte-like blasts, which initiate and sustain production of myeloid clonogenic progeny in vitro. Secondary <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cells</b> derived at week 1, 5, and 8 from long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs) initiated with primitive progenitors, which lack HLA-DR antigens, exhibit neither the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph 1) nor the corresponding bcr/abl mRNA characteristic of CML. In contrast, <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cells</b> recovered at week 1, 5, and 8 from LTBMCs initiated with the CML HLA-DR+ population contain Ph 1 and express bcr/abl mRNA. This observation indicates {{that it may be}} possible to select a population of viable, exclusively benign hematopoietic stem cells from CML bone marrow capable of repopulating the hematopoietic compartment following autologous bone marrow transplantation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A rapid assay {{has been}} {{developed}} for the quantitation of colonies arising from surviving <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cells</b> in pig epidermis after irradiation. The number of surviving <b>clonogenic</b> <b>cells</b> per unit area {{was related to the}} epidermal in vivo response of moist desquamation. After irradiation with single doses, ranging from 20 to 36 Gy, skin biopsies were taken and incubated in dispase for enzymatic separation of the epidermis and dermis. Full thickness epidermal sheets were labelled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in vitro. Proliferating cells were visualized using standard immunohistochemical procedures. Cell groups containing > or = 16 cells were counted as colonies. These colonies were first seen on day 14 / 15 after irradiation. The number of colonies per cm 2, as a function of skin surface dose, yielded a cell survival curve with a D 0 (+/- SE) of 3. 87 +/- 0. 57 Gy. The ED 50 for the epidermal in vivo reaction of moist desquamation corresponded with a colony density of 2. 7 colonies per cm 2. After higher doses, abundant smaller colonies of 4 - 8 BrdU-positive cells were seen and these were more radioresistant, as represented by higher D 0 values...|$|R
