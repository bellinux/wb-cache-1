Reich argued that <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E

Series creator Chris Carter decided to make use of this rig during the fourth season. When <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> the episode, the desire to add to Fox Mulder's emotional involvement by having someone he knew on board led to the writers bringing back the character of Max Fenig to be that person.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 onwards, Britain {{conducted}} {{a number of}} studies into the properties and use of variable geometry wings. The noted British engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis began exploring the concept during the Second World War and became an early pioneer and advocate for the variable geometry wing, <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> an aircraft consideration that lacked conventional features such as a vertical stabiliser and rudder, instead using variable geometry wings to provide primary controllability in their place. In 1946, Wallis published a paper upon this research, which was quickly hailed as being a major scientific breakthrough in the aviation industry. Wallis proceeded to advocate for the production of an aircraft, military or civil, that would take advantage of a variable geometry wing. The Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Defence arranged for a series of tests to demonstrate the application of the technology to projectiles, both for research purposes and a potential form of anti-aircraft defence; while Wallis worked upon this research programme, he continued to promote the concept of a manned variable geometry aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Another {{argument}} for the substance theory is the argument from conception. The argument claims {{that in order to}} <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> an object's properties, like the redness of an apple, one must <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> the object that has those properties. According to the argument, one cannot <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> redness, or any other property, distinct from the substance that has that property.|$|R

5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. <b>Conceiving</b> <b>of</b> reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E

25|$|For {{the most}} part, the Reformed {{tradition}} did not modify the medieval {{consensus on the}} doctrine of God.

25|$|However, Antonescu's {{non-compliance}} {{with the}} terms of Wilson's ultimatum also had drastic effects on Romania's ability to exit the war. By then, Antonescu was <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> a separate peace with the Western Allies, while maintaining contacts with the Soviets. In parallel, the mainstream opposition movement came to establish contacts with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), which, although minor numerically, gained importance for being the only political group to be favored by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. On the PCR side, the discussions involved Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu and later Emil Bodnăraș. Another participating group at this stage was the old Romanian Social Democratic Party.|$|E

Flondor, who regretted his earlier vote for unconditional union, threatened to call in international arbiters, and demanded that Romania cease its occupation of the West Ukrainian People's Republic.

25|$|The {{overture}} in {{the score}} {{had been written}} before Eisler was offered work on the film. It had been written for Johannes R. Becher's play Winterschlacht (Winter Battle) which had its premiere on 12 January 1955. Eisler's inspiration for this piece was Horatio's monologue from Hamlet which Eisler had read in Karl Kraus' Weltgericht. Eisler later reworked the overture into his song Monolog Horatio's (Hamlet). Eisler considered the possibility of <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> his music to Night and Fog as a separate orchestral work, although this never came to fruition. He reused portions of the music for his incidental music to The Days of the Commune (Die Tage der Commune) and William Tell (Wilhelm Tell).|$|E

However, Goodrick-Clarke noted that the group's [...] "ideas and rituals" [...] draw upon [...] "a native tradition", with references to the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon concept of wyrd, an emphasis on ceremonies performed at equinoxes, {{and the construction of}} incense using indigenous trees, thus suggesting the idea of [...] "rootedness in English nature".

One verse of the poem called for [...] "spill their bloods until they all die", another called for [...] "remov them from every sensitive position". Khalaf said the poem was [...] "part of the tribal-cum-ethnic-cum-political mobilization and counter mobilization". According to Michael Field, Khalid [...] "as reputation for being very hard on the Shias". Freedom House mentioned that the Khawalid brothers [...] "espouse a decidedly anti-Shiite agenda, <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> the community as a veritable fifth column to be dealt with in the framework of security, rather than through political bargaining". The sectarian violence and rise of Shia powers in Iraq have only strengthened this belief. This view of Shia as a security problem led the Khawalid brothers to consider any economic and political reforms as invalid. Instead they thought that these reforms would only lead the Shia to demand even more.|$|E
500|$|One {{way that}} {{writers such as}} Wollstonecraft helped to shape the new genre of children's {{literature}} {{at the end of}} the 18th century was by attempting to remove its chapbook and fairy tale associations and replace them with a middle-class ideology. Many of these writers considered chapbooks and fairy tales to be associated with the poor and the rich, respectively. As Kelly explains, [...] "traditional chapbook literature embodies a lottery mentality of carpe diem, belief in fortune, wish for lucky gifts (such as great strength, cleverness or beauty), a view of time as cyclical or repetitive and an avid interest in predicting the future." [...] In contrast, 18th-century children's literature [...] "embodies an investment mentality. This meant saving for the future, ‘proper’ distribution of personal resources, avoiding extravagance, <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> time and one’s own life as cumulative and progressive, and valuing self-discipline and personal development for a better future under one’s own control." [...] Sarah Trimmer, for example, contends in her Guardian of Education, the first successful periodical dedicated to reviewing children’s books, that children should not read fairy tales precisely because they will lead to slothfulness and superstition.|$|E
500|$|The {{international}} use of Greek was {{one factor}} enabling {{the spread of}} Christianity, as indicated for example {{by the use of}} Greek for the Epistles of Paul. Constantine, the first emperor to convert to Christianity, presumably knew some Greek, but Latin was spoken in his court, and he used an interpreter to address Greek-speaking bishops at the Council of Nicaea. In the Christian Latin West, Greek became associated with [...] "paganism" [...] and regarded as a foreign language (lingua peregrina). Saint Augustine confessed that he loathed Greek and found it hard to learn. By late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> oneself as a [...] "Hellene" [...] in matters of religion and culture. In {{the first half of the}} 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated, and the Acta Conciliorum ("Acts of the Church Councils") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into Latin, Syriac, or Coptic. During this period, Latin played only a subordinate role in the ecumenical councils, as did representatives from the Western empire. Although traditionally Armenian is regarded as having been established as a Christian language by this time, it does not appear in the Acta. There are hints that Coptic might be spoken at the councils, but no secure record. On-the-spot translation into Greek was available for the participant who used his own language, including some who are referred to as [...] "Arabs", [...] "Saracens" [...] or [...] "Ishmaelites". Christian content has been found in a few Arabic inscriptions from the 6th century.|$|E

500|$|During the 90s, new manga author Masashi Kishimoto {{sought to}} write a {{one-shot}} chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version {{never made it to}} print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump magazine based on the idea. For the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto [...] "simple and stupid", Kishimoto avoided modeling him after anyone in particular, instead <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> him as naïve with a dark side resulting from his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto said makes this character unique. By and large, Naruto's personality is childish; the creator tried to convey this trait in his illustrations. Kishimoto notes as an example of this the cover of volume 10, where Kishimoto depicts Naruto mimicking a turtle as a child might do. Naruto was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on making Naruto's facial expressions consistent in difficult situations. He commented: [...] "It's rather awkward to talk about what makes Naruto appealing to audiences, but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal." [...] He believed it was Naruto's losses that made readers identify with him, although he wanted Naruto not to feel defeat again, which was his primary aim when writing the series. Kishimoto has said that Naruto's burning desire to be a ninja was based on his own ambition to succeed as a manga artist.|$|E
