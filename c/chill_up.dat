500|$|Portrait of Ruin has {{met with}} overall {{positive}} reviews and received various awards. Game Informer awarded it [...] "Handheld Game of the Month" [...] for January 2007, and listed {{it as one of}} the [...] "Top 50 Games of 2006". Portrait of Ruin also won [...] "Best Original Score" [...] and was runner-up for [...] "Best Adventure Game" [...] in IGN's Best of 2006. Dracula was listed as [...] the third top villain of 2006 by Game Informer, citing the final boss fight in Portrait of Ruin as the reason. 1UP.com listed it as the [...] "Best DS Game" [...] in their [...] "Best of E3 2006" [...] feature. The audio was well received. GameSpot called the music [...] "excellent" [...] and rated the sound a 9 out of 10. Yahoo! Games rated the sound a 4.5 out of 5. Game Informer called the audio a high point of the game, though complained about Charlotte always shouting the name of her attack. Game Informer also praised the cooperative element and felt that more games should be designed like it. IGN stated that [...] "the dramatic score is enough to send a <b>chill</b> <b>up</b> your spine", though mentioned that amount of vocals was sparse. GameZone ranked it as the ninth best Castlevania game. Robert Workman (an editor for GameZone) complimented it for its changes to the series that came without a sacrifice to quality.|$|E

[...] "Jones," [...] he said excitedly, [...] "this way--there's the signal again." [...] We dashed in haste for the mouth of the third ravine, and came suddenly upon Jones, kneeling under a pinyon tree. [...] "Boys, look!" [...] he exclaimed, as he pointed to the ground. There, clearly defined in the dust, was a cat track as big as my spread hand, and the mere sight of it sent a <b>chill</b> <b>up</b> my spine. [...] "There's a lion track for you; made by a female, a two-year-old; but can't say if she passed here last night. Don won't take the trail. Try Moze." ...|$|E

5000|$|With {{regard to}} Draiman being the singer for the band, Donegan said, [...] "After {{a minute or}} two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge...I'm playing my guitar and I'm {{grinning}} from ear to ear, trying not {{to give it away}} that I like this guy, you know, because I don't want to, you know...say 'Yeah, we'll give you a call back. We'll, you know, discuss it.' But I was so psyched. <b>Chill</b> <b>up</b> my spine. I'm like, 'There is something here.'" [...] As drummer Mike Wengren commented, [...] "We clicked right off the bat." [...] Draiman then joined the band in 1996 and the band was renamed Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band [...] "Disturbed," [...] Draiman said, [...] "It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense." ...|$|E

[...] —Screenwriter Richard D'Ovidio on the radio segment that led him to write the screenplay for The Call Screenwriter Richard D'Ovidio was inspired to script the story after his wife heard an NPR segment with a 9-1-1 operator discussing her job. He began to research the subject and visited the Los Angeles Metropolitan Communications Dispatch Center (MCDC). Finding the center, which has backup generators, bulletproof windows, and a moat surrounding the building, to be [...] "pretty amazing," [...] he decided to shed light on what he viewed as a previously overlooked occupation. The story was originally conceptualized as a television series entitled The Hive (a reference to the constant calls and conversations sounding like bees buzzing), but D'Ovidio decided to redraft it as a film on realizing that [...] "the operators couldn't be the ones kicking in doors and going out into the field" [...] all the time. As a result, what was planned to be the pilot episode was expanded and revised as a movie.|$|E

40|$|Before subsiding in the 1960 s, lynching at {{the hands}} of White people in the United States would claim the lives of several thou-sand African Americans. Two early 21 st-century {{publications}} compel us to revisit this form of collective murder and ponder its significance for the sociological and moral understanding of racial violence. The first of these publications is a disturbing collection of lynching photographs titled Without Sanctuary. The effect of Allen and associates’documentary is visceral. I dare say that most Amer-icans have never confronted violence this graphic—strippings, beatings, and burnings; limp, contorted, and desecrated bodies hanging from telegraph and telephone poles, barn rafters, bridges, and makeshift gallows or tied to trees in bunches. But perhaps more disturbing than the physical condition of the dead is the counte-nance on the perpetrators ’ faces. Their collective visage is haunt-ing. The manner in which White men, women, and children went about killing Blacks, expressed variably as dispassion and contu-macy, but never as horror, sends a <b>chill</b> <b>up</b> the spine of the observer. The second publication, Philip Dray’s At the Hands of Persons Unknown, is a comprehensive accounting of the history of lynchin...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve our}} {{understanding}} of the mechanism of chilling injury in chill-sensitive callus (Cornus stolontfera), early changes in cell permeability and respiratory activity were studied. Partial leakage of amino acids and an abrupt increase in permeation and oxidation of added dopamine were characteristic of chilled callus in the late stage of chilling at 0 °C (48 hr), when most of the callus sustained severe injury. However, little or no change in cell permeability was observed in the early stage of chilling (within 24 hr), when calli retained their viability for growth after transfer to a warm temperature. These results suggest that changes in the cell membranes per se are by no means the pri-mary step in cell injury. Temporary depression of respiratory activity was detected soon after chilling for 12 hr, but activity appeared to return to the original level on further <b>chilling</b> <b>up</b> to 24 hr. An irreversible dysfunction, however, occurred in the respiratory system on prolonged <b>chilling</b> <b>up</b> to 48 hr. This implies that irreversible impairment of mitochondrial functions may not be involved in the early stage of the cell injury. A possible relationship between these observed changes and ultrastructural changes in chilled cells is discussed...|$|R

60|$|He {{stood with}} poised spear {{above his head}} waiting for the instant that would expose a {{vulnerable}} part of the ape-man's body and still not endanger one of the blacks.

50|$|During {{the filming}} of An Officer and a Gentleman, Hackford kept Lou Gossett Jr. in {{separate}} living quarters from the other actors so he could intimidate them more during his scenes as a drill instructor. Richard Gere originally balked at shooting the ending, which involves his character arriving at his lover's factory wearing his Navy dress whites and carrying her off from the factory floor. Gere thought the ending would not work {{because it was too}} sentimental, and Hackford was initially inclined to agree with Gere, until during a rehearsal when the extras playing the workers began to cheer and cry. But when Gere saw the scene later with the music underneath it at the right tempo, he said it sent <b>chills</b> <b>up</b> the back of his neck, and is now convinced Hackford made the right decision.|$|R

500|$|Chuck Taylor from Billboard also praised [...] "I'm Your Angel", a {{duet with}} R. Kelly. He wrote that [...] "this wonderfully {{restrained}} ballad delights with the most graceful vocal performances either of these artists has ever offered to radio." [...] Taylor commented, [...] "what raises the roof is the tune's elegant, epic instrumental base, which includes sweeping strings, a soulful choir, and gentle but determined percussive drive." [...] He continued, that [...] "I'm Your Angel" [...] "sells big at the bridge, where the instrumentation drops and Kelly and Dion harmonize in a gorgeous minor key – it truly makes the song."

This is one of them." [...] Brett Berliner from Stylus Magazine was particularly favorable of the song's use of a siren, as he called the concept [...] "truly incredible, {{and one of the}} best ideas for a song I’ve ever heard in my life." [...] Steven Potter of the Journal Sentinel called the song a [...] "testament to the lyrical skill only the best emcees possess." [...] Yahoo! Music's James Poletti felt it was [...] "some of the best hip-hop recorded" [...] in 2002. Kathryn McGuire from Rolling Stone was more critical, writing that [...] "the hyperbolic urgency of 'One Mic' feels staged." ...|$|R
