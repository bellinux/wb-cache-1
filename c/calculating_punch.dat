The earliest of these <b>calculating</b> <b>punches</b> were electromechanical. Later models employed vacuum tube logic.

40|$|When is <b>calculated</b> the <b>punching</b> {{force is}} {{taken into account}} only the length of contour and not its form. In this case, the {{pressing}} force for the contours with the same length, but with different geometries (circle, square, hexagon, triangle and shearing) may have different values. To demonstrate this hypothesis were made experimental tests which demonstrated this supposition. Also, this hypothesis was verified using the finite element analysis (FEA) {{in order to show}} the possible differences and to view the material behaviour during <b>punching</b> process. The <b>calculated</b> <b>punching</b> force, the experimental obtained punching force and the force determined using FEA were centralized into a table and were made graphics that show the variation of punch force according with the geometry of punched contour. The analysed materials are AISI 304, DC 01, Al 99. 8 and Brass. The software used to make the finite element analysis is Deform 3 D version 6. 1 (service pack 2) ...|$|R
50|$|The 650 was a two-address, bi-quinary coded decimal {{computer}} (both {{data and}} addresses were decimal), with memory on a rotating magnetic drum.

The 650 was marketed to business, scientific and engineering users as well as to users of punched card machines who were upgrading from <b>calculating</b> <b>punches,</b> such as the IBM 604, to computers. Because of its relatively low cost and ease of programming, the 650 was used to pioneer a wide variety of applications, from modeling submarine crew performance to teaching high school and college students computer programming.|$|R
50|$|From the IBM Archives http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000011.html:The IBM Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator was {{announced}} in May 1949 as a versatile general purpose computer designed to perform any predetermined sequence of arithmetical operations coded on standard 80-column punched cards. It was also capable of selecting and following one of several sequences of instructions {{as a result of}} operations already performed, and it could store instructions for self-programmed operation. The Calculator consisted of a Type 605 Electronic <b>Calculating</b> <b>Punch</b> and a Type 412 or 418 Accounting Machine. A Type 941 Auxiliary Storage Unit was available as an optional feature. All units composing the Calculator were interconnected by flexible cables. If desired, the Type 412 or 418, with or without the Type 941, could be operated independently of the other machines. The Type 605 {{could be used as a}} <b>Calculating</b> <b>Punch</b> and the punch unit (Type 527) could be operated as an independent gang punch.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 602 <b>Calculating</b> <b>Punch,</b> {{introduced}} in 1946, was an electromechanical calculator capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The 602 was IBM's first machine that did division. (The IBM 601, {{introduced in}} 1931, only multiplied.) Like other IBM calculators, it was programmed using a control panel. Input data was read from a punched card, the {{results could be}} punched in the same card or a trailing card.|$|E
50|$|Around 1933 Eckert {{proposed}} interconnecting {{punched card}} tabulating machines from IBM located in Columbia's Rutherford Laboratory to perform more than simple statistical calculations. Eckert arranged with IBM president Thomas J. Watson for a donation of newly developed IBM 601 <b>calculating</b> <b>punch,</b> which could multiply {{instead of just}} adding and subtracting.In 1937 the facility was named the Thomas J. Watson Astronomical Computing Bureau. IBM support included customer service and hardware circuit modifications needed to tabulate numbers, create mathematical tables, add, subtract, multiply, reproduce, verify, create tables of differences, create tables of logarithms and perform Lagrangian interpolation, all to solve differential equations for astronomical applications. In January 1940, Eckert published Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation, which solved the problem of predicting the orbits of the planets, using the IBM electric tabulating machines, based on the punched card. This slim book is only 136 pages, including the index.|$|E

He asked if the SSEC could be used for calculations being done at Oak Ridge for the NEPA project to power an airplane with a nuclear reactor, but the demands for the SSEC produced a backlog. In the meanwhile, he requested that the first IBM 604 <b>calculating</b> card <b>punch</b> be delivered to Oak Ridge.

40|$|AbstractSometimes, due {{to design}} {{mistakes}} or {{a change in}} the construction function results in heavier or additional loads, a flat slab may be failed by punching shear which is considered as a brittle failure. A lot of research work has been carried with the objectives of strengthening existing flat slabs against punching shear. Nevertheless, very few experimental tests have been conducted for the investigation of the behavior of repaired flat slabs damaged due to punching shear. An experimental investigation with the objective of retrofitting flat slabs damaged due to punching shear using prestressed vertical bolts is presented in this paper. The parameters examined in this study are vertical prestressed bolts with different ratios within the slab thickness, slab thickness and central column size. Through the experimental tests the load carrying capacity, deformation characteristics and the cracking behavior have been investigated. A comparison between the behavior of retrofitted slabs and their references showed that the proposed system of repair is effective and could be used in practice. A comparison between the experimental results and <b>calculated</b> <b>punching</b> failure load based on the formulas adopted by different codes, showed a reasonable agreement...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow stress}} {{behavior}} of 10 vol. % short carbon fibers reinforced AZ 91 D composites (C-sf/AZ 91 D) were investigated by hot compression test. The results show the flow stress reach the peak value at small strain and then decrease monotonically {{until the end}} of the large strain, which exhibits an obvious dynamic strain softening. The decrease of stress level with deformation temperature increasing or strain rate decreasing can be represented by Zener-Hollomon parameter in a hyperbolic sine equation. By considering the effect of strain on material constants, a modified viscoplastic constitutive equation was established to characterize the dependence of flow stress on the deformation temperature, strain, and strain rate. The stress-strain values calculated by the constitutive equation are in consistent with the experimental results. Applying the constitutive equation, the plastic deformation of C-sf/AZ 91 D) composites during the hot compression process were analyzed by finite element simulation. The <b>calculated</b> <b>punch</b> force-stroke curves agree well with the measured ones. The results confirmed that the established constitutive equation can accurately describe the hot plastic deformation behavior of C-sf/AZ 91 D composites, and can be used for the finite element analysis on the hot forming process.

40|$|Before the European {{construction}} {{standards were}} introduced in January 2011, it was mainly the method in BBK 04 that was used for <b>calculating</b> <b>punching</b> capacity in concrete structures, and in less common cases the method in BHB. The method of BBK 04 is {{easy to use and}} have had the same structure since the first was published in 1979. The Concrete handbook method (BHB) where usually only used when a higher punching capacity was needed and the cross-sectional height where fixed, calculations using this method entails more work, but will in return usually give a higher capacity. It also allows the use of shear reinforcement to increase the cross-section capacity. The method of <b>calculating</b> <b>punching</b> shear in EC 2 differs largely from the methods of BBK 04 and BHB. The method is similar to a large extent of the so called “alternative model” to calculate the shear capacity in BBK 04. The {{purpose of this study is}} to make a comparison between the different methods, mentioned above. The study aims to find out which one of these models/methods that will provide the maximum punching capacity and utilization. The results of the study can then be used to make a quick and fairly assessment if a construction can withstand the same load situation that it was originally analyzed for when using the European construction standards. In the comparison, three different kinds of concrete qualities was used C 25 / 35 -C 45 / 55, and four different kinds of reinforcement contents ρ = 0. 02 – 0. 1 %, and a span of effective cross section heights in the range d = 0. 1 - 2 m. The study shows that for an older concrete structure dimensioned in accordance with BKR and BBK 04 it’s very likely that the utilization when recalculating it with the Eurocode will not be a problem. This seems to apply to all concrete qualities, reinforcing contents and cross-sectional heights used in this study. The method in EC 2 provides between 20 - 130 % higher punching capacities. The difference between the two methods increases with the cross-sectional height. For effective heights over 0. 2 m the punching capacity is at least 36 % greater than what is obtained with method in BBK 04. The load in EC 2 is in this case 16 - 27 % greater than the load obtained when using BKR. Even a quite significant increase of the loads could in most cases be done. When then concrete manual method (BHB) is used and the reinforcement content of the structure is above 0. 5 % that method generally achieves better capacities or at least equal capacities compared to the method in EC 2. For low cross-sectional heights, the method in EC 2 sometimes gives better values of capacity. It is unlikely that a structure that has been optimized with the help of BHB could withstand the greater loads that are achieved when using the Euro codes. This also applies to crosssections that needs shear reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental, numerical and analytical study to develop a design method to <b>calculate</b> <b>punching</b> shear resistance for a new shearhead system between tubular steel column and reinforced concrete flat slab. This shearhead system enables two of the most popular structural systems, i. e. reinforced concrete flat slab floor and steel tubular column, to be used to produce efficient structures of low cost and short construction time. This research investigates slabs without and with a service hole adjacent to the column. The new shearhead system should not only possess sufficient punching shear resistance, but should also be efficient for construction. The main methodology for this project was based on numerical finite element simulations verified by two full scale tests. These two tests were carried out in the University of Manchester's Structural Testing Laboratory. The two specimens had the same slab size, thickness and reinforcement ratio, but differed in the column shape (rectangular or circular), central reinforcement arrangement (continuous or discontinuous), shearhead position in the slab thickness and shearhead fabrication arrangement. Recorded load-deflection and load-strain relationships, crack development and critical perimeter were used for detailed validation of using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. The validated ABAQUS model was used to conduct a comprehensive parametric study to investigate the effects of a number of design parameters, including the effect of varied column size, shearhead arm length, shearhead arm cross section, shearhead arm angle, amount of flexural reinforcement, slab thickness, shearhead positions and hole positions. The main conclusion from the parametric study was that the shearhead system could be treated as an enlarged column in normal flat slab structure. The parametric study enabled pressure distribution below the shearhead arms to be approximated for checking whether the shearhead arms would be sufficient for the enlarged column assumption to be valid. The parametric study results were also used to determine the effective depth of the flat slab and critical punching shear perimeter of the slab with and without a service hole. Using the enlarged column assumption, the punching shear resistance of all structures used in the parametric study were re-calculated using Eurocode 2 (EC 2), British stand 8110 (BS 8110) and American Concrete Institute code 318 (ACI 318). Comparison of calculation results using these three design methods indicates that both EC 2 and BS 8110 predicted very close value which reached very good agreement with the ABAQUS simulation (normally within 10 %). Among these three design methods, ACI 318 was the only code that explicitly considered shearhead system. ACI 318 was not able to predict the slab critical perimeter length with good accuracy, however, its prediction of slab punching shear resistance achieved reasonably good agreement with numerical analysis results and were on the safe side. Based on these studies, a design method for <b>calculating</b> <b>punching</b> resistance of the proposed shearhead system between reinforced concrete flat slab and steel tubular column has been developed in this thesis.

40|$|Flat slabs {{are very}} popular and {{economical}} floor {{systems in the}} construction industry. These floor systems, supported directly on the columns, {{are known to be}} susceptible to punching shear {{in the vicinity of the}} slab-column connection. The punching shear provisions of AS 3600, the Australian Concrete Structures Standard, are based on empirical formulae which do not consider some of the important parameters affecting the capacity of a slab such as flexural reinforcement ratio and slab thickness size effect. In this paper, the provision of the Australian standard for punching shear with no unbalanced moment is reviewed, and an alternative method, based on mechanical model, is proposed to <b>calculate</b> <b>punching</b> shear capacity of the slabs. To evaluate provisions of AS 3600 and the proposed method, the current code's equation, and the proposed formula are used to predict the capacity of a large number of experimental tests, reported in the literature. In addition, NZS 3101 : 2006, New Zealand Standard for Concrete Structures, and Eurocode 2, European Concrete Structure Code, formulae for punching shear are used to predict the same experimental tests. It is concluded that AS 3600 - 2009 is less accurate than NZS 3101 : 2006, which considers the slab thickness size effect. Eurocode 2 is more accurate than both mentioned standards as it considers the tensile reinforcement ratio effect and the slab thickness effect. Moreover, the proposed formula predicts the capacity of slabs with a very good accuracy, and properly, considers the effect of tensile reinforcement ratio and size effect of slab.

40|$|Flat slabs {{are very}} popular and {{economical}} floor {{systems in the}} construction industry. These floor systems, supported directly on columns, {{are known to be}} susceptible to punching shear {{in the vicinity of the}} slab-column connection. The punching shear provisions of AS 3600 - 2009, the current Australian Concrete Structures Standard, for the case of concentric loading are based on empirical formulae developed in the early 1960 s and have not improved significantly since then. These provisions do not consider some of the important parameters affecting the capacity of a slab such as flexural reinforcement ratio and slab thickness size effect. AS 3600 - 2009 only recognises shearheads as an effective shear reinforcement to increase the concentric punching shear strength of slabs, and it does not cover more practical types of reinforcement such as shear studs and stirrups unlike most of European and North American codes of practice. In this thesis, the available methods for <b>calculating</b> concentric <b>punching</b> shear strength of slabs are reviewed. The analytical basis of previous work by other researchers was used to propose a formula to <b>calculate</b> the <b>punching</b> shear strength of flat plates with good accuracy for a wide range of slab thicknesses, tensile reinforcement ratios, and concrete compressive strengths. In this method, it is assumed that punching shear failure occurs due to the crushing of the critical concrete strut adjacent to the column. A large number of experimental results of slab test specimen, reported in the literature were gathered to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed formula, as well as the punching shear formulae in some of the internationally recognised standards such as AS 3600 - 2009, ACI 318 - 05, CSA A 23. 3 - 04, DIN 1045 - 1 : 2001, Eurocode 2, and NZS 3101 : 2006. The proposed formula was also extended to cover the case of prestressed flat plates with the use of the decompression method. Recent experimental results of prestressed slab test specimens, published in journal papers, were collected to assess the accuracy of the proposed formula and provisions of aforementioned standards in the prediction of the ultimate strength of prestressed flat plates. Furthermore, detailing considerations for the design of shear reinforcements such as shear studs and stirrups, which are not recognised by AS 3600 - 2009, were discussed. Different failure modes of flat plates with shear reinforcement were presented. A method to calculate the strength of the slab assuming a critical crack developing inside the shear reinforced region was proposed. This method considers the contribution of shear reinforcement intersecting with the critical crack and the uncracked concrete zone adjacent to the column. In addition, a control perimeter outside the shear reinforced zone was suggested to be used with the one-way shear formula of AS 3600 - 2009 to <b>calculate</b> the <b>punching</b> shear strength of flat plates outside their shear reinforced zone. The proposed method and provisions of ACI 318 - 05, CSA A 23. 3 - 04, and Eurocode 2 were evaluated against some of the reported experimental results on the flat plates with shear reinforcement...|$|R

To <b>calculate</b> the <b>punching</b> shear resistance the formulations of the NBR 6118 : 07, effective until April/ 2014, did not consider the compression of the concrete in the plane of the slab, due to prestressing. Just the inclined components of some tendons were considered for total load applied relief, but this fact did not generate a significant difference, compared to reinforced concrete, because the inclination angle is very close to zero. The American and European provisions consider a portion related to the compression of the concrete in the planeof the slab.

40|$|Abstract. The present {{paper is}} focused on the Finite Element {{modeling}} of the Marciniak stretch-forming test in warm condition.

Tensile tests confirmed the large influence of the strain rate on the deformation of the AZ 31, especially when the test temperature is over 200 °C. Three dimensional FE simulations were thus carried out in order to analyze the strain and strain rate evolutions during the formability test at the temperature of 200 °C. In particular, simulations were aimed at investigating the effect of the specimen’s geometry on the strain rate evolution in the central region, where failure occurs during the Marciniak stretch-forming test.

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{there is}} a need to {{determine}} the capacity of bridge decks as a large number of them were built back in the 60 ’s and 70 ’s. Since then, not only a lot of additional safety requirements have been incorporated into the modern codes but the traffic flow has also increased drastically. The current research deals with this question by taking into account arching action or compressive membrane action (CMA) in transversely prestressed decks on concrete girders. CMA is a phenomenon that occurs in deck slabs with edges restrained against lateral movement by stiff boundary elements. This restraint induces in-plane forces in the slab affecting both the flexural and the punching shear capacities. Existing methods were modified and a MATLAB program was developed to include the effect of CMA and the transverse prestressing to <b>calculate</b> the <b>punching</b> shear capacity of bridge decks.

40|$|Punching {{failure is}} one of the major {{drawbacks}} of using flat slabs in the design of reinforced concrete structures. Punching shear analysis is very complicated which appears clearly in the large variation of the equations used by the different codes in <b>calculating</b> the <b>punching</b> shear capacity. There are many factors that affect the punching shear capacity of an element. This current research aims to investigate the contribution of two of these factors which are the horizontal flexural reinforcement, and the vertical shear reinforcement in the form of stirrups. Following the experimental program conducted at the reinforced concrete laboratory of the Faculty of Engineering at Cairo University, Egypt and verification using the finite non-linear analysis software (ANSYS 15), good correlation was observed between the analytical models and their corresponding experimental data. This proves that ANSYS 15 allows for studying the punching behavior of the flat slab in more details which could not be monitored in the laboratory. As a result, a detailed parametric study as well as comparison with some design codes was conducted using thirteen full scale flat slab specimens in order to simulate real life problems. The specimens had a loaded span of 2000 mm and a total thickness of 250 mm.

40|$|AbstractReinforced {{concrete}} {{flat slab}} structures are used widely in construction projects {{due to their}} economic and functional advantages. Punching shear failure in such structures can have catastrophic effects in the case of, for example, multi-storey framed structures and the designer aims to ensure that ductile flexural deformation occurs before the brittle shear failure. Shear mechanisms generally govern the behaviour of reinforced concrete structures subjected to localised impact loads. Existing experimental results investigating punching shear in flat slabs subjected to impact loading shows that when increasing the loading rate, the punching shear strength also increases whereas the deformation capacity reduces. This behaviour {{is due to a}} combination of inertial effects and material strain-rate effects which leads to a stiffer behaviour of the slab for higher loading rates. This can also lead to a change of mode of failure from flexural to pure punching shear with increasing loading rates. Current empirical formulae for punching shear are unable to predict this behaviour since the slab deformations are not considered for <b>calculating</b> the <b>punching</b> shear strength. This paper presents an analytical model based on the Critical Shear Crack Theory which can be applied to flat slabs subjected to impact loading. This model is particularly useful for cases such as progressive collapse analysis and flat slab-column connections subjected to an impulsive axial load in the column. The novelty of the approach is that it considers (a) the dynamic punching shear capacity and (b) the dynamic shear demand, both in terms of the slab deformation (slab rotation). The model considers inertial effects and material strain-rate effects although it is shown that the former has a more significant effect. Moreover, the model allows a further physical understanding of the phenomena and it can be applied to different cases (slabs with and without transverse reinforcement) showing a good correlation with experimental data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of process {{parameters}} on the peak load and the energy absorption of the expansion of thin walled tubes using a die. The energy absorption and peak load during the expansion process were <b>calculated</b> for various <b>punch</b> angles (α) and with different expansion ratios (rp/ro) at different temperatures (T) by finite element analysis where rp is the punch outer radius and ro is the tube inner radius. The effect of these input parameters on the response parameters peak load, energy absorption and local buckling have been critically analyzed using Taguchi method. It is observed that the peak load and energy absorption of the expansion tube is influenced by expansion ratio (rp/ro), punch angle followed by tube temperature. The energy absorption of the expanded tube increases as the rp/ro ratio increases and also larger punch angle improves the energy absorption. Whereas the minimum expansion ratio (rp/ro) decreases the peak load at higher temperature and medium punch angle. The ANOVA performed on the experimental results revealed that the expansion ratio (rp/ro) {{is the most important}} process parameter that minimizes the peak load followed by punch angle and tube temperature. Also it is found that the expansion ratio improves the energy absorption. Keywords...|$|R
