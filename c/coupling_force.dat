40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{identify}} the <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> between substructures from the acceleration response of a structure under support excitation, and the local structural damage is then detected from the identified <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> based on dynamic sensitivity analysis. The identification equation of the <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> is formulated in state space, and it is solved with the damped least-squares method. The sensitivity of the <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> between the substructures {{with respect to a}} local change in the system parameter is derived analytically. In addition, a model condensation method is used {{to reduce the number of}} <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> for a more practical application. A nine-bay three-dimensional truss structure serves as an example for validating the proposed method. Numerical simulations with noisy measured accelerations show that the <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> between substructures are very sensitive to local changes in the system parameters and the proposed method can accurately detect the location and extent of structural damage resulting from an improved computational efficiency and accuracy.

Originally the actuator was intended for direct perilymph stimulation after stapedotomy using a piston prosthesis. A possible alternative application is the stimulation of middle ear structures or the round window (RW). Here the perilymph stimulation with a K-piston through a stapes footplate (SFP) fenestration (N = 10) as well as stimulation of the stapes head (SH) with a Bell prosthesis (N = 9), SFP stimulation with an Omega/Aerial prosthesis (N = 8) and reverse RW stimulation (N = 10) were performed in cadaveric human temporal bones (TBs). Codacs actuator output is expressed as equivalent sound pressure level (eq. SPL) using RW and SFP displacement responses, measured by Laser Doppler velocimetry as reference. The axial actuator <b>coupling</b> <b>force</b> in stimulation of stapes and RW was adjusted to ~ 5 mN. The Bell prosthesis and Omega/Aerial prosthesis stimulation generated similar mean eq. SPLs (Bell: 127. 5 - 141. 8 eq. dB SPL; Omega/Aerial: 123. 6 - 143. 9 eq. dB SPL), being significantly more efficient than K-piston perilymph stimulation (108. 6 - 131. 6 eq. dB SPL) and RW stimulation (108. 3 - 128. 2 eq. dB SPL). Our results demonstrate that SH, SFP and RW are adequate alternative stimulation sites for the Codacs actuator using coupling prostheses and an axial <b>coupling</b> <b>force</b> of ~ 5 mN. Based on the eq.

40|$|Introduction. Woodcutters’ working {{conditions}} are difficult {{due to the}} presence of numerous occupational hazards. Petrol –fuelled chain saws commonly used in forestry produce vibration, which may lead to the development of non-specific disorders in the upper extremities of the chain saw operator, referred to as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). The magnitude of <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> exerted on a vibrating tool handle may affect the severity of HAVS and hand-wrist cumulative trauma disorders. The aim of the presented study was to measure <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> exerted by fellers on various chain saws and to find correlation between force magnitude and type of tool used. Material and methods. <b>Coupling</b> <b>forces</b> applied by workers on different types of chain saws were measured by means of a hydro-electronic force meter. All measurements were carried out during the harvesting of wood in real work conditions. Results. Mean force applied by forestry workers on their tools was 44. 2 N. <b>Coupling</b> <b>forces</b> registered during cutting wood with small universal chain saws were larger than forces exerted on models characterized by higher power profile. Forces applied on comparable tools produced by various manufacturers also differed. Conclusions. The relationship between <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> and power of the chain saw should lead to ergonomic improvements of the tool and vibration-reducing devices. These results can also be used as a recommendation for fellers in a range of using proper machines for different types of cut or types of wood.

Result of research indicate that behavior characteristic of deformation and mode of failure at coupling beams that happened is the existence of compression area at diagonal direction coming in contact with tip of force, tension area at opposite diagonal direction which will have crack till split at diagonal area compress, and the beam will attain its maximum load carrying capacity when {{small portion of the}} concrete in the compression corners crush.
