The <b>Cross</b> <b>Site</b> <b>Scripting</b> attack is possible by inserting or changing the programming logic, changing and syntax of HTML elements by code injection attacks. The Web application is XSS Vulnerable when there is no proper input validation. The many web applications like social networking sites are the victims of this attack. This paper describes the various attack technique of <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting</b> and various mitigation involved in <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting</b> (XSS) Vulnerability. As new technology arrived, it comes with lot of new features and possibly attacks. In the today’s trends of social web application, the SQL injection, <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting</b> (XSS) attack and <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> forgery attack are major challenges for web application [...] The paper also describes various research perspective involved with <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting.</b> In the cyber world the security is now main issues for the user.

These Attacks make use of vulnerabilities in the code of web-applications, resulting in serious consequences, such as theft of cookies, passwords and other personal credentials. Cross-Site scripting (XSS) Attacks occur when accessing information in intermediate trusted sites. Client side solution acts as a web proxy to mitigate <b>Cross</b> <b>Site</b> <b>Scripting</b> Attacks which manually generated rules to mitigate <b>Cross</b> <b>Site</b> <b>Scripting</b> attempts.

This paper provides client-side solution to mitigate crosssite scripting Attacks. The existing client-side solutions degrade the performance of clientand# 039;s system resulting in a poor web surfing experience.

Very recent sql injection and <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting</b> attacks are on most famous websites such as Nokia, and Cisco caused so much of damage.

SQL Injection attack allows the attackers to fully compromise web database via web application. <b>Cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting</b> attack allows the attackers to modify the web content. All these are because of design flaws in the web applications. For identifying these attacks, we have signature based IDS/IPS etc,. Most of these are syntax based detection systems.

Everyday new vulnerabilities are found in what was previously believed to be secure applications, unlocking new risks and security hazards that can be exploited by malicious advertisers or intruders compromising the security of systems. Using <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting</b> techniques intruders can hijack web sessions and craft credible phishing sites. Similarly, intruders may harm the server by uploading malicious executables and batch files. On the other hand the java script code downloaded into browser can attack client machines to steal user’s credentials (XSS attacks) and lure users into providing sensitive information to unauthorized parties (Phishing attacks). It is proposed here a model detecting and preventing malicious files and <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting</b> attacks based on monitoring JavaScript code execution and comparing the execution to high level policies, to detect malicious code behavior. The solution also protects the servers from dangerous DOS commands and executable files. The model follows an approach similar to hackers and security analyst to discover vulnerabilities in networkconnected web servers.

40|$|Abstract. With {{the growing}} trend towards {{the use of}} web {{applications}} the danger posed by <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting</b> vulnerabilities gains severity. The most serious threats resulting from <b>cross</b> <b>site</b> <b>scripting</b> vulnerabilities are session hijacking attacks: Exploits that steal or fraudulently use the victim’s identity. In this paper we classify currently known attack methods to enable the development of countermeasures against this threat. By close examination of the resulting attack classes, we identify the web application’s characteristics which are responsible for enabling the single attack methods: The availability of session tokens via JavaScript, the pre-knowledge of the application’s URLs and the implicit trust relationship between webpages of same origin. Building on this work we introduce three novel server side techniques to prevent session hijacking attacks. Each proposed countermeasure removes one of the identified prerequisites of the attack classes. SessionSafe, {{a combination of the}} proposed methods, protects the web application by removing the fundamental requirements of session hijacking attacks, thus disabling the attacks reliably. ...|$|R

40|$|A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a {{security}} tool {{that protects the}} web application and web application server from various attacks. Application protection is a valuable security layer to add because it can protect against a number of application layer security threats which is usually not protected by a typical network layer intrusion detection system. The Web Application can easily be attacked by the hackers even though with {{the existence of the}} normal firewall in the system. This is due to the limitation that the normal firewall does not work in the application layer. The hackers will attack the Web Application using the methods like structured Query Language (SQL) Injection, <b>Cross</b> <b>Site</b> <b>Scripting</b> (XSS), Command Injection, or Session Manipulation, cookie poisoning, Directory traversal, Forceful browsing. This paper addresses these problems by presenting a methodology for the automatic detection of vulnerabilities in web application and preventing web application from various attacks.

Writing crosscutting functions in complex software should take advantage of the modularity offered by new software development approaches.

In this paper, we design a security aspect called AProSec for detecting SQL injection and <b>Cross</b> <b>Scripting</b> <b>Site</b> (XSS), that are common attacks in web servers.
