50|$|The {{tail rotor}} system rotates airfoils, small wings called blades, that vary in pitch in order to vary the amount of thrust they produce. The blades most often utilize a {{composite}} material construction, such as a core made of aluminum honeycomb or plasticized paper honeycomb, covered in a skin made of aluminum or carbon fiber <b>composite.</b> <b>Tail</b> rotor blades are made with both symmetrical and asymmetrical airfoil construction. The pitch change mechanism uses a cable control system or control tubes that run from the anti-torque pedals in the cockpit to a mechanism mounted on the tail rotor gearbox. In larger helicopters, the pitch change mechanism is augmented by a hydraulic power control servo. In {{the event of a}} hydraulic system failure, the mechanical system is still able to control the tail rotor pitch, though the control resistance felt by the pilot will be considerably greater.|$|E

The other pair were narrower, tapering from 6 ft at the heel to 5 ft at the tip. These were carried by an oak windshaft with a cast iron poll end. The sails currently on the mill span 60 ft. The windshaft is 16 ft long, and tapers from 23 in diameter at the neck to 13 in diameter at the tail. The windshaft carries a 8 ft diameter wooden Head Wheel with 108 cogs and a <b>composite</b> <b>Tail</b> Wheel, with a cast iron centre and wooden rim. The Tail Wheel has 84 cogs.

40|$|An {{assessment}} is presented of ten <b>composite</b> <b>tail</b> rotor spars and four horizontal stabilizers {{exposed to the}} effects of in-flight commercial service for up to nine years to establish realistic environmental factors for use in future designs. This evaluation is supported by test results of helicopter components and panels which have been exposed to outdoor environmental effects since 1979. Full scale static and fatigue tests were conducted on graphite/epoxy and Kevlar/epoxy composite components removed from Sikorsky Model S- 76 helicopters in commercial operations off the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. Small scale static and fatigue tests were conducted on coupons obtained from panels exposed to outdoor conditions in Stratford, CT and West Palm Beach, Florida. The panel materials and ply configurations were representative of the S- 76 components. The results are discussed of moisture analyses and strength tests on both the S- 76 components and composite panels after up to nine years of outdoor exposure. Full scale tests performed on the helicopter components did not disclose any significant reductions from the baseline strengths. The results increased confidence in the long term durability of advanced composite materials in helicopter structural applications...|$|E
40|$|GFRP and CFRP {{sandwich}} structures with honeycomb cores are high performance light weight structures for aerospace applications. Their impact sensitivity requires reliable NDT methods after fabrication and in service. Guided waves {{are able to}} propagate over large areas in components with a small attenuation and interact with defects. The DLR part of the EU-project AISHA II (Aircraft integrated structural health assessment) is focused on a full-scale test of a 3. 5 m long tail-boom of the helicopter EC 135. Especially for the complex <b>composite</b> <b>tail</b> boom with an asymmetric construction these interactions are difficult to predict and to compute. However their knowledge {{is important for the}} development of a structural health monitoring system. At DLR the non-contact ultrasonic imaging techniques are successfully used for a complementary NDT method and for the visualisation of the guided wave propagation. Experimental investigations showed that damage detection in the upper and lower skin is only possible with frequencies below 30 kHz. For S-mode excitation a special actuator based on piezocomposite transducers has been developed. This transducer is a combination of piezoceramic materials with ductile polymers and flexible electrodes to form a reliable and damage tolerant actuator. At delaminations the S-mode with a wavelength of about 160 mm is converted to an A-mode. The paper describes the possibility of a defect selective SHM system and shows the capability of impact detection...|$|E
40|$|International audienceScanning laser {{systems are}} {{a class of}} {{ultrasonic}} guided wave systems that have shown great promise for the inspection of complex structures {{because of the high}} spatial resolution of their resulting data. In this study, the focus is on applying full-field signal processing techniques to automatically detect and characterize fastener damage in aircraft components with realistic structural complexity. The particular testbed being considered is a <b>composite</b> <b>tail</b> section with several rivet lines. Artificial damage was introduced into several of the rivets with different magnitudes and orientations. While trained users of the laser scanning system can often detect the damage modes by simply viewing the resulting images, a more automated and quantifiable approach is desired to increase the consistency and quantify the confidence of the inspection system. In order to characterize the state of each rivet, a polar wavenumber processing technique is proposed. First, the full-field data is transformed to a new polar coordinate system centered on a particular rivet. A 3 D Fourier transform then transforms the data to the frequency-wavenumber domain. Finally, the data is windowed to isolate the waves propagating in the positive radial direction. Analyzing the scattering pattern from each rivet in turn provides information on the health of each rivet. Damage detection may be accomplished either by comparison of the extracted scattering pattern with a model of the expected scattering pattern, or by an absolute reference-free method comparing rivets to one another to identify outliers. The results show that there is the potential to provide quantified damage detection and characterization for fastener damage using laser-excitation guided wave inspection systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a wind tunnel test program to {{determine}} the performance loads and dynamic characteristics of the <b>Composite</b> Flexbeam <b>Tail</b> Rotor (CFTR) for the AH- 64 Advanced Attack Helicopter are reported. The CFTR uses an elastomeric shear attachment of the flexbeam to the hub to provide soft-inplane S-mode and stiff-inplane C-mode configuration. The properties of the elastomer were selected for proper frequency placement and scale damping of the inplane S-mode. Kinematic pitch-lag coupling was introduced to provide the first cyclic inplane C-mode damping at high collective pitch. The CFTR was tested in a wind tunnel over the full slideslip envelop of the AH- 64. It is found that the rotor was aeroelastically stable throughout the complete collective pitch range and up to rotor speeds of 1403 rpm. The dynamic characteristics of the rotor {{were found to be}} satisfactory at all pitch angles and rotor speeds of the tunnel tests.

40|$|The unique {{structural}} {{features of}} helicopter bearingless rotors {{call for the}} development of design and modeling methodologies for laminated composite flex-structures. Indeed, the flex-structure should be flexible enough to replace the flap, lead-lag, and feathering bearings, while maintaining high strength and stiffness in the axial direction. Laminated composite materials are a material of choice for such an application. Chordwise deformations, transitional zones between different cross sections and localized compressive stresses are all likely to be present in the flex-structure, rendering the validity of a beam model questionable. In this article a nonlinear anisotropic shallow shell model is developed that accommodates transverse shearing deformations, and arbitrarily large displacements and rotations, but strains are assumed to remain small. The displacement-based shell model has six degrees of freedom at each node and allows for an automatic compatibility of the shell and beam models. The model is validated by comparing its predictions with several benchmark problems. A four-bladed <b>composite</b> bearingless <b>tail</b> rotor system is analyzed in detail using the shell model and compared with the predictions of a beam model. Significant differences are observed between the two models, especially in the torsional behavior...|$|R

40|$|Pyrethroid {{insecticides}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely used classes of insecticides. Previous studies revealed that pyrethroids potently affect the insect voltage-gated sodium (Na 1) channel (VGSC), resulting in prolonged channel open time. However, recent findings have suggested that pyrethroids may affect targets other than the VGSC. In particular, several studies have shown that pyrethroids can modulate the activity of voltage-gated calcium (Ca 21) channels (VGCCs). However, these studies often reported conflicting results; some studies observed stimulatory effects, whereas others observed inhibitory effects of pyrethroids on VGCCs. This study investigated whether allethrin (AL), a well-characterized type I pyrethroid, altered VGCC characteristics measured by whole-cell recording in rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC 12) differentiated with nerve growth factor (NGF).

40|$|Abstract. The {{lightweight}} {{materials such as}} composites are often used for the aerospace structures. One of the uses of these materials is for the tail boom of helicopters. Tail booms are the structures connecting the tail rotor to the fuselage. It is mainly subjected to the pitching moment and torsion. Because it is long to obtain the enough distance between the tail rotor and the main rotor, the materials used for manufacturing the tail boom {{needs to be a}} lightweight material. The structural optimization of the tail boom is also necessary. In this study, two different tail booms are manufactured by using laminated <b>composites.</b> The <b>tail</b> booms considered in this study are a semi-monocoque structure consisted of skins and stiffeners. These skins and stiffeners are made of carbon/epoxy. One is produced by using 3 -ply carbon/epoxy and it is strengthened using stiffeners. The other is produced by using honeycomb between 2 -layers of carbon/epoxy. A hand lay-up technique is used for the manufacturing of the tail booms. The vacuum bagging and a moderate heat are used to cure the composite structure. The bending and bending with torsion tests are performed to determine the structural performance of the tail booms. The tail boom is also modeled using the finite element method and analyses are performed. The results are presented and discussed...|$|R
