40|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> {{have become}} one of the most {{important}} advances in the treatment of hypertension since their introduction over 20 years ago. The increase in the number of available <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> (as new formulations of preexisting drugs or new chemical entities) over recent years has contributed to an ever-changing scenario regarding their appropriate use compared with other antihypertensive agents. As a consequence of this evolving situation, several authors have proposed a 3 -generation classification of <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> currently, or soon to be, marketed in several counties. The classification system is based among other variables, on chemical structure, tissue selectivity, administration frequency and duration of action.

We {{sought to}} {{estimate}} {{the risk of death}} and recurrent myocardial infarction {{associated with the use of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> after myocardial infarction in a population-based cohort study. Background. <b>Calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> are commonly prescribed after myocardial infarction, but their long-term effects are not well established. Methods. Patients 25 to 69 years old with a suspected myocardial infarction were identified and followed up through a community-based register of myocardial infarction and cardiac death (part of the World Health Organization Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease [MONICA] Project in Newcastle, Australia). Data were collected by review of medical records, in-hospital interview and review of death certificates. Results. From 1989 to 1993, 3, 982 patients with a nonfatal suspected myocardial infarction were enrolled in the study. At hospital discharge, 1, 001 patients were treated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, 923 with <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists,</b> 711 with both beta-blockers and <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> and 1, 346 with neither drug. Compared with patients given beta-blockers, patients given <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> were more likely to suffer myocardial infarction or cardiac death (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1. 4, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 0 to 1. 9), cardiac death (RR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 2. 7) and death from all causes (RR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 2. 6). Compared with patients given neither beta-blockers nor <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists,</b> patients given <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> were not at increased risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death (RR 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 8 to 1. 3), cardiac death (RR 0. 9, 95 % CI 0. 6 to 1. 2) or death from all causes (RR 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 7 to 1. 3). No excess in risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death was observed among patients taking verapamil (RR 0. 9, 95 % CI 0. 6 to 1. 6), diltiazem (RR 1. 1, 95 % CI 0. 8 to 1. 4) or nifedipine (RR 1. 3, 95 % CI 0. 7 to 2. 2) compared with patients taking neither <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> nor beta-blockers.

5000|$|Lomerizine {{works as}} a <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonist</b> by {{blocking}} voltage-dependent calcium channels. [...] A study using 3HNitrendipine showed that lomerizine allosterically inhibits binding in calcium channels at a site different than the 1,4 dihydropyridine binding site. However, its antimigraine effects {{are believed to be}} due not to the blocking of calcium channels, but to the antagonizing effects of lomerizine on the 5HT2A receptor. The drug was shown to competitively inhibit binding of 3Hspiperone to 5-HT2A receptors, inhibiting the 5-HT driven release of Ca2+.Lomerizine treatment of 5-HT2A expressing cells led to the inhibition of Ca2+ release in response to 5-HT, while Ca2+ release in response to ATP was unaffected. By preventing the release of Ca2+, lomerizine prevents serotonin-induced contraction of the basilar artery, which can lead to migraines.|$|E

50|$|T-type calcium {{channels}} are low-voltage activated calcium channels that open during membrane depolarization. These channels aid in mediating calcium influx into cells after an action potential or depolarizing signal. The entry of calcium into various cells has many different physiological responses associated with it. Within cardiac and smooth muscle cells voltage-gated calcium channel activation initiates contraction directly {{by allowing the}} cytosolic concentration to increase. Not only are T-type calcium channels known to be present within cardiac and smooth muscle, but also are present in many neuronal cells within the central nervous system. Different experimental studies within the 1970s allowed for the distinction of T-type calcium channels (transient opening calcium channels) from the already well-known L-type calcium channels (Long-Lasting calcium channels). The new T-type channels were {{much different from the}} L-type calcium channels due to their ability to be activated by more negative membrane potentials, had small single channel conductance, and also were unresponsive to <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonist</b> drugs that were present. These distinct calcium {{channels are}} generally located within the brain, peripheral nervous system, heart, smooth muscle, bone, and endocrine system.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{therapeutics}} used clinically {{which can}} effect {{the activity of}} P-type calcium channels. However, the primary target of these therapeutics are not thought to be P-type channels. For example, calcium antagonists, which are used to treat coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, act by inhibiting L-type or T-type calcium channels. Some of these calcium antagonists include verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, nicardipine, and barnidipine. Although their main target is not P-type channels, these calcium antagonists also act to block the function of P-type channels. Moreover, flunarizine is another <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonist</b> {{which is used to}} treat migraines. Its main targets are voltage-gated calcium channels and sodium channels. Flunarizine inhibits the P-type channels that are located in the neocortical slices. It works to inhibit the inward flux of calcium. The migraines that it helps to prevent are due to mutations within the [...] "cacna1a" [...] gene of the P-type channel subunit. Also, compounds that block P-type channels are shown to help with seizures. Epileptic seizures are caused by increased neurotransmission, which is partially a result of P-type channels. Compounds such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine are known to block the P-type channels, which have helped to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Overall, there are various non-selective calcium channel blockers that help alleviate symptoms of hypertension, schizophrenia, cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, pain, asthma, bradycardia, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease. Although many of the therapeutic compounds' main target is not P-type channels, further research needs to determine if the clinical effects of these compounds are also influenced by the P-type channel blockage.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS are {{first-line}} antihypertensive agents {{but their}} effects {{in patients with}} chronic renal diseases have not been clearly defined. The available information concerning the renoprotective ef-fects of <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> is complex {{in view of the}} conflicting data coming out of various clinical trials. Based on a critical review of the available litera-ture, some conclusions are drawn here. (i) Use of <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> in hy-pertensive patients with renal disease is safe and has no deleterious effects on renal functions. (ii) <b>Calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> may be better than diuretics and β-blockers to protect renal function against hypertension. (iii) Renin-angiotensin axis-blocking agents are more effective than calcium channel blockers to reduce proteinuria and to prevent renal disease progression. (iv) The combination of <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> and renin-angiotensin axis-blocking agents may be beneficial to improve renal protective effects of ACE inhibi-tors or angiotensin receptors blockers when administered singly. (v) As sug-gested in some recent reports, the new-generation <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists,</b> which have the property of vasodilator action on both afferent and efferent glomeru-lar arterioles, may have interesting renal protective effects.

40|$|Background: According to {{published}} data, {{the ability}} to prevent various hypertension related events differs between the various anti-hypertensive drug groups. Although absolute drug effects with similar drugs also differ among the various studies, relative drug effects could be considered constant. We therefore explored the possibility of drawing statistically valid conclusions {{about the differences between}} various drug groups by doing an overview of published data. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis using a Bayesian fixed effect model in which we brought together 27 published studies. We chose to always relate the drug effects to the number of events observed with placebo drugs. We therefore obtained results both from studies reporting the effects of the newer drugs when tested against diuretics and beta-blockers, and from studies in which diuretics and beta-blockers had been tested against placebo. We constructed the posterior probability distributions of the relative effects of ACE-inhibitors versus <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> with three different endpoints: stroke, coronary disease and heart failure. We then calculated point estimates of effects with 95 % credibility intervals. As an intermediate step in this procedure we obtained similar information about the effects of the three groups of active drugs, ACE-inhibitors, <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> and diuretics or beta-blockers, tested against placebo. Findings: ACE-inhibitors and <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> have an almost identical ability to prevent stroke in hypertensive individuals with a risk ratio (RR) of 1. 04. On the other hand, <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> reduce coronary disease by only 9 % relative to placebo. When ACE-inhibitors and <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> are compared by the Bayesian method, the outcome is a 14 % difference in favour of the ACE-inhibitors to prevent coronary disease, with a credibility interval reaching identity. Nor do <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> do as well as diuretics or _-blockers in this respect, RR = 1. 11 with 95 % credibility interval 1. 01 to 1. 22. All the tested drug groups have a profound preventive effect on the occurrence of heart failure when given to hypertensive patients, showing reductions of 44 % to 56 %. When ACE-inhibitors are compared with <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> the risk ratio is 0. 79, with a credibility interval 0. 65 to 0. 95. Interpretation: The conclusion of our analysis is a statistically significant difference between ACE-inhibitors and <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> in respect of effects on coronary disease and heart failure when treating hypertensive individuals, ACE-inhibitors being more efficacious.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} 1, 4 -dihydropyridine <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> (nifedipine, nisoldipine, and lacidipine) on serotonin (5 -HT) - and KCl (120 mM) -induced contractions of rat isolated septal coronary artery. The preparations showed the well-known biphasic response to KCl depolarization. All three <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> were more potent in inhibiting the second, tonic phase compared to the first, transient phase, with pIC 50 values of 7. 17 +/- 0. 12 / 8. 27 +/- 0. 07 (nifedipine), 7. 93 +/- 0. 21 / 8. 96 +/- 0. 06 (nisoldipine), and 8. 28 +/- 0. 07 / 9. 79 +/- 0. 04 (lacidipine) for suppressing {{the first and the}} second phase, respectively. Furthermore, the influence of the <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> on the 5 -HT concentration-response curve was investigated. Nifedipine, nisoldipine, and lacidipine concentration dependently depressed the maximum effect of 5 -HT on the coronary artery preparations without influencing the pEC 50 of the 5 -HT concentration-response curve. In conclusion, all three dihydropyridine <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> are potent and effective inhibitors of depolarization- or 5 -HT-induced coronary artery contractions. Lacidipine, a new lipophilic compound, was the most potent one in inhibiting the depolarization-induced contraction, thereby showing a marked selectivity for the tonic phase compared to the initial phasic respons...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Aspirin {{use in the}} {{secondary}} prevention of ischaemic heart disease may provoke gastrointestinal discomfort. OBJECTIVE: To register gastrointestinal symptoms and complications in patients with cardiovascular disease using aspirin and to relate these symptoms to infection with H. pylori. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 398 consecutive patients in the Coronary-Care Unit, University Hospital Nijmegen and analysed for serum antibody levels to H. pylori infection. Questionnaires were sent 2 weeks after discharge to assess gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 314 patients (79 %). A total of 183 out of 314 patients (46 %) reported gastrointestinal symptoms. Of 238 patients using 80 - 100 mg aspirin daily, 145 (61 %) recorded gastrointestinal symptoms. Besides aspirin, the use of <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> was correlated with gastrointestinal symptoms. Of the 128 patients using <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists,</b> 84 (66 %) reported gastrointestinal symptoms. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in H. pylori-positive and -negative patients using aspirin was 48 % and 52 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks after discharge almost 50 % of the patients with cardiovascular disease experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, especially patients using aspirin or <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists.</b> Patients seropositive for H. pylori and using aspirin or <b>calcium</b> <b>antagonists</b> did not have more gastrointestinal discomfort compared to non-infected patients...|$|R
