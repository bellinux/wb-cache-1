40|$|Two {{microbial}} growth models predicting {{the growth of}} Pseudomonas fluorescens and Listeria innocua at superatmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations at 7 degrees C were validated on fresh-cut butterhead lettuce. <b>Cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> was inoculated with the same strain of L. innocua as the in vitro experiments. The P. fluorescens strain was tagged with a gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) in order to distinguish the inoculated strain from contaminating Pseudomonaceae.

40|$|The {{perception}} of Minimally processed (MP) salad vegetables as healthy and convenient {{has led to}} an increasing popularity for such foods. Concerns regarding the microbiological safety of minimally processed salad vegetables arise as their unique characteristics enhances the growth of microorganisms, including those which can grow at refrigeration temperatures. For food processors the challenge is to produce a safe product with extended shelf-life. Normal catering operations require well defined instructions for the safe handling and preparation of salad vegetables which exist for other food groups such as meat, dairy and fish products. This research project was devised to examine the microbiological consequences of using NaDCC (sodium dichlorisocyanurate), commercially available as Aquatabs, as a surface disinfectant during the preparation of salad vegetables in catering or processing operations. Experiments were designed to do the following: 1. To reduce the microbial load on the surface of cut butterhead lettuce during it’s preparation using NaDCC as a chlorine dip. 2. To examine the antimicrobial effect of NaDCC on the different physiological groups of microorganisms present on <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> and cabbage. 3. To examine the effect of NaDCC on foodbome pathogens commonly associated with vegetables in-vivo. 4. To compare Aquatabs to another commercially available chlorine product and two organic acid products as surface disinfectants for <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce.</b> Results showed that treatment of <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> with NaDCC (Aquatabs) significantly improved the microbiological quality. When applying the disinfectant to salad vegetables intended for refrigerated storage, the pH of the chlorine solution, drying post treatment and type of vegetable are important factors to be considered. Treatment of <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> with NaDCC also significantly reduced pathogens in-vivo contributing to the microbiological safety of the product. The efficiency of NaDCC disinfectants was similar to the lactic acid disinfectants. The survival of microorganisms was attributed to the surface microenvironment of the salad vegetable which protected the microoganisms from the biocidal action of the disinfectants...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{injury is}} {{inherent}} {{to the production}} and processing of fruit and vegetables. The opportunistic colonization of damaged plant tissue by human enteric pathogens {{may contribute to the}} occurrence of outbreaks of foodborne illness linked to produce. Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 (EcO 157) responds to physicochemical stresses in <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> and lettuce lysates by upregulation of several stress response pathways. We investigated the tolerance of EcO 157 to osmotic stress imposed by the leakage of osmolytes from injured lettuce leaf tissue. LC-MS analysis of bacterial osmoprotectants in lettuce leaf lysates and wound washes indicated an abundant natural pool of choline, but sparse quantities of glycine betaine and proline. Glycine betaine was a more effective osmoprotectant than choline in EcO 157 under osmotic stress conditions in vitro. An EcO 157 mutant with a deletion of the betTIBA genes, which are required for biosynthesis of glycine betaine from imported choline, achieved population sizes twofold lower than those of the parental strain (P < 0. 05) over the first hour of colonization of <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The cell concentrations of the betTIBA mutant also were 12 -fold lower than those of the parental strain (P < 0. 01) when grown in hypertonic lettuce lysate, indicating that lettuce leaf cellular contents provide choline for osmoprotection of EcO 157. To demonstrate the utilization of available choline by EcO 157 for osmoadaptation in injured leaf tissue, deuterated (D- 9) choline was introduced to wound sites in MAP lettuce; LC-MS analysis revealed the conversion of D 9 -choline to D- 9 glycine betaine in the parental strain, but no significant amounts were observed in the betTIBA mutant. The EcO 157 ΔbetTIBA-ΔotsBA double mutant, which is additionally deficient in de novo synthesis of the compatible solute trehalose, was significantly less fit than the parental strain after their co-inoculation onto injured lettuce leaves and MAP <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce.</b> However, its competitive fitness followed a different time-dependent trend in MAP lettuce, likely due to differences in O 2 content, which modulates betTIBA expression. Our study demonstrates that damaged lettuce leaf tissue does not merely supply EcO 157 with substrates for proliferation, but also provides the pathogen with choline for its survival to osmotic stress experienced at the site of injury...|$|E

The most effective treatments for extending postharvest life of lettuce slices were fumigation with 500 μl/ 1 NO for 1 h, and dipping in 500 mg/l DETANO for 5 min. Dipping in DETANO solution was, however, more effective as it generated a 100 % increase in postharvest life compared with a 70 % increase due to NO gas.

40|$|Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 is a known causative {{agent of}} {{foodborne}} illness that is frequently {{associated with the}} contamination of fresh produce. The attachment mechanisms used by E. coli O 157 :H 7 on produce, and the interaction of bacterial cells with salad greens are not well understood. This research investigated the attachment patterns of two bioluminescent strains of E. coli O 157 :H 7 associated with the expression of thin aggregative (curli) fimbriae.

40|$|During dark {{storage of}} fresh-cut product {{prepared}} from butterhead and iceberg lettuce {{the levels of}} carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch) decrease. Carbohydrate levels were low in butterhead lettuce at the start [~ 20 mg/g dry matter (DW) ] and levels decreased by over 50 % during storage at 12 °C; carbohydrate levels in iceberg lettuce were much higher at the start (~ 350 mg/g DW) and decreased by over 70 % during storage. When the fresh-cut lettuces were stored under a low intensity monochromatic light (red, blue, red + blue, green), either continuous or in a 12 -h photoperiod, the shelf life was markedly prolonged over the dark control. The prolonged shelf life coincided with vastly increased levels of carbohydrates in the lit samples. In butterhead lettuce, the carbohydrate levels increased during storage up to 10 times compared to the initial level; in iceberg lettuce the light greatly prevented carbohydrate depletion. The shelf life showed a positive correlation with the amounts of carbohydrates in the fresh-cuts measured at day 7 or 14 of the storage. This strongly indicates that the carbohydrate level is {{a key factor in}} extending shelf life of fresh <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> stored under light.

Questions focussed on intentions to purchase fresh <b>cut</b> lamb’s <b>lettuce</b> from environmental sustainable farms, simulating a fresh cut product with an Eco-label. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The SEM technique is used to develop propositions representing a theoretical approach in the context of the process for purchasing fresh cut products. With regard to distinguishing between the motives, the authors referred to the approach that sets out two different types of motive: health and green. Findings – The resulting managerial implications make it possible to assess how much the different types of motive influence the attitude and affect the choices and the behavior of the consumers.

40|$|During postharvest {{handling}} and storage, {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables continue to lose water through the process of transpiration which is a physiological process of water loss from fresh products. This process is influenced by factors such as temperature, relative humidity, respiration rate, surface area and air movement; an excessive weight loss causes change in texture, a favourable environment for microbial growth and leads to unsalable loss of market value, during retail marketing and to a direct financial loss. Iceberg lettuce is a highly perishable product with a short shelf life (7 days at 7 °C) due to the influence of minimal processing unit operations, such as cutting and shredding that causes disruptions of cells, which induces an increase in respiration rate, transpiration and enzymatic activities after harvest. The aim of this work was to quantify the transpiration rate (TR) of fresh <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> under different storage condition. Experiments were conducted by conditioning the sample at 2, 6 and 10 °C and 76, 86, 96 and 100 % RH and TR was recorded during 7 days of storage. The results showed that both temperature and relative humidity affected transpiration rate: TR increased by increasing temperature and by decreasing RH; TR ranged from 0. 49 to 1. 26 (g kg- 1 h- 1) over all the combinations of temperature and RH tested.

40|$|Nontyphoid {{salmonellosis}} {{caused by}} Salmonella enterica {{is the most}} common bacterial food-borne illness in humans, and fresh produce, including tomatoes, is a common vehicle. Accumulating data indicate that human enteric pathogenic bacteria, including S. enterica, interact actively with plants. Tomato plants were inoculated with S. enterica to evaluate plausible contamination routes and to determine if the tomato cultivar affects S. enterica colonization. S. enterica population levels on tomato leaves were cultivar dependent. S. enterica levels on Solanum pimpinellifolium (West Virginia 700 [WVa 700]) were lower than on S. lycopersicum cultivars. S. enterica preferentially colonized type 1 trichomes and rarely interacted with stomata, unlike what has been reported for <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> leaves. Early S. enterica leaf colonization led to contamination of all fruit, with levels as high as 105 CFU per fruit. Reduced bacterial speck lesion formation correlated with reduced S. enterica populations in the phyllosphere. Tomato pedicels and calyxes also harbored large S. enterica populations following inoculation via contaminated water postharvest. WVa 700 green fruit harbored significantly smaller S. enterica populations than did red fruit or S. lycopersicum fruit. We found that plants irrigated with contaminated water had larger S. enterica populations than plants grown from seeds planted in infested soil. However, both routes of contamination resulted in detectable S. enterica populations in the phyllosphere. Phyllosphere S. enterica populations pose a risk of fruit contamination and subsequent human disease. Restricting S. enterica phyllosphere populations may result in reduced fruit contamination. We have identified WVa 700 as a tomato cultivar that can restrict S. enterica survival in the phyllosphere...|$|E

The common procedure to reduce microbial contamination {{involves the use of}} chlorine based compounds. Recently, electrolyzed water (EW) has been evaluated as an alternative measure in controlling microbial spoilage contamination occurring during washing steps. This work reviews results related to the application of EW for controlling microbial viability responsible for decay development during storage period. EW produced with sodium bicarbonate as electrolyte reduced Penicillium spp. population in water and, consequently, green mould decay in citrus fruits; the use of sodium chloride in EW production inactivated spores of Fusarium sp. in water and reduced pineapple decay during storage at 12 °C for 20 days as well as controlled yeast and mould population in date fruit up to six months of cold storage. EW was also found effective in controlling spoilage bacteria on ready-to-eat produce. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pantoea agglomerons, and Rhanella aquatilis were undetectable in electrolyzed process water amended with sodium chloride although similar treatment slightly reduced Erwinia carotovora load inoculated onto lettuce. EW at low free chlorine concentration reduced viability of Pseudomonas spp. And psychrotrophic bacteria in both simulated and industrial washing water. EW treatment of fresh <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> dipped in microbial contaminated water reduced Pseudomonas spp. of about 1 log cfu g- 1 delaying spoilage symptoms that occurred early in untreated vegetables.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to model the growth of nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli O 157 :H 7 (E. coli O 157 :H 7 NR) in blanched spinach and to {{evaluate}} model performance with an independent set of data for interpolation (8. 5, 13, 15 and 27 °C) and for extrapolation (broth and fresh-cut iceberg lettuce) using the ratio method and the acceptable prediction zone method. The lag time (LT), specific growth rate (SGR) and maximum population density (MPD) obtained from each primary model were modeled as a function of temperature (7, 10, 17, 24, 30, and 36 °C) using Davey, square root, and polynomial models, respectively. At 7 °C, the populations of E. coli O 157 :H 7 NR increased in tryptic soy broth with nalidixic acid (TSBN), blanched spinach and fresh-cut iceberg lettuce, while the populations of E. coli O 157 :H 7 decreased in TSB after 118 h of LT, indicating the risk of nalidixic acid-resistant strain of E. coli O 157 :H 7 contaminated in ready-to-eat produce at refrigerated temperature. When the LT and SGR models of blanched spinach was extended to iceberg lettuce, all relative errors (percentage of RE = 100 %) were inside the acceptable prediction zone and had an acceptable Bf and Af values. Thus, it was concluded that developed secondary models for E. coli O 157 :H 7 NR in blanched spinach were suitable for use in making predictions for fresh <b>cut</b> iceberg <b>lettuce,</b> but not for static TSBN in this work...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to develop a mathematical model of pathogenic bacterial inactivation kinetics in a gastric environment in order to further understand a part of the infectious dose-response mechanism. The major bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, and Salmonella spp. were examined by using simulated gastric fluid adjusted to various pH values. To correspond to the various pHs in a stomach during digestion, a modified logistic differential equation model and the Weibull differential equation model were examined. The specific inactivation rate for each pathogen was successfully described by a square-root model as a function of pH. The square-root models were combined with the modified logistic differential equation to obtain a complete inactivation curve. Both the modified logistic and Weibull models provided a highly accurate fitting of the static pH conditions for every pathogen. However, while the residuals plots of the modified logistic model indicated no systematic bias and/or regional prediction problems, the residuals plots of the Weibull model showed a systematic bias. The modified logistic model appropriately predicted the pathogen behavior in the simulated gastric digestion process with actual food, including <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce,</b> minced tuna, hamburger, and scrambled egg. Although the developed model enabled us to predict pathogen inactivation during gastric digestion, its results also suggested that the ingested bacteria in the stomach would barely be inactivated in the real digestion process.

40|$|Several {{outbreaks}} of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 infections {{have been associated}} with minimally processed leafy vegetables in the United States. Harvesting and processing cause plant tissue damage. In order to assess the role of plant tissue damage in the contamination of leafy greens with E. coli O 157 :H 7, the effect of mechanical, physiological, and plant disease-induced lesions on the growth of this pathogen on postharvest romaine lettuce was investigated. Within only 4 h after inoculation, the population sizes of E. coli O 157 :H 7 increased 4. 0 -, 4. 5 -, and 11. 0 -fold on lettuce leaves that were mechanically bruised, cut into large pieces, and shredded into multiple pieces, respectively. During the same time, E. coli O 157 :H 7 population sizes increased only twofold on leaves that were left intact after harvest. Also, the population size of E. coli O 157 :H 7 was 27 times greater on young leaves affected by soft rot due to infection by Erwinia chrysanthemi than on healthy middle-aged leaves. Confocal microscopy revealed that leaf tip burn lesions, which are caused by a common physiological disorder of lettuce, harbored dense populations of E. coli O 157 :H 7 cells both internally and externally. Investigation of the colonization of <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> stems by E. coli O 157 :H 7 showed that the pathogen grew 11 -fold over 4 h of incubation after its inoculation onto the stems, from which large amounts of latex were released.

30|$|Interestingly, some {{compounds}} (molsidomine or diethylamine NONOate diethylammonium) {{were effective}} at dispersing biofilms under refrigerated conditions (4 °C). Temperature {{is an important}} factor affecting the dissociation constant. NONOate (s) are very sensitive to temperature: a 1 °C change from 37 °C can results in an approximate 13 % change in NO release (Ramamurthi and Lewis [1997]). Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that when biofilms are exposed to the nitric oxide donors at lower temperatures, they experienced the treatment {{for a longer period of}} time, and this increased their potency. The implications of this observation for industrial applications are potentially exciting: the ability of the nitric oxide donors to disperse biofilms at 4 °C makes them good candidates for cleaning refrigerated surfaces, common in the food industry and even removing pathogen biofilms from refrigerated foods. While Salmonella and E. coli are thought to be metabolically inactive under these conditions, their populations in biofilms formed on refrigerated foods remain relatively steady over an extended period of time (Kroupitski et al. [2009]). Furthermore, a complement of Salmonella genes that were differentially expressed during biofilm formation on <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> during cold storage has been identified (Kroupitski et al. [2013]), suggesting that even though the cells of these human pathogens are not dividing, physiological processes and gene expression still take place under refrigerated conditions. It would be of great interest to determine whether these specific genes induced in biofilms on foods at 4 - 8 °C could be subject to manipulation by NO. More broadly, it remains to be determined which of the Salmonella genes involved in biofilm formation (Hamilton et al. [2009]; Teplitski et al. [2006]) are subject to regulation by nitric oxide, and – conversely – which of the known Salmonella genes responsive to nitric oxide contribute to the NO-mediated biofilm dispersal (Henard and Vazquez-Torres [2011]; Karlinsey et al.

In other research, the antimicrobial activity of 12 enterococci strains was confirmed by Hajikhani et al. ([2007]), showing that Ps. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris were sensitive to compounds produced by enterococci but E. coli and Yersinia enterocolitica were not affected. Trias et al. ([2008 a] [...]) treated apple wounds and <b>lettuce</b> <b>cuts</b> with the LAB strains resulting in reduced counts of Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli by 1 to 2 log cfu[*]g- 1, whereas the growth of L. monocytogenes was completely inhibited. Cheikhyoussef et al. ([2010]) investigated bifidin I from Bifidobacterium infantis BCRC 14602, and reported an increase in bacteriocin activity from 2. 6 [*]×[*] 102 AU[*]mg- 1 for neutralized CFS to 3.7 [*]×[*] 105 AU[*]mg- 1 for the purified bacteriocin. Simova et al. ([2009]) achieved a 105 -fold increase in bacteriocin activity after a single peak was assessed upon C 2 /C 18 reversed-phase liquid chromatography purification. The relative low concentration of bacteriocin in the CFS likely contributed to the BLS not being able to inhibit all bacteria and fungi examined in this study. Further investigation is needed to establish the method of direct use of LAB as protective cultures or that of purified bacteriocins on foods.|$|R
40|$|The end {{of shelf}} life of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce packed in {{modified}} atmosphere (MA) {{is determined by}} its visual quality and by its microbial load. The total microbial load should not exceed 6 – 7 log CFU g− 1 mesophilic counting and be free of human pathogens. Not much is known about specific interactions between the levels of specific spoilage micro-organisms and the sensorial quality attributes of the fresh-cut product. We studied the changes in sensorial quality attributes and the growth and population dynamics of microorganisms in three independent batches of MA packed fresh-cut iceberg lettuce stored at 7 °C. The sensorial quality of the fresh-cut product was daily evaluated by visual determination of color, shape (indication of crispness) and discoloration (browning); together these attributes were translated into an Overall Visual Quality (OVQ) value. In addition, off-odour and sourness production were scored immediately after opening of the bags. Samples of the fresh-cut product were taken to determine the total microbial load and to investigate the bacterial species composition using mass sequencing analysis. The decrease of OVQ over time showed a down sigmoid curve, reaching the limit of consumer acceptance after about eight days. Total bacterial counts increased from about 5 log at day 1 to about 8 log colony forming units (CFU) per gram at day 7. Initially, Pseudomonas species were dominant but when the package became anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), in particular Leuconostoc spp. and Lactococcus spp. became more abundant and dominated the bacterial population. Especially {{the rapid growth of}} Leuconostoc species correlated with development of a sour off-odour, represented by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids in the product and the decrease in OVQ. Results indicate that metabolites produced by LAB are responsible for off-odour production and loss of sensorial quality. Based on this knowledge, new strategies for shelf-life improvement may be designed to prevent the dominance of LAB in fresh <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> or make shelf-life better predictable based on initial counts of LAB, that may assist the industry and retail to reduce food waste. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Besides the {{traditionally}} used sodium hypochlorite (20 and 200 mg L- 1), alternative sanitizers such as peroxyacetic acid (80 and 250 mg L- 1) and neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water (4. 5 and 30 mg L- 1 free chlorine) {{as well as}} chlorine dioxide gas (1. 54 mg L- 1) were evaluated for their efficiency in reducing the microbial load of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce. An additional rinsing step with tap water and cooling of the sanitizing solutions, which are obvious for the fresh-cut industry, were not performed within the current study. The high doses of sodium hypochlorite and peroxyacetic acid tested within this study {{do not conform to}} the normally used concentrations within the fresh-cut industry. Neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water (30 mg L- 1), peroxyacetic acid (250 mg L- 1), and gaseous chlorine dioxide significantly reduced the total aerobic plate count of <b>cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> in comparison with water wash treatments alone. None of the treatments significantly affected the sensory quality of the lettuce, although small color changes were observed after colorimetric measurements. From a nutritional point of view water rinsing significantly decreased the vitamin C (maximum 35 %) and phenol (maximum 17 %) contents, but did not affect the carotenoid and alpha-tocopherol contents. Additional effects caused by adding a sanitizer to the wash water were not observed for vitamin C and phenols. Conversely, washing with 250 mg L- 1 peroxyacetic acid reduced the beta-carotene content by about 30 %, whereas using 200 mg L- 1 sodium hypochlorite reduced both the lactucaxanthin and the lutein contents by about 60 %. Use of gaseous chlorine dioxide also {{had an impact on the}} lutein content (- 18 %). Furthermore, the alpha-tocopherol content was reduced by 19. 7 and 15. 4 % when the two concentrations of neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water were used, respectively. These data represent the situation on day 0. In a next phase, shelf-life studies considering microbial and sensory quality and nutrient content should be conducted...|$|E
40|$|A lettuce (Lactuca sativa) {{washing process}} was {{simulated}} to assess chlorine as a disinfectant {{for maintaining the}} microbial water quality “clean” i. e. to prevent water becoming a vehicle for transmission of unacceptable levels of micro-organisms to the lettuce. <b>Cut</b> <b>lettuce</b> leaves were inoculated overnight with E. coli O 157 to obtain ca. 4. 0 log CFU/g, and subsequently washed. The washing process consisted of washing portions of 50 g of lettuce for one minute. The process was executed for 1 hour by taking lettuce portions of 50 g, and continuing to pass each subsequently through the same washing bath to obtain a final product-to-water ratio of 0. 5. kg/L. Each portion of lettuce was rinsed after washing. The pH of the washing water was reduced to 6. 5 and free chlorine was continuously added to maintain 1 mg/L of free chlorine in the water. The experiment was performed in i) tap water and ii) in artificial process water, including lettuce extract, the latter with COD values of 500 (C 500) or 1000 mg O 2 /L (C 1000). In the absence of chlorine, the E. coli O 157 levels rapidly increased in the wash water and eventually reached 5. 3 ± 0. 4 log/ 100 mL. When maintaining 1 mg/L of free chlorine, the contamination could be controlled to 2. 2 ± 0. 05, 1. 2 ± 0. 6 and 1. 3 ± 0. 4 log CFU/ 100 mL in tap water, C 500, and C 1000 respectively. Chlorination breakpoint and cumulative chlorine dose positively correlated with the COD load {{of the water and}} this higher chlorine consumption resulted in increased total trihalomethanes concentrations in the water: <LOD, 27. 8 ± 5. 4 and 124. 5 ± 13. 4 µg/L, the latter exceeding the amount allowed in drinking water in the EU. However, on the lettuce no detectable amounts were observed in all cases. This experiment shows that low amounts of chlorine are effective for maintaining a “clean” water quality. Nevertheless, the correlation of trihalomethanes with COD load illustrates the importance of the physicochemical quality and suggests the possible use of pre-treatments to lower the COD load...|$|E
