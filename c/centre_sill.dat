40|$|Abstract: To {{ensure the}} safe and {{efficient}} {{operation of the}} approximately 1. 6 million freight cars (wagons) in the North American railroad network, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) requires periodic inspection of railcars to detect structural damage and defects. Railcar structural underframe components, including the <b>centre</b> <b>sill,</b> sidesills, and crossbearers, are subject to fatigue cracking due to periodic and/or cyclic loading during service {{and other forms of}} damage. The current railcar inspection process is time-consuming and relies heavily on the acuity, knowledge, skill, and endurance of qualified inspection personnel to detect these defects. Consequently, technologies are under development to automate critical inspection tasks to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. Research was conducted to determine the feasibility of inspecting railcar underframe components using machine vision technology. A digital video system was developed to record images of railcar underframes and computer software was developed to identify components and assess their condition. Tests of the image recording system were conducted at several railroad maintenance facilities. The images collected there were used to develop several types of machine vision algorithms to analyse images of railcar underframes and assess the condition of certai...|$|E

Based on {{introducing}} engineering {{background and}} characteristics of river, the Yellow River in lanzhou section of the hydrological and sediment characteristics {{and characteristics of}} riverbed evolution are analyzed. On this basis, determine the once-in-a-century flow, and calculate the once-in-a-century flow when the bridge was analyzed and local scour of general erosion depth, scope of backwater height, etc. On {{the bridge of the}} embedment depth, clearance under the bridge, such as the check, and the bridge construction impact on the stability of river regime is analyzed.

50|$|In the 1930s the {{automatic}} coupler project saw the underframes replaced. The new design was all-steel, reinforced with <b>centre</b> <b>sills</b> {{in lieu of}} the truss rods and heavier bracing on the ends, and the brake equipment on the first 201 wagons was upgraded from the previous combined brake cylinder and auxiliary reservoir to a larger brake cylinder and a separate auxiliary reservoir. When the buffers and truss rods were removed in the 1950s, the wagon capacity was boosted a further ton.|$|R

40|$|The Mesozoic LeMay Group accretionary {{complex of}} Alexander Island, Antarctica, {{contains}} thrust-bound slices of accreted ocean floor, ocean islands and seamounts. They represent fragments of proto-Pacific oceanic crust, of which {{only a tiny}} remnant (the Phoenix plate) remains off northern Antarctic Peninsula. They therefore provide an excellent opportunity to sample the ancient oceanic crust that formerly occupied the southern Pacific Ocean. All the basalts experienced sea-floor and subduction/accretion metamorphism ranging from zeolite to transitional blueschist facies. On the basis of rare–arth and other immobile trace element characteristics, the basalts are divided into depleted MORB, N-MORB, E-MORB, and tholeiitic and alkaline OIB. Oceanic basalts occur within two rock associations on Alexander Island, basalt-volcaniclastite-chert and basalt-volcaniclastite-tuff. The basalt-volcaniclastite-chert rock association is dominated by pillow lavas which have light REE-depleted N-MORB geochemical characteristics, and is interpreted as representing ocean floor formed at spreading <b>centres.</b> Locally, <b>sills</b> of tholeiitic OIB intrude the sequence. The basalt-volcaniclastite-tuff rock association exposed in the Lully Foothills was formed in shallow water during the Early Jurassic. It is geochemically varied, consisting of basalts with N-MORB, E-MORB and tholeiitic OIB characteristics. The association is interpreted to have been formed on a large seamount or ocean island...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the hydrographic {{observations}} collected on the Antarctic continental shelf between 138 °E and 146 °E {{as part of the}} CEAMARC and ALBION projects in December 2007 -January 2008. A total of 140 quasi-synoptic CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) casts were analysed to map the spatial distribution of the summer hydrographic properties. Seven distinct hydrographic regimes were identified based on regional topographic features and the presence of specific water masses. These regimes are associated with spatial contrasts in the distribution of the High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) and the Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW). In particular, the HSSW distribution confirms the unique character of Commonwealth Bay in terms of extreme bottom salinity and dissolved oxygen values. The bay appears to be a preferred region for both dense shelf water formation and storage. The systematic survey of the Adelie Depression shows the ubiquitous presence of HSSW in the depression, and over the Adelie Sill as a 60 m thick layer at the <b>centre</b> of the <b>sill.</b> This water is dense enough to mix down the continental slope and form Antarctic Bottom Water. Upstream of the sill, the HSSW is shown to sit over the topography with indications of recirculation. The D 2 ̆ 7 Urville Trough, another deep basin on the shelf, is filled with warmer and fresher water that is too light to contribute to the formation of AABW. The D 2 ̆ 7 Urville Trough appears to collect MCDW which enters at the shelf break over the Adélie Bank and spreads over the northern slope of the trough. Another branch of MCDW enters inthe easternAdelie Sill and is found almost everywhere in the Adelie Depression with the noticeable exception of the coastal bays. Additional CTD casts collected during the ALBION- 2009 experiment in January 2009 suggest that most of the features observed in 2008 in the Adelie Depression should be robust on a year-to-year basis although summer 2009 was characterized by fresher dense shelf waters. 2007 ～ 2008 年夏季に得た 140 点のCTD観測データにもとづいて、東経 138 ～ 146 度における南極陸棚域の海洋構造を解析した。海洋構造は高塩分陸棚水（HSSW）と周極深層水（MCDW）で特徴づけられ、底層で塩分と溶存酸素濃度が極値によってCommonwealth湾の特異性が見出された。同湾は高密度の陸棚水の形成域と考えられ、HSSWはAdélie凹地に存在する。この水塊は陸棚斜面を流れ下り、南極底層水を形成する上で十分に高密度である。一方、D’Urville谷で観測された高温・低塩分水は低密度であるため、底層水形成には寄与しないと考えられる。 2009 年には陸棚水の低塩分化が観測されたが、Adélie凹地では 2008 年に観測された特徴からほとんど変化していなかった...|$|R
