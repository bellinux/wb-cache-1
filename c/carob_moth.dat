50|$|Only a few pests {{are known}} to cause severe damage in carob orchards, so they have {{traditionally}} not been treated with pesticides. Some generalist pests such as the larvae of the leopard moth (Zeuzera pyrina L.), small rodents such as rats (Rattus spp.) and gophers (Pitymys spp.) can cause damage occasionally in some regions. Only some cultivars are severely susceptible to mildew disease (Oidium ceratoniae C.). One pest directly associated with carob is the larva of the <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> (Myelois ceratoniae Z.), which can cause extensive postharvest damage.|$|E
40|$|The <b>carob</b> <b>moth,</b> Ectomyelois ceratoniae Zeller, is a pest of {{agricultural}} commodities and stored products around the world. <b>Carob</b> <b>moth</b> {{is known to}} infest citrus in the Mediterranean region and in southern Africa. In grapefruit cultivars, <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> infestations are associated {{with high levels of}} mealybug. However, although this relationship has been observed in other citrus types such as Navel oranges, this has never been quantified. A recent survey of infested fruit from various production areas in South Africa indicated that the pest status of <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> on Navel oranges may have been underestimated. As a result of the incidental pest status of <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> on citrus in South Africa in the past, a species specific integrated pest management (IPM) programme does not exist. Therefore, the overriding aim of this theses was to evaluate the pest status of <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> in citrus and establish a species specific IPM programme by determine the autecology of <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> in citrus. Reliable methods for monitoring <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> in citrus orchards both for producers and for research purposes were developed. A user-friendly monitoring method for determining weekly <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> infestation through dropped fruit was suitable for producers. A timed scouting method was also developed; although the accuracy of this method varied with the experience of the scout. The pest status of <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> was highest in the Loskop Valley, Nelspruit and the Vaalharts production areas and economic injury to growers ranged from R 512. 35 to R 3 719. 80 per hectare {{as a direct result of}} infestation. No infestation was recorded in the Sundays River Valley and Citrusdal production areas over both the 2014 - 15 and 201516 growing seasons. A laboratory study showed the survival of <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> larvae infesting citrus is less than 10 % in the absence of mealybug. However, this increases to almost 40 % in the presence of mealybug residues and sooty mould. There was a significant relationship between carob infestation at harvest and mealybug infestation in the middle months of the growing season. The relationship between <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> and mealybug indicates that current production guidelines for the management of mealybug in citrus may need to be amended. Consequently, it is proposed that an orchard with a history of <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> infestation and a high mealybug infestation in the previous season should be subjected to an early season preventative application of a registered control product. Also, if mealybug infestation in December is higher than a 5 % of fruit per tree, then a corrective application of a registered product is recommended. The application of 2, 4 -D at petal drop reduced the size of the navel-end opening, decreasing the proportion of mealybug found in the navel-end, subsequently reducing <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> infestation, resulting in a direct benefit for producers. Products registered for the control of false codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta Meyrick, were effective in reducing <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> infestation. In a spray trial conducted over two seasons, Delegate® and Runner® reduced infestation significantly in the 2014 - 15 season (over 80 %), while only Delegate® was effective in the 2015 - 16 season (over 80 %). If a late season corrective chemical application is targeted at both FCM and <b>carob</b> <b>moth,</b> this application should take place between 6 - 7 weeks prior to harvest. The mating disruption product, SPLAT® EC, reduced <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> infestation by 70 % compared to the untreated control. A laboratory culture was established and head-capsule size categories were determined for all five <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> instars. A parasitoid survey indicated that parasitism of <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> larvae is generally less than 5 % in citrus orchards and a new species of Braconidae was described as Phanterotoma carobivora van Achterberg and Thackeray. <b>Carob</b> <b>moth</b> fifth instar were found to be the most cold-tolerant larval stage, and were shown to be more cold susceptible than the most cold-tolerant FCM instars at - 0. 55 ºC for eighteen days. This cold treatment resulted in a mortality of 94. 6 % fifth instar <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> compared to a combined fourth and fifth instar mortality of 87. 8 % for FCM after eighteen days. These results indicate that post-harvest cold treatments targeting FCM will be as, if not more, effective against <b>carob</b> <b>moth,</b> suggesting that current phytosanitary legislation for <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> should be amended to incorporate this study’s findings...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCarob moth (Ectomyelois ceratonia Zell Lepidoptera: pyralidae) is {{the most}} {{important}} reason of quantitative and qualitative reduction of pomegranate (Punica granatum) yield all over pomegranate cultivation regions of Iran like Isfahan province. Isfahan province with 7620. 5 hectare pomegranate orchards is in third place of pomegranate production (after Fars and Markazi provinces) in Iran (3), and following cultivars are the most important cultivars in Isfahan: Naderi, Ravandi, red aril soursweet, Shahvar sweet, Ameneh Khatooni and Zaagh shirin. <b>Carob</b> <b>moth's</b> damage was studied for three cultivars (red aril soursweet, white skin sweet and red skin sour) in five regions (Natanz, Koohpayeh, Shahreza, Rooran and Najafabad) during 2010 year. In order to determine tolerant cultivars and damage levels of this pest in Isfahan province, primary sampling was conducted to define required sampling number and 60 tree numbers distinguished as required sample. Then 60 trees of each cultivar were selected randomly from orchards of each region which had same aged trees of all three cultivars and larger than five hectares, infected and non- infected fruits were counted and recorded. According to results, regions and cultivars had highly significant (p< 0. 01) effect on infection rate and Natanz had the highest infection whereas Najafabad showed the least and also sour cultivar showed the highest infection whereas sour sweet cultivar had the least...|$|R
40|$|Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) {{orchards}} in the Middle East {{are typically}} {{composed of a}} mix of different cultivars in which variation in fruit infestation by <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) has been observed. However, seasonal variation in infestation and adaptation of the <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> to this cropping system have not been explored. We monitored the progress of fruit infestation in 10 pomegranate cultivars {{during the growing season}} of two consecutive years in pomegranate orchards of Iran. Overall, levels of infestation in fruits were strongly correlated with susceptibility to fruit cracking in pomegranate, so that cracked fruits and cracking-susceptible cultivars were infested the most. However, this pattern changed during the season. Infestation was first observed on cracking-susceptible cultivars. At this point almost all cracked fruits were infested. Towards the end of the season, infestation in uncracked fruits and cracking-resistant cultivars increased. Uncracked fruits seem better overwintering sites for <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> as under simulated winter conditions, survival of insect larvae in uncracked fruits was > 3 times higher than in cracked fruits. Taken together, our data reveal that cracked fruits of pomegranate are the better host during the growing season, while uncracked fruits better sustain <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> population in winter. It seems therefore advisable not to grow cracking-susceptible and cracking-resistant cultivars together in the same area...|$|E

Among the different odours examined, <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> (Ectomyelois ceratoniae Zeller) frass elicited the highest olfactory responses, while Ephestisa larvae, which were less suitable hosts, elicited the lowest response. The different preferences to various odours suggest that Goniozus legneri can discriminate among suitable and less suitable insect hosts...|$|E
40|$|The <b>carob</b> <b>moth,</b> Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller, 1839) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is {{the most}} {{important}} pest of pomegranate in Iran. As it has been rarely recorded on other host plants, control methods have mostly been focused on its populations on pomegranate. In this study, shapes and sizes of wings were compared in populations on 4 host plants (pomegranate, fig, pistachio and walnut) using a landmark-based geometric morphometric method, and analysis of partial warp scores and centroid sizes. The results showed significantly smaller wing size in populations on pomegranate and a significant host plant-associated shape difference among populations as a consequence of allometric growth. This suggests that the wing size and shape differences among test populations may not have a genetic basis and could happen because of differences in the nutritional content of host plants. The results of the analysis suggest that the female <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> lays her eggs on host plants that provide suitable conditions for hatching. The larger size of moths on hosts other than pomegranate showed that some host plants such as fig, pistachio and walnut can provide for increased stored nutritional reserves by larvae that may result in more successful over-wintering and higher fecundity in adults. This suggests that in spite of the more extensive activity of <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> on pomegranate in Iran, populations on other host plants can have an important effect on expanding pest population sizes in following years which should be considered in control methods...|$|E

40|$|The <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> (Ectomyelois ceratoniae) {{is the key}} pest of pomegranate, {{which causes}} a {{significant}} percentage of losses in pomegranate orchards and warehouses of Iran annually. The pest larvae are characterized by displaying a cryptic behavior within the fruit, which avoids most routine control techniques, especially chemical method. The low efficiency of traditional measurements and also the rich species diversity of natural enemies within the infested fruits highlight the necessity of exploring effective control methods, especially environmental friendly approaches. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are a group of biological control agents that actively search for the host, including those in a cryptic habitat like the <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> larvae within infested fruits. Here, we assumed that treatment of the infested and dropped fruits with EPNs may provide new insight into the management of the <b>carob</b> <b>moth.</b> Three species of EPNs, Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora were selected and used in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In preliminary assays, the EPNs species were used with different concentrations of infective juveniles (IJs) (0, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 IJ/larvae) in 2 -cm diam. plates. The mortality rates of the laboratory tests were 79. 75 % and 76. 5 % for S. feltiae and S. carpocapsae, corresponded to LC 50 value of 2. 02 IJ/larva for S. feltiae and 2. 05 IJ/larva for S. carpocapsae. On the contrary, H. bacteriophora demonstrated low virulence on the pest larvae in petri tests with a LC 50 = 426. 92 IJ/larva. Hence, both Steinernema species were selected for subsequent experiments. The penetration rate for S. feltiae and S. carpocapsae into the hemocoel of the pest was 43 % and 31 %, respectively, and the corresponding reproduction rate was 15, 452 IJ/larva for S. feltiae and 18, 456 IJ/larva for S. carpocapsae. The gathered data from those in vitro tests were used for a field assay. Different concentrations (5, 10, 50, 100, and 160 IJ/cm 2 of the arena) of S. feltiae and S. carpocapsae were applied in the field test. The mean mortality results from the last test were 10. 89 % and 26. 65 % for S. feltiae and S. carpocapsae, respectively. Finally, we found that these low virulence rates of the nematodes were attributed to inhibitory/repellency effects of saprophytic fungi within the infested pomegranates, a usual status of the infested fruits in autumn or winter seasons. Future work on additional EPN populations more adapted to the extreme conditions of the pomegranate production area in Iran may provide sufficient evidence to continue the further investigation on the best EPN species populations and advanced formulations with high durability...|$|E
40|$|Feeding indices and enzymatic {{activities}} of Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller) were studied in a growth chamber under controlled conditions (29  ±  2  °C, relative humidity of 70  ±  5 % and a photoperiod of 16 : 8 (L:D) hours) on two commercial Pistachio cultivars (Akbari and Kalequchi) and an artificial diet. Feeding indices of E. ceratoniae larvae differed significantly on three hosts (P <  0. 05). The relative consumption rate was calculated to be 5. 36  ±  0. 009, 11. 10  ±  1. 49 and 10. 631  ±  0. 599 (mg/mg/day) on artificial diet, Akbari and Kalequchi cultivars, respectively. <b>Carob</b> <b>moth</b> larvae reared on Akbari cultivar showed the highest efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) (5. 64  ±  0. 43).

40|$|Perfectly {{integrated}} into the Tunisian economy, date sector is undergoing a great expansion in production and exports. Infestation {{is a major problem}} encountered during the dates’ postharvest period. Consequently, {{there is a need to}} maintain fruit quality during handling, packaging and storage. Currently, after the methyl bromide (MB) restriction, the industry needs an efficient and environmental-friendly alternative against insects. In this study, ethyl formate (EF) had been chosen to fumigate dates of Deglet Nour variety. Initially, trials at laboratory scale were performed with the most resistant larvae stage of the <b>carob</b> <b>moth</b> (Ectomyelois ceratoniae). For this purpose, three EF concentrations (114. 4, 127. 8, and 143 g/m 3) and two exposure durations (2 and 3 h) were tested. Results revealed that the most efficient combination was 143 g/m 3 of EF for 2 h, which caused 98. 12 % mortality. Then, experiments were undertaken at a semi-industry scale with Vapormate®, the commercial version of EF containing a combination of EF and CO 2. The mortality rate was further improved, reaching 100 %. However, the CO 2 synergistic effect was not demonstrated. In addition, the effects of EF and Vapormate® on the quality of fumigated fruits regarding color, sugar content and aromatic composition was assessed and discussed.

40|$|Semiochemical-based {{behavioral}} manipulation {{has been}} increasingly implemented in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as an environmentally friendly strategy. For many pest species, however, efficient methods {{have yet to}} be developed. An efficient sex pheromone attractant is missing in management of the <b>carob</b> <b>moth,</b> Ectomyelois ceratoniae, a devastating fruit pest, because the major pheromone component is unstable. To explore the use of host-plant volatiles to attract carob moths, the pomegranate-carob moth interaction was investigated in field and wind tunnel experiments. Cracked pomegranates and cracking-susceptible cultivars were most susceptible to E. ceratoniae infestation. Male and female moths were attracted by mature pomegranates, but not by unripe pomegranates and flowers. The combination of pomegranate with virgin females was most attractive to carob moths and enhanced the attraction of virgin females. β-Caryophyllene was identified as the volatile of pomegranate that elicited the strongest antennal responses from female moths. In the wind tunnel, moth attraction was negatively correlated with the amount of β-caryophyllene in different fruit stages. These findings can be used to attract/trap carob moths and/or disrupt their host finding. In the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, the role of male sex pheromone in male-male competition was investigated. Virgin females perfumed with male pheromone or with the main pheromone component mated less than control virgin females, indicating that male pheromone on females inhibits the approach of other males. Male pheromone may be thus used to suppress mating in H. virescens. Together, pomegranate volatiles and male pheromone of H. virescens show great potential for application in IPM...|$|E
40|$|The <b>carob</b> <b>moth,</b> Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller 1839) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is {{the most}} {{important}} pest of pomegranate, Punica granatum L. (Myrtales: Ponicaceae), in Iran. In this study, 6 amplified fragment length polymorphism primer combinations were used to survey the genetic structure of the geographic and putative host-associated populations of this pest in Iran. An AMOVA was performed on test populations. Pairwise differences, Mantel test, multidimensional analysis, cluster analysis and migration rate were calculated for 5 geographic populations of E. ceratoniae sharing the same host, pomegranate. In another part of the study, 3 comparisons were performed on pairwise populations that were collected on different hosts (pomegranate, fig, pistachio and walnut) in same geographic regions. The results showed high within population variation (85. 51 % of total variation), however geographic populations differed significantly. The Mantel test did not show correlations between genetic and geographic distances. The probable factors that affect genetic distances are discussed. Multidimensional scaling analysis, migration rate and cluster analysis on geographic populations showed that the Arsanjan population was the most different from the others while the Saveh population was more similar to the Sabzevar population. The comparisons didn't show any host fidelity in test populations. It seems that the ability of E. ceratoniae to broaden its host range with no fidelity to hosts can decrease the efficiency of common control methods that are used on pomegranate. The {{results of this study suggest}} that in spite of the effects of geographic barriers, high within-population genetic variation, migration rate and gene flow can provide the opportunity for emerging new phenotypes or behaviors in pest populations, such as broadening host range, changing egg lying places, or changing over-wintering sites to adapt to difficult conditions such as those caused by intensive control methods...|$|E
