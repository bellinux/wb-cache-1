5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> used to mean 'man'. He advises the translator to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E

25|$|This {{argument}} has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. The point is that, in instances {{of some sort}} of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible that every single time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.|$|E
25|$|The {{extension}} of his estates through the Harthill inheritance was for long uncertain. At {{the death of}} his grandfather, Richard Harthill, there was still a male heir in the family, a ten-year-old grandson called William, who was intended to inherit the majority of the estates. Richard had appointed feoffees to ease the transition, although there were reports that the tenants had no connection with the feoffees and an inquisition post mortem decided that Pooley and the rest ought to escheat to the king during William's minority. In March 1401 an inquiry was held at Tamworth, Staffordshire, into the age of William and it transpired that he was 21, old enough to take over his estates, although he his wardship was still held by Roger Sapurton. Only with the death of William sine prole in the summer of 1402 <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> certain that his aunt Elizabeth, Sir John Cokayne's mother, would inherit. However, matters were still far from straightforward. For example, an inquisition at Tamworth on 10 August found that Elizabeth's stepmother, Mary, was still alive and held a third of the estate at Newton Regis. After the death of Edmund Cokayne in 1403, Elizabeth married John Francis (also rendered Franceys and Fraunceys) of Ingleby, apparently in the same year, She and Francis settled the manor of Harthill on Sir John Cockayne at about the time of their marriage but Elizabeth seems to have been in no hurry to hand over any more of her inheritance to her son. The quitclaim dated 21 April 1416 but issued on 5 May 1417, after her death, listed the manors and properties that made up the Harthill inheritance.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{title was}} {{invariably}} {{seen as a}} statement on {{the demise of the}} Beatles, as commentators viewed the album as Harrison's liberation from the artistic constraints imposed on him within the band. The album's cover image, showing Harrison seated on his Friar Park lawn surrounded by four reclining garden gnomes – thought to represent the Beatles – was also viewed as reflecting this theme. While commenting that [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] had [...] "accrue new layers of relevance" [...] during the album's creation, particularly with the death of Harrison's mother, former Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer writes: [...] "Nobody in November 1970 could have mistaken the title's significance... As if to cement the association of ideas, the wry cover picture has George in solitary splendour, surrounded by a quartet of gnomes." [...] In a 2001 interview, photographer Barry Feinstein admitted that the words [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] had helped inspire his set-up for the photo, saying: [...] "What else <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be?...</b> was over with The Beatles, right?

500|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{reception in}} trade publications, but some advertisements would boast {{the power of}} the film or {{go so far as to}} call it a great American drama.

The conversion! <b>Could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be?</b> A New England church meeting would be a good place to exhibit and - ask questions." [...] Though the reviewer in the The New York Dramatic Mirror however disagreed that the premise was plausible, [...] "A [...] old deacon forms the complicating element in this rather conventional and rather improbable story. That a girl could become a comic opera star without the knowledge of her parents is a strain for the imagination. That a simple little dance like the one in the picture could effect such a conversion is another tax on belief. The acting is good, especially in the heroine's role. The deacon displays an unnatural tendency in such a stern character when he rapturously kisses the photograph of his daughter." [...] It is unknown if the character of Deacon Sanders is really a church deacon because the synopsis states Deacon Sanders is a farmer who is [...] "nearly as poor as he is religious".|$|E

500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? <b>Could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics, used to more {{prescriptive}} cookery writers, {{thought her}} approach assumed too much knowledge {{on the part}} of the reader. In her view, [...] "The ideal cookery writer is one who makes his readers want to cook as well as telling them how it is done; he should leave something, not too much perhaps, but a little, unsaid: people must make their own discoveries, use their own intelligence, otherwise they will be deprived of part of the fun." [...] In The New York Times Craig Claiborne wrote admiringly of David, but remarked that because she assumed her readers already knew the basics of cooking she would be [...] "valued more by those with a serious regard for food than by those with a casual interest". [...] The writer Julian Barnes commented that as an amateur cook he found David's terse instructions intimidating: of a recipe in Italian Food [...] he wrote, [...] "E.D.'s first sentence reads like this: 'Melt 1½ lbs (675 g) chopped and skinned tomatoes in olive oil'... Melt? Melt a tomato?... <b>Could</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> that Elizabeth David was too good a writer to be a food writer?". A later cook, Tom Parker Bowles, observes, [...] "You don't turn to Elizabeth David for nannying, step-by-step instruction, or precise amounts and timing. She assumes you know the basics, and is a writer who offers inspiration, and wonderful, opinionated prose. Her recipes are timeless, and all her books wonderful works of reference (and tirelessly researched) as well as beautiful reads." ...|$|E
