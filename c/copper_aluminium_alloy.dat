The results from both numerical and actual spherical and Berkovich indentation tests demonstrate that materials are significantly strengthened for deformation at this level and the proposed approach is able to provide reasonably accurate results...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the {{stress corrosion cracking}} {{of a series of}} aluminium bronze alloys and attempts to characterize the cracking in relation to the various mechanisms proposed. The theories of cracking applicable to the aluminium bronze/ammonia system include; the anodic dissolution, the film rupture and the embrittlement theories, which are described in the literature review. The <b>copper</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> system was selected for investigation as it exhibits a martensite transformation, making the cracking of these alloys in ammonia solutions a usefulful comparison with the cracking of stainless steels in chloride solutions. The study used 'U-bend' specimens stressed in ammonia solution preconcentrated with copper, while the oxidation of the alloys under the same conditions was examined using unstressed specimens. Oxidation in this thesis is taken to mean an anodic dissolution process with or without the formation of a metallic oxide layer. The tests showed three binary alloys to be susceptible to intergranular and transgranular cracking, while two commercial alloys only cracked transgranularly and only in pH = 11 ammonia solution. Stress corrosion conditions gave rise to sharp, narrow cracks traversing all the phases in the alloy with matching features on opposing fracture surfaces, whereas oxidation gave rise to less distinct, more rounded features with a definite phase dependence. Further experiments showed the limited penetration and reactivity of a corrosive solution along narrow cracks. It is concluded that stress corrosion cracking and oxidation occur by different mechanisms and that the mechanism of stress corrosion cracking is unlikely to involve oxidation as a necessary step to cracking. The {{results of the present study}} support an embrittlement mechanism of stress corrosion cracking in aluminium bronze alloys...|$|E

AA 6101 -T 6 and AA 1350 <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{are widely used}} in electrical bus bars. As these alloys are joined by mechanical fasteners in electrical bus bars, the conductive area has been reduced.

Friction stir welding technique is mainly invented for joining similar and dissimilar <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> In this investigation, friction stir welding of AA 6101 -T 6 and AA 1350 <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> was done by varying tool traversing speed, rotational speed and tilt angle with hexagonal pin profiled tool.

Analysis of variance shows that most significant impact on tensile strength is made by variation in tool rotating speed while tool tilt angle makes the most significant impact on elongation and bending strength.

40|$|The Laser-Arc method {{represents}} a pulsed vacuum deposition where the arc discharge is ignited by short laser pulses. Owing {{to the short}} burning times of the single arcs, the erosion is restricted to the immediate neighbourhood of the ignition point, the laser focus. Hence, the cathode spots may be displayed on the cathode surface according to the displacement of the focus position. In this way, the drawbacks of conventional arc technology such as local overheating and emission of microparticles are essentially reduced. The Laser-Arc has been scaled up from the laboratory level to an industrial prototype. This fully computerized equipment allows the deposition of hydrogen-free diamond-like carbon films of hardness up to 80 GPa with a growth rate of up to 0. 2 mu m min(- 1). Owing to their low friction and high wear resistance, these films are especially suitable for sliding elements.

The electromagnetic expanding ring experiment {{was used as the}} primary tool for examining the ductility behaviour of metals. Through a use of the Phantom v 12 digital high-speed camera and specialised TEMA Automotive software, rings expansion velocities were determined with satisfactory accuracy for all ring tests. In this paper, the experimental observations on cold-rolled <b>copper</b> Cu-ETP, <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> Al 7075, barrel steel and tungsten heavy alloy are reported.

Moreover, results of analogue investigation for static and dynamic loading at the temperature of about − 40 °C were described. The experimental observations mainly revealed the different ductility behaviour of metals tested at applied dynamic loadings; Cu-ETP and barrel steel demonstrated an increase in ductility, whereas <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> Al 7075 and tungsten heavy alloy were characterised by lower ductility in comparison to static loading.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the influence of explosive ratio and type of sensitizer on the quality of explosive welds between <b>copper</b> and <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> plates. The welds were performed on a partially overlapping joint configuration using an emulsion explosive (EE) with two different sensitizers, hollow glass microspheres (HGMS) and expanded polystyrene spheres (EPS). Welds with an improved surface were achieved by using the HGMS sensitizer. A higher wave amplitude was registered in welds produced with the EPS sensitizer. In turn, the dimension of the molten pockets was influenced by the explosive ratio, increasing in size with increases in the values of this parameter. The intermetallic content of these zones varied according to the sensitizer type. Unlike the CuAl 2 phase, the Cu-richer phases CuAl and Cu 9 Al 4 were only identified in welds performed using the EPS sensitizer. An increase in hardness was observed at the interface of all welds, which resulted from both the presence of intermetallic phases and the plastic deformation of the materials promoted by the impact. This effect was most evident on the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> side. All the welds had a greater strength than copper, i. e. the weakest material of the joint. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Preheating temperature can make up the lost heat, improve the temperature of copper plate before the FSW process, achieve the refining grains, and then obtain a high quality welding joint.
