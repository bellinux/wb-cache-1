Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling to the golf course which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery. The fixed fares prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885, as rival undertakers were not given access to the LNC's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR's <b>cargo</b> <b>rate</b> (24shillings in 1885) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium.|$|E

5000|$|Steamboats earned {{money by}} {{charging}} passengers fares and shippers for carrying cargo. Some vessels managed to carry {{as many as}} 500 people together with 500 tons of cargo. Passenger fares varied over time. In the early 1850s, fares for the Eagle, running from Oregon City and Portland, were $5 a trip for passengers and $15 per ton of freight. During a gold rush, passenger fares were $23 for passage from Portland to Wallula, with various other charges, such as meals, in addition. Cargo was charged by the ton and by the distance carried. Sample rates in the early 1860s, following {{the establishment of a}} near monopoly on river transit, showed <b>cargo</b> <b>rates</b> running from $15 per ton for the haul from Portland to The Dalles (121 mi), and 90 per ton for Portland to Lewiston (501) miles.

Various chicaneries were practiced by the steamboat companies to increase the tonnage charges for items shipped. One authority states that gross tonnage was measured at 100 cubic feet to the ton, which would still permit the steamboat companies to fix the [...] "ton" [...] for customer charges at 40 cubic feet.|$|R

This sale, and others that came after it, was heavily criticised at the time for being far lower than the actual value of the railway, and prompted many anti-British protests.

In 1976, the M880/M890 series was put into production under a large contract., For almost a decade the Dodges were referred to as [...] "880s", [...] "890s", or most commonly called [...] "five-quarters". The term [...] "CUCV" [...] did not appear until the 1980s when GM was contracted to replace the M880/90s. The M8XXs were {{an attempt by the}} U.S. military to use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) vehicles with minor modifications in non-combat roles. They were intended to replace the M37, M715 and their related variants. The 1¼ ton M880-series was based on the Dodge W200, a ¾ ton capacity 4×4 civilian/commercial truck. The 880/90s had a 2500 lb <b>cargo</b> <b>rating,</b> enabling it to have a -ton load rating. The similar 1¼ ton M890-series was based on the Dodge D200, a ¾ ton capacity 4×2 civilian/commercial truck. The M880/M890s had several failings: a gasoline powerplant, 12-volt electrical systems (a separate 24 volt system was added to communications units), and no power steering, due to the PS pump location being used for the 24V generator. The 318 gasoline engine proved to be a fatal flaw as the military moved increasingly to diesel engines during this time period. The lack of power steering was a hindrance in off-road, close quarters, and snow-plowing duties (although most civilian and Air Force models had power steering). Around 44,000 M880/M890s were produced during the 1976–1977 model years and faithfully served the Army and Air Force until the late 1990s.|$|R
