5|$|The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy {{dog with}} a short, tight, silky <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> {{feathering}} on the ears and legs.

5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat is the {{smallest}} species of bat and arguably the world's smallest mammal. It has a reddish-brown or grey <b>coat,</b> <b>with</b> a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies range greatly in size, {{with an average of}} 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Females give birth annually to a single offspring.|$|E
40|$|Tablets {{of aspirin}} (a {{moisture}} degradable drug) have been film <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> two analogous Eudragit RL and RS copolymers designated here as A and B which differ {{only in their}} cation content in the ratio 2 : 1 (A:B). A, is therefore more hydrophilic than B. The tablets were film <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> ethanol solutions of these two polymers. Film <b>coating</b> <b>with</b> either A or B significantly reduced the moisture uptake potentials of the tablets but caused {{an increase in the}} disintegration times of the tablets and retarded dissolution rates. The mean disintegration times were 0. 5 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 1 min (uncoated tablets), 16 &#x 00 B 1; 2. 5 min (tablets <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> A) and 115 &#x 00 B 1; 3. 6 min (tablets <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> B). The corresponding dissolution rates &#x 0025; h - 1 were 28. 3 for uncoated, 16. 6, <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> A and 14. 8, <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> B, respectively. Thus, <b>coating</b> <b>with</b> polymer B considerably impaired the disintegration and dissolution properties of the tablets...|$|R

5|$|The Scottish Terrier {{typically}} has a hard, wiry outer <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> a soft, dense undercoat.

The longer coat on the beard, legs and lower body may be slightly softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy.|$|E
5|$|The West Highland White Terrier, {{commonly}} known as the Westie is a breed of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> a somewhat soft white undercoat. The modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but {{did not want to be}} known as such.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} most {{significant}} difference is in Napoleon, in his clothing, and in his general stature. David's version depicts Napoleon, dressed in an immaculate, multi-coloured uniform with a billowing cape. Delaroche's version, however, sees Napoleon in a fairly ordinary, gray <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> {{the sole purpose of}} keeping the cold away, rather than showing him as the symbol he may have represented - that of a gallant and powerful war leader, which is the impression given in David's version.|$|E

5|$|They have a {{moderately}} long single <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> no undercoat. Feathering of the fur {{appears on the}} chest, belly, ears and {{on the back of}} the legs. The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docked tails were often used in working dogs, as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult.|$|E
5|$|Echols {{recalled}} {{that the first}} scenes shot were those of Madonna walking down Lenox Avenue. While filming, the singer noticed a black leather <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> fur trim, worn by Fatima, the assistant director. Madonna asked for the coat from Fatima and ended up wearing it in the video. Echols also noted that Madonna had {{a close relationship with}} the cinematographer, and knew from which angle her shots would be the best and which lights to be used. After the misunderstandings regarding looks and the plot direction were cleared, the filming resumed and was finished within three days. The final scenes were with model Jason Olive in a Marlem house, with Madonna climbing steps and reaching him and their supposed child.|$|E
5|$|The French Spaniel (Epagneul Français) is a {{breed of}} dog of the Spaniel-like setter. It was {{developed}} in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century. Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct {{by the turn of}} the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier, a French priest. One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition.|$|E

5|$|A dun-colored <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> {{primitive}} markings {{that include}} a dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Monk is briefly {{separated}} from the group after accidentally boarding the wrong train at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. While reuniting with his partners he notices Steven Leight (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) being interviewed on a TV screen in Times Square about the recent murder of his wife. Noticing Leight eating a mint from the same bar the ambassador had last been seen, Monk insists Steven Leight is the ambassador's murderer, {{despite the lack of}} supporting evidence. To support his theory, Monk proposes that Leight stole his wife's jewelry to stage a robbery, then proceeded to the bar before calling the police. He asserts Leight and the ambassador were wearing essentially identical coats, and that they must have been switched accidentally at the bar. As rain falls, Leight locates the ambassador's hotel room, and subsequently kills both him and his bodyguards, and switches the newly wet <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> his own.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Fung {{is having}} tea {{in a public}} square {{surrounded}} by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (Kwai's pregnant friend) having tea in the same square. As {{he tries to get}} her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. The pregnant woman leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> all the stickers and runs off.|$|E

The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E
