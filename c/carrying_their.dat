In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh.

5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence.

Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E

5|$|In ODIs, {{there have}} been only 11 {{instances}} of a player <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> bat. The first occasion was when Grant Flower made 84—in Zimbabwe's total of 205—against England in December 1994. The following year, Saeed Anwar became the first player to score an ODI century while carrying his bat; he made 103 against Zimbabwe in Harare. England's Nick Knight surpassed Anwar's score and went on to make 125 against Pakistan in 1996. , this remains a record in the ODI format. Australia's Damien Martyn and England's Alec Stewart are the only other players to score a century while performing this feat in ODIs. Sri Lanka's Upul Tharanga became the first cricketer from his team to carry the bat when he made 112 against Pakistan in October 2017. In T20Is, Chris Gayle is the only player to carry his bat, doing so against Sri Lanka during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, scoring 63 runs in West Indies' total of 101.|$|E
5|$|In late 594, however, after Peter {{was heavily}} {{defeated}} by the Slavs, Priscus was again appointed to command as magister militum of Thrace, a post he proceeded to hold continuously for several years. In 595, he marched up the Danube, crossing the river and marching along its northern bank to Novae, despite the khagans protests. There, he learned that Singidunum had been captured by the Avars. He sailed his army to the city and, after failed face-to-face negotiations with the khagan, sent the taxiarches Goduin to recapture it. The Avars, having razed the city's walls, abandoned it at {{the approach of the}} Byzantine force. Next the Avars launched a raid against Dalmatia. Goduin was dispatched with 2,000 men to shadow them. He managed to ambush the Avar detachment <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> booty, recovered it and sent it to Priscus. After these events, the khagan turned west to campaign against the Bavarians and the Franks, leaving the Byzantine territories quiet for a period of a year and a half, until the summer of 597. Nevertheless, Priscus and his army remained on watch along the Danube border.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Reed {{caught up}} with the Donners and went on ahead with one of his teamsters, Walter Herron. The two shared a horse, {{and they were able to}} cover 25–40 miles (40–64km) per day. The rest of the party rejoined the Donners, but their bad luck continued. Native Americans chased away all of Graves' horses, and another wagon was left behind. With grass in short supply, the cattle spread out more, which allowed the Paiutes to steal 18 more during one evening; and several mornings later, the Paiutes shot another 21. So far, the company had lost nearly 100 oxen and cattle, and their rations were almost {{completely}} depleted. One more stretch of desert lay ahead. The Eddys' oxen had been killed by Native Americans and they were forced to abandon their wagon. The family had eaten all their stores, but the other families refused to assist their children. The Eddys were forced to walk, <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> children and miserable with thirst. Margret Reed and her children were also now without a wagon. But the desert soon came to an end, and the party found the Truckee River in beautiful lush country.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Gallipoli Campaign {{had ended}} and the AIF in Egypt {{was in the process}} of {{doubling}} in size from two divisions to four. Birdwood wished to appoint two British generals to command the new divisions, but Senator Pearce opposed this, ordering that one be given to McCay. On 22 March 1916, McCay arrived back in Egypt to assume command of the 5th Division. He found that General Headquarters, Egyptian Expeditionary Force had ordered II Anzac Corps, of which the 5th Division was a part, to replace I Anzac Corps in the defence of the Suez Canal. Owing to a shortage of rolling stock, the 4th and 5th Divisions were ordered to undertake a three-day route march across the desert under service conditions, <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> packs and weapons. This proved to be a greater test of staff and troops than anticipated, and many men dropped from thirst or exhaustion. Many of his men blamed McCay for subjecting them to such a humiliating and severe trial.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Division {{entered the}} line in the quiet Lunéville sector in February 1918. On 26 February, MacArthur and Captain Thomas T. Handy {{accompanied}} a French trench raid in which MacArthur assisted in the capture of a number of German prisoners. The commander of the French VII Corps, Major General Georges de Bazelaire, decorated MacArthur with the Croix de guerre. Menoher recommended MacArthur for a Silver Star, which he later received. The Silver Star Medal was not instituted until 8 August 1932, but small Silver Citation Stars were authorized to be worn on the campaign ribbons of those cited in orders for gallantry, similar to the British mention in despatches. When the Silver Star Medal was instituted, it was retroactively awarded to those who had been awarded Silver Citation Stars. On 9 March, the 42nd Division launched three raids of its own on German trenches in the Salient du Feys. MacArthur accompanied a company of the 168th Infantry. This time, his leadership was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Cross. A few days later, MacArthur, who was strict about his men <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> gas masks but often neglected to bring his own, was gassed. He recovered in time to show Secretary Baker around the area on 19 March.|$|E

5|$|Both sides had a {{connection}} to the early history of European football; Chelsea were invited {{to take part in the}} inaugural European Cup in 1955–56 as champions of England, only to be denied entry by The Football League, allowing Manchester United to become the first English entrants in the competition the following season. In February 1958, eight Manchester United players were killed in the Munich air disaster, when the aeroplane <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> team back from a match in Belgrade crashed while attempting to take off from a refuelling stop in Munich. Manager Matt Busby was seriously injured in the crash and almost died as a result, but he rebuilt the team, and in May 1968, Manchester United became the first English winners of the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the 1968 European Cup Final. Chelsea won their first European trophy three years later, when they beat Real Madrid 2–1 in the 1971 European Cup Winners' Cup Final replay after a 1–1 draw in the first match. Both Chelsea and Manchester United won that same competition during the 1990s – first Manchester United beat Barcelona 2–1 in the 1991 final (followed by victory over Red Star Belgrade in the 1991 Super Cup), and then Chelsea beat VfB Stuttgart in the 1998 final (followed by victory over Real Madrid in the 1998 Super Cup, their most recent European success). Manchester United then won their second European Cup the following year, beating Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final.|$|E
