With a polarization- and phase-controlled pulse shaping technique, the relative phase between the resonant and non-resonant CARS signals is controlled, and spectral interferometry is performed without an interferometer. Both the real and imaginary parts of the background-free resonant CARS spectrum are measured via spectral interferometry between the resonant and non-resonant signals from the same sample. The resonant signal is amplified significantly by homodyne mixing with the non-resonant signal as a local oscillator, greatly improving the detection limit...|$|R

50|$|CARS is {{used for}} species {{selective}} microscopy and combustion diagnostics. The first exploits the selectivity of vibrational spectroscopy whereas the latter is aimed at temperature measurements; the CARS signal is temperature dependent. The strength of the signal scales (non-linearly) with {{the difference in the}} ground state population and the vibrationally excited state population. Since the population of states follows the temperature dependent Boltzmann Distribution, the CARS signal carries an intrinsic temperature dependence as well. This temperature dependence makes CARS a popular technique for monitoring the temperature of hot gases and flames. More recently, CARS has been utilized as a method for non-invasive imaging of lipids in biological samples, both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, RP-CARS, a particular implementation of the <b>Coherent</b> <b>anti-Stokes</b> <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> microscopy, is used to study myelin and myelopathies.Finally, CARS-based detectors for roadside bombs are under development.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coherent</b> <b>anti-Stokes</b> <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> {{also called}} Coherent anti-Stokes Raman {{scattering}} spectroscopy (CARS), {{is a form}} of spectroscopy used primarily in chemistry, physics and related fields. It is sensitive to the same vibrational signatures of molecules as seen in Raman spectroscopy, typically the nuclear vibrations of chemical bonds. Unlike Raman spectroscopy, CARS employs multiple photons to address the molecular vibrations, and produces a coherent signal. As a result, CARS is orders of magnitude stronger than spontaneous Raman emission. CARS is a third-order nonlinear optical process involving three laser beams: a pump beam of frequency ωp, a Stokes beam of frequency ωS and a probe beam at frequency ωpr. These beams interact with the sample and generate a coherent optical signal at the anti-Stokes frequency (ωpr+ωp-ωS). The latter is resonantly enhanced when the frequency difference between the pump and the Stokes beams (ωp-ωS) coincides with the frequency of a Raman resonance, which is the basis of the technique's intrinsic vibrational contrast mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965, a {{paper was}} {{published}} by two researchers of the Scientific Laboratory at the Ford Motor Company, P. D. Maker and R. W. Terhune, in which the CARS phenomenon was reported for the first time. [...] Maker and Terhune used a pulsed ruby laser to investigate the third order response of several materials. They first passed the ruby beam of frequency ω through a Raman shifter to create a second beam at ω-ωv, and then directed the two beams simultaneously onto the sample. When the pulses from both beams overlapped in space and time, the Ford researchers observed a signal at ω+ωv, which is the blue-shifted CARS signal. They also demonstrated that the signal increases significantly when the difference frequency ωv between the incident beams matches a Raman frequency of the sample. Maker and Terhune called their technique simply 'three wave mixing experiments'. The name <b>coherent</b> <b>anti-Stokes</b> <b>Raman</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> was assigned almost ten years later, by Begley et al. at Stanford University in 1974. Since then, this vibrationally sensitive nonlinear optical technique has been commonly known as CARS.|$|E

In particular, linewidths for unassigned optical phonon mode triplet centered at around 820 cm− 1 are found to be 7. 5 ± 0. 2 cm− 1, 9. 1 ± 0. 3 cm− 1, and 11. 2 ± 0. 3 cm− 1.
