5|$|Barium {{hydroxide}} ("baryta") {{was known}} to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> it absorbs very little CO2 in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} budget, the {{restoration}} had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures, and Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem. Within fifteen years, the gallery walls were sagging, and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration. Van Erp used concrete from which alkali salts and <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> leached and were transported {{into the rest of}} the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. <b>Calcium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E

40|$|The {{solid-state}} vibrations {{of magnesium}} and <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> {{have been studied}} by normal coordinate analysis. Using a simple short-range force field, the calculated frequencies of normal vibrations are in good agreement with the experimentally observed fundamentals. Some fundamental bands have been estimated by calculations. Hartree-Fock frequency calculations on three model clusters suggest that the correlation field splitting of the hydroxyl group stretching vibrations mainly originates in the interlayer interactions...|$|R
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{entrainer}} is {{one that}} has a strong chemical affinity for one of the constituents. Using again the example of the water/ethanol azeotrope, the liquid can be shaken with calcium oxide, which reacts strongly with water to form the nonvolatile compound, <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> Nearly all of the <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> can be separated by filtration and the filtrate redistilled to obtain 100% pure ethanol.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the latent hydraulicity of silica powder and blast furnace slag powder in concrete is enhanced by the addition of <b>hydroxide</b> <b>calcium.</b> But the effectiveness of <b>hydroxide</b> <b>calcium</b> has not yet been confirmed for cement mortar and concrete. This experimental study was carried out to investigate the effect on long-term strength and durability of cement motar and concrete when mixed with both industrial by-products and minute <b>hydroxide</b> <b>calcium</b> powder. From the test results we see the effectiveness of the combinatory use of both minute <b>hydroxide</b> <b>calcium</b> powder and blast furnace slag in cement mortar and concrete in resisting freeze-thaw and carbonation attack. We expect increased use of industrial by-products such as fly ash and blast furnace slag in concrete members...|$|R

40|$|As is known, {{smelting}} dust {{has been}} reclaimed so far. But, {{it has the}} possibility of being used as a recycled material.

40|$|PURPOSES: To {{investigate}} the fundamental characteristics of blast-furnace slag mortar that was hardened with activating chemicals {{to capture and}} sequester carbon dioxide. METHODS: Various mix proportions were considered to find an appropriate stregnth development in regards with various dosages of activating chemicals, <b>calcium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> and sodium silicates, and curing conditions, air-dried, wet and underwater conditions. Flow characteristics was investigated and setting time of the mortar was measured. At different ages of 3, 7 and 28 days, strength development was investigated for all the mix variables. At each age, samples were analyzed with XRD. RESULTS: The measured flow values showed the mortar lost its flowability as the activating chemicals amount increased in the scale of mole concentration. The setting time of the mortar was relatively shorter than OPC mortar but the initial curing condition was important, such as temperature. The amount of activating chemicals was found not to be critical {{in the sense of}} setting time. The strength increased with the increased amount of chemicals. The XRD analysis results showed that portlandite peaks reduced and clacite increased as the age increased. This may mean the Ca(OH) 2 keeps absorbing CO 2 in the air during curing period. CONCLUSIONS: The carbon capturing and sequestering activated blast-furnace slag mortar showed successful strength gain to be used fo...|$|R
40|$|Room {{temperature}} {{ball milling}} of CaO and ZnO powder mixture (using molar ratio of CaO:ZnO of 1 : 2) {{with the addition}} of stoichiometrically required amount of water to form <b>calcium</b> zinc <b>hydroxide</b> hydrate (CaZn 2 (OH) 6 • 2 H 2 O) and subsequent calcination at 700 oC was conducted. In order to improve basicity of mixed oxides, <b>calcium</b> zinc <b>hydroxide</b> hydrate was modified by the addition of promoters. The addition of promoter in initial powder mixture such as K 2 CO 3 and KOH (with molar ratio of promoter to CaO of 1 : 10) was shown to effect the mechanochemical reaction. The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), base strength using Hammett indicator method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM and SEM-EDS). The results showed that, during mechanochemical treatment, CaO, ZnO and H 2 O reacted rapidly to form CaZn 2 (OH) 6 • 2 H 2 O, and this was the same when promoters were used. Only difference was in basicity of the catalysts, and opposite of the expected, results showed that the addition of promoters did not cause an increase of basicity. On the other hand, addition of KOH to initial powder mixture caused increase of carbonates formation during mechanochemical treatment...|$|R
