40|$|The {{reiteration}} frequency for mouse immunoglobulin VH-genes and CH-genes {{has been}} directly estimated by hybridization of purified MOPC 315 α-chain mRNA {{with a vast}} excess of mouse DNA. A biphasic <b>Cot</b> <b>curve</b> resulted. The low Cot transition (Cot 1 / 2 about 1. 5) was interpreted as hybridization to VH-genes and the high Cot transition (Cot 1 / 2 about 103) as hybridization to CH-genes. These values correspond to about 5000 VH-genes and less than 8 CH-genes. This germ-line content of VH-genes is sufficient to account for antibody diversity given a comparable set of VL-genes. Minimal-gene models are invalidated {{and there is no}} need to invoke somatic generators of diversity...|$|E
40|$|Cot curves {{derived from}} {{renaturation}} kinetics of sheared denatured DNA {{indicated that the}} genome of six populations representing the four most common root-knot nematode species (Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria, M. javanica, and M. hapla) is composed of 20 % repetitive and 80 % nonrepetitive sequences of DNA. Cot curves were almost identical, indicating that all populations had a haploid genome of approximately the same size. Calculations from an average <b>Cot</b> <b>curve</b> gave an estimate of 0. 51 x 108 nucleotide base pairs for the haploid genome of the four Meloidogyne species. This genome is about 12 - 13 {{times larger than the}} genome of the E. coli strain used as a control...|$|E
40|$|DNA and RNA can be assayed {{rapidly and}} very sensitively by {{exploiting}} the enhanced fluorescence of ethidium intercalated into duplex regions. By assaying at different pHs and introducing a heating/cooling cycle, {{a great many}} physicochemical aspects of DNA and RNA can be studied avoiding the use of radiolabels, and often giving information not otherwise readily obtainable. Studies are described on duplex DNA which involve measurement of extinction coefficients, cross-linking by chemicals, <b>Cot</b> <b>curve</b> analysis as well as estimation of drug-DNA binding constants. The assays {{can be adapted to}} investigate multi-stranded nucleic acid structures. The use of covalently closed circular DNA also allows rapid and extremely sensitive measurements of nicking caused by irradiation or drugs...|$|E
40|$|Four diploid {{and three}} phylogenetically {{tetraploid}} Cyprinidae (Ostariophysi) have been characterized as for nuclear DNA content, modal chromosome number and DNA reassociation kinetics (hydroxyapatite chromatography). Among the diploid species nuclear DNA content (10 − 12 g DNA/ 2 C) was 1. 62 for Tinca tinca, 1. 87 for Scardinius erythrophthalmus, 2. 53 for Leuciscus cephalus and 2. 75 for Alburnus alburnus, while the phylogenetically tetraploid species Carassius auratus, Barbus barbus and Cyprinus carpio attained 3. 40, 3. 66 and 3. 80 respectively. Modal chromosome number was 2 n = 48 – 50 for diploid individuals and 2 n = 100 – 104 for phylogenetically tetraploid ones. In all the species 5 – 8 % {{of the genome}} is represented by highly repetitive and foldback DNA. In DNA reassociation kinetics of phylogenetically tetraploid Cyprinidae a distinct plateau separates an intermediate reassociating sequence fraction (about 22 % of the genome; with average repetition frequencies between 1, 000 and 1, 400) from a slow reassociating one (unique DNA; about 72 % of the genome). These two genome fractions are not clearly distinguishable {{from each other in}} <b>Cot</b> <b>curves</b> of the diploid Cyprinidae, where a similar plateau is not evident. Since simple ploidy changes are not expected to affect DNA reassociation kinetics we suggest a different evolution in the genome organization of the two ploidy groups. Some possible hypotheses are discussed...|$|R
