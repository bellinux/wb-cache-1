40|$|The {{complexity}} of shear wave-arrivals above small earthquakes makes the polarisations and time-delays of shear-wave splitting above small earthquakes difficult to measure. We report a semi-automatic shear-wave analysis system, SWAS, {{that appears to}} combine the benefits of both visual and automatic techniques. Initially, SWAS automatically estimates shear-wave polarisations and picks shear-wave arrivals by an expert system, which provides sufficiently accurate initial measurements for visual adjustment. SWAS then allows easy <b>comparison</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjustment</b> of picks between screen images of original seismograms, seismograms rotated into anisotropic polarisations, and polarisation diagrams (hodograms), with immediate plotting in various standard or non-standard configurations. This speeds up visual measurements by well over an order of magnitude, and typically allows records of almost all small earthquakes (M ≥ − 1. 0) to be reliably measured for shear-wave splitting polarisations and time-delays. SWAS was developed and tested for data from the SIL seismic network in Iceland...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSolar {{irradiance}} and ancillary {{meteorological data}} is frequently measured by automatic weather stations for use within solar resource assessment for solar power plants. High accuracy measurement data {{are required for}} <b>comparison</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjustment</b> of satellite data and derivation of the expectable long-term mean value of the solar resource. Thus, utmost diligence must be taken during the measurement process and data evaluation to achieve data quality required for project financing. The combination of automatic data screening and manual flagging by an expert in at least daily frequency in close collaboration with a local station operator is the most recognizedway to detect impacts on measurement data and paves the way for post-correcting data treatment where necessary and reasonable. This is the preferred and recommended procedure, resulting in highestdata quality. The presented work is also understood {{as a basis for}} ongoing development and discussion among the corresponding expert group about screening of irradiance and ancillary meteorological data and its corresponding flagging. A common understanding and wide conformity about the screening process and flagging of data would be aspired...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} 51 series of surface {{pressure}} (extending back to between 1780 and 1871) over Europe is assessed using three different homogenization techniques. A new technique introduced here {{based on an}} iteration of multiple qualitative <b>comparisons</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjustments</b> (MCAs), <b>and</b> the Caussinus and Mestre technique, based on multiple decision rules and Bayesian statistics, are two methods {{that do not require}} a homogeneous reference series for the detection <b>and</b> <b>adjustment</b> of inhomogeneities. The third technique, the standard normal homogeneity test, does require a homogeneous reference series for the homogenization procedure, and has been used only on the last 100 yr of each station series. The results of the three methods, as well as the original, unadjusted data, are compared for differences in the variance of the individual series and in their interstation correlations. Empirical orthogonal function analysis is also used to assess differences in the results of the adjustment methods. The comparisons suggest that surface pressure in this geographical domain may be considered as being stationary over periods ranging from decades to centuries, and thus homogeneous parts of a surface pressure record can be used to adjust for inhomogeneities, as is done using MCA. It is also seen that EOF analysis can be an effective tool to assess the homogeneity of a dataset. The results of the EOF analysis show that inhomogeneities and poorly adjusted series can have undue influence on subsequent analyses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{business}} management quantitative modelling is a core competency. It enables structuring various complex problems; reduce systems to their relevant elements {{and to make}} objective and clear decisions. This especially applies to production-distribution networks which are formed by multiple independent and globally active companies. Here, individual goals and collective tasks meet so that experienced-based knowledge is no longer satisfactory. A literature review showed {{that there is no}} satisfactory concept available for superior network and quantitative operational management in multi-tier business networks. Therefore, in this article we focus quantitative supply chain models as starting point for stipulations among independent network partners. First, we deduce the main elements of quantitative modelling for inter- and intra-organisational production-distribution planning. Thereby, we present an extension of the Two-Stage-Production-Distribution-Problem which can be used as starting point for iterative supply chain coordination. Based on a literature review we introduce a novel pivotal point supply chain management model. The approach induces ongoing alignment of the strategic, tactic and operative tasks. On each level of this hierarchical planning frame specific plans are computed for <b>comparison</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The advantages of this approach {{can be found in the}} reliable objective basis for negotiations and the repeatable combined inter- and intra-organisational management...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for measuring}} emission time delay during irradiation of targeted samples by utilizing {{digital signal processing}} to determine the emission phase shift caused by the sample is disclosed. The apparatus includes a source of electromagnetic radiation adapted to irradiate a target sample. A mechanism generates first and second digital input signals of known frequencies with a known phase relationship, and a device then converts {{the first and second}} digital input signals to analog sinusoidal signals. An element is provided to direct the first input signal to the electromagnetic radiation source to modulate the source by the frequency thereof to irradiate the target sample and generate a target sample emission. A device detects the target sample emission and produces a corresponding first output signal having a phase shift relative to the phase of the first input signal, the phase shift being caused by the irradiation time delay in the sample. A member produces a known phase shift in the second input signal to create a second output signal. A mechanism is then provided for converting each of the first and second analog output signals to digital signals. A mixer receives the first and second digital output signals and compares the signal phase relationship therebetween to produce a signal indicative of the change in phase relationship {{between the first and second}} output signals caused by the target sample emission. Finally, a feedback arrangement alters the phase of the second input signal based on the mixer signal to ultimately place the first and second output signals in quadrature. Mechanisms for enhancing this phase <b>comparison</b> <b>and</b> <b>adjustment</b> technique are also disclosed...|$|R
5000|$|In some situations, the Bonferroni {{correction}} {{is substantially}} conservative, i.e., the actual family-wise error rate {{is much less}} than the prescribed level α. This occurs when the test statistics are highly dependent (in the extreme case where the tests are perfectly dependent, the family-wise error rate with no multiple <b>comparisons</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>and</b> the per-test error rates are identical). For example, in fMRI analysis, tests are done on over 100,000 voxels in the brain. The Bonferroni method would require p-values to be smaller than [...]05/100000 to declare significance. Since adjacent voxels tend to be highly correlated, this threshold is generally too stringent.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{the issues of}} using overall survival (OS) as a primary endpoint {{in the presence of}} crossover and the statistical analyses available to adjust for confounded OS due to crossover in oncology clinical trials. Methods: An indirect comparison was conducted between pazopanib and sunitinib in advanced renal cell carcinoma. Statistical adjustment methods were used to estimate the true comparative effectiveness of these treatments. Recently, a head-to-head trial comparing pazopanib and sunitinib was completed. This provided the opportunity to compare the OS treatment effect estimated for pazopanib versus sunitinib using indirect <b>comparison</b> <b>and</b> statistical <b>adjustment</b> techniques with that observed in the head-to-head trial. Results: Using a rank-preserving structural failure time model to adjust for crossover in the pazopanib registration trial, the indirect comparison of pazopanib versus sunitinib resulted in an OS hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 97, while an unadjusted analysis resulted in an OS HR of 1. 96. The head-to-head trial reported a final OS HR of 0. 92 for pazopanib versus sunitinib. Conclusion: This case study supports the need to adjust for confounded OS due to crossover, which enables trials to meet ethical standards and provides decision makers with a more accurate estimate of treatment benefit...|$|R

Several studies concerning its perceptive threshold have been carried out previously. The resulting threshold values are somewhat scattered, varying between 4 % and more than 20 %. These studies differ in terms of sound stimuli, length of the reverberation, experiment design and experience of the subjects. In this study, a <b>comparison</b> <b>and</b> an <b>adjustment</b> experiments were carried out using three sound stimuli: white noise, male spoken words and an orchestral extract. The room impulse responses used in these comparisons are characterized by frequency-dependent decays. The reverberation time at 1000 Hz of the mean impulse response was 1, 89 s which is representative of a medium size concert hall. The subjects were students with half of them playing a musical instrument regularly. They had no prior experience in terms of perceptual audio testing. A differentiation threshold around 10 % is obtained, varying slightly with the experimental conditions and the sound stimuli.

This legislation emphasizes the importance of scientifically based research using high-quality experimental or nonexperimental designs for estimating the impact of reforms on student performance. This dissertation explores different nonexperimental approaches to estimating treatment effects because of their frequency of use in education, range in quality, and potential biases. Specifically, it empirically compares alternative <b>comparison</b> group matching <b>and</b> statistical methods for estimating the impact of the America 2 ̆ 7 s Choice Comprehensive School Reform model on the change in fourth-grade reading performance using publicly available school-level data from Florida. ^ The adequacy of the propensity score and multivariate matching methods in minimizing the average differences between treatment <b>and</b> <b>comparison</b> matches <b>and</b> balancing observed pre-treatment characteristics between these groups are compared. Additionally, different approaches for estimating treatment impacts are compared, including pre-post, repeated measures, fixed-effects, and random-effects methods. Matching <b>and</b> model-based <b>adjustment</b> are also compared. ^ Findings revealed that the comparison group selected with fixed-one propensity score matching was the most similar to the America 2 ̆ 7 s Choice schools on average; and that the different impact methods produced mostly similar impact estimates. Specifically, the pre-post and repeated measures methods, as well as the fixed-effects and random-effects repeated measures methods, produced mostly similar impact estimates when using model-based adjustment for both initial status and change characteristics (i. e., all controls). However, matching only <b>and</b> model-based <b>adjustment</b> only with all controls produced mostly different impact estimates. Furthermore, matching only and matching combined with model-based adjustment with all controls produced different impact estimates for the fixed-effects methods, but similar ones for the random-effects methods. Yet, matching combined with model-based <b>adjustment</b> <b>and</b> model-based <b>adjustment</b> only with all controls using the full comparison pool produced mostly similar impact estimates. ^ This research suggests that when treatment <b>and</b> potential <b>comparison</b> schools are largely dissimilar, the fixed-effects repeated measures method using the full <b>comparison</b> pool <b>and</b> model-based <b>adjustment</b> with all controls should be used to estimate treatment effects in contrast to any other combination of the pre-post or repeated measures methods or comparison groups examined. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES The SCTS have {{published}} mortality rates for cardiac surgery by named hospital since 2001 and by named surgeon since 2005. This clinical governance programme {{has been associated}} with improved mortality outcomes despite increasing numbers of high-risk patients undergoing surgery. We describe the process of analysing the 2008 - 11 in-hospital mortality data, including the management, data processing and statistical framework. METHODS All SCTS data from April- 2008 to March- 2011 were extracted from the central cardiac audit database. The data were cleaned and summaries, including missing data, returned to units for validation. Afterwards, the final extract was cleaned and procedures classed as emergency, salvage, transplantation, trauma or primary-VAD removed. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A contemporary recalibration of the logistic EuroSCORE model was developed for risk-adjustment. Funnel plots were used to detect outlier units with 95 % and 99 % two-sided confidence limits. One-sided 95 % confidence limits corrected for multiple <b>comparisons</b> <b>and</b> multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> for overdispersion are examined. RESULTS A total of 106, 982 records were included from 40 hospitals and 301 consultants. The mean mortality was 2. 7 % in all cardiac surgery. The recalibrated model was well calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P= 0. 56) and had good discrimination (AUC= 0. 78). Funnel plots were generated for each procedure group comparing 1) hospitals and 2) consultants. CONCLUSIONS The detection of ‘outlier’ healthcare providers is a challenging exercise and requires careful planning and analysis. By combing clinical and statistical expertise with robust methodology, we can reduce the chances of falsely classifying a unit as an ‘outlier’...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBuilding thermal {{performance}} and potential solar applications {{depend on the}} quality of the solar resource data available. Unfortunately, most of the locations do not account for measured solar radiation data and, as a result, rely on the values from typical meteorological years. Texas, in a similar fashion as other states in the US, does not have an active network for solar radiation data and has a variety of weather conditions that could be integrated into more than three climate zones. Therefore, in order to estimate reliable solar radiation for different locations in Texas, this paper presents the <b>comparison</b> <b>and</b> the <b>adjustment</b> between two models that use the meteorological data available from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The comparison study was based on sixteen solar stations that cover three climate zones in Texas and use hourly solar radiation data that was recorded from 2000 through 2002 and 2010 through 2012. In this study, the estimated and measured hourly global solar radiations were compared to evaluate which model would be most suitable in each location in Texas. The two models that were studied were a modified Cloud-cover Radiation Model (CRM) by Muneer and the model developed by Zhang and Huang. These models are regression type models that use location or site specific coefficients, which have shown a good correlation during the past years between measured global solar radiation and local meteorological parameters. Most of the locations in climate zone 2, in general, fit the Zhang–Huang Model better, whereas the CRM model presents a better correlation for climate zones 3 and 4...|$|R
40|$|Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP- 4) cleaves and inactivates the insulinotropic hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) and gastric {{inhibitory}} polypeptide, collectively termed incretins. DPP- 4 inhibitors entered {{clinical practice}} as approved therapeutics for type- 2 diabetes in 2006. However, inter-individual {{variance in the}} responsiveness to DPP- 4 inhibitors was reported. Thus, we asked whether genetic variation in the DPP 4 gene affects incretin levels, insulin secretion, and glucose tolerance in participants of the TÜbingen Family study for type- 2 diabetes (TÜF). Fourteen common (minor allele frequencies ≥ 0. 05) DPP 4 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 1, 976 non-diabetic TÜF participants characterized by oral glucose tolerance tests and bioimpedance measurements. In a subgroup of 168 subjects, plasma incretin levels were determined. We identified a variant, i. e., SNP rs 6741949, in intron 2 of the DPP 4 gene that, after correction for multiple <b>comparisons</b> <b>and</b> appropriate <b>adjustment,</b> revealed a significant genotype-body fat interaction effect on glucose-stimulated plasma GLP- 1 levels (p = 0. 0021). Notably, no genotype-BMI interaction effects were detected (p = 0. 8). After stratification for body fat content, the SNP negatively affected glucose-stimulated GLP- 1 levels (p = 0. 0229), insulin secretion (p = 0. 0061), and glucose tolerance (p = 0. 0208) in subjects with high body fat content only. A common variant, i. e., SNP rs 6741949, in the DPP 4 gene interacts with body adiposity and negatively affects glucose-stimulated GLP- 1 levels, insulin secretion, and glucose tolerance. Whether this SNP underlies the reported inter-individual variance in responsiveness to DPP- 4 inhibitors, at least in subjects with high body fat content, remains to be shown...|$|R
