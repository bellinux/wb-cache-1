40|$|We re-examine {{the view}} that capital taxes are too low when capital is mobile across tax jurisdictions. We do so by emphasising two {{previously}} neglected implications of non-cooperative capital tax setting in a fully dynamic environment. First, in a truly-dynamic environment, the returns to the non-capital factors of production and thereby disposable income and savings depend on predetermined capital stock. Thus, capital-market clearing interest rates depend also on past rates and taxes. Hence, taxes affect future interest rates, and thereby future consumption levels, capital stocks and tax revenues abroad. Second, in an overlapping generations economy, the effect of capital taxes on the current income of different generations {{is not the same}} across generations. The reason is that for old generations capital taxes affect the returns to their savings, while for younger generations capital taxes affect their non-capital income. This implies that capital taxes may produce an externality through affecting current <b>consumption</b> levels <b>abroad.</b> These two horizontal externalities may lead, ceteris paribus, to too high national capital taxes, and may more than offset the usual effects of tax competition. In this case, and contrary to conventional wisdom, national capital taxes will be too high...|$|R

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the performance of current screening criteria in identifying children with blood lead levels higher than 50 µg/L in France, and to propose new criteria. Data from a national French survey, conducted among 3831 children aged 6 months to 6 years in 2008 – 2009 were used. The sensitivity and specificity of the current criteria in predicting blood lead levels higher than or equal to 50 µg/L were evaluated. Two predictive models of BLL above 44 µg/L (for lack of sufficient sample size at 50 µg/L) were built: the first using current criteria, and the second using newly identified risk factors. For each model, performance was studied by calculating the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. The sensitivity of current criteria for detecting BLL higher than or equal to 50 µg/L was 0. 51 (0. 26; 0. 75) and specificity was 0. 66 (0. 62; 0. 70).

Auditing is, however, subject to regulation in Switzerland (World Trade Organisation 2008; OECD 2015 b). Obtaining an auditing license in Switzerland requires specific education and experience. Swiss certified auditors or university graduates with at least 12  years of practical experience fulfill these requirements. Additionally, foreigners with comparable education and experience who demonstrate sufficient knowledge of Swiss law may acquire an auditing license as long as a treaty with the country of origin exists or the country holds a reciprocal right (Art. 4 Law on Audit Supervision).

30|$|An IO {{approach}} {{addressed the}} percentage of CO 2 emissions in importing goods. According to Wyckoff and Roop (1994), the import of CO 2 intensive non-energy products can distort a particular country’s estimated CO 2 emissions level as an artificially low level. For example, if a country imports products from other countries which {{did not participate in}} an international agreement such as the Kyoto protocol, the CO 2 embodied in these imports would not be counted for CO 2 emissions level of the importing country. This {{is often referred to as}} a carbon leakage. Adopting an MRIO model and assuming that the technology level of trading countries is identical, they revealed about 13 % of the total CO 2 emissions of the six largest OECD countries – Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the U.S. – were originated from the manufacturing imports. Similarly, Nijdam et al. (2005) quantified the environmental load of Dutch private consumption using a single region IO model for GHG emissions. They revealed that food production, room heating and auto-car are the most important elements, presenting that 49 % of the environmental load of the <b>consumption</b> takes place <b>abroad.</b> Sánchez-Chóliz and Duarte (2005) also analyzed the sectoral impacts of Spanish international trade relationship on the present level of atmospheric pollution using the Spanish national IO model. They found that sectors such as transport material, mining and energy, non-metallic industries, chemical and metals are CO 2 exporters; other services, construction, transport material and food sectors are the major CO 2 importers.|$|R

It finds that the health sector is still dominated by public sector provision amidst a gradually developing private sector that is mainly supported by domestic investments. The participation of foreign firms is predominantly through management of local private hospitals by South African hospital groups. Botswana remains a net importer of health services, especially through <b>consumption</b> <b>abroad</b> from the neighbouring South Africa. Nonetheless, import substitution is gradually taking root through the growing private sector that provides services that were previously imported. There remains a significant level of dependence on foreign health professionals, especially specialist medical doctors to augment shortages in the domestic healthcare system. Despite local media reports indicating concerns about Botswana health professionals working outside the country, lack of data impedes the ability to analyse and appreciate the magnitude and possible impact of this movement on the economy and the health sector. The need for further research remains especially on the possible impact of liberalisation of trade in the health sector in order to adequately guide policy. Also, the current inadequacy of data makes it difficult to appreciate the trends in trade in health services, thus, there is need to develop data sets to support analysis and policy debates on the subject...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess welfare effects of {{regulating}} the banking sector in Morocco along the European Union lines. The agreement between the EU and Morocco, signed in February 1996 and came into force in March 2000, provides for the gradual establishment of an industrial free-trade zone by 2012 and progressive liberalization of trade in agriculture. The agreement between Morocco and the EU foresees, in addition to that, to start negotiations for a free trade area in services. The agreement contains, however, no binding commitments. But Morocco is expected to deepen further its relationships with Europe within the framework of the Neighboring Policy. The relevance of the issue of banking services’ liberalization goes beyond Morocco’s agreement with the EU. On the one hand, Morocco’s free trade agreement with the US encompasses services, more specifically financial services, in addition to manufactured goods, agricultural products, intellectual property rights, and government procurement. This agreement is expected to come into force in 2006. On the other hand, under GATS, Morocco is projected to increase its commitments and opens up further its banking sector to foreign competition. The last commitments made by Morocco in Uruguay Round were mainly under commercial presence (mode 3) as compared to cross border supply (mode 1) and <b>consumption</b> <b>abroad</b> (mode 2). Except lending to finance investment in Morocco or commercial transactions with Morocco allowed under the mode 1, no commitment has been made in other items (Achy 2002). Hence, there is a real need to understand opportunities and challenges of liberalizing banking services on the Moroccan economy. ...|$|E

After constructing a database showing the existence of limitations on market access and/or national treatment by each service sector, the study finds that the commitment level differs greatly between sensitive and less sensitive sectors, and that the commitment level under the ASEAN Framework Agreement (AFAS) is the highest among the four FTAs studied. It also finds that there are cross-country and sector-wide similarities {{in the pattern of}} service sector commitment under and across each of the FTAs; this implies that the shared domestic sensitivities can be overcome by a shared economic cooperation scheme for enhancing competitiveness (through FTA provisions). The study further highlights that, overall, Mode 4 (movement of people) gains least commitment, whereas Mode 2 (<b>consumption</b> <b>abroad)</b> gains most commitment under all the four FTAs studied. Turning to policy implications, there are two possibilities on the sequence of further streamlining the four FTAs: (1) Start within the same “clusters” among similarly committed countries under a particular FTA; then harmonize the level of commitments across all the signatory countries to the FTA; or (2) Start with harmonizing rather dissimilar countries from different “clusters” of commitments under a particular FTA, which provides small-scale “social experimenting”; then scale up this line of effort at an acceptably later stage {{to the level of the}} whole FTA, then eventually attempt to harmonize across all the FTAs centering on ASEAN.

Saper and colleagues in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 2004, the image of ayurveda as a safe alternative or complement to biomedicine has sharply deteriorated in North America and Europe. In reaction, some western countries have forbidden the import of the herbal products denounced by Saper and colleagues’ warning, and the Government of India has taken measures to implement its rules on their production to ensure the full safety of the products intended for both export and national markets. This seriously hinders the export of siddha remedies as they may contain metals, mercury being one of their iconic ingredients. It has also created problems for their production, as the companies that manufacture siddha products are, in general, less developed than their ayurvedic counterparts. I will discuss this event and its impact on regulations in Europe, the United States and Canada and in India {{in the first part of}} this chapter. In the second part, I will explore the ideological and spiritual position of siddha medicine and its relation to iatrochemistry in order to comprehend why it has the reputation of a metal- and mineral-based medicine, and in particular, a mercury-based medicine.

40|$|According to the GATS, {{services}} can be traded through four different modes of supply, namely, cross border supply, <b>consumption</b> <b>abroad,</b> commercial presence, and movement of natural persons, termed modes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. There is much evidence to indicate interdependence across these four modes in services trade. There are essentially {{two types of}} linkages, namely, positive and negative linkages, across the various modes of supply. Positive linkages {{take the form of}} (i) complementarities across modes, where one or more mode is simultaneously used for providing the service across borders; and (ii) facilitation across modes, where trade through one mode creates conditions that are conducive for trading through other modes. Negative linkages take the form of (i) substitution across modes, where trade through one mode is substituted by another; (ii) restrictions on one mode which affect trade through other modes of supply and distort the way in which a service is trade; and (iii) restrictions which apply across multiple modes and constrain several modes simultaneously. In addition to these first order linkages, there are also extended spillover effects across the modes that arise indirectly over the medium and long run. This paper discusses the various kinds of linkages that are found in service sector trade, using evidence from companies, countries, and surveys and {{from a wide range of}} services. The objective is to provide an integrated perspective on service sector trade and related multilateral negotiations under the GATS so that countries can better leverage cross modal and cross-subsectoral trade opportunities, address constraints in a holistic manner, and maximize the overall gains from services trade. ...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the high}} flows of imports and exports {{compared}} to Dutch production, {{the economy in the}} Netherlands can be considered as being far from closed. Environmental pressure in the Netherlands originates therefore partly from production of goods for <b>consumption</b> <b>abroad.</b> Conversely, consumption by Dutch households causes environmental pressure in foreign countries. The result is a shift of environmental pressure from the Netherlands to abroad and vice versa. Determining this shift is done by calculating environmental pressure along production-consumption chains by using a methodology based on an input-output analysis. The shift is calculated for four environmental aspects, i. e. energy use, land use, acidification and disturbance. Energy use in the Netherlands is about 50 % higher than required for consumption in Dutch households. Especially heavy chemical and metal industries export a major part of production, either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, exported products from the agricultural, transport and service sectors implicate more energy use than imported products from these sectors. This picture continues to fit the future scenarios calculated for the year 2030. The land required for consumption by the Dutch population is about three times the area of the Netherlands. The main use of this land is timber production, necessitating import. Since acidification is closely related to energy use and Dutch factory farming contributes greatly to the acid emissions, the 'flow' of acid emissions from foreign countries to the Netherlands is lower than from the Netherlands to other countries. Finally, disturbance in the Netherlands is mainly coupled to direct consumption in households and delivery of services to the Dutch population, while shifting disturbance to other countries is of particular importance in the transport sector...|$|E

Preliminary calculations show that in order to reach the per capita level of consumption of such countries the Soviet Union should increase its production level about 2. 5 times. But this is only a general goal. To determine scientifically the necessary growth not only of the whole economy, but also of its branches and to establish the level of production for the whole product as well as for individual goods, we must solve such methodological questions as the following: in comparing per capita consumption here with the <b>consumption</b> <b>abroad</b> should we take into consideration exports? Should we consider the fact that the standard of living of a considerable portion of the population in the most developed capitalist countries, including the United States, is extremely low? Should we mechanically aim at the American level of consumption or, what would be more correct, in a number of cases, take theoretical standards (for example, in respect to the basic foods, clothing, footwear, household appliances, means of transportation) ? And so on, and so on. On the basis of the methods worked out we may concretely determine the quantitative levels of production necessary for the solution of this basic economic problem. Of course, production will continue to grow even after reaching this goal. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} liberalization of temporary movements of individual service suppliers on total merchandise trade and on trade in services. In particular, the paper looks at {{the impact of the}} so-called forth mode to provide a service (Mode 4 in the GATS terminology) on trade in services under the other three modes: cross-border service supply (Mode 1), <b>consumption</b> <b>abroad</b> (Mode 2) and commercial presence abroad (Mode 3). Estimates are obtained using a gravity model of trade augmented for a measure of temporary movements of service suppliers. Estimates of the size of a country's Mode 4 trade in services are based on specific information regarding the number of temporary foreign workers occupied in the service sector and their estimated average earnings, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional measures of Mode 4 based on remittances or compensation for employees. In order to obtain unbiased estimators, multilateral resistances for tariffs and remoteness are introduced in the gravity equation. The study finds a positive and significant effect of temporary movements of service providers on merchandise trade. For example, a 10 per cent increase in temporary movement of service providers increases US imports by approximately 3 per cent and exports by a minimum of 1. 8 per cent and a maximum of 2. 7 per cent. As to trade in services, it is found that a 10 per cent increase in the temporary movement of people increases services imports (exports) under Mode 1 by 4. 7 (2. 9) per cent, and it is linked to over 7 per cent higher foreign direct investment inflows and outflows. No significant relationship is found between services trade under Mode 2 and Mode 4. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), in the Uruguay Round, and its entry into force in 1995 marked a new stage {{in the history of}} the multilateral system. It was motivated essentially by the rapid expansion of international services trade within an increasingly open environment in many countries. Given the peculiarities of services trade, including the intangible nature of the products concerned and the need for direct contact between supplier and user in many cases, the Agreement contains a variety of conceptual innovations, including its extension to modes of supply beyond conventional cross-border trade (<b>consumption</b> <b>abroad,</b> commercial presence, and presence of natural persons) and its coverage, and legitimization, of various types of non-tariff restrictions. In turn, the new concepts needed time to be absorbed by the ministries and agencies involved in services trade. Further, the positive-list, or bottom-up, approach to scheduling trade commitments under the GATS meant that great flexibility was given to Members in selecting the sectors concerned and specifying the levels of access provided under individual modes. Thus, not surprisingly, the schedules that emerged from the Uruguay Round, which still account for the majority of current commitments, contain a variety of unclear or superfluous entries that may cause interpretation problems. Their solution could contribute significantly to the clarity and comparability of access obligations across sectors and WTO Members. The scheduling conventions agreed for the Doha Round thus provide specifically for the possibility of technical refinements that leave the substance of commitments unchanged. However, not only was this possibility used more sparingly to date than might have been expected, but additional flaws would be introduced if some current offers were to enter into effect. The following discussion, with a focus on a particular group of entries (market access via commercial presence), tries to explain the scope for such refinements and develop a clearer picture of the areas where further action might be needed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economics}} of trade policy in financial services, highlighting differences between trade across borders and through commercial presence. Trade liberalization could complement other financial reforms by enhancing the efficiency, quality, and variety of financial services and by encouraging improvement of financial regulations and practices. However, it raises sectoral, strategic, and cultural concerns. The design of trade policy should therefore emphasize the nexus with the macroeconomic framework and other financial sector policies, especially prudential and capital account regulations. It should also differentiate between types of trade. National reforms should be coordinated with multilateral trade agreements and initiatives on international financial architecture.

40|$|There {{are major}} {{difficulties}} associated with measurement {{of each of}} the four modes of services trade delivery as defined in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) : cross-border supply, <b>consumption</b> <b>abroad,</b> commercial presence, and movement of natural persons. The consequence is that the extent of global trade in services is hugely underestimated and the services sector does not receive the trade and economic policy attention it deserves. The global economy meanwhile misses out on the productivity gains that focused reform of services sectors could generate. Australia is one of the world's most services-intensive economies. Of the 20 largest world economies, Australia's is fourth only to the United States, United Kingdom, and France in services. This means Australias future economic growth will be substantially determined by improvements in productivity and competitiveness in services. Just a small rise of 0. 1 % in services sector productivity would result in a sustained annual rise of over A$ 1 billion in Australia's gross domestic product. But the services sector does not receive the policy focus these economic fundamentals would justify. This is largely because the balance of payments data measures Australia's services exports at less than 25 % of total exports, consistent with World Trade Organization estimates that services account for roughly 20 % of world trade. In Australia's case, sufficient business survey work has been done to leave no remaining doubt that the balance of payments data have needed to be both improved in their own right as well as supplemented with foreign affiliates' trade in services (FATS) data to shed greater light on the services sector's share in international business. This paper highlights recent business case studies in Australia, which demonstrates the importance of intensifying official efforts to enhance collections of services export data and to measure specifically Mode 3 (Commercial Presence) delivery of international services. The studies are drawn chiefly from legal services and financial services but also cover the information and communication technology and architecture/building design sectors. This paper focuses on some of the problems commonly experienced in relation to statistics regarding international trade in services. It deals moreover only with case studies drawn from Australian business experience; and refers to practices and collections of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) ...|$|E
