5|$|Tregelles dated the {{manuscript}} to the 8th century. Tregelles {{was aware that}} the handwriting is typical for the 6th century, but the handwriting of the commentary is much older. The letters ΕΘΟΣ are round, high, and narrow, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> written before the 8th century. C. R. Gregory supported Tregelles's point of view. According to Nicholas Pocock, {{the manuscript}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> written before the 6th century nor after the 8th century.|$|E

5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E

Such claims could not be independently verified by Western reporters.

5|$|Sampson felt, in 1995, {{that there}} was not enough {{evidence}} to conclude that Achelousaurus was a direct descendant of Einiosaurus. Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein Achelousaurus split off between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{attained}} {{its greatest}} geographic extent, but the attempted union with Russia <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> achieved, as the systemic, {{cultural and religious}} incompatibilities between the two empires proved to be insurmountable. The territorial annexations and the ruthlessly conducted wars left a legacy of injustice suffered and desire for revenge {{on the part of}} the Russian ruling classes and people. The huge military effort weakened the Commonwealth and the painful consequences of the adventurous policies of the Vasa court and its allied magnates were soon to be felt.|$|E
5|$|The {{apex of the}} Counter-Reformation {{activity}} {{had fallen}} on {{the turn of the}} 17th century, the earlier years of the reign of Sigismund III Vasa (Zygmunt III Waza), who in cooperation with the Jesuits and some other Church circles attempted to strengthen the power of his monarchy. The King tried to limit access to higher offices to Catholics. Anti-Protestant riots took place in some cities. During the Sandomierz Rebellion of 1606 the Protestants supported the anti-King opposition in large numbers. Nevertheless, the massive wave of szlachta's return to Catholicism <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> stopped.|$|E

5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea {{is a testament to the}} belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|The timing <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{better for}} the Vale Royal community, for in a storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the {{unfinished}} nave of their abbey church collapsed, and rebuilding <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full. It {{has been suggested that}} the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with the appropriation by the feofees, was too soon after the storm to realistically have been in response to that event. Given that the abbey was already – and remained – in debt, the reason for the appropriation was probably related to that. As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest of the church to be maintained by the parish.|$|E

5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied {{that he was a}} spy. The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had {{made their way to the}} Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E
5|$|At night, Francis spies on Dr. Caligari and observes {{what appears}} to be Cesare {{sleeping}} in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Dr. Caligari's sideshow and realize that the 'Cesare' sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Dr. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum.|$|E
5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E
