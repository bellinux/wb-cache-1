40|$|A safe, convenient, and {{economical}} method of preparing and dispensing a {{large volume of}} sterile water in a movable container is described. A <b>caster-mounted,</b> rectangular, 100 -gal, stainless-steel water tank was fabricated. An audible, solid-state water-level alarm was developed for use with a detachable sensing probe that could be autoclaved. A filter system was constructed to allow the tank to be autoclaved as an open vessel. Thermocouples were mounted within the tank of water to study the time-temperature relationships of the water during the sterilization cycle. In a downward displacement autoclave with a hot jacket, 75 min were required for the water temperature to rise from 140 to 240 F (60 to 116 C). A total of 3 hr for heating and holding includes an adequate safety factor to insure the sterility of the water immediately after autoclaving. The long-term sterility {{of the water and}} the safety of the system were verified by using the water to maintain a germ-free animal colony...|$|E
