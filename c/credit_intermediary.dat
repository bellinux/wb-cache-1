30|$|In general, it may {{be noted}} that banks attach less {{importance}} to qualitative information than entrepreneurs. The only information the banks deem highly relevant is that regarding the organization.

30|$|The {{distance}} between innovator entrepreneurs and external financiers becomes particularly relevant when the financing relationship involves <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> In this case, informational opacity between the funder and funded becomes {{an obstacle to}} access credit, as innovator entrepreneurs seem to ignore the relevance of all the quantitative information required by the bank (hypothesis H. 8 confirmed).|$|R

In fact, on average, 59 % believe that qualitative information is critical to investment decisions.

30|$|The {{convenience}} of a costly investment to collect confidential information may be, however, greater for decisions of opening credit lines to large enterprises, considering {{the amount of}} loans. In this way, larger <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> could be encouraged to adopt different approaches towards {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} and large companies: transaction banking towards SMEs and relationship lending towards large enterprises.|$|R
30|$|Obviously, the {{difficulties}} of collecting information on intangible capital are different in large firms than small and medium sized (SMEs). Large firms have a greater capacity to generate information and a greater market visibility. <b>Credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> can sometimes even indirectly access qualitative information about the company, catching the signalling of the industry in which the company operates (Banks and Sobel 1987; Brighi 2006).|$|R

40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in securitisation activity experienced in Europe {{in the years following}} the introduction of the euro has altered the liquidity, credit and maturity transformation role traditionally performed by banks.

We use a novel database of securitisation activity and a large sample of European banks and find that the use of securitisation shelters banks' loan supply from the effects of monetary policy. Securitisation activity has also strengthened banks' capacity to supply new loans. This capacity, however, depends on business cycle conditions and, notably, on banks' risks positions. The recent credit crisis is instructive in this respect. Asset securitisation Bank lending channel Monetary policy...|$|R

From this perspective, particularly interesting has been considered the experience of those banking systems, where the high level of debt achieved by families, can play a determinant role on the availability of credit for the whole economy.

40|$|This essay {{makes the}} case that the USPS is in a unique {{position}} to provide much-needed financial services for the large population of unbanked or underbanked Americans. First, the post office can offer credit at lower rates than fringe lenders by taking advantage of economies of scale as well as their position in the federal bureaucracy. Second, they already have branches in many low-income neighborhoods that have been long deserted by commercial banks. And, third, people at every level of society, including the unbanked, have a level of familiarity and comfort with the post office that they do not have with more formal banking institutions. This essay moves one step further by demonstrating why government support and even subsidies to enable the endeavor are appropriate and justifiable. First, banking-related subsidies are grounded in historical practice, as demonstrated by government support for credit unions, savings and loans, and student loans. Postal banking derives from these longstanding practices, but broadens the scope to include the poor and not just the middle class. Further, state support of banking throughout U. S. history has operated much like a social contract: the state supports the banking system in a variety of ways and in return, banks are to be <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> providing the populace with access to loans and financial services. Thus subsidies for banking have been justified because they provide a benefit to all citizens. Mainstream banks have met a portion of their obligation, but a large portion of the population — the poor — have been left out.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theory of}} money, whose value depends on {{the functioning of the}} intermediary sector, and a unified framework for analyzing the interaction between price and financial stability. Households that happen to be productive in this period finance their capital purchases with <b>credit</b> from <b>intermediaries</b> and from their own savings. Less productive household save by holding deposits with intermediaries (inside money) or outside money. Intermediation involves risk-taking, and intermediaries’ ability to lend is compromised when they suffer losses. After an adverse productivity shock, credit and inside money shrink, and the value of (outside) money increases, causing deflation that hurts borrowers even further. An accommodating monetary policy in downturns can mitigate these destabilizing adverse feedback effects. Lowering short-term interest rates increases the value of long-term bonds, recapitalizes the intermediaries by redistributes wealth. While this policy helps the economy ex-post, ex-ante it can lead to excessive risk-taking by the intermediary sector. Preliminary and Incomplete.

40|$|The high {{household}} debt level, {{as seen in}} recent years, has been a concern for many governments and financial institutions because {{of the decline in}} the well-being of households and the financial burden indebted households pose on the economy. A household that cannot afford to service its debt repayments will ultimately experience a decrease in its standard of living, and many other essential monthly expenses such as school fees may be “crowded out” by the debt repayments. An alarming trend is the high levels of debt that households have indulged in, with little regard for the negative consequences of such accumulated debt. Households which are unable to service their debt repayments put a strain on the economy and contribute to an increase in the cost of credit, DTI (2003). Consequentially, <b>credit</b> <b>intermediaries</b> will experience high bad debts and thus, in turn, will factor this cost into the overall cost of credit. The high {{household debt}} levels are caused by both demand and supply side factors such as the overall decrease in interest rates, greater financial inclusion post- 1994, a lack of financially educated consumers, vague debt contracts and reckless credit lending by financial <b>intermediaries,</b> National <b>Credit</b> Regulator (2012). Excessive debt could indicate that the debt level has surpassed all other indicators such as household income and net wealth, which would make debt unsustainable in the long run. The aim of this research is to analyse the South African household debt levels and to assess whether the implementation of the National Credit Act has had the desired effect on household debt levels. The research will rely on previous literature and use time series data extracted from The South African Reserve Bank to complete regression analysis. The research begins by introducing the concept of excessive debt and highlighting the current debt levels in South Africa. The literature review covers the causes, advantages and disadvantages of debt, and the last section covers the results of the South African household debt trends. The results indicate that household debt has indeed increased at an alarming rate, and these debt levels continue to rise. The research highlights the implications of over-indebtedness on both the microeconomic and macroeconomic level, and the dire consequences that can cripple the economy if household debt levels continue to increase unabated. It is imperative that policies set out by the National Credit Regulator succeed in curbing household over-indebtedness sooner rather than later, to assist and protect the households which are already over-indebted and prevent further over-indebtedness. The research reveals that households will continue to battle with over-indebtedness, thus the importance for policies to be in place to protect both the consumers and financial services provides, and ultimately the economy...|$|R
