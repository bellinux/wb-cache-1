25|$|By 1906 it {{had become}} clear that Port Victoria would not develop into a major <b>continental</b> <b>sea</b> port and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) began to look for new {{opportunities}} to bring in revenue. In July of that year seven wooden halts were constructed: Milton Road, Milton Range, Denton, Uralite, Beluncle, Middle Stoke and Grain Crossing. Uralite halt was named after the nearby British Uralite plc complex which had opened in 1899 and manufactured drainage pipes from wet asbestos paste. On 1 May 1915, the little-used Milton Road Halt was closed. The branch line to Allhallows-on-sea was opened on 16 May 1932 followed on 17 July 1932 by opening of another halt at Stoke Junction. A new station opened at Grain on 3 September 1951, replacing Grain Crossing Halt, which closed to rail traffic on 11 July 1951 and passengers on 3 September 1951 - a bus service being provided between those dates.|$|E
2500|$|Elasmosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Campanian-age Upper Cretaceous Pierre Shale of western Kansas. The Pierre Shale {{represents}} a period of marine deposition from the Western Interior Seaway, a shallow <b>continental</b> <b>sea</b> that submerged much of central North America during the Cretaceous. At its largest, the Western Interior Seaway stretched from the Rockies east to the Appalachians, some [...] wide. At its deepest, it may have been only [...] deep, shallow in terms of seas. Two great continental watersheds drained into it from east and west, diluting its waters and bringing resources in eroded silt that formed shifting delta systems along its low-lying coasts. There was little sedimentation on the eastern shores of the Seaway; the western boundary, however, consisted of a thick clastic wedge eroded eastward from the Sevier orogenic belt. The western shore was thus highly variable, depending on variations in sea level and sediment supply.|$|E

50|$|The bedrock, with a {{depth of}} about 400 m, is made up mainly of {{sedimentary}} minerals. In the Spessart is found {{a great deal of}} bunter.

50|$|Between {{approximately}} 2.640 and 2.516  Ga, two successive stromatolitic carbonate platforms {{developed in}} the basin of the Kaapvaal craton. Oldest was the Schmidtsdrif Subgroup, deposited in the southwestern part of the basin, showing stromatolitic carbonates, siliciclastic sediments and small lava flows. This {{was followed by the}} Nauga formation carbonates deposited on peritidal flats in the southwest, which were inundated during a marine transgression of the Transvaal Supergroup <b>continental</b> <b>sea,</b> at some 2.550  Ga. This resulted in a carbonate platform in the Transvaal and Griqualand West Basins, lastingfor 30-50  Ma. Shales were deposited during this period over the Nauga Formation carbonates. Following this a subsidence led to immersion of the stromatolitic platform and to sediments of iron-rich banded iron formations being laid down over the entire basin.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the Blitz (bombing of {{population}} centres), which eventually killed over 40,000 civilians but which gave British industry the breathing space it needed to provide the fighter aircraft and ammunition to hold off invasion, docks on the south coast such as Southampton, Portsmouth and Plymouth were heavily damaged by German bombing raids; in response as much maritime traffic as possible was directed to the west and north. On 16 August the Luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed Tilbury Docks and the Port of London, which normally handled a million tons of cargo per week. To the Nazis' glee, the skipper of one Brazilian freighter stated that southern Britain was finished and nothing could save her, but although the damage was severe, ships from all parts of the Empire, South America and the Far East continued to unload food and war goods for Britain and to load cargoes for export. With no passenger trade, and with all Scandinavian and <b>continental</b> <b>sea</b> traffic suspended, the port was far less busy than normal, but as many as 35,000 men still filled the warehouses with grain, tobacco, flour, tea, rubber, sugar, meat, wool, timber and leather every day throughout August 1940. British aircraft factories, led by the Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook worked around the clock to greatly increase production and prevent a collapse of the RAF. On 16 September Time Magazine wrote [...] "Even if Britain goes down this fall, it will not be Lord Beaverbrook's fault. If she holds out, it will be his triumph. This war is a war of machines.

40|$|During the Cretaceous major {{episodes of}} oceanic anoxic {{conditions}} triggered large scale deposition of marine black shales rich in organic carbon. Several oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) {{have been documented}} including the Cenomanian to Turonian OAE 2, which is among the best studied examples to date. This study reports on a large limestone body that occurs within a black shale succession exposed in a coastal section of the Tarfaya Basin, Morocco. The black shales were deposited {{in the aftermath of}} OAE 2 in a shallow <b>continental</b> <b>sea.</b> To decipher the mode and causes of carbonate formation in black shales, a combination of element geochemistry, palaeontology, thin section petrography, carbon and oxygen stable isotope geochemistry and lipid biomarkers are used. The ¹³C-depleted biphytanic diacids reveal that the carbonate deposit resulted, at least in part, from microbially-mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane in the shallow subseafloor at a hydrocarbon seep. The lowest obtained δ¹³Ccarbonate values of − 23. 5 ‰ are not low enough to exclude other carbon sources than methane apart from admixed marine carbonate, indicating a potential contribution from in situ remineralization of organic matter contained in the black shales. Nannofossil and trace metal inventories of the black shales and the macrofaunal assemblage of the carbonate body reveal that environmental conditions became less reducing during the deposition of the background shales that enclose the carbonate body, but the palaeoenvironment was overall mostly characterized by high productivity and episodically euxinic bottom waters. This study reconstructs the evolution of a hydrocarbon seep that was situated within a shallow <b>continental</b> <b>sea</b> in the aftermath of OAE 2, and sheds light on how these environmental factors influenced carbonate formation and the ecology at the seep site...|$|E

We also observe a period (∼ 2 hours) of intense dissipation within the pcynocline implying a very much elevated vertical heat flux at that time. We speculate that the observation of enhanced dissipation {{is consistent with a}} shear spiking mechanism observed in temperate shelf seas. The results highlight the intermittent nature of Arctic shelf sea mixing processes, and how they can impact on the transformation of Arctic Ocean water masses. The observations also clearly demonstrate that the absence or presence of sea ice profoundly affects the availability of near-inertial kinetic energy to drive vertical mixing on Arctic shelves...|$|E

50|$|Recently, a few coccoliths {{have been}} {{reported}} from late Pliocene and Pleistocene central Arctic sediment (Worsley and Herman, 1980).

The sediment record as well as theoretical considerations make strong argument against alternating ice-covered and ice-free....The probable Middle Cenozoic development of an ice cover, accompanied by Antarctic ice development and a late shift of the Gulf Stream to its present position, were important {{events that led to}} the development of modern climates.

40|$|In Life Cycle Assessment and Comparative Risk Assessment {{potential}} {{human exposure}} to toxic pollutants {{can be expressed}} as the human intake fraction (iF), representing the fraction of the quantity emitted that enters the human population. To assess model uncertainty in the human intake fraction, ingestion and inhalation iFs of 367 substances emitted to air and freshwater were calculated with two commonly applied multi-media fate and exposure models, CalTOX and USES-LCA. Comparison of the model outcomes reveal that uncertainty in the ingestion iFs was up to a factor of 70. The uncertainty in the inhalation iFs was up to a factor of 865, 000. The comparison showed that relatively few model differences account for the uncertainties found. An optimal model structure in the calculation of human intake fractions {{can be achieved by}} including (1) rain and no-rain scenarios, (2) a <b>continental</b> <b>sea</b> water compartment, (3) drinking water purification, (4) pH-correction of chemical properties, and (5) aerosol-associated deposition on plants.

40|$|The palaeontological, geochemical and mineralogical {{records of}} core GNS 84 -C 106 were {{analysed}} {{in order to}} reconstruct palaeohydrological changes and palaeoproductivity patterns in the Gulf of Salerno for the last 34 kyr. This approach, including compositional analysis of planktonic and benthic assemblages, gave an insight into the relationships between <b>continental,</b> <b>sea</b> surface and bottom environmental changes. The main source of variability of planktonic and benthic assemblages is related respectively to sea surface temperature and palaeobathymetry. Interrelated changes in surface salinity, nutrients, density gradient {{in the water column}} and organic fluxes at the bottom act as a secondary factor controlling the composition of both planktonic and benthic assemblages. The highest palaeoproductivity rates were reached during an interval spanning from late glacial to Middle Holocene, in conditions of enhanced continental run-off. During the Early and Middle Holocene, reduced surface salinity and density stratification were also coupled with the development of a deep chlorophyll maximum and enhanced flux or organic matter at the bottom. From about 6. 5 kyr B. P. onward, a sharp reduction in palaeoproductivity took place, coupled with an increase in surface salinities...|$|E
40|$|Lytic and {{lysogenic}} {{viral infection}} was investigated throughout the Southern Ocean at sites spanning the sub-Antarctic zone, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and an Antarctic <b>continental</b> <b>sea.</b> Higher lytic virus activity {{was recorded in}} the more productive sub-Antarctic zone than in the iron-limited waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during two transects. Reduced lytic viral activity in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current was combined with a shift toward lysogenic infection, probably resulting from the lower concentration of potential prokaryotic hosts. Superimposed on this variation, lytic viral production was lower in a transect completed in the Drake Passage in autumn (1. 8 × 108 to 1. 5 × 109 liter− 1 day− 1) than over the Greenwich Meridian during summer (5. 1 × 108 to 2. 0 × 1010 cells liter− 1 day− 1), indicating that viral activity {{is linked to the}} overall seasonal fluctuations in biotic activity. Interestingly, while prokaryotic abundance was lowest in the coastal Weddell Sea, levels of bacterial and lytic viral production (4. 3 × 108 to 1. 7 × 1010 cells liter− 1 day− 1) in this area were {{similar to those of the}} other zones. This may explain the weak relationship between the distribution of prokaryotes and chlorophyll in the Weddell Sea, as a high turnover of prokaryotic biomass may have been stimulated by the availability of substrates in the form of viral lysate. With estimated carbon and iron releases of 0. 02 to 7. 5 μg liter− 1 day− 1 and 1. 5 to 175. 7 pg liter− 1 day− 1, respectively, viral activity in the Southern Ocean is shown to be a major contributor to satisfying the elemental requirements of microbes, notably prokaryotes in the Weddell Sea and phytoplankton in the sub-Antarctic zone...|$|E
