25|$|A {{variety of}} techniques, most notably narrow <b>correlator</b> spacing, have been {{developed}} to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address shorter delay multipath from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a choke ring antenna) may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. Short delay reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.|$|E

40|$|Model-based <b>correlators</b> are in nowdays {{widely used}} in {{disciplines}} such as communications and underwater acoustics. These class of methods generally make strong assumptions on the data underlying physical model and develop dedicated processors that fully exploit the model structure. When the assumed model is a good description of the data, these methods achieve very high quality results since, in the mismatch free case, they are optimal for the single signal in white noise scenario. However, in presence of model mismatch this result is degraded.
