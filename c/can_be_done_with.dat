5|$|The actual welding {{technique}} utilized {{depends on the}} electrode, {{the composition of the}} workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed. Flat welds require the least operator skill, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.|$|E
5|$|The same {{surface tension}} {{demonstration}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> water, lime water or even saline, {{but only on}} a surface made of a substance to which water does not adhere. Wax is such a substance. Water poured onto a smooth, flat, horizontal wax surface, say a waxed sheet of glass, will behave similarly to the mercury poured onto glass.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, dragonflies and damselflies are {{sought out}} as a hobby similar to birding and butterflying, known as oding, from the Latin name of the {{dragonfly}} order, Odonata. Oding is especially popular in Texas, where 225 different species of odonates have been observed. With care, and with dry fingers, dragonflies can be handled and released by oders, as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> butterflies, {{though it is not}} encouraged.|$|E

5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, what <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> various objects that exist in the setting, and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E
5|$|As in Final Fantasy XII, {{enemies are}} {{integrated}} into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen {{similar to those used}} in previous Final Fantasy titles. A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the previous game's version of the series' Active Time Battle (ATB) system, called the Command Synergy Battle system. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Abilities, or Item. Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills at a constant rate to a set maximum number of slots. The kinds of attack actions available are close-range melee attacks or ranged magical attacks, {{but there are also}} other magical actions that evoke healing or shielding abilities. The ATB bar can be increased in size throughout the game from three slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of combat, and the characters' health is fully restored after each fight. Players have the option of restarting a battle while {{in the middle of a}} fight. During some skirmishes, players are put through quick time events called Cinematic Actions that allows them to deal higher damage to foes and end certain battles.|$|E

25|$|Birdwatching, or birding, {{is a form}} of {{wildlife}} observation in which the observation of birds is a recreational activity.

25|$|The {{experiment}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> entities {{much larger}} than electrons and photons, although it becomes more difficult as size increases.

25|$|Cleaning {{of human}} remains varies by type. If necessary, surface {{cleaning}} of bone <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> a very mild detergent and water solution, but bones {{should never be}} soaked {{in order to prevent}} dirt from becoming embedded in pores. The possibility of cleaning human remains is highly dependent on the fragility of the specimen.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{altering}} cloud precipitation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> {{the use of}} dry ice. It was widely used in experiments in the US in the 1950s and early 60s before it was replaced by silver iodide. Dry ice {{has the advantage of}} being relatively cheap and completely non-toxic. Its main drawback is the need to be delivered directly into the supercooled region of clouds being seeded.|$|E
25|$|Forecasting {{the life}} {{expectancy}} directly, generally using ARIMA or other time series extrapolation procedures: that {{has the advantage of}} simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other life table results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> any common statistical/mathematical software package, like EViews, R, SAS, Stata, Matlab, or SPSS.|$|E

25|$|Rearing is {{also another}} method {{that can bring}} the most rewards. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> wild host eggs or laboratory-prepared host eggs that are exposed in {{suitable}} habitats outside. They can then be taken in after a sufficient amount of time has passed and examined for developing fairyflies. With this method, {{it is possible to}} observe the life history and determine the hosts of particular species of discovered fairyflies.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{laboratory}} diagnosis of measles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> confirmation of positive measles IgM antibodies or isolation of measles virus RNA from respiratory specimens. For people unable {{to have their}} blood drawn, saliva can be collected for salivary measles-specific IgA testing. Positive contact with other patients known to have measles adds strong epidemiological evidence to the diagnosis. Any contact with an infected person, including semen through sex, saliva, or mucus, can cause infection.|$|E
25|$|Repeated plays {{also make}} it clearer why {{switching}} is the better strategy. After the player picks his card, it is already determined whether switching will win the round for the player. If this is not convincing, the simulation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the entire deck. (Gardner 1959b; Adams 1990). In this variant, the car card goes to the host 51 times out of 52, and stays with the host {{no matter how many}} non-car cards are discarded.|$|E
