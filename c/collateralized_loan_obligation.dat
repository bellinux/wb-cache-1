40|$|<b>Collateralized</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Obligations</b> (CLOs) {{were one}} of the largest and fastest growing {{segments}} of the structured finance market, fueling the 2003 - 2007 boom in syndicated loans and leveraged buyouts.

50|$|Not all collateralized debt {{obligations}} (CDOs) are credit derivatives. For example, a CDO made up {{of loans}} is merely a securitizing of loans that is then tranched based on its credit rating. This particular securitization {{is known as a}} <b>collateralized</b> <b>loan</b> <b>obligation</b> (CLO) and the investor receives the cash flow that accompanies the paying of the debtor to the creditor. Essentially, a CDO is held up by a pool of assets that generate cash. A CDO only becomes a derivative when it is used in conjunction with credit default swaps (CDS), in which case it becomes a Synthetic CDO. The main difference between CDOs and derivatives is that a derivative is essentially a bilateral agreement in which the payout occurs during a specific event which is tied to the underlying asset.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{class of}} owner may receive larger yields in {{exchange}} for being the first in line to risk losing money if the businesses fail to repay the loans that a CLO has purchased.

The lead bank retains a minority amount of the loan while usually maintaining [...] "agent" [...] responsibilities representing the interests of the syndicate of CLOs as well as servicing the loan payments to the syndicate (though the lead bank can designate another bank to assume the agent bank role upon syndication closing). The loans are usually termed [...] "high risk", [...] "high yield", or [...] "leveraged", that is, loans to companies which owe an above average amount of money for their size and kind of business, usually because a new business owner has borrowed funds against the business to purchase it (known as a [...] "leveraged buyout"), because the business has borrowed funds to buy another business, or because the enterprise borrowed funds to pay a dividend to equity owners.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new insights}} into the nature of loan securitization. We analyze the use of <b>collateralized</b> <b>loan</b> <b>obligation</b> (CLO) transactions by European banks from 1997 to 2004 and try to identify the influence that various firm-specific and macroeconomic factors may have on an institution's securitization decision. We find that not only regulatory capital arbitrage under Basel I has been driving the market. Rather, our results suggest that loan securitization is an appropriate funding tool for banks with high risk and low liquidity. It may also have been used by commercial banks to indirectly access investment-bank activities and the associated gains...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} recent innovations in financial markets has been the development of credit derivative products that allow banks to more actively manage their credit portfolios than ever before. We analyse the effect that access to these markets has had on the lending behaviour of a sample of banks, using a sample of banks that have not accessed these markets as a control group. We find that banks that adopt advanced credit risk management techniques (proxied by the issuance of at least one <b>collateralized</b> <b>loan</b> <b>obligation)</b> experience a permanent increase in their target loan levels of around 50 %. Partial adjustment to this target, however, means that the impact on actual loan levels is spread over several years.
