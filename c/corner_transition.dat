40|$|AbstractIn five-axis {{machining}} {{the trajectory}} {{is composed of}} linear path which has the feature of tangential discontinuity, so that the velocity will be abrupt or be equal to zero {{at the corner of}} the adjacent segments. This problem greatly effects the machining efficiency and quality. So a pair of double cubic NURBS curves satisfying the predefined fitting accuracy are used to fair the corners of the adjacent five-axis linear segments and generate the smooth tool path. On the basis of the proposed transition model, the parametric synchronization of the smoothed double NURBS trajectories and the remained two linear segments are respectively constructed to realize the smoothing variation along the tool trajectory. The approximation error has an analytical relationship with the transition length of the smoothed curve. It is easily to construct the analytical double NURBS curves satisfying the pre-defined error limit. The simulation and experiment examples show that the proposed transition algorithm can satisfy the error constraint, generate the curvature-continuous double NURBS tool path, make local <b>corner</b> <b>transition</b> smooth and improve the machining quality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Curving {{tool paths}} {{composed}} of straight lines, {{which are often}} represented as G 01 blocks, are still the most widespread format form in the machining process chain of CAD/CAM/CNC. At the junctions between consecutive segments, the tangency and curvature discontinuities may lead to feedrate fluctuation and acceleration oscillation, which would deteriorate the machining efficiency and quality. In this paper, a real-time look-ahead interpolation methodology is proposed, which adopts a curvature-continuous PH curve as a transition to blend corner at the junction of adjacent lines in the tool path. The blending algorithm can guarantee the approximation error exactly, and the control points of the curve can be calculated analytically. On the other hand, the arc length and the curvature of the transition curve, which are important items in speed planning, also have analytical expressions. All the advantages are the guarantee of calculation efficiency during the interpolation. Except for a curvature-continuous tool path, our look-ahead algorithm adopts a speed planning window strategy to achieve {{a balance between the}} calculation capabilities and the real-time interpolation requirements. In this window, the <b>corner</b> <b>transition</b> algorithm and speed planning are implemented simultaneously and dynamically during the interpolation. By defining the width of this window, which is actually the number of linear segments contained in this window, can adjust the time consuming of speed planning. Simulation and experiments on our own developed CNC platform are conducted. The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithms...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{experimental}} {{results on the}} shape and motion of a mercury droplet, placed in a horizontally rotating cylinder in the rpm range 8 - 93, so that the Reynolds number of the drop 2500 <Re< 26000 and its capillary number 0. 0002 <Ca< 0. 0023. When contact angle variations can be neglected at low speeds (Re< 8150), the velocity of the drop is much lower than that predicted by the Ho. Young Kim's [6] relation. This observed discrepancy is overcome by modifying Kim's relation by substituting the dissipation estimated from a boundary layer near the solid surface instead of bulk dissipation. Based on the changes at the rear side of the mercury droplet, there are three distinct regimes identified with varying speeds of rotation (i) oval or rounded regime (ii) corner regime and (iii) cusping regime. The oval to <b>corner</b> <b>transition</b> happens at a finite receding contact angle of 950. The ratio of critical contact angle (θc) at which the transition occurs to the static receding contact angle (θs) {{was found to be}} 0. 657. The de Gennes model [4], extended to high contact angle by substituting the dissipation for wedge flow, predicts a critical contact angle ratio (θc/θs) that is in close agreement with the experimental value. At higher Re, the dynamic contact angle variation with velocity was compared with Cox-Voinov model [3]. Though the trend of the variation of data is approximately represented by the model, the fit coefficient according to experimental data is very high when compared to theoretical value.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{theory of}} interfacial fluctuation effects occurring at 2 D wedge (<b>corner)</b> filling <b>transitions</b> in pure (thermal disorder) and impure (random bond-disorder) systems is presented. Scaling {{theory and the}} explicit results of transfer matrix and replica trick studies of interfacial Hamiltonian models reveal that, for almost all examples of intermolecular forces, the critical behaviour at filling is fluctuation-dominated, characterised by universal critical exponents and scaling functions that depend only on the wandering exponent ζ. Within this filling fluctuation (FFL) regime, the critical behaviour of the mid-point interfacial height, probability distribution function, local compressibility and wedge free energy are identical to corresponding quantities predicted for the strong-fluctuation (SFL) regime for critical wetting transitions at planar walls. In particular the wedge free energy {{is related to the}} SFL regime point tension which is calculated for systems with random-bond disorder using the replica trick. The connection with the SFL regime for all these quantities can be expressed precisely in terms of special wedge covariance relations which complement standard scaling theory and restrict the allowed values of the critical exponents for both FFL filling and SFL critical wetting.

30|$|Image splicing, which {{involves}} combining {{two or more}} images into a new image, {{is one of the}} most common types of image tempering. The majority of research into splicing detection is based on the fact that the image splicing process can cause discontinuities along edges and <b>corners.</b> These abnormal <b>transitions</b> are an important clue in the verification of image’s authenticity. Early attempts to detect spliced images focused on changes of the global statistical characteristics caused by abrupt discontinuities in the spliced images [4 – 7]. However, the statistical moment-based splicing detection methods are limited in that the statistical moments for an entire image do not efficiently reflect the local discontinuities caused by a splicing operation. Splicing detection algorithms that are capable of extracting local transitions caused by spliced image region have been presented. One of these approaches is the run-length-based splicing detection method [8 – 10]. Using this method, we can extract abnormal local transitions caused by splicing forgery. Run-length-based splicing detection methods have achieved notable detection performances with a small number of features. However, the detection rates of these algorithms are not ideal because the final features are extracted from the moments of various run-length matrices.|$|R

A predictive thermodynamic model is used to compute the relevant mixture properties, including its critical point coordinates and the local value of the fundamental derivative of {{gas dynamics}} Gamma. The considered model is the improved Peng-Robinson Stryjek-Vera cubic equation of state, complemented by the Wong-Sandler mixing rules. A finite thermodynamic region is found where the nonlinearity parameter Gamma is negative and therefore non-classical gas dynamics phenomena are admissible.

40|$|A basic {{technique}} for designing curved shapes {{in the plane}} is interpolating splines. The designer inputs a sequence of control points, and the computer fits a smooth curve that goes through these points. The literature of interpolating splines is rich, much of it based on the mathematical idealization of a thin elastic strip constrained {{to pass through the}} points. Until now there is little consensus on which, if any, of these splines is ideal. This thesis explores the properties of an ideal interpolating spline. The most important property is fairness, a property often in tension with locality, meaning that perturbations to the input points do not affect sections of the curve at a distance. The idealized elastic strip has two serious problems. A sequence of co-circular input points results in a curve deviating from a circular arc. For some other inputs, no solution (with finite extent) exists at all. The idealized elastic strip has two properties worth preserving. First, any ideal spline must be extensional, meaning that the insertion of a new point on the curve shouldn't change its shape. Second, curve segments between any two adjacent control points are drawn from a two-parameter family (and this property is closely related to good locality properties). A central result of this thesis is that any spline sharing these properties also has the property that all segments between two control points are cut from a single, fixed generating curve. Thus, the problem of choosing an ideal spline isreduced to that of choosing the ideal generating curve. The Euler spiral has excellent all-around properties, and, for some applications, a log-aesthetic curve may be even better. Shapes in applications, such as font outlines, contain extra features such as <b>corners</b> and <b>transitions</b> between straight lines and smooth curves. Attaching additional constraints to control points expresses these features, and, carefully applied, give the designer a richer palette of curve types.

Its eastern syntaxis is marked by high exhumation, a sharp structural bend, and strain concentration at the transition from shortening to oblique transpression. Here we present GPS velocity and strain rate fields that cover the syntaxis, including 11 new stations in the core of the St. Elias Mountains. These data are corrected for transient deformation (glacial isostatic adjustment and postseismic and interseismic loading) to produce residual velocities and strain rates representative of long-term tectonics. The main features of these velocity and strain rate fields are a peak in strain rates (strain knot) in the syntaxis at the junction between the main fault systems and a rapid rotation from convergence-parallel to convergence-normal orientations of the velocities and shortening axes around the syntaxis, leading to shortening across the southern Denali Fault. These features are consistent with the strain and tectonic patterns expected near an indentor <b>corner</b> at the <b>transition</b> from shortening to transpression, with a combination of diffuse and localized deformation.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering"December 2007. "A {{statistically}} based {{analytical method}} {{was developed to}} improve the reliability of fatigue failure predictions for metallic components of various geometric configurations subjected to constant amplitude fatigue loads. The method required {{the determination of the}} distribution of equivalent initial flaw sizes. The equivalent initial flaw size associated with an actual crack is influenced by the geometric configuration of the body, the applied loading conditions and the crack growth model employed. In this study four factors were identified including two types of crack configurations and their influence on the equivalent initial flaw size distribution was investigated. Also the influence of the four factors on the equivalent initial flaw size distribution was examined. These are the stress concentration factor, tg K, the uncracked ligament length, n w, the maximum stress, max S and mean stress, mean S, of the applied constant amplitude fatigue loading. Two types of initial crack configurations were assumed; corner and surface flaw. Five specimen types were investigated; smooth unnotched, open-hole, Kt = 3, 4 t K = and 5 t K = specimens all of which have different stress concentration factors. Two statistical models were fitted and investigated. One model assumed that the initial crack started as a <b>corner</b> crack, <b>transitioned</b> into a through crack, and then propagated till final fracture. The other model assumed that the initial crack started as a surface crack, transitioned into a through crack, and then propagated till final fracture. For each crack configuration, a statistical model was fitted between the mean and the standard deviation of the distributions of the equivalent initial flaw sizes and the stress concentration factor, the uncracked ligament length, the maximum stress, and the mean stress of the fatigue loading. Multiple regression techniques were used to fit these models. Using the statistical models together with Monte Carlo simulation, a distribution of estimated fatigue lives were generated using the FASTRAN-II crack growth code for the Kt = 3 and 4 t K = specimen types, at various stress levels. Hypothesis testing was used to compare the estimated fatigue lives of the specimen with the measured fatigue lives obtained from testing at a level of significance of 0. 05. An acceptance criterion was established to determine if the predicted fatigue lives compared well with experimentally obtained fatigue lives. As a conclusion, the methodology provided adequate approximation of fatigue life for some of the fatigue loading cases of the 4 t K = specimens and for one of the fatigue loading cases of the 3 t K = specimens. The initial crack configuration type did not have any significant effect on the proposed methodology...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 This thesis {{presents}} a control {{system for a}} walking machine leg. The leg is representative {{of one of the}} six legs required for a proposed walking machine based on the geometry of the darkling beetle. Each of the three joints is controlled by a DC servo motor mounted {{to the base of the}} leg. The speed of the motors is controlled with pulse width modulation. Feedback of joint positions is accomplished with potentiometers mounted on the actual joints. A five-point path, forming a rectangle in the global coordinate system, is used as a skeleton of the path of movement. Desired times and accelerations from point to point are used to develop the path of movement, which smoothes <b>corners</b> and velocity <b>transitions</b> along the path. To create a model of the dynamics of each joint, a constant motor speed is output and the joint velocity and joint angle are recorded. From several trials at several different motor speeds, relationships between the joint velocity, joint angle, and motor speed can be found. This data is then least squares fit in two dimensions to give two second order functions. The first function uses the desired joint angle to calculate the variance from the mean joint velocity. This variance is then added to the desired joint velocity and is used in the second function to calculate the needed motor signal. Feedback control is accomplished using a PID control system. Because of the high level of noise in the feedback signal, a digital noise filter is used. Both moving average and linear regression techniques are examined. Performance of the system is measured by comparing the actual path in Cartesian coordinates to the desired path of movement. The RMS error is taken along the path, during the time frame of the ideal system. The maximum Cartesian error along the path is also used in evaluation. To determine suitable feedback gain combinations, several experiments are run and evaluated. Data is plotted and suitable values are chosen for the feedback gains based on their performance and sensitivity to change in performance. The performance of the leg is measured for a basic rectangular path, the basic path with a variation in step angle, and the basic path with a constant body velocity...|$|R
40|$|General Electric (GE) has {{developed}} an approach whereby native mercury reduction on fly ash can be improved by optimizing the combustion system. This approach eliminates carbon-rich areas in the combustion zone, making the combustion process more uniform, and allows increasing carbon content in fly ash without significant increase in CO emissions. Since boiler excess O{sub 2 } can be also reduced {{as a result of}} optimized combustion, this process reduces NO{sub x} emissions. Because combustion optimization improves native mercury reduction on fly ash, it can reduce requirements for activated carbon injection (ACI) when integrated with sorbent injection for more efficient mercury control. The approach can be tailored to specific unit configurations and coal types for optimal performance. This report describes results of a U. S. DOE sponsored project designed to evaluate the effect of combustion conditions on 'native' mercury capture on fly ash and integrate combustion optimization for improved mercury and NO{sub x} reduction with ACI. The technology evaluation took place in Lee Station Unit 3 located in Goldsboro, NC and operated by Progress Energy. Unit 3 burns a low-sulfur Eastern bituminous coal and is a 250 MW opposed-wall fired unit equipped with an ESP with a specific collection area of 249 ft{sup 2 }/kacfm. Unit 3 is equipped with SO{sub 3 } injection for ESP conditioning. The technical goal of the project was to evaluate the technology's ability to achieve 70 % mercury reduction below the baseline emission value of 2. 9 lb/TBtu, which was equivalent to 80 % mercury reduction relative to the mercury concentration in the coal. The strategy to achieve the 70 % incremental improvement in mercury removal in Unit 3 was (1) to enhance 'naturally' occurring fly ash mercury capture by optimizing the combustion process and using duct humidification to reduce flue gas temperatures at the ESP inlet, and (2) to use ACI in front of the ESP to further reduce mercury emissions. The program was comprised of field and pilot-scale tests, engineering studies and consisted of eight tasks. As part of the program, GE conducted pilot-scale evaluation of sorbent effect on mercury reduction, supplied and installed adjustable riffle boxes to assist in combustion optimization, performed combustion optimization, supplied mobile sorbent injection and flue gas humidification systems, conducted CFD modeling of sorbent injection and flue gas humidification, and performed mercury testing including a continuous 30 -day sorbent injection trial. Combustion optimization was the first step in reduction of mercury emissions. Goals of combustion optimization activities were to improve 'native' mercury capture on fly ash and reduce NO{sub x}. Combustion optimization included balancing of coal flow through individual burners to eliminate zones of carbon-rich combustion, air flow balancing, and burner adjustments. As part of the project, the original riffle boxes were replaced with Foster-Wheeler's adjustable riffle boxes to allow for biasing the coal flow between the coal pipes. A 10 -point CO/O{sub 2 }/NO{sub x} grid was installed in the primary superheater region of the back pass to assist in these activities. Testing of mercury emissions before and after combustion optimization demonstrated that mercury emissions were reduced from 2. 9 lb/TBtu to 1. 8 lb/TBtu due to boiler operation differences in conjunction with combustion optimization, a 38 % improvement in 'native' mercury capture on fly ash. Native mercury reduction from coal was {approx} 42 % at baseline conditions and 64 % at optimized combustion conditions. As a result of combustion optimization NO{sub x} emissions were reduced by 18 %. A three-dimensional CFD model was developed to study the flow distribution and sorbent injection in the post air heater duct in Lee Station Unit 3. Modeling of the flow pattern exiting the air pre-heater demonstrated that because of the duct transition from a circular opening at the exit of air-pre-heater to a rectangular ESP inlet duct, flow separation occurred at the <b>corners</b> after the <b>transition.</b> Modeling also demonstrated that the flow was severely biased from the South side to the North side due to the bend of the duct. Results of CFD modeling were used to design lances for better sorbent distribution across the ESP inlet duct. Modeling of water injection demonstrated that because of flue gas temperature biasing, the droplet evaporation rate was slower on the North side than that on the South side of the duct. Modeling suggested that an improvement of water droplet evaporation could be achieved by closing the lance on the North side where flue gas temperatures were lower. Preliminary evaluation of the effect of carbon-based sorbents on mercury reduction took place in a 1 MBtu/hr (300 kW) Boiler Simulator Facility using the same coal as fired at Lee Station...|$|R
