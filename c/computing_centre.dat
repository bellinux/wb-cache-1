40|$|International audienceComputers {{are used}} to solve {{different}} problems. For solving these problems computer software and hardware are used, but for operations of those computing facilities a Data Centre is necessary. Therefore, development of the data centre is subordinated to solvable tasks and computing resources. We are studying the history of data centres’ development, taking into consideration an understanding of this. In {{the beginning of the}} computer era computers were installed in <b>computing</b> <b>centres,</b> because all <b>computing</b> <b>centres</b> have defined requirements according to whom their operation is intended for. Even though the concept of ‘data centre’ itself has been used since the 1990 s, the characteristic features and requirement descriptions have been identified {{since the beginning of the}} very first computer operation. In this article the authors describe the historical development of data centres based on their personal experience obtained by working in the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Latvia and comparing it with the theory of data centre development, e. g. standards, as well as other publicly available information about computer development on the internet...|$|R
40|$|ATLAS is a {{particle}} physics experiment on Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The experiment produces petabytes of data every year. The ATLAS Computing model embraces the Grid paradigm and originally included {{three levels of}} <b>computing</b> <b>centres</b> {{to be able to}} operate such large volume of data. With the formation of small <b>computing</b> <b>centres,</b> usually based at universities, the model was expanded to include them as Tier 3 sites. The experiment supplies all necessary software to operate typical Grid-site, but Tier 3 sites do not support Grid services of the experiment or support them partially. Tier 3 centres comprise a range of architectures and many do not possess Grid middleware, thus, monitoring of storage and analysis software used on Tier 2 sites becomes unavailable for Tier 3 site system administrator and, also, Tier 3 sites activity becomes unavailable for virtual organization of the experiment. In this paper we present ATLAS off-Grid sites monitoring software suite, which enables monitoring on sites, which are not under operation of ATLAS Distributed Computing software...|$|R
