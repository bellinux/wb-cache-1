40|$|Abstract—Without careful methodological guidance, <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> {{software}} engineering {{are difficult to}} plan, design and execute. While {{there are a number}} of broad guidelines for <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research, there are none that specifically address the needs of a software engineer undertaking multiple <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> an industrial setting. Through a synthesis of existing best practices <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research, we provide a set of comprehensive guidelines for conducting multiple <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> {{software engineering}} research. Our guidelines can assist software engineering researchers with all stages of multiple <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research, although <b>in</b> this paper we concentrate on the early phases, such as focusing the <b>case</b> <b>study</b> and detailed plan design. To date, three exploratory research projects found our guidelines very useful. We illustrate our guidelines with examples from one of these projects.

5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{concluded that}} the crash was attributable primarily to three factors: Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' delayed or inadequate reactions to earlier incidents involving Holland, and {{the sequence of events}} during the aircraft's final flight. The crash is now used in military and civilian aviation environments as a <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> teaching crew resource management. It is also often used by the U.S. Armed Forces during aviation safety training {{as an example of the}} importance of compliance with safety regulations and correcting the behavior of anyone who violates safety procedures.|$|E

By late March 2011, the estimated cost of renovating the trestle had risen to $1.1million, and the expected time to completion increased to two years.|$|E
5|$|As {{the company}} expanded, it {{was subject to}} several legal issues {{regarding}} trademarks. Because of its use as a <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> American law schools, {{one of the most}} prominent incidents of infringement in the United States occurred with the similarly named Burger King located in Mattoon, Illinois. Eugene and Elizabeth Hoots owned an ice cream shop in the city of Mattoon; due to the success of the store, in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop in a former garage next to the original operation. Keeping with theme related to the name of the ice cream shop, Frigid Queen, they named their burger stand Burger King and registered their trademark with the state of Illinois in 1959. In 1962 The Hootses, with knowledge of the Federal trademark held by Burger King Corporation, added a second location in Charleston, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In a <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species {{can be found in}} proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern marbled newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E
