40|$|Friction stir welding(FSW) is a {{solid state}} welding technique, it uses a {{rotating}} tool to generate the necessary heat for the process. FSW is initially used to weld aluminium and its alloys because the defects like porosity, alloy segregation, hot cracking, hydrogen entrapment etc. are not encountered with this process those are mainly appeared in fusion welding processes [1]. Process uses a non <b>consumable</b> rotating <b>tool</b> which slides along with rotation on the faying surface of work-pieces to be weld. To obtain the desired strength, {{it is essential to}} have complete control over the relevant process parameters on which the quality of a weldment is based. The process was duly named friction stir welding (FSW), and TWI filed for world-wide patent protection in December of 1991 by TWI. TWI (The Welding Institute) is a world famous institute in the UK that specializes in materials joining technology. Many of the typical problems related to fusion welding of aluminium alloys can be avoided by using non conventional joining techniques. Since FSW is governed by two completely mechanical processes, i. e. mixing and forging, it is possible to join heterogeneous aluminium alloys without filler metal. Using specially designed tools and machines up to 75 mm of aluminium can be welded in a single pass.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] heat exchangers provide large surface area to volume ratios and accelerated heat transfer, leading to compact form factors for application in portable and distributed thermal management and waste heat recovery. The application of microchannel heat exchangers in industry has been slowed by high manufacturing costs. Therefore, efforts are being made {{to find new ways to}} manufacture these components. This research investigates the application of a process-based cost and environmental impact assessment model to the evaluation of manufacturing alternatives to produce microchannel heat exchangers. A bottom-up process-based cost modeling method is used to estimate the cost of manufacturing a microchannel heat recovery unit (HRU). Cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment is simultaneously applied to evaluate environmental impact. Both sets of calculations extend from a single common set of data consisting of production and device geometry parameters. An analysis is demonstrated for different manufacturing alternatives for producing the HRU.

40|$|The {{production}} of future generation integrated circuit devices requires precise control of impurities on the silicon surface. Cleaning of silicon wafers has historically involved {{the use of}} concentrated chemicals, large amounts of rinse water, and elevated temperatures to remove particles, metals, and organic matter from the surface. Poor understanding of the mechanisms of contamination has necessitated large margins of error in cleaning processes and has made cleaning the largest consumer of resources in an IC process line. Explosive growth within the semiconductor sector coupled with the increased need for cleaning in device manufacturing presents an enormous burden for the natural environment. By better understanding the relevant parameters in a cleaning step, future process will continue meet performance specifications while simultaneously reducing {{their impact on the}} environment. The environmental performance of the manufacturer is limited by the available technologies for wafer cleaning. Design changes occurring at the tool, chemical, and system level all affect the overall environmental impact of a fab. A modified Cost of Ownership (CoO) expression based on the <b>tool</b> <b>consumable</b> cost (CC), footprint (F), yield (Y), throughput (T), and utilization (U) is presented as a guideline for identifying the next generation of 'green' technologies. Barriers to the implementation of an ideal wetbench are also discussed. The intrinsic silicon-HF interface provides a baseline for understanding the impact of contamination on the electronic quality of the surface. Minority carrier lifetime measurements made by Radio-Frequency Photoconductance Decay (RF-PCD) show that defects on this surface are not described by any known models for a single mid-gap, electronic state. A model is presented in which each physical defect introduces two coupled mid-gap states. By analogy with Pb-centers observed at the Si-Si 02 interface, these states correspond to the three physical states of a dangling bond. The doublyoccupied state {{may play a role in}} native oxide growth and metal deposition; the unoccupied state is a likely site for attack during fluoride etching. Metal contaminants at the silicon-liquid interface have also been studied using RF-PCD. The deposition of part per trillion (ppt) levels of Cu is shown to increase by a factor of 17. 5 by using a 500 : 1 solution of HF instead of a 100 : 1 solution. This strong dependence arises from a shift in the electrochemical potential at the wafer surf ace. With the reduction in [Ir], the potential shifts to more cathodic values and causes the Cu deposition rate to increase. To prevent unacceptable levels of contamination from dilute HF solutions, the purity of a D:l HF bath must scale as D- 1. 78. by Anand Junuthula Reddy. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM) {{requires}} a Launch/Entry/Abort (LEA) suit capability and short duration Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) capability for Orion. The EVAs will involve a two-person crew for approximately four hours. Currently, two EVAs are planned with one contingency EVA in reserve. Providing this EVA capability is very challenging due to system level constraints {{and a new}} and unknown environment. The goal of the EVA architecture for ARCM is one that builds upon previously developed technologies and lessons learned, and that accomplishes the ARCM mission while providing a stepping stone to future missions and destinations. The primary system level constraints are to 1) minimize system mass and volume and 2) minimize the interfacing impacts to the baseline Orion design. In order to minimize the interfacing impacts and to not perturb the baseline Orion schedule, the concept of adding "kits" to the baseline system is proposed. These kits consist of: an EVA kit (converts LEA suit to EVA suit), EVA Servicing and Recharge Kit (provides suit <b>consumables),</b> the EVA <b>Tools,</b> Translation Aids & Sample Container Kit (the tools and mobility aids to complete the tasks), the EVA Communications Kit (interface between the EVA radio and the MPCV), and the Cabin Repress Kit (represses the MPCV between EVAs). This paper {{will focus on the}} trade space, analysis, and testing regarding the space suit (pressure garment and life support system). Historical approaches and lessons learned from all past EVA operations were researched. Previous and current, successfully operated EVA hardware and high technology readiness level (TRL) hardware were evaluated, and a trade study was conducted for all possible pressure garment and life support options. Testing and analysis was conducted and a recommended EVA system architecture was proposed. Pressure garment options that were considered for this mission include the currently in-use ISS EVA Mobility Unit (EMU), all variations of the Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES), and the Exploration Z-suit. For this mission, the pressure garment that was selected is the Modified ACES (MACES) with EVA enhancements. Life support options that were considered included short closed-loop umbilicals, long open-loop umbilicals, the currently in-use ISS EMU Portable Life Support System (PLSS), and the currently in development Exploration PLSS. For this mission, the life support option that was selected is the Exploration PLSS. The greatest risk in the proposed architecture is viewed to be the comfort and mobility of the baseline MACES and the delicate balance between adding more mobility features while not compromising landing safety. Feasibility testing was accomplished in low fidelity analogs and in the JSC Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) to validate the concept before a final recommendation on the architecture was made. The proposed architecture was found to meet the mission constraints, but much more work is required to determine the details of the required suit upgrades, the integration with the PLSS, {{and the rest of the}} tools and equipment required to accomplish the mission.

40|$|There are 22 {{construction}} {{support vessels}} in the DOF Group that have active heave compensated cranes with lifting capacity of above 50 tonnes. The Brazilian flagged Skandi Salvador was chosen to represent the fleet in terms of specifications, since she {{was close to the}} average numbers for size, age and capacity. She has a NOV crane with SWL of 140 t. There are two main types of maintenance; preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance. Fault distributions can be used to evaluate which type of maintenance that should be performed, and in which intervals. Maintenance management should be a process of continuous improvement, with focus on planning, execution, reporting and analysis in order to establish and revise resource needs, goals and requirements, and the maintenance program itself. Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Risk Based Inspection (RBI) are useful methods to establish an optimal maintenance and inspection program, based on functional demands, functional faults, and prevention of these functional faults. The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) concept and the ?Newsboy? model are mathematical decision models {{that can be used to}} decide number of spares to be ordered, order point, safety level, and investments in capital spare parts. Seven areas of improvement for the maintenance practice in the DOF Group were proposed: 1. 	Informal experience to be made formal. 2. 	Formalize the maintenance management processes. 3. 	Introduce scientific methods like Reliability Centered Maintenance and Risk Based Inspection to establish maintenance program. 4. 	Introduce scientific methods for spare parts management. 5. 	Introduce a fleet-oriented philosophy for all aspects of the maintenance practice, especially for spare parts management. 6. 	Bring the users closer to decisions regarding the MMS 7. 	Increase practical usability of critical equipment classification. The main objective of spare parts management is to find the optimal numbers, types and locations for spare parts needed to perform the desired tasks with as high uptime as possible. In effect, to have spare parts available when they are needed, but to avoid stocking spare parts that are not needed. At the heart of the proposed spare parts management philosophy lie fleet orientation, formalization, and scientific methods. A spare part evaluation work process is proposed, consisting of 6 phases: 1. 	Basic input. Where the actor responsible collects the data necessary for making the evaluation. 2. 	Spare part categorization. The spare parts are categorized in three categories, based on given criteria. 3. 	Risk assessment. A consequence classification is carried out to decide the desired probability of having a spare available during procurement lead time for operational spares and <b>consumables.</b> 4. 	Decision <b>tools.</b> Two different decision tools are utilized to make optimal decisions for the spare parts considered. 5. 	Output. The decisions are summarized and carried out. Information related to the capital spare parts decisions are entered into a newly established capital spare parts experience register. 6. 	MMS. The results from the spare part evaluations are inserted in the maintenance management system. An important part of the proposed spare parts management philosophy is the ability to make optimal decisions in changing environments. If the evaluation process is not dynamic, the actors responsible will soon revert to the former, subjective methods for making decisions. So, whenever a change in the operation of a vessel is planned or registered, the project/vessel manager should ask himself how this change might affect the input parameters of the decision tools. This forms the basis for the proposed dynamic spare part evaluation work process. The decision tool for capital spares is built around the relation between the expected cost of holding a spare part and not needing it, versus the expected cost of not having it when you need it. When basing the evaluation on significantly lower delivery times than estimated by the manufacturer, the optimal capital spare parts investment decisions for the offshore crane on Skandi Salvador were to purchase all the recommended parts, except the largest crane wire. Using the estimated delivery times from the manufacturer, the optimal decisions were clearly to purchase all the recommended spare parts. At the delivery time of Skandi Salvador, the DOF Group chose to only purchase four of the items on the list of recommended capital spare parts. The capital spare parts investment decisions taken by the DOF Group at the delivery time of the vessel are therefore considered sub-optimal compared to the findings in this thesis, and the DOF Group is advised to purchase the remaining capital spare parts on the list of recommended spare parts. The decision tool for operational spares and consumables finds the optimal order quantity, order point and safety stock. An important input parameter is the desired probability of having enough spare during procurement lead time. This parameter is set based on the consequence classification for the part. The decision tool was used to make decisions for optimal order quantity, order point and safety stock for a list of recommended spare parts for the offshore crane on Skandi Salvador...|$|R
