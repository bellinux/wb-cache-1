2500|$|Jilhavan Aircraft {{built the}} Kappa Sova for Kappa 77 from 1997 to 2004 and {{obtained}} marketing rights in 2005 when Kappa became insolvent. [...] They became {{a subsidiary of}} Skyleader Aircraft in 2008 when the type was redesignated Jihlavan Skyleader. [...] It is an all-metal design apart from a carbon fibre <b>cockpit</b> <b>frame.</b> [...] It has two-spar tapered wings with 6° of dihedral, electrically operated Fowler flaps and upturned Küchemann tips. [...] The fin and rudder are swept. The straight tapered tailplane is set {{on top of the}} fuselage, the port elevator carrying a trim tab.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company also}} {{produced}} a single seat {{version of the}} Viking II design, which it referred to simply as the [...] "Single-Place". This version mounts a single seat on a narrower <b>cockpit</b> <b>frame,</b> but is otherwise similar.|$|E
50|$|The {{game had}} three ship views {{available}} - two first person views {{from inside the}} cockpit with <b>cockpit</b> <b>frame</b> and the interface visible in one case and only the interface visible in the other, and a third person view of the ship.|$|E
5000|$|One feature pioneered in the J 2 {{that would}} also be used in later {{all-metal}} monoplanes designed and built by Junkers in World War I, was a [...] "unitized" [...] forward fuselage structure, combining the engine mount, wing roots and <b>cockpit</b> <b>framing</b> into a single structure.|$|R
50|$|All Viimas of the Finnish Air Force were {{fitted with}} a <b>framed</b> <b>cockpit</b> in 1950s.|$|R
50|$|After {{his move}} to Australia, Schneider {{designed}} a significantly different {{version of the}} ES-49, the longer span (18.00 m) ES-49B Kangaroo. The new wing, though similar in construction to the earlier one, was different in plan with a shorter rectangular centre section and proportionately longer tapered outer panels with shorter ailerons. This alteration placed the spoilers in the tapered sections. The fuselage was also revised, with rounded skinning on the upper nose instead of the earlier three flat panels, together with considerable revision of the rear fuselage. The upper fuselage profile was made straight and horizontal and the underside arched upwards, producing a more slender structure. There were detailed changes to the tail, too with a fuller and more curved rudder and the trim tab shortened {{and moved to the}} port side. Two Kangaroos were built, the second with slightly revised <b>cockpit</b> <b>framing.</b>|$|R
50|$|A Walmart {{exclusive}} red redeco of the Universe Ultra figure, {{making him}} more cartoon-accurate. This figure {{differs from the}} Japanese version, wherein the red color is in a brighter shade, the <b>cockpit</b> <b>frame</b> is painted in white instead of black and the decals are different.|$|E
50|$|Jilhavan Aircraft {{built the}} Kappa Sova for Kappa 77 from 1997 to 2004 and {{obtained}} marketing rights in 2005 when Kappa became insolvent.

50|$|Apart from a tubular <b>cockpit</b> <b>frame</b> and {{composite}} wing tips, the Speedtwin ST2 is an aluminium {{monocoque structure}} throughout. The fuselage is flat sided, with rounded decking {{into which the}} single piece, starboard hinged canopy merges. The cockpit seats two {{in tandem with the}} pilot in front when flying solo; dual controls are fitted. There is a baggage area behind the rear seat. The Speedtwin has a fixed conventional undercarriage, its mainwheels, fitted with hydraulic brakes, on oleo legs from below each engine, giving it a 2.44 m track. It has flown both with and without wheel and leg fairings. The tailwheel is steerable.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} cantilever low-wing, a single-seat enclosed <b>cockpit</b> under a <b>framed</b> aircraft canopy, retractable {{conventional landing gear}} and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed to}} comply with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight rules and US light-sport aircraft rules. Like the aircraft it replicates, it features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-tandem enclosed <b>cockpit</b> under a <b>framed</b> canopy, retractable conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|R
50|$|Podesva {{designs and}} builds reproductions of famous {{aircraft}} on a custom basis for customers. The Trener {{was designed to}} comply with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight rules. It features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-tandem enclosed <b>cockpit</b> under a <b>framed</b> canopy, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|R
50|$|For those wishing {{more than}} a desktop simulator, replica panels are commercially {{available}} mimicking those found in a modern airliners such as a Boeing or Airbus. These panels will either fit into a real cockpit section, which some large scale home simulators are built into, or will be mounted in a home constructed <b>cockpit</b> <b>frame,</b> normally made from wood. With most modern airliners now using Glass Cockpit type displays it is relatively simple to replicate the displays in software, outputting them via multi head graphics cards or networked PCs to cheaply available LCD monitors mounted behind the panel. To the casual observer {{it can be hard}} to tell a home built static simulator and a commercial one apart.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Traditional {{mechanical}} calculations {{are more}} often used in the strength check of the amusement facility nowadays. However, there exit some disadvantages in this way, such as the long cycle cost, the heavy workload, and particularly the inability in case of more intricately forced parts. This paper illustrates {{the idea of using}} finite element analysis (ANSYS) software to check the strength of “Ferris Wheel ” amusement machine rotating cockpit, analyzes the loads and stresses of the <b>cockpit</b> <b>frame</b> under extreme work conditions, and comes to a reasonable conclusion. And the strength check of intricately forced workpiece of amusement machines are explored as well...|$|E
50|$|The seven {{members of}} the crew were killed on February 1 when Columbia {{disintegrated}} during reentry into the atmosphere. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board determined the failure {{was caused by a}} piece of foam that broke off during launch and damaged the thermal protection system (reinforced carbon-carbon panels and thermal protection tiles) on {{the leading edge of the}} orbiter's Left wing. During re-entry the damaged wing slowly overheated and came apart, eventually leading to loss of control and disintegration of the vehicle. The <b>cockpit</b> window <b>frame</b> is now exhibited in a memorial inside the Space Shuttle Atlantis Pavilion at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.|$|R
50|$|Mixed {{construction}} low-wing cantilever monoplane, conventional in layout, with a fixed {{landing gear}} and a closed <b>cockpit.</b> Steel <b>framed</b> fuselage, covered with canvas {{on a wooden}} frame, aluminum in front engine section. Three-part trapezoid wings with rounded tips, of wooden construction, two-spar, plywood (in front) and canvas covered, fitted with split flaps and slats. Conventional cantilever empennage, plywood (fins) and canvas (elevators and rudder) covered. Two seats in tandem, under a canopy, with a fixed panoramic windshield and small side windows. Behind the cockpit was a place for a baggage. Conventional fixed landing gear with a rear wheel, the main gear was in covers. 4-cylinder straight engine de Havilland Gipsy Major in front, driving a two-blade tractor wooden propeller Szomański of a fixed pitch. Fuel tanks 180 l in mid-wing section. Cruise fuel consumption 28 l/h.|$|R
40|$|A C- 11 B Instrument Flight Trainer was {{converted}} into a variable stability flight simulator. The original <b>frame,</b> <b>cockpit,</b> controls, pneumatic system and instruments were utilized as well as certain other necessary components. The original aerodynamic and engine computers were removed, a new instrument drive system was designed and a hybrid computer was programed to solve the equations of motion. The cockpit controls supplied the inputs to the computer which in turn supplied the outputs to the various instruments through their respective drive systems. The computer program may be quickly changed to simulate the aerodynamic characteristics of almost any single engine jet aircraft, or the parameters of a specific aircraft may be varied to investigate their effects on flying qualities.

5000|$|The Federation forces later {{travel to}} Mars {{in order to}} {{discover}} the ELS's intentions, with Descartes heading out first in the Gadelaza. However most of its ships and Mobile suits were assimilated, and Descartes ends up being assimilated as well, killing him in the process. Celestial Being arrives {{too late to save}} the Federation soldiers and engaged in battle against them. Setsuna executes Trans-Am Burst in an attempt to communicate with the ELS, theorizing that this is the [...] "dialogues to come" [...] that Aeolia Schenberg was conditioning humanity for. Unfortunately, Setsuna falls victim to a mental attack from the ELS and is rendered comatose in the middle of battle. Tieria reveals Raphael Gundam's backpack, GN-008RE Seravee Gundam II, and rips 00 Raiser's <b>cockpit</b> from the <b>frame,</b> handing it to Lockon as Tieria tries to hold off the ELS with his quantum brainwaves. With the ELS surrounding him, Tieria self-destructs his Gundam to take out ELS with him. The Sol Brave Squadron, led by Graham Aker, arrive and help Celestial Being escape. Tieria's conscious mind returns to Veda and Feldt Grace desperately awaits at Setsuna's side to awaken. After the battle, the Ptolemaios crew and the Earth Sphere Federation witness the appearance of a large moon-size ELS, determining that it will arrive at Earth in 92 days.|$|R
5000|$|No. 4 Squadron was {{operating}} its Sopwith Camels in hazardous, low-altitude support of Australian ground troops when King arrived in France, {{and he had}} little opportunity for air-to-air combat. The burly 6 ft King—nicknamed [...] "Bo", [...] "Beau", or [...] "Bow"—also had problems landing the Camel; crammed into its small <b>cockpit,</b> his large <b>frame</b> impeded control stick movement. [...] The resulting rough landings annoyed his commanding officer, Major Wilfred McCloughry, brother of ace Edgar McCloughry. King's friend and fellow No. 4 Squadron pilot, Harry Cobby, recalled that [...] "there was some speculation that he might go home—but he proved himself an impressive pilot". Cobby often took King on [...] "special missions" [...] to make mischief with the Germans; No. 4 Squadron found that two-man patrols were generally able to lure enemy aircraft into a fight, whereas larger formations tended to deter engagements. On 14 May 1918, King shot down a two-seat German scout that was spotting for artillery between Ypres and Bailleul, but clouds prevented him from confirming its destruction. By 20 May, he had been credited with his first aerial victory, over a Pfalz D.III near Kemmel-Neuve Église. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 June. On 20 June, he destroyed a German balloon over Estaires; although vulnerable to attack with incendiary bullets, these large observation platforms were generally well protected by fighters and anti-aircraft defences, and were thus considered a dangerous but valuable target. Later that month he shot down two more aircraft, a Pfalz and a two-seat LVG, in the Lys region.|$|R
