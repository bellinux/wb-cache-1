25|$|Knickebein was {{in general}} use but the X-Gerät (X apparatus) was {{reserved}} for specially-trained pathfinder crews. X-Gerät receivers were mounted in He 111s, with a radio mast on the fuselage. The system worked on 66–77MHz, a higher frequency than Knickebein. Ground transmitters sent pulses {{at a rate of}} 180 per minute. X-Gerät received and analysed the pulses, giving the pilot visual and aural directions. Three cross-beams intersected the beam along which the He 111 was flying. The first <b>cross-beam</b> alerted the bomb-aimer, who activated a bombing clock when the second <b>cross-beam</b> was reached. When the third <b>cross-beam</b> was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger, which stopped the first hand of the clock, with the second hand continuing. When the second hand re-aligned with the first, the bombs were released. The clock mechanism was co-ordinated with the distances of the intersecting beams from the target so the target was directly below when the bombs were released.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1957, an {{additional}} bell was {{moved from the}} old church to the new by Whitechapel Bell Foundry, {{at a cost of}} £123. [...] This was one of several removals from the old church that were performed as reaction to the theft of the lead from its roof the year before. [...] The <b>cross-beam</b> from its roof, which Page in 1908 had described as [...] "enriched with a vine pattern of sixteenth-century character" [...] was moved to a new memorial Chapel of St Alban in the new building, which was consecrated on 17 June 1958 by the bishop who was then the Archibishop in Jerusalem (now the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem). [...] John Gedge, architect, of Bedford, drew up the plans for this new chapel, which involved reorienting the organ, as well as a new altar and altar rail, a new choir vestry, a new credence table, and a new prayer desk. [...] The altar rail in the new chapel was made from new oak and an 18th-century staircase taken from old church.|$|E
2500|$|However, early Christian {{writers who}} {{speak of the}} shape of the {{particular}} gibbet on which Jesus died invariably describe it as having a <b>cross-beam.</b> For instance, the Epistle of Barnabas, which was certainly earlier than 135, and may have been of the 1st century AD, the time when the gospel accounts of the death of Jesus were written, likened it to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300), and to the position assumed by Moses in [...] Justin Martyr (100–165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: [...] "That lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up {{in the form of the}} cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb." [...] Irenaeus, who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having [...] "five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [...] the person rests who is fixed by the nails." ...|$|E

It is seven feet high at the center and approximately eight feet in diameter. To build it, long fresh poles of oak or willow are driven into the ground or placed in holes made with a digging stick. These poles, which form the framework, are arranged at one-foot intervals and are bound together at the top with yucca-leaf strands. Over them a thatching of bundles of big bluestem grass or bear grass is tied, shingle style, with yucca strings. A smoke hole opens above a central fireplace. A hide, suspended at the entrance, is fixed on a <b>cross-beam</b> so {{that it may be}} swung forward or backward. The doorway may face in any direction. For waterproofing, pieces of hide are thrown over the outer hatching, and in rainy weather, if a fire is not needed, even the smoke hole is covered. In warm, dry weather much of the outer roofing is stripped off. It takes approximately three days to erect a sturdy dwelling of this type.

60|$|The {{wind was}} still easterly, {{accompanied}} with rather a heavy swell of sea for the operations in hand. A landing was, however, made this morning, when the artificers were immediately employed in scraping the seaweed off the upper {{course of the}} building, in order to apply the moulds of the first course of the staircase, that the joggle-holes might be marked off in the upper course of the solid. This was also necessary previously to the writer's fixing {{the position of the}} entrance door, which was regulated chiefly by the appearance of the growth of the seaweed on the building, indicating the direction of the heaviest seas, {{on the opposite side of}} which the door was placed. The landing-master's crew succeeded in towing into the creek on the western side of the rock the praam-boat with the balance-crane, which had now been on board of the praam for five days. The several pieces of this machine, having been conveyed along the railways upon the waggons to a position immediately under the bridge, were elevated to its level, or thirty feet above the rock, in the following manner. A chain-tackle was suspended over a pulley from the <b>cross-beam</b> connecting the tops of the kingposts of the bridge, which was worked by a winch-machine with wheel, pinion, and barrel, round which last the chain was wound. This apparatus was placed on the beacon side of the bridge, at the distance of about twelve feet from the <b>cross-beam</b> and pulley in the middle of the bridge. Immediately under the <b>cross-beam</b> a hatch was formed in the roadway of the bridge, measuring seven feet in length and five feet in breadth, made to shut with folding boards like a double door, through which stones and other articles were raised; the folding doors were then let down, and the stone or load was gently lowered upon a waggon which was wheeled on railway trucks towards the lighthouse. In this manner the several castings of the balance-crane were got up to the top of the solid of the building.|$|E

The effect, then, of {{the sudden}} enthusiasm for {{classical}} literature, which gained strength during every hour of the fifteenth century, was, as far as respected architecture, {{to do away with}} the entire system of Gothic science. The pointed arch, the shadowy vault, the clustered shaft, the heaven-pointing spire, were all swept away; and no structure was any longer permitted but that of the plain <b>cross-beam</b> from pillar to pillar, over the round arch, with square or circular shafts, and a low-gabled roof and pediment: two elements of noble form, which had fortunately existed in Rome, were, however, for that reason, still permitted; the cupola, and, internally, the waggon vault.|$|E

Genetic mechanical models for <b>cross-beams</b> six-axis force/torque sensors are proposed, in which deformable cross elastic beams and compliant beams are modeled as quasi-static Timoshenko beam. A detailed description of model assumptions, model idealizations, application scope and model establishment is presented. The results are validated by both numerical FEA simulations and calibration experiments, and test results {{are found to be}} compatible with each other {{for a wide range of}} geometric properties. The proposed analytical solutions are demonstrated to be an accurate estimation algorithm with higher efficiency...|$|R
60|$|An old woman, {{the wife}} of a labourer, had been set to nurse him, for the doctor had said that he was not to be left. She moved about the room, {{arranging}} and ordering, grumbling to herself from time to time at this lonely task which had been assigned to her. There were some flowers in broken jars upon a <b>cross-beam,</b> and these, with a touch of tenderness, she carried over and arranged upon a deal packing-case beside the patient's head. He lay motionless, and as he breathed there came a gritty rubbing sound from somewhere in his side, but he followed his companion about with his eyes and even smiled once as she grouped the flowers round him.|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the big <b>cross-beam</b> was in {{position}} and Charnock watched Festing fit the bolt into its fan-shaped socket. He did so with fastidious care and then standing on the beam swung the hammer a workman gave him. The blast-lamp roared upon a timber overhead, throwing down waves of light that flooded the rock face, but the twinkling brightness rather puzzled the eye. For all that, Festing struck the wedge squarely and drove it home with a few heavy blows. Then he fastened the cross-bolt and Charnock filled a ladle with the melted lead. A blue flame flickered about the cavity as he poured in the stuff, there was an angry sputtering, and he afterwards found some holes in his coat. Festing dropped his hammer with a gesture of satisfaction.|$|E
