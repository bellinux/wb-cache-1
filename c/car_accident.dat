30|$|Shorten {{the human}} {{reaction}} time: since more than 90 % of <b>car</b> <b>accidents</b> {{are caused by}} the human factor, if drivers can receive a warning signal earlier by communication technology, they will {{have more time to}} deal with the emergency.

This is also the paper's main concern.|$|R
