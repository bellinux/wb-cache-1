25|$|In cold climates heating air {{and water}} is a major demand on {{household}} energy use. By investing in newer technologies in the home, significant energy reductions are possible. Heat pumps are a more efficient alternative to using electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water. A variety of efficient clothes dryers are available, and the classic <b>clothes</b> <b>line</b> requires no energy, only time. Natural gas condensing boilers and hot air furnaces increase efficiency over standard hot flue models. New construction implementing heat exchangers can capture heat from waste water or exhaust air in bathrooms, laundry and kitchens.|$|E

25|$|Some puzzles are {{criticized for}} the obscurity of their solutions, for example, the {{combination}} of a <b>clothes</b> <b>line,</b> clamp, and deflated rubber duck used to gather a key stuck between the subway tracks in The Longest Journey, which exists outside of the game's narrative and serves only as an obstacle to the player. Others have been criticized for requiring players to blindly guess, either by clicking on the right pixel, or by guessing the right verb in games that use a text interface. Games that require players to navigate mazes have also become less popular, although the earliest text-adventure games usually required players to draw a map if they wanted to navigate the abstract space.|$|E
25|$|Having {{training}} aids {{may make it}} easier to become comfortable with riding a unicycle. One method for training is using a spotter to make riding easier. One other easy way to learn is to find a narrow hallway {{that can be used to}} help alleviate left and right balancing while allowing a beginner to focus on forward and backward balance. If a hallway cannot be found, a fence or <b>clothes</b> <b>line</b> is suitable. Equally, riding back and forth between two chairs, faced back to back, whilst holding on to the chair backs allows the user to gauge how to appropriately position oneself before setting off. Using props such as sticks or ski poles is generally discouraged as they hinder balance and create dependence. A fall onto props could also cause serious injury.|$|E

5000|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} {{the use of}} <b>clothes</b> <b>lines</b> has prompted many governments to pass [...] "right-to-dry" [...] laws allowing their use.

500|$|The {{music video}} was principally at shot at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire and {{directed}} by Nez. It premiered on Channel 4 on 4 December 2008. It starts off with Allen singing from a caravan window, while a <b>clothes</b> <b>line</b> on the right has underwear and a teddybear hanging from it. As she exits, her clothes are revealed to be a smock dress with a big bow and high heels; upon returning through the caravan door, the interior changes {{to that of a}} luxurious mansion, in reality an English country estate. The chorus starts and she walks down the hall, surrounded by butlers, all making synchronised moves and starting a choreography with Allen. Afterwards, she climbs the stairs and the camera cuts to the next scene, where she is sitting {{down in front of the}} mirror in an extravagant bedroom, with dresses, lamps, toys and cupcakes. The scene changes once again, with Allen walking into a room with giant, brightly coloured presents. They suddenly stand up, having two human legs, and begin to spin around, with the singer joining them. After descending the stairs and walking through the same hall she entered, she exits the estate, and the video takes down a darker, more serious tone, while the verse [...] "Forget about guns and forget ammunition/'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission/Now I'm not a saint but I'm not a sinner/Now everything is cool as long as I'm getting thinner" [...] is sung. The euphoric visual effects appear once again soon after, as the chorus takes place. Allen walks down the estate stairs, being surrounded by dancing balloons, hopping butlers and coloured fog. The camera zooms out showing the estate tied in a giant ribbon, but also grey, melancholic clouds, which contrast the cheerful party from before. Allen stated that she hoped the music video would convey parts of the song's sarcasm.|$|E
500|$|In May 2008, Lohan {{made her}} first screen {{appearance}} since I Know Who Killed Me, on ABC's television series Ugly Betty. She guest starred in four episodes as Kimmie Keegan, an old schoolmate {{of the protagonist}} Betty Suarez. Articles about Lohan have appeared in various men's magazines. She was voted No. 10 {{on the list of}} [...] "100 Sexiest Women" [...] by readers of FHM in 2005, No.13 in 2006, No.30 in 2007, and No.41 in 2008, while Maxim placed her third on its [...] "Hot 100" [...] list in 2006 and first in 2007. Lohan has been the face of Jill Stuart, Miu Miu, and Dooney & Bourke, as well as the 2008 Visa Swap British fashion campaign. She was also the face of Italian clothing company Fornarina for its Spring/Summer 2009 campaign. Lohan has a long-lasting fascination with Marilyn Monroe going back to when she saw Niagara during The Parent Trap shoot. In the 2008 Spring Fashion edition of New York magazine, Lohan re-created Monroe's final photo shoot, known as The Last Sitting, including nudity, saying that the photo shoot was [...] "an honor." [...] The New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante found it disturbing, saying [...] "the pictures ask viewers to engage in a kind of mock necrophilia.... the photographs bear none of Monroe's fragility." [...] In 2008, Lohan launched a <b>clothes</b> <b>line,</b> whose name 6126 was designed to represent Monroe's birth date (June 1, 1926). The line started with leggings, before expanding to a full collection, covering 280 pieces [...] In April 2009, Lohan released a self-tanning spray under the brand name Sevin Nyne in collaboration with Sephora. In September 2009, Lohan became an artistic adviser for the French fashion house Emanuel Ungaro. A collection by designer Estrella Archs with Lohan as adviser was presented in October, receiving a [...] "disastrous" [...] reception, according to Entertainment Weekly and New York. Lohan left the company in March 2010.|$|E

500|$|Sunshine offered open fields, and {{the three}} Miller boys quickly took a liking to sport during their childhood, playing Australian rules {{football}} in winter and cricket in summer. Their father had played cricket for Warracknabeal, winning a premiership in the local league in 1900. Les taught the boys {{to play with a}} side-on stance and underlined the importance of orthodox batting technique, reminding his sons to maintain a high leading elbow when hitting the ball. They were taught to rely on a solid defence, concentration, and self-control in the mould of the leading Victorian and Australian Test batsman of the era, Bill Ponsford. Miller began his schooling in Sunshine, where he quickly became known for his diminutive height; {{he was one of the}} smallest children in the school. At the age of seven, Miller moved to the inner-eastern middle-class Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick, where his parents had purchased a two-storey house with a spacious garden that allowed the children to play sport. By this time, his elder brothers had given him the derisive nickname Weedy. Miller's small size and age deficit meant that he conceded a strength advantage to his brothers in backyard cricket matches. This forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, which held him in good stead for his future career. Whenever Miller managed to dismiss his brothers and earn himself some batting time, he typically played with a straight bat in a watchful manner, as it was difficult for him to remove his brothers, meaning that his opportunities with the bat were rare. Miller and his friends would loiter outside Ponsford's home, just [...] away, in the hope of catching a glimpse of their hero.Perry, p. 13. Like Miller in his backyard, Ponsford was known for his powers of concentration and was the first person to score two quadruple centuries in first-class cricket.Perry, p. 14. Miller often practised for hours by himself; he put a tennis ball inside a stocking, before suspending it from a <b>clothes</b> <b>line</b> and hitting it back and forth. Indoors, Miller developed a lifelong love of classical music through a cousin who liked to play Mozart. He played flute in the Elsternwick school band but could not read music.|$|E

2500|$|One {{or both of}} two drying {{techniques}} was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying {{with the}} aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the humidity level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately. [...] Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a <b>clothes</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
