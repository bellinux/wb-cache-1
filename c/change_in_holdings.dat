40|$|Our {{basic premise}} is that fund {{managers}} performance is related to superior information about an asset payoff. We investigate the relationship between managerial skills and trading behavior within a two-period rational expectation equilibrium (REE) model where agents trade on private information in the first round, while a public signal arrives at the second date that makes traders revise their beliefs and retrade. The public signal {{can be related to}} the asset payoff, or to variables not related to fundamentals (noise), or both. We characterize the unique partially revealing REE and explore the drivers of price dynamics and trading behavior. Our main prediction is that good managers are contrarian traders, while bad managers are momentum traders when public news arrive to the market. Furthermore, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings</b> of each type of trader is monotonic on the traders' skills. Based on these predictions, we propose new performance evaluation measures that rely on the manager's <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings</b> around the arrival of public news rather than his past performance. A byproduct of our analysis is the proposal of a new protocol for performance evaluation and Due Diligence (DD) procedures.

40|$|This paper calculates {{effective}} {{tax rates}} on capital income (interest, dividends, and capital gains on equities) in Japan and analyzes {{the impact of}} the revision of the Small Saving Tax Exemption for interest income (the so-called Maruyu System) on Japanese household portfolios. My contributions are as follows: (1) I am the first to calculate effective tax rates on interest, dividends, and capital gains on equities from 1973 to 2001 and calculate the effective tax rates on assets to which the exemption applies (Maruyu assets) and those on assets to which the exemption does not apply (non-Maruyu assets). As a result, I found that (2) before the 1988 revision of the exemption, Maruyu assets such as bank and postal savings deposits were given more preferable tax treatment than non-Maruyu assets such as equities, as is the general perception in Japan, but after the 1988 revision, the situation became reversed, with non-Maruyu assets being given more preferable tax treatment than Maruyu assets. Moreover, (3) I use effective tax rates by age group in the empirical analysis, taking into account {{for the first time the}} amount of principal that is tax-exempt, and (4) I estimate asset demand equations by three-stage least squares to deal with the endogeneity of rates of return, which is so far not taken into account in analyses of the revision of Maruyu system and household portfolios in Japan. And (5) I calculate the amount of the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings</b> of each asset that is caused by the 1988 and 2006 revisions of the Maruyu system, and it turns out that not only the 1988 revision of the exemption but also the 2006 revision will promote a shift in household portfolios away from Maruyu assets and toward non-Maruyu assets, as expected, but that the magnitude of {{the impact of the}} 2006 revision is much less considerable than that of the 1988 revision in the short run as well as the long run.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{companies}} tend to switch auditors when audit opinions are inconsistent {{with those in}} the previous period, financial performances are worse, and both stock and option values fall.

The <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings</b> of executives' stock options are positively correlated with the degree to which analysts' earnings forecasts deviate from previous periods; the announcements of analysts' earnings forecast errors have no influence on the value of executives' options, since that signaling effect has already reflected on the stock price.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{existence}} of earnings and price momentum anomalies for a sample of actively traded stocks in the Bombay Stock Exchange during 2001 - 2006. We also {{examine the relationship between}} these anomalies and the level of ownership by two distinct categories of sophisticated investors, domestic Mutual Funds (MF) and Foreign Institutional Investors (FII). Our findings indicate that using standard time series models, there is clear evidence of a post earnings announcement drift in the Indian market. In addition, after controlling for value and size, both earnings momentum and a three month price momentum exist. The level of ownership by FIIs mitigates the effect of earnings momentum and accentuates the effect of price momentum on stock returns. In contrast, there is no impact of the level of ownership by MFs. We also find that the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings</b> by FIIs are driven by the price momentum whereas the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings</b> by MFs are driven by the earnings momentum. We finally compare the performance of a MF ownership weighted portfolio with a FII ownership weighted portfolio. We find that the FII weighted portfolio has a higher beta and generates a lower beta adjusted return in comparison to the MF weighted portfolio. However, the turnover and holding patterns of the two portfolios are similar...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative fund {{management}} invariably involves portfolio performance being {{measured in}} terms of a quadratic objective function (due to the inclusion of variance terms as a measure of risk). Periodically, the constituents of the fund are adjusted to improve performance. This adjustment incurs a transaction cost which is a modulus function of the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings.</b> Thus the fund manager wishes to minimise a combined quadratic and modulus function. This paper presents a new approach to deal with the minimisation of this hybrid function, using a well tried quadratic programming algorithm.

40|$|<b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> {{quarterly}} <b>holdings</b> of Domestic General Equity unit {{trust funds}} in JSE sectors displayed a negative association with same quarter returns. The results {{were obtained from}} cross tabulations of unit trust sector holdings data taken from the period June 2002 to June 2009. The relationship was consistent with loss aversion behaviour: a tendency to hold stocks with negative returns to avoid realising a loss, and to sell stocks with positive returns to achieve a more immediate gain. This finding at the sector level of unit trust holdings was {{a reversal of the}} positive correlation between <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings</b> and stock returns observed in US mutual funds by Sias, Starks and Titman (2006). Those sectors purchased by Domestic General Equity unit trusts in the preceding quarter generated significant positive abnormal returns over the following quarter. Trading rules, which replicated the weighted purchasing of sectors by unit trusts, were tested for holding periods of between one and four quarters. The trading rule with a single quarter holding period, generated an estimated cumulative return 43 % greater than a benchmark of equal sector weightings from September 2002 to June 2009; but the high level of transaction costs associated with an average annual portfolio turnover ratio of 3. 0 made it impossible to achieve such a return in practice.

40|$|ABNORMAL TRADING BY ADVISORY BANKS BEFORE M&A ANNOUNCEMENTS: COINCIDENCE, SKILLS OR INSIDER TRADING? PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In {{a merger}} and {{acquisition}} (M&A), acquirer’s advisory banks {{are believed to}} have information about the target beforehand. This study investigates whether the banks exploit this inside information to increase their <b>holdings</b> <b>in</b> the target firm before the public announcement. DATA The institutional holdings data are collected from the quarterly 13 F fillings of SEC via WRDS database. The M&A data are collected from SDC Platinum. Other supporting data such as share prices, deal characteristics and company characteristics are acquired from SDC Platinum, Thomson One Banker, CRSP and COMPUSTAT. The final data set consists of 1064 cases for insider trading investigation from 715 M&As. RESULTS The main findings suggest that advisory banks do increase their <b>holdings</b> <b>in</b> the targets before takeover announcements. These increases have already been benchmarked against those of the advisory banks in targets’ peers. On average, the banks start accumulating targets’ shares since 11 quarters before the announcement. However, their <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings</b> <b>in</b> the targets during the last five quarters immediately prior to the takeover are positive, but not statistically significant. In addition, {{the results of this study}} suggest a positive relationship between the trading behavior of the advisory banks and the target premium.

Research completed at the Department of Economics, W. Frank Barton School of BusinessA significant amount of academic literature exits on the United States’ trade deficit, and its financing through foreigners’ purchases of U. S. securities. Over the last several years, the trade relationship between The U. S. and China has received considerable attention as China has acquired large positions in U. S. securities. This study examines the dynamics of how China has allocated its portfolio of short-term and long-term U. S. Treasury securities relative to its holdings of U.

We find that <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> Chinese <b>holdings</b> of short-term Treasuries are well explained through portfolio allocation dynamics, while <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> Chinese <b>holdings</b> of long-term Treasuries are not well explained by portfolio allocation dynamics.

Second, we document that the positive IFRS effects on institutional holdings are concentrated among investors whose orientation and styles suggest they are most likely to benefit from higher quality financial statements, including active, value, and growth investors. These results are consistent with holdings changes being associated with the financial reporting regime change. Finally, we show that increased institutional <b>holdings</b> are concentrated <b>in</b> countries in which enforcement and reporting incentives are strongest, and where the differences between local GAAP and IFRS are relatively high.

40|$|Existing {{evidence}} using US {{data show}} a simultaneous covariability between a stock’s price and quarterly flows {{into and out}} of the stock by institutional investors. In this paper we use data on monthly <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>holdings</b> by all investor groups at the Oslo Stock Exchange to show that such quarterly effects are concentrated within a month. We find a positive relation between monthly net flows into a stock by institutions and foreigners and the stock’s return. We find no evidence of any effects the next month, providing evidence against the hypothesis that quarterly results are due to within-quarter feedback. Such feedback effects must be of less than one month duration. We show that offsetting net inflows by mutual funds and foreigners are net outflows by individual and nonfinancial investors. The interesting question is which of these groups are active in “pushing prices. ” While we can not empirically distinguish which of the various investor groups is reacting, we argue that the most reasonable story is that institutions and foreign investors are the active parties, since the prices move in the direction of these groups’ trades. The lack of next-month feedback (price reversals) is consistent with prices moving toward fundamentals...|$|R

We find that higher cash holdings arise mainly through the management of net working capital, as opposed to asset sales or reductions in investment.

The analysis on 27 developed nations shows an increasing trend in the total value of their foreign equity holdings from 2001 to 2007, followed by a sudden drop during the financial crisis in 2008. In contrast, the declining trend observed in home bias during the 2001 - 2007 period is strengthened during the financial crisis.
