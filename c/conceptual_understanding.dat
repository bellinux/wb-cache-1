5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E
5|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} not on actual {{arithmetic}} computation, {{but rather on}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> and interpretation. The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves exploring data and covers 20–30% of the exam. Students are expected to use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions of data, including univariate, bivariate, and categorical data. The second theme involves planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students {{must be aware of}} the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that can be drawn from the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E
5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} use of learning stories {{as a way to}} gather, analyse and use evidence to support the development of social studies <b>conceptual</b> <b>understandings.</b> This is important because there is limited research in New Zealand related to social studies assessment in secondary school environments, or in the monitoring of <b>conceptual</b> changes in <b>understanding.</b> The limited research that can be drawn upon highlights the challenges social studies teachers face teaching and assessing conceptually. Sociocultural theory featured strongly throughout the research, through the decision to investigate learning stories as an assessment approach, as well as the lens with which to approach the methodology. In order to investigate the Learning Story Framework, as an intervention, a qualitative design-based methodology was utilised involving one in-depth case study. The research composed of three iterative phases, gathering evidence using semi-structured interviews, participant observation and documentation analysis, including reflective journals. The findings suggested that learning stories can be used to support the development of <b>conceptual</b> <b>understandings</b> in conjunction with a reflective class culture, strong community relationships, clarity of planning for and sharing <b>conceptual</b> <b>understandings,</b> and support for students to critically reflect...|$|R
25|$|A common {{misconception}} {{was that}} reform educators {{did not want}} children to learn the standard methods of arithmetic. As the NCTM Focal Points made clear, such methods were still the ultimate goal, but reformers believed that <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> should come first. Reform educators believed that such understanding is best pursued by allowing children at first to solve problems using their own understanding and methods. Under guidance from the teacher, students eventually arrive at an understanding of standard methods. Even the controversial NCTM Standards of 1989 did not call for abandoning standard algorithms, but instead recommended a decreased emphasis on complex paper-and-pencil computation drills and greater attention to mental computation, estimation skills, thinking strategies for mastering basic facts and <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> of arithmetic operations.|$|E

Nevertheless, it is helpful to have a <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> of them.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} features of teaching in the promotion of <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, where teachers typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the U.S.A., where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how one problem is a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.|$|E

25|$|In salt marshes, early ecologists like Eugene Odum and John Teal {{sparked the}} current {{bottom-up}} paradigm in ecology through work on Sapelo Island, GA (U.S.A) that stressed the dominant role of physical factors like temperature, salinity, and nutrients in regulating plant primary productivity and ecosystem structure (Teal 1962, Odum 1971). Ecologists noted that marsh plants were not heavily grazed {{and appeared to}} be relatively unpalatable, and thus argued that most plants entered salt marsh food chains as detritus (Teal 1962). A corollary of this dogma is that consumers play an unimportant or subtle role in controlling salt marsh primary production (Smalley 1960, Teal 1962). This paradigm was widely accepted for decades and applied to other ecosystems like mangroves and seagrass beds (Bertness 2007), and has thus “become entrenched in the <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> of coastal ecosystems” (quote from Bertness and Silliman 2008; Smalley 1960, Nixon 1982).|$|E
25|$|Net {{zero-energy}} building: Based {{on scientific}} analysis within the joint research program “Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings” a methodological framework {{was set up}} which allows different definitions, in accordance with country’s political targets, specific (climate) conditions and respectively formulated requirements for indoor conditions: The overall <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> of a Net ZEB is an energy efficient, grid connected building enabled to generate energy from renewable sources to compensate its own energy demand (see figure 1).The wording “Net” emphasizes the energy exchange between {{the building and the}} energy infrastructure. By the building-grid interaction, the Net ZEBs becomes an active part of the renewable energy infrastructure. This connection to energy grids prevents seasonal energy storage and oversized on-site systems for energy generation from renewable sources like in energy autonomous buildings. The similarity of both concepts is a pathway of two actions: 1) reduce energy demand by means of energy efficiency measures and passive energy use; 2) generate energy from renewable sources. However, the Net ZEBs grid interaction and plans to widely increase their numbers evoke considerations on increased flexibility in the shift of energy loads and reduced peak demands.|$|E

Understanding details of these mathematical concepts {{is not required to}} conceptually appreciate the concrete eversion that arises, which in essence only requires understanding a specific embedded circle drawn on a torus in 3-space. George Francis suggested the name [...] "holiverse", derived from the word [...] "holistic", since (after some thought) the complete eversion can be conceptually grasped from beginning to end, without the visual aids provided by animation. In spirit, this is closer to the ideas originally suggested by Shapiro, and in practice provides a concrete proof of eversion not requiring the abstraction underlying Smale's proof.

Reanalysis of the MET report’s results conducted by Jesse Rothstein, an economist and professor at University of California, Berkeley, dispute some of these interpretations, however.

2500|$|Four‑vectors {{have been}} {{mentioned}} above in context of the energy-momentum , but without any great emphasis. Indeed, none of the elementary derivations of special relativity require them. But once understood, , and more generally tensors, greatly simplify the mathematics and <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> of special relativity. Working exclusively with such objects leads to formulas that are manifestly relativistically invariant, which is a considerable advantage in non-trivial contexts. For instance, demonstrating relativistic invariance of Maxwell's equations in their usual form is not trivial, while it is merely a routine calculation (really {{no more than an}} observation) using the field strength tensor formulation. On the other hand, general relativity, from the outset, relies heavily on , and more generally tensors, representing physically relevant entities.

40|$|ABSTRACT Several {{studies are}} {{reviewed}} that examine differences in moral schema development using techniques intermediate between measuring implicit knowledge (such {{as with the}} De � ning Issues Test) and explicit knowledge (such as with the Moral Judgment Interview). Findings include signi � cant differences in the comprehension of moral narratives based on age/education and on level of expertise. Also, intended moral themes in stories are not understood by younger children. It {{is safe to say}} that most research in moral development has focused on moral judgement (i. e. the reasoning used to advocate a certain action choice in a moral dilemma). In this tradition, researchers recognise that people conceptualise moral problems differently, based on developmental age and education (e. g. Kohlberg, 1984; Rest, 1986). As individuals develop in moral judgement, transformations occur in how they construe their obligations to others. According to a moral constructivist theory, these transformations can be viewed as changing moral schemas (<b>conceptual</b> <b>understandings)</b> about how it is possible to organise co-operation (Rest et al., 1999, 2000). <b>Conceptual</b> <b>understandings</b> are transformed as individual...|$|R
