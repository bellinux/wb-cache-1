40|$|Little {{is known}} about the effect <b>of</b> <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> {{menstruation}} on lung function. The aims of the study were to examine the association of lung function with natural and surgical <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> menstruation, and assess whether lower lung function is associated with earlier age at <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> menstruation. The study was performed in 141   076 women from the UK Biobank, who had provided acceptable and reproducible spirometry measurements and information on menstrual status. The associations of lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1  s (FEV 1), spirometric restriction (FVC[*]<[*]lower limit of normal (LLN)), airflow obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC <LLN)) with <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> menstruation and age at <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> menstruation were assessed using regression analysis. Women who had natural <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> menstruation showed a lower FVC (− 42  mL; 95 % CI − 53 – − 30) and FEV 1 (− 34  mL; 95 % CI − 43 – − 24) and higher risk of spirometric restriction (adjusted odds ratio 1. 27; 95 % CI 1. 18 – 1. 37) than women still menstruating. These associations were stronger in women who had had a hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy. The earlier the natural <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> menstruation, the lower the lung function. There was no clear association of lung function with age at hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy. Airflow obstruction was not associated with <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> menstruation.

An earlier study has demonstrated a significant relationship between the increase in HDL concentrations and spontaneous changes in food intake, specifically an increased fat intake. In this investigation we have dissociated the effects <b>of</b> <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> smoking as such from those of dietary alterations by monitoring plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations after <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> smoking in 12 subjects whose diet was kept constant during an initial 2 -week control period and during 2 weeks following <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> smoking. Under these conditions plasma HDL-cholesterol levels did not increase significantly (1. 01 +/- 0. 26 mmol/l (mean +/- SD) before and 1. 04 +/- 0. 27 mmol/l after <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> smoking). Similarly, no significant alterations were recorded for other plasma lipid or lipoprotein concentrations. Activities of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase were unchanged throughout the study.

40|$|In {{the year}} 1992, two {{publications}} on age-specific mortality rates revealed a <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> demographic aging at later ages in very large cohorts of two dipteran species reared under {{a variety of}} conditions. Despite some initial concerns about possible artifacts, these findings have now been amply corroborated in the experimental literature. The eventual <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> aging undermines the credibility of simple Gompertzian aging models based on a protracted acceleration in age-specific mortality during adulthood. The first attempt to explain the apparent <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> aging was extreme lifelong heterogeneity among groups with respect to frailty. This lifelong heterogeneity theory assumes an underlying Gompertzian aging affecting every member of an adult cohort, with a merely apparent <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> aging explained in terms of the increasing domination of a slowly aging group among the survivors to late ages. This theory has received several experimental refutations. The second attempt to explain the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> aging applied force of natural selection theory. This explanation <b>of</b> the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> aging has been corroborated in several Drosophila experiments. In particular, this theory requires that both age-specific survival and age-specific fecundity cease declining in late life, which has now been experimentally established.

A “beyond-BACI” sampling design provided the framework to detect the effect <b>of</b> the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> farming, which produced qualitative and quantitative changes in the composition and structure of the fish assemblages beneath the sea-cage fish farm compared with two nearby controls. The aggregative effect on wild fish due to the existence of the farm decreased from approximately 50 times compared to nearby controls when the farm was in full operation to 3 ̆c 2 times when only the farm structures remained. Abundances of POM feeders 3 ̆e(large-sized mugilids), large benthic chondrichthyid rays and Pagellus spp. declined markedly at the fish farm after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> farming, suggesting that the removal of daily feeding was responsible for their disappearance. In contrast, abundances of herbivores, benthic macro- and meso-carnivores were similar beneath the fish farm both {{before and after the}} <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> farming. Benthic macro-carnivores, however, were more abundant beneath the sea-cages compared to control locations, supporting the hypothesis that the increase in the physical structure beneath farms plays a role in aggregating these species. Sparids occurred beneath the sea-cages only after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> farming, while the two natural control locations did not show differences from before to after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> farming.

40|$|To assess {{relationships}} between characteristics of methadone maintenance treatment and long-term <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> injecting (> or = 1 year). The incidence <b>of</b> <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> injecting and relapse from non-injecting to injecting was estimated among 488 participants of the Amsterdam cohort study among drug users. We used a nested matched case-control design to identify methadone treatment characteristics significantly and independently related to <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> injecting. To ensure detailed and valid assessment of methadone treatment, {{data of the}} Central Methadone Register were linked with cohort data. For 339 of 488 subjects of the initial study group methadone data were available. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> injecting increased from 2. 2 / 100 person years in 1985 - 89 to 5. 5 / 100 per year in 1995 - 97 (Ptrend = 0. 005). Relapse to injecting was high: 17. 2 / 100 person years (no trend). Methadone dosage and frequency of methadone programme attendance in themselves were not significantly related to <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> injecting. However, an individual increase of 5 mg or more per year (OR 4. 20, 95 % CI 1. 54 - 11. 46) and receiving methadone mainly via the outpatient clinic for drug-abusing prostitutes and foreigners (OR 0. 18, 95 % CI 0. 05 - 0. 59) were independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> injecting.
