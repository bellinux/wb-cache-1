The current methods of determining the bitumen content of bituminous paving mixtures requires the use of potentially hazardous chemicals and several hours of testing time.

40|$|Based {{on results}} of an {{evaluation}} performed {{during the winter of}} 1985 - 86, six Troxler 3241 -B Asphalt <b>Content</b> <b>Gauges</b> were purchased for District use in monitoring project asphalt contents. Use of these gauges will help reduce the need for chemical based extractions. Effective use of the gauges depends on the accurate preparation and transfer of project mix calibrations from the Central Lab to the Districts. The objective of this project was to evaluate the precision and accuracy of a gauge in determining asphalt contents and to develop a mix calibration transfer procedure for implementation during the 1987 construction. The first part of the study was accomplished by preparing mix calibrations in the Central Lab gauge and taking multiple measurements of a sample with known asphalt content. The second part was accomplished by preparing transfer pans, obtaining count data on the pans using each gauge, and transferring calibrations from one gauge to another through the use of calibration transfer equations. The transferred calibrations were tested by measuring samples with a known asphalt content.

40|$|Introduction The long-distance {{behaviour}} of N = 1 supersymmetric field theories {{is believed}} to unravel {{a new kind of}} duality 1. Two theories described in the ultraviolet by different <b>gauge</b> <b>contents</b> and <b>gauge</b> groups flow in the infrared towards the same fixed point of the renormalization group. They effectively describe the same long-range physics. The non-trivial feature of this duality is that the gauge groups of the dual pairs are different. The gist of this relationship is better understood in terms of the dual pair of moduli spaces. In general the scalar potential of a supersymmetric gauge theory comprises two terms known as the D- and F -terms. The possible supersymmetric vacua are labelled by the vanishing of both the D- and F -terms. The locus of the scalar fields where the scalar potential vanishes is the moduli space. In general the gauge group is completely broken by t...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{hazardous}} nature of chemical asphalt extraction agents, nuclear gauges {{have become an}} increasingly popular method of determining the asphalt content of a bituminous mix. This report details the results of comparisons made between intended, tank stick, extracted, and nuclear asphalt content determinations. A total of 315 sets of comparisons were made on samples that represented 110 individual mix designs and 99 paving projects. All samples were taken from 1987 construction projects. In addition to the comparisons made, seventeen asphalt cement samples were recovered for determination of penetration and viscosity. Results were compared to similar tests performed on the asphalt assurance samples {{in an attempt to}} determine the amount of asphalt hardening that can be expected due to the hot mix process. Conclusions of the report are: 1. Compared to the reflux extraction procedure, nuclear asphalt <b>content</b> <b>gauges</b> determine asphalt <b>content</b> of bituminous mixes with much greater accuracy and comparable precision. 2. As a means for determining asphalt content, the nuclear procedure should be used as an alternate to chemical extractions whenever possible. 3. Based on penetration and viscosity results, softer grade asphalts undergo a greater degree 'of hardening due to hot mix processing than do harder grades, and asphalt viscosity changes caused by the mixing process are subject to much more variability than are changes in penetration. 4. Based on changes in penetration and viscosity, the Thin Film Oven Test provides a reasonable means of estimating how much asphalt hardening can be anticipated due to exposure to the hot mix processing environment...|$|R
