40|$|In {{the present}} thesis the {{development}} of new, efficient and bioorthogonal conjugation methods for the derivatization of cube-octameric silsesquioxanes (<b>COSS)</b> is described. The successful synthesis of an octaazide <b>COSS</b> scaffold allowed for the eightfold conjugation of an octa-RGD peptide via copper(I) -catalyzed alkyne-azide [3 + 2] cycloaddition (CuAAC) in a water-free system. As <b>COSS</b> cages are stable in acidic media and aldehydes are easily addressable in this environment, aminooxy-functionalized silsesquioxane derivatives promise high reaction rates upon oxime ligation. Thus, pendant aminooxy groups were introduced into an octaamino <b>COSS</b> precursor by amide coupling with protected aminooxy acetic acid. The subsequent oximation allowed the efficient conjugation {{with a number of}} peptidic molecules having up to 35 amino acids in their backbones, among them functional peptides as [KVSALKE] 5 or disulfide-rich miniproteins. The number of attached ligands was not only dependent on the reaction rate, but was also dictated by the steric and electrostatic repulsion of the ligands. Thus, this work showed different experimental approaches to the synthesis of biofunctionalized <b>COSS.</b> Furthermore, a peptide-COSS conjugate was used to demonstrate the possibility to address a central cellular process (DNA replication in higher cells), showing the great application potential of these nanoparticles. Additionally, a preparatory approach is described that might allow for the synthesis of alcohol- and aldehyde-derivatized <b>COSS</b> particles via biotransformation of halogenated silsesquioxanes using haloalkane dehalogenases. ...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{open source}} {{software}} (<b>COSS)</b> products – privately developed software based on publicly available code – represent a rapidly growing multi-billion dollar market. A unique aspect of competition between <b>COSS</b> firms is that many use software licenses that require their enhancements to be made publicly available, creating an incentive for some firms to free-ride on others contributions. Despite its success, the <b>COSS</b> industry has received scant attention in the marketing literature. We develop a model of competition between <b>COSS</b> firms that incorporates the particular terms of the software licenses. Our model consists of (1) a vertically differentiated duopoly of software firms where product quality is composed of a mix of features and usability and (2) a developers market where firms hire developers to improve their product quality. Our analysis reveals several counterintuitive findings. First, when developers skills are unobservable to firms, all firms profits and consumer surplus can be higher than when skills are observable. Second, <b>COSS</b> products can be of higher quality than traditional closed source products. Third, when the market is large and signaling is costly, firms can benefit when they are mandated to make their software code public, even when one firm completely free-rides...|$|R
