40|$|Public {{concerns}} about incinerator emissions, {{as well as}} the creation of federal regulations for medical waste incinerators, are causing many health care facilities to rethink their choices in medical waste treatment. As stated by Health Care Without Harm, non-incineration treatment technologies are a growing and developing field. Most medical waste is incinerated, a practice that is short-lived because of environmental considerations. The burning of solid and regulated medical waste generated by health care creates many problems. Medical waste incinerators emit toxic air pollutants and toxic ash residues that are the major source of dioxins in the environment. International Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of WHO, acknowledged dioxins <b>cancer</b> <b>causing</b> <b>potential</b> and classified it as human carcinogen. Development of waste management policies, careful waste segregation and training programs, as well as attention to materials purchased, are essential in minimizing the environmental and health impacts of any technology...|$|E
40|$|The Department of Energy's (DOE) {{occupational}} {{radiation protection}} dose limits are specified in 10 CFR 835 (hereafter {{referred to as}} 'regulation'). Ambiguity in the regulation regarding designation of dose and fluence-to-dose conversion factors leads to confusion and disagreement regarding the appropriate choice of conversion factors. Three primary dose quantities of relevance are absorbed dose, D, quality factor, Q, and the product of those, called dose equivalent, H. The modifier Q is intended to express the long-term fatal <b>cancer</b> <b>causing</b> <b>potential</b> of different radiation types and generally increases with energy for neutrons. For photons, Q is close to unity regardless of energy. In principle, H could be estimated by incorporating a phantom and relevant Q values in a radiation-transport model. In practice, this would entail too much model complexity and computer time. The evaluator of H instead relies on pre-calculated energy-dependent fluence-to-dose conversion factors. Three primary sets of fluence-to-dose conversion factors are commonly used to determine stochastic dose for neutrons and photons: (1) ANSI/ANS- 6. 1. 1 - 1977 that incorporates the NCRP- 38 data for neutrons and sets based on Claiborne and Wells for photons, (2) ANSI/ANS - 6. 1. 1 - 1991 {{that are based on}} and nearly identical to the neutron and photon sets in ICRP - 51, and (3) neutron and photon sets in ICRP- 74. The first set is maximum H values in a 30 -cm diameter cylinder phantom for neutrons and in a 30 -cm thick slab phantom for photons. The second set is effective dose equivalent, HE, derived from an anthropomorphic phantom by summing the products of tissue dose equivalents, HT, and tissue weighting factors, w{sub T}. The third set is effective dose, E, also derived from an anthropomorphic phantom by summing the products of H{sub T} and w{sub T}. E is functionally identical to H{sub E} except H{sub T} is the product of D and the radiation weighting factor, w{sub R}, which is similar in meaning to Q...|$|E

40|$|Cancer is {{a complex}} genetic disorder, characterised by {{uncontrolled}} cell proliferation and caused by altered expression of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. When cell proliferation pertains to colon, it is called colorectal cancer. Most of colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>causing</b> genes are <b>potential</b> targets for the miRNA (microRNA) that bind to 3 ′UTR (untranslated regions) of mRNA and inhibit translation. Mutations occurring in miRNA binding regions can alter the miRNA, mRNA combination, and can alter gene expression drastically. We hypothesized that 3 ′UTR mutation in miRNA binding site could alter the miRNA, mRNA interaction, thereby altering gene expression. Altered gene expression activity could promote tumorigenesis in colon. Therefore, we formulated a systematic in silico procedure that integrates data from various databases, followed rigorous selection criteria, and identified mutations that might alter the expression levels of <b>cancer</b> <b>causing</b> genes.

40|$|Objectives. We {{sought to}} analyze how early {{exposure}} to the 1918 influenza pandemic is associated with old-age mortality by cause of death. Methods. We analyzed the National Health Interview Survey (n[*]=[*] 81 [*] 571; follow-up 1989 – 2006; 43 [*] 808 deaths) and used year and quarter of birth to assess timing of pandemic exposure. We used Cox proportional and Fine-Gray competing hazard models for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, respectively. Results. Cohorts born during pandemic peaks had excess all-cause mortality attributed to increased noncancer mortality. We found evidence for a trade-off between noncancer and cancer causes: cohorts with high noncancer mortality had low cancer mortality, and vice versa. Conclusions. Early disease exposure increases old-age mortality through noncancer causes, which include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and may trigger a trade-off {{in the risk of}} <b>cancer</b> and noncancer <b>causes.</b> <b>Potential</b> mechanisms include inflammation or apoptosis. The findings contribute {{to our understanding of the}} causes of death behind the early disease exposure–later mortality association. The cancer–noncancer trade-off is potentially important for understanding the mechanisms behind these associations...|$|R
