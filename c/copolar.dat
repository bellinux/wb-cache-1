40|$|Geometrical defects of a {{high gain}} {{reflector}} antenna can cause the radiation pattern of the antenna to fail to meet its specifications. These defects give rise to loss of gain, widening of the main beam and raising of sidelobes. The geometrical defects can be identified, and subsequently corrected, by utilizing information contained in the phase of the <b>copolar</b> aperture field distribution. For technical reasons, this phase can be difficult or inconvenient to measure directly. Therefore, indirect methods of deducing the phase are often preferred. This thesis introduces an iterative algorithm, called the modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, which has been developed for retrieving the <b>copolar</b> aperture field phase distribution from the far field <b>copolar</b> amplitude pattern. In order to aid convergence of this algorithm, it incorporates information concerning the design and any known aspect of the antenna. The modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm {{is based on the}} conventional Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, originally developed for electron microscopy, but incorporates features of Fienup's phase retrieval algorithms. This thesis reviews radio engineering theory with an emphasis on high gain reflector antennas. In particular, the Fourier transform relationship between the <b>copolar</b> aperture field distribution and the <b>copolar</b> radiation pattern is critically examined. The problem of retrieving the <b>copolar</b> aperture field distribution from the amplitude of its Fourier transform is called a Fourier phase problem. The Fourier phase problem, the uniqueness of its solutions and iterative algorithms for solving it are discussed. Other established methods for determining geometrical defects of an antenna are described and their relative advantages and disadvantages are assessed. The main advantage of the modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is that it requires measurement of only a single <b>copolar</b> amplitude pattern. The modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is evaluated by applying it to computer simulated data and to measured amplitude patterns of an acoustic antenna. This evaluation illustrates the relationship between the accuracy of the data to which the algorithm is applied and the accuracy of the retrieved <b>copolar</b> aperture field phase distribution. The performance of the algorithm appears to be insensitive to the location and dimensions of the geometrical defects of the antenna. The optimum form of the algorithm seems to be versatile and robust enough to offer real hope of being able to retrieve, to a useful level of accuracy, the phase of the aperture field from a single measured radiation pattern amplitude (i. e. {{there is no need to}} measure the phase of the radiation pattern) ...|$|E

40|$|In this work, fully polarimetric {{data from}} POLDIRAD (DLR C-band {{research}} weather radar) {{are used to}} evaluate the degree of polarization of weather radar targets. The degree of polarization can be derived from Wolf?s coherency matrix and, for a given incoherent target, is dependent on the transmit polarization state. However, thanks to unitary transformations, fully polarimetric data allow the retrieval of the degree of polarization corresponding to any desired transmit state. The concept of depolarization response, indicated with p(?, ?), is introduced to illustrate this dependency, and computed depolarization response graphs are shown for canonical incoherent scatterers. Canonical incoherent scatterers are constructed as discrete sums of clouds of canonical (coherent) scatterers and are used to illustrate the behaviour of the degree of polarization at different transmit states for both anisotropic and isotropic weather targets. The degree of polarization is then compared with the <b>copolar</b> correlation coefficient, a variable already in use in radar meteorology, in order to assess whether it brings complementary information or not. When rain is illuminated, if the transmit state lies on the circular/slant circle of the Poincare sphere, (the great circle passing through the poles and +/- 45 linear polarization) we experimentally and theoretically show that the degree of polarization performance is very similar to the <b>copolar</b> correlation coefficient and, indeed, the capability of carrying complementary information to the set of variables normally available to dual-pol radars at hybrid is limited. However, exploration of fully polarimetric weather radar data reveal that these variables can differ. Experimental data are shown and possible physical mechanisms explaining these unexpected differences are discussed. Besides cloud microphysics research, the results might be relevant also for operational purposes because planned weather radars are supposed to operate at hybrid mode. Together with the <b>copolar</b> correlation coefficient, the degree of polarization at circular/slant send is naturally available to these radars {{and the use of the}} latter might bring additional information essentially at zero cost. For a sound evaluation of the utility of the degree of polarization at circular/slant send, it must not be forgotten that the <b>copolar</b> correlation coefficient measured by hybrid radars differs from the <b>copolar</b> correlation coefficient measured at alternate H/V mode. Since the <b>copolar</b> correlation coefficient used in the present work is collected at alternate H/V transmit mode, further research is needed for a more precise assessment of the potential to bring complementary information...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents W-Band {{measurements of}} the <b>copolar</b> correlation co-efficient and Doppler spectrum taken from the University of Wyoming King Air research airplane. These measurements demonstrate the utility of making W-Band polarimetric and Doppler spectrum measurements from an airborne platform in investigations of cloud microphysical properties. ^ Comparison of <b>copolar</b> correlation coefficient measurements with aircraft in situ probe measurements verifies that polarimetric measurements indicate phase transitions, and hydrometeor alignment in ice clouds. Melting layers in clouds were measured by the W-Band system on board the King Air during 1992 and 1994. Both measurements established {{the use of the}} linear depolarization ratio, LDR, to locate the melting layer using an airborne W-Band system. The measurement during 1994 allowed direct comparison of the magnitude of the <b>copolar</b> correlation coefficient with the values of LDR. The relation between the measurements corresponds with a predicted relationship between the two parameters for observation of particles exhibiting isotropy in the plane of polarization. Measurements of needle crystals at horizontal and vertical incidence provided further evidence that the <b>copolar</b> correlation coefficient values agreed with the expected response from hydrometeors possessing a preferred alignment for the side looking case, and hydrometeors without a preferred alignment for the vertical incidence case. Observation of significant specific differential phase at vertical incidence, the first reported at W-Band, corresponded to a significant increase in differential reflectivity overhead, which was most likely produced by hydrometeor alignment driven by cloud electrification. ^ Comparison of the drop size distributions estimated using the Doppler spectra with those measured by the wingtip probes on the King Air reveals that the radar system is better suited under some liquid cloud conditions to provide microphysical {{measurements of the}} cloud or precipitation than the probes. The radiometric calibration of the radar system determines the accuracy of the drop size distribution estimate. The results presented here indicate that the procedure used to absolutely calibrate the W-Band radar system successfully characterized the reflectivity measurements to the extent required to obtain close correspondence between the radar and probe measurements of the drop size distribution. ...|$|E

We show that strongly regular graphs constructed from <b>copolar</b> spaces and from the more general spaces called Δ-spaces are counterexamples to Brouwer's Conjecture. Using J. I. Hall's characterization of finite reduced <b>copolar</b> spaces, {{we find that the}} triangular graphs T(m), the symplectic graphs Sp(2 r,q) over the field F_q (for any q prime power), and the strongly regular graphs constructed from the hyperbolic quadrics O^+(2 r, 2) and from the elliptic quadrics O^-(2 r, 2) over the field F_ 2, respectively, are counterexamples to Brouwer's Conjecture. For each of these graphs, we determine precisely the minimum number of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph into non-singleton components. While we are not aware of an analogue of Hall's characterization theorem for Δ-spaces, we show that complements of the point graphs of certain finite generalized quadrangles are point graphs of Δ-spaces and thus, yield other counterexamples to Brouwer's Conjecture. We prove that Brouwer's Conjecture is true for many families of strongly regular graphs including the conference graphs, the generalized quadrangles GQ(q,q) graphs, the lattice graphs, the Latin square graphs, the strongly regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue - 2 (except the triangular graphs) and the primitive strongly regular graphs with at most 30 vertices except for few cases. We leave as an open problem determining the best general lower bound for the minimum size of a disconnecting set of vertices of a strongly regular graph, whose removal disconnects the graph into non-singleton components.
