5|$|In {{the final}} years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various {{proposals}} for Reconstruction. Some of these called for a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio. Representative James F. Wilson of Iowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution for a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> abolishing slavery. The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.|$|E
5|$|Arizona Proposition 107 – On November 7, 2006, Arizona {{rejected}} a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> banning same-sex marriage and civil unions by 52% of the vote. Two years later Arizona voters approved a more narrow amendment banning only same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota Amendment 1 – On November 6, 2012, Minnesota {{rejected}} a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> banning gay marriage with 53% {{of the electorate}} opposed. A majority of all votes cast {{would be required to}} amend the state constitution.|$|E
25|$|Bills and {{proposed}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> {{would be subject}} to automatic judicial review, following their promulgation. Judicial review of <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> may only be for procedural defects.|$|R
5000|$|A 1961 {{referendum}} approved <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> {{allowing for}} direct {{elections for the}} president {{and the creation of a}} presidential republic. Further <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> were approved in a 1963 referendum following the coup.|$|R
5000|$|The {{initiative}} process, for proposing <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments,</b> may be [...] "direct" [...] or [...] "indirect". States {{that permit}} indirect <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments,</b> like Mississippi, permit legislators to propose an alternative amendment which {{is placed on}} the ballot alongside the direct citizen proposal.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s, Black wrote {{decisions}} relating to the establishment clause, where he insisted on the strict {{separation of church and}} state. The most notable of these was Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared state-sanctioned prayer in public schools unconstitutional. This provoked considerable opposition, especially in conservative circles. Efforts to restore school prayer by <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> failed.|$|E
5|$|Changes in Directive Principles {{require a}} <b>Constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> {{which has to}} be passed by a special {{majority}} of both houses of the Parliament. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting and by the absolute majority of the house – whether the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|Changes to the {{fundamental}} rights require a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> which has to be passed by a special majority of both houses of Parliament. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting. However, the number of members voting should not be less than the simple majority of the house – whether the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5000|$|State <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> prohibiting {{same-sex}} marriage and civil unions is passed in Nebraska and Nevada passes constitutional ban on {{same-sex marriage}} only, but it doesn't {{go into effect}} because the Nevada Constitution requires two ballot votes for citizen-initiated <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments.</b>|$|R
50|$|Politicians {{fought over}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bayh {{was serving}} on the Subcommittee on <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendments</b> in August 1963 when its {{chairman}} Estes Kefauver {{died of a heart}} attack. Judiciary Committee Chairman James Eastland planned to terminate the subcommittee to save money, but Bayh offered to serve as chairman and pay for its staff out of his Senate office budget. Thus, Bayh assumed the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendments</b> Subcommittee chairmanship less than a year into his first term. As chairman, Bayh was the principal architect of two <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments.</b>|$|R
5|$|Early in his career, Ford {{supported}} a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> against desegregation busing. He also floated {{a proposal to}} put the federal budget on a two-year cycle, believing too much time was spent annually on budget wrangling. This idea, based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget, was never implemented. During the Ninety-fifth Congress (1977–1979), {{he was chairman of}} the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Michigan was {{admitted}} to the Union on January 26, 1837. The original 1835 Constitution of Michigan provided for the election of a governor and a lieutenant governor every 2 years. The fourth and current constitution of 1963 increased this term to four years. There was no term limit on governors until a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> effective in 1993 limited governors to two terms.|$|E
5|$|Ministry of Interior {{proposed}} a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> on 15 December 2016 aimed at providing {{constitutional right to}} acquire, possess and carry firearms. The proposed law would, if passed, add a new section to Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic, expressly providing {{the right to be}} armed as part of citizen's duty of participation in provision of internal order, security and democratic order.|$|E
25|$|Subsection 52(3) of the Constitution Act, 1982 {{requires}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> {{to be made}} {{in accordance}} with the rules set out in the Constitution itself. Subsection 52(3) entrenches constitutional supremacy and prevents Parliament and the provincial legislatures from making most <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> using simple legislation.|$|R
40|$|The criticisms toward {{judicial}} review from Richard Bellamy and Jeremy Waldron’s political constitutionalism approach {{demonstrate that they}} do not exclude constitutional courts entirely, as they accept mechanisms of legislative responses, except <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments.</b> This paper concludes that the high number of <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> in Brazil does not mitigate {{judicial review}} critiques. The extensive structure of the Brazilian Constitution imposes frequent changes, which do not modify its essence. Furthermore, the possibility of judicial review over <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> represents that <b>constitutional</b> court could overrule legislative response...|$|R

5|$|Romania {{abolished}} compulsory {{military service}} on October 23, 2006. This came about due to a 2003 <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> which allowed the parliament to make military service optional. The Romanian Parliament voted to abolish conscription in October 2005, with the vote formalising one of many military modernisation and reform programmes that Romania agreed to when it joined NATO in March 2004.|$|E
5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} Electoral College by <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> have been introduced in Congress over the decades. These efforts have, however, been hampered {{by the fact that}} a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate are required to send an amendment to the states, where ratification by three-fourths of the State legislatures or by conventions in three fourths of the states is required for it to become operative.|$|E
5|$|After Michigan gained statehood, {{governors}} {{held the}} office for a two-year term, until the 1963 Michigan Constitution changed the term to four years. The number of times an individual could hold the office was unlimited until a 1992 <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> imposed a lifetime term limit of two four-year governorships. The longest-serving governor in Michigan's history was William Milliken, who was promoted from lieutenant governor after Governor George W. Romney resigned, then was elected to three further successive terms.|$|E

5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century. Two proposals for <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent to the voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Following Baehr v. Lewin, a 1993 {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of Hawaii that found the state's refusal to grant same-sex couples marriage licenses discriminatory, voters in 1998 approved a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> granting the Hawaii State Legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples, and the legislature passed a law banning same-sex marriage. Civil unions were not restricted. Bills creating civil unions were considered several times, but failed to receive committee approval prior to 2009.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{successful}} defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking {{against what he}} saw as violations of constitutional rights. In 1864, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict of Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military interference with the elections in Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> aimed at freeing the slaves.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, the central issue. Beshear favored holding a referendum on a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to allow expanded casino gambling in the state, while Fletcher maintained that expanded gambling would bring an increase in crime and societal ills. The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher {{by a vote of}} 619,686 to 435,895.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the federal}} {{constitutional}} initiative allows citizens {{to put a}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months. The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference {{on the ballot in}} case both proposals are accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.|$|E
5|$|The 1776 {{constitution}} {{provided that}} the vice-president of the Legislative Council would act as governor (who {{was president of the}} Council) should that office be vacant. The 1844 constitution placed the president of the Senate first in the line of succession, as did the subsequent 1947 constitution. A <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> in 2006 created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected on the same ticket for the same term as the governor, and if the office of governor is vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. This office was first filled in 2010.|$|E
