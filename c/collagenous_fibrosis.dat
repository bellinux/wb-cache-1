40|$|Poster PresentationConference Theme: The Extracellular Matrix NicheIntervertebral disc (IVD) {{degeneration}} is a world-wide {{health problem}} and its aetiology is multifactorial with genetic and environmental factors. The IVD {{is a highly}} specialised niche, and contains a nucleus pulposus (NP) rich in proteoglycans (PG) and water, surrounded by a <b>collagenous</b> annulus <b>fibrosis</b> (AF). During IVD degeneration, there is a loss of disc matrix, water, and cells from the NP which results in structural changes to the disc, ultimately altering its function {{and can lead to}} low back pain. In this study, we systematically analysed changes in the matrix proteins in relation to aging and IVD degeneration. Ethics was approved by the IRB, and clinical IVD samples were obtained with patient consent. The AF and NP were dissected from degenerated and non-degenerated samples. Proteins were extracted with 4 M GuHCl buffer, fractionated using CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation, and separated into soluble/insoluble fractions. Proteins were trypsin digested, labeled with iTRAQ reagents for quantitative analysis using LCMS/MS, and identified using ProteinPilot 4. 0. Seven controls were compared to identify age-related changes. In the AF, collagen type I (soluble fraction) and types II and XI (soluble and insoluble fractions) showed a decreasing trend with age. In the NP, type II collagen had a decreasing trend, but in younger controls, was accompanied with increased type I collagen, suggesting a shift in collagen composition. An increasing trend with age was observed for PGs, including decorin, lumican and PRELP (AF and NP), as well as biglycan and mimecan in NP. Seven degenerated samples were compared to controls. Many identified proteins in the degenerated samples showed similar patterns with the controls, indicating that aging and degeneration may involve similar processes. Younger, degenerated samples had elevated levels of lumican, type II collagen, and particularly type I collagen in the NP (insoluble). Older, degenerated IVD had increased aggrecan, decorin and PRELP in the AF (insoluble fraction). Aging and degeneration shared some similarities, as well as differences in the static protein profile. Reduced collagen during degeneration may correlate to decreased tensile strength and fibrotic appearances of degenerated tissues. The differing proteins may aid in understanding the processes involved in aging and degeneration. Further studying of the dynamics of IVD cells in protein production may be achieved with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), which would identify actively synthesised proteins and further elucidate the cellular functions in the IVD...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocytic {{hypophysitis}} {{is a rare}} inflammatory disorder {{which is}} caused by autoimmune destruction of the pituitary gland. Almost all reported cases have been in women and the disease {{is often associated with}} pregnancy. We describe here the first male case of lymphocytic hypophysitis in Korea. The patient presented with headache, impotence, decreased libido, and deteriorated vision. Endocrinologic studies showed panhypopituitarism, and pituitary MRI imaging revealed a homogeneously enhanced pituitary mass with a thickened stalk. Treatment with prednisolone and thyroid hormone for five months was ineffective. Transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary mass was performed successfully with normalization of the visual field defect. Histologic examination revealed diffuse lymphocytic infiltration with dense <b>collagenous</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> consistent with lymphocytic hypophysitis. Lymphocytic hypophysitis should be considered in differential diagnosis even in men with hypopituitarism and an enlarged pituitary gland...|$|E
40|$|In Brazil, Oligacanthorhynchus pardalis (Westrumb, 1821) Schmidt, 1972 {{has been}} {{observed}} in five species of wild felines. In the present study, five roadkilled oncillas (Leopardus tigrinus Schreber, 1775) were collected in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Chronic lesions caused by O. pardalis were observed in the small intestine {{of one of the}} specimens. Histological examination identified a well-defined leukocyte infiltration and an area of <b>collagenous</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> Only males parasites (n = 5) were found, with a prevalence of 20 %. The life cycle of Oligacanthorhynchus species is poorly known, although arthropods may be their intermediate hosts. The low prevalence encountered {{may be related to the}} small number of hosts examined, and the reduced ingestion of arthropods infected by larvae of O. pardalis. This is the first report of O. pardalis parasitizing L. tigrinus in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul...|$|E
40|$|The {{domestication}} of tuna {{species has}} proven {{to be one of the}} most challenging endeavours in aquaculture. Among the issues yet unresolved is the occurrence of ‘puffy snout syndrome,’ a condition in which tumor-like growths form on the head. Ultimately, vision and feeding are impaired and long-term afflictions typically result in mortality. Though few mentions of puffy snout exist in the literature, evidence suggests that it is not uncommon among facilities that hold tunas in captivity. The specific aims of this study were to: a) describe pathological features of puffy snout, and b) investigate its etiology through the evaluation of conditions and protocols at facilities rearing/holding tuna. To describe pathological features of puffy snout, clinical signs were detailed by observing captive tunas in a land-based holding system, and examination of evidence of infection by parasites, bacteria, and viral agents was conducted on tissues collected from fish with and without puffy snout. Histological examination of tissue from normal and affected fish was also conducted. To investigate etiology, a survey was developed and sent electronically to 28 tuna-holding facilities globally. The survey inquired about the prevalence of puffy snout and the husbandry conditions and protocols employed (e. g., biological characteristics, capture and transport procedures, holding system design and water quality, feeding regime). These data were compared across facilities in an attempt to couple puffy snout prevalence with holding conditions and/or protocols. Clinical signs of puffy snout included occlusion of the eyes and mouth, followed by changes to swimming and feeding behaviours. Parasitology, bacteriology, and virology examination all indicated no commonly-found pathological agents were responsible for inducing the condition. Histology showed that puffy snout is largely characterized by the apparent degeneration of muscle tissue with the replacement of a loose <b>collagenous</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and an undetermined fluid filling the interstitial space in tissues anterior to the eye. In dorsal musculature, collagenous growth may occur in the epidermal or hypodermal regions. Based on survey data, the capture and transport process and feeding regime were unrelated to development of puffy snout. However, certain biological (e. g., fish size) and holding system (e. g., tank/pen size) parameters showed weak but non-dismissible coupling with puffy snout prevalence. Survey data and additional personal communication with field researchers confirmed that puffy snout in tuna is solely a captivity-related condition...|$|E
