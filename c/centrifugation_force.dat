Elution into a buffer supplemented with bovine serum albumin avoided column-induced {{changes on the}} surface of the parasites. Biotin-labelled bovine serum albumin, fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis revealed a very intense binding of albumin to the parasite. Incubation and washing of cells without protein supplementation did not result in any damage or lysis of parasites but it did cause extensive shedding of cellular and surface proteins into the supernatant which could be prevented by using the protein-supplemented buffer. A decreasing yield of high molecular weight cellular proteins in relation to centrifugal force was a general phenomenon observed in scanning densitometry of SDS gels after isolation in either protein-supplemented buffer or protein-free buffer. The quantity of shed cellular components increased with increasing centrifugal force. In contrast, quantities of high molecular weight, biotin-labelled surface proteins increased with greater centrifugal force, indicating labelling of otherwise inaccessible residues.

However, as most food product consist of mixtures of ingredients, it is questionable if this high purity is always be necessary. Mild fractionation {{makes use of}} the natural organization of the main components present. In this paper, those components are detached through milling, soaking in water and subsequently using <b>centrifugation</b> <b>forces.</b> Two fractions, soluble protein fraction (SPF) and starch fraction (SF), were studied in a thickened oil-in-water emulsion. The soluble pea protein fraction {{could be used to}} make a good emulsion, which remained stable upon environmental stresses (e. g. heating and freezing). Furthermore, the viscosity of the mildly refined fractions indicated a cooperative effect between the protein network and the starch gelation.

Industrial relevance In this manuscript we aim at understanding the functional properties from fractions that are obtained via mild fractionation concepts. While most focus is now on understanding properties of well-defined, pure ingredients, modern trends, such as increased sustainability and health, point in the direction of less or milder fractionation of plant materials.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} centrifugation on equine sperm total and progressive motility, viability, and acrosomal integrity. We hypothesized that although high <b>centrifugation</b> <b>forces</b> would be detrimental to equine Equus caballus sperm, recovery rates would increase. Ejaculates from six stallions were collected, extended to a concentration of 25 × 106 cells/mL, and subjected for 10 min to (1) no centrifugation (NC) or (2) centrifugation at 400 × g, (3) 900 × g, or (4) 4500 × g. Before and after centrifugation (Day 0), and after 24 h of cooling (Day 1), sperm motility was assessed by computer-assisted semen analysis, and samples were stained with SYBR- 14 /propidium iodide (PI) for viability and with PI/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) –Peanut aglutinin (PNA) (Arachis hypogaea) for acrosomal integrity. The effect of treatment and day on motility, viability, and acrosomal integrity was determined using a mixed linear model. Compared with the other treatments, centrifugation at 4500 × g reduced all end points measured (P < 0. 05). Both 400 × g and 900 × g yielded lower recovery rates than that of 4500 × g (NC = 100. 0 ± 0. 0 %; 400 × g = 54. 4 ± 8. 6 %; 900 × g = 75. 0 ± 7. 1 %; 4500 × g = 97. 9 ± 2. 8 %; P < 0. 05). Centrifugation at 400 × g or 900 × g did not damage equine sperm.

In Experiment 1, cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were collected from slaughterhouse ovaries and randomly allocated to different RCFs (3, 000 rpm: 970 g; 6, 000 rpm: 3, 900 g; or 10, 000 rpm: 10, 840 g) for 10 or 20 min. Percentages of visible GV were 76 - 79 % in the oocytes centrifuged with 10, 000 rpm, which were significantly higher (p< 0. 01) than those with 3, 000 and 6, 000 rpm. No significant differences in GV visibility were observed among oocytes with different lengths of centrifugation (p< 0. 05) regardless of the RCFs. In esperiment 2, the maturation rate of the oocyte was found significantly lower in the 20 min than in the 10 min group received 10, 840 g of RCF (30 vs. 75 %, p< 0. 05). In conclusion, the GV of porcine oocytes can be clearly visible by centrifugation at 10, 840 g for 10 min without compromising their subsequent maturation rates and a longer centrifugation time (20 min) had no beneficial influence on the visibility of GV stage pig oocytes...|$|E

40|$|Cell pellets {{formed by}} {{centrifugation}} provided a good system {{to study the}} osmotic behavior, electroporation, and interaction between cells. Rabbit erythrocyte pellets were {{used in this study}} because they were simpler than nucleated cells to model analytically. Structurally, cell pellets possessed properties of porous solid bodies and gels. Electrically, cell pellets were shown to behave as a parallel set of resistance, Rp, and capacitance, Cp. Information on pellet structures was obtained from electric measurements. The pellet resistance reflected the intercellular conductivity (porosity and gap conductivity), whereas the pellet capacitance depended mostly on membrane capacitance. The pellet resistance was more sensitive to experimental conditions. The intercellular gap distance can be derived from pellet porosity measurements, providing the cell volume and surface area were known. Rp increased and relaxed exponentially with time when centrifugation started and stopped; the cycles were reversible. When supernatants were exchanged with solutions containing hypotonic electrolytes or macromolecules (such as PEG) after the pellets were formed, complicated responses to different colloidal osmotic effects were observed. A transient decrease followed by a large increase of Rp was observed after the application of a porating electric pulse, as expected from a momentary membrane breakdown, followed by a limited colloidal-osmotic swelling of pelleted cells. The equilibrium values of Rp, Cp, pellet porosity, and intercellular distances were measured and calculated as functions of cell number, <b>centrifugation</b> <b>force,</b> and ionic strength of the exchanged supernatant. Thus, the structure and properties of cell pellets can be completely characterized by electrical measurements...|$|E

This master thesis presents an analytical method used for analysis of oxidation products. The aim of this project was {{to come up with}} a method to separate the oil from the water-phase, to a sufficient yield and as pure as possible for analysis in a spectrophotometer called FoodLab fat. During the way experiments regarding stability of oils and finally a stability study on emulsions were done. Starting the separation experiments with ethanol to break the emulsion, this turned out to be the best way to go. Further investigation through extractions with 2 - propanol/isooctane and ethanol/heptane were tested. The method needed to be simple, easy to use and not too time-consuming but still be repeatable and reliable. To optimize the separation, different <b>centrifugation</b> volumes, <b>forces</b> and times were tested.

40|$|The current {{success of}} soy foods is driving soy {{ingredient}} manufacturers to develop innovative products for food manufacturers. One such innovation is separating the soy proteins glycinin and beta-conglycinin {{to take advantage}} of their individual functional and nutritional properties. Precipitation by acidification is a low-cost method for separating these two proteins. Separation is achieved by preferentially precipitating glycinin at pH ~ 6 while beta-conglycinin remains in solution. Understanding the particle formation during protein precipitation is important as it can influence the efficiency of the precipitation process as well as subsequent downstream processes such as the particle-liquid separation step, usually achieved by centrifugation. Most of the previous soy protein precipitation studies are limited to precipitation at pH 4 as this is the pH range most commonly used in the commercial manufacturing of soy protein isolates. To date, there have been no studies on the particle formation during precipitation at pH > 5. Precipitation of soy protein is generally thought to occur by the rapid formation of primary particles in the size range of 0. 1 - 0. 3 microns followed by aggregation of these particles via collision to aggregates of size about 1 - 50 microns. The formation of the primary particles occurs on a time scale much shorter than that of the overall precipitation process (Nelson and Glatz, 1985). This study shows that precipitation of soy protein is indeed rapid. At high pH levels, binary liquid-liquid separation occurs forming a protein-rich heavy phase. The protein-rich phase appears as droplets which can be coalesced to form a uniform bulk layer under <b>centrifugation</b> <b>forces.</b> Upon lowering the pH level by the addition of acid, further protein is precipitated as amorphous material which binds the droplets together to form aggregates of amorphous precipitates. Liquid-liquid separation has been observed in many protein solutions but this phenomenon has only scarcely been reported in the literature for soy proteins. It presents an exciting opportunity for an innovative product. Features of the liquid-phase protein such as protein yield and purity will be characterized...|$|R

Four criteria in terms of {{physical and chemical properties}} of Co-MCM- 41 were proposed for quality control of catalysts. After centrifugation at 120 000 g, SWCNT purity index based on absorption spectra of sodium cholate (SC) dispersed tubes is 0. 268, approaching the previously estimated value (∼ 0. 325) for analytically pure SWCNTs. It is a significant improvement compared to previously reported high-purity samples (e. g., super purified HIPCO (Unidym) with purity index) 0. 087, and SWeNT SG 65 (SouthWest NanoTechnologies) with purity index) 0. 194). In photoluminance emission spectra of SC dispersed SWCNTs, (1) line width for E 11 emission peaks at E 22 excitation energy, (2) intensities of three sidebands, and (3) intensities of E 11 emission peaks at E 33 excitation energy are found to be related to SWCNT purity. Theoretical models predict that SC molecules adsorbed on the surface of SWCNTs account for about 40 - 60 wt % of tube samples. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) confirm that SC cannot be easily washed away by common solvents. However, after removal of metallic residues (0. 15 wt % by TGA), absorbed SC molecules can be eliminated by heating in air at 350 °C for 30 min.

Following hydration of proliposomes, separation of BDP-entrapped liposomes from the unentrapped (free) BDP at an optimized centrifugation duration of 90  min and a <b>centrifugation</b> <b>force</b> of 15, 500 g were identified. The dispersion medium {{was found to have}} a major influence on separation of BDP-entrapped liposomes from the unentrapped drug. Entrapment efficiency values were higher than 95 % as estimated when DW was used. By contrast, the entrapment efficiency was 19. 69 ± 5. 88, 28. 78 ± 4. 69 and 34. 84 ± 3. 62 % upon using D 2 O as a dispersion medium (for LMH-, sorbitol- and D-mannitol-based proliposomes, respectively). The similarity in size of liposomes and BDP crystals was found to be responsible for co-sedimentation of liposomes and free BDP crystals upon centrifugation in DW, giving rise to the falsely high entrapment values estimated. This was remedied by the use of D 2 O as confirmed by light microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance ((1) HNMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and entrapment studies. This study showed that carrier type has a significant influence on the entrapment of BDP in liposomes generated from proliposomes, and using D 2 O is essential for accurate determination of steroid entrapment in the vesicles...|$|E

Also observed were two time- and temperature-dependent stabilization processes in which the force required for dislodgment increased. One of the stabilization processes was sensitive to dinitrophenol and was inactive at 4 degrees C; the second was still active in metabolically blocked cells.

The relationship between free-cell DNA and pathological pro-cesses has revealed a possible way how to define new biological markers for non-invasive cancer or prenatal diagnostics [6, 7]. Real time PCR-based methods are able to detect and quantify extremely small amounts of nucleic acids. Recently published papers show that fetal plasma DNA is even amplifiable at concentrations of 1 – 5 genome [...] equivalents/ml of blood [8]. However, an extremely short halftime of plasma DNA [9] and many pre-analy-tical variables (type of blood anticoagulant, transport conditions, delayed plasma separation, <b>centrifugation</b> <b>force,</b> freezing-thawing, storage, etc.) may affect the number of free DNA molecules in plasma specimens. Also, additional plasma modifications (filtration or fractionation on gradients) and adaptations of extracti-on protocols significantly affect the quantity and varia-tion of plasma DNA [10]. The goal of our study was to compare six nucleic acids extraction protocols to define the optimal pre-analytical approach for further molecular analyses ba-sed on plasma DNA. Material and Methods A blood pool was made from venous EDTA blood specimens of ten healthy individuals. Plasma was se-parated by centrifugation at 1600 g for 10 min within 3 h after collection, pooled, divided into thirty 1 -ml ali-quots, and stored at – 70 oC prior to analysis. Cell lysis, protein denaturation, and isolation of nucleic acids (NA) from 900 µl of the aliquoted pool were performed by six different extraction procedures: a) phenol/chloroform DNA extraction method after SDS and proteinase K lysis [11]; b) phenol/chloroform DNA extraction with addition of a polyacryl DNA carrier (Molecular Research Cen-ter, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) before lysis; c) salting-out protein precipitation method with 6 M so-dium chloride [12]; d) DNA extraction with commercial spin microcolumn...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{centrifugation}} protocols {{result in}} important sperm losses during {{removal of the}} supernatant. In this study, the effect of <b>centrifugation</b> <b>force</b> (400 or 900 × g), duration (5 or 10 min), and column height (20 or 40 mL; Experiment 1); sperm concentration (25, 50, and 100 × 10 [superscript 6]/mL; Experiment 2), and centrifugation medium (EZ-Mixin CST [Animal Reproduction Systems, Chino, CA, USA], INRA 96 [IMV Technologies, Maple Grove, MN, USA], or VMDZ [Partnar Animal Health, Port Huron, MI, USA]; Experiment 3) on sperm recovery and survival after centrifugation and cooling and storage were evaluated. Overall, sperm survival was not affected by the combination of centrifugation protocol and cooling. Total sperm yield was highest after centrifugation for 10 min at 400 × g in 20 -mL columns (95. 6 ± 5 %, mean ± SD) or 900 × g in 20 -mL (99. 2 ± 0. 8 %) or 40 -mL (91. 4 ± 4. 5 %) columns, and at 900 × g for 5 min in 20 -mL columns (93. 8 ± 8. 9 %; P < 0. 0001). Total (TMY) and progressively motile sperm yield followed a similar pattern (P < 0. 0001). Sperm yields {{were not significantly different}} among samples centrifuged at various sperm concentrations. However, centrifugation at 100 × 10 [superscript 6]/mL resulted in significantly lower total sperm yield (83. 8 ± 10. 7 %) and TMY (81. 7 ± 6. 8 %) compared with noncentrifuged semen. Centrifugation in VMDZ resulted in significantly lower TMY (69. 3 ± 22. 6 %), progressively motile sperm yield (63. 5 ± 18. 2 %), viable yield (60. 9 ± 36. 5 %), and survival of progressively motile sperm after cooling (21 ± 10. 8 %) compared with noncentrifuged semen. In conclusion, centrifuging volumes of ≤ 20 mL minimized sperm losses with conventional protocols. With 40 -mL columns, it may be recommended to increase the centrifugal force to 900 × g for 10 min and dilute the semen to a sperm concentration of 25 to 50 × 10 [superscript 6]/mL in a milk- or fractionated milk-based medium. The semen extender VMDZ did not seem well suited for centrifugation of equine semen...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} realise the {{potential}} of embryonic stem (ES) cells as a regenerative medicine, {{it is crucial that}} economical, robust and scalable bioprocesses be established. Because bioprocesses irrevocably define the safety and efficacy of any biologically derived product, an understanding of the the impact of the engineering environment on ES cells is sought. This thesis uses murine ES cells as a mimic for ES cell types that will be used in cell based regenerative medicine applications to examine the bioprocessing impact of centrifugal recovery cells. A micro scale-down approach was used to examine the e�ffects of centrifugal <b>force,</b> <b>centrifugation</b> time and process temperature on both the yield and biological characteristics of cells subjected to batch centrifugation. When subjected to centrifugation, mES cell loss and cell damage does not appear to occur during the settling or cell pelleting. In general, 5 - 25...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} four different microfluidic technologies {{that can be used}} as stand-alone devices or integrated in point-of-care systems. The first technology is a rapid, low-cost, portable microfluidic system for assessing the somatic cell count and fat content of milk in 15 min using a “sample-in, answer-out” approach. The system consists of twelve independent microfluidic devices, essentially flattened funnel structures, fabricated on the footprint of a plastic compact disc (CD). The assay separates cells and fat globules based on their densities (by differential sedimentation), concentrating white cells in the closed-end channel near the outer rim of the CD for estimation of total “cell pellet” volume, while fat globules move toward the center of disc rotation, forming a fat “band” in the funnel. The closed-end channel provides accurate cell counts over the range 50, 000 to over 3, 000, 000 cells per mL. A technique is also presented to recirculate liquids in a microfluidic channel by alternating the predominance of centrifugal and capillary forces. With this technique, liquid volumes of μL to mL can be sampled with many sizes of microfluidic channels that contain {{only a fraction of the}} sample at one time, provided the channel wall with greatest surface area is hydrophilic. We present a theoretical model describing the balance of centrifugal and capillary forces in the device and validate the model experimentally. Towards the development of an integrated pathogen identification system, two other technologies are demonstrated and implemented. The design, fabrication, and characterization of a polymer centrifugal microfluidic system for the specific detection of bacterial pathogens is presented. This single-cartridge platform integrates bacteria capture and concentration, supernatant solution removal, lysis, and nucleic-acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) in a single unit. The unit is fabricated using multilayer lamination and consists of five different polymer layers. Bacteria capture and concentration are accomplished by sedimentation in five minutes. <b>Centrifugation</b> <b>forces</b> also drive the subsequent steps. A wax valve is integrated in the cartridge to enable high-speed centrifugation. Oil is used to prevent evaporation during reactions requiring thermal cycling. Device functionality was demonstrated by real-time detection of E. coli cells from a 200 -μL sample. Finally, the laser-printer-based fabrication of pressure-resistant microfluidic single-use valves is reported, along with their implementation on pressure-driven and centrifugal microfluidic platforms. A laser printer is used to selectively deposit toner on a plastic substrate in the form of circular dots. After assembly into a microfluidic device, the valve is opened (melted) with a pulse of laser light. This is an easy approach to connect multiple fluidic levels. This simple technology is compatible with a range of polymer microfabrication technologies and should facilitate the development of fully integrated, (re) configurable, and automated lab-on-a-chip systems, particularly when reagents must be stored on chip for extended periods, e. g. for medical diagnostic devices, lab-on-a-chip synthetic systems, or hazardous bio/chemical analysis platforms. ...|$|R
40|$|Living excised {{roots of}} pea were {{centrifuged}} at 20, 000 g for 24 hours, {{and the behavior}} of organelles was followed by electron microscopy at various intervals after <b>centrifugation.</b> With these <b>forces,</b> organelles are not perceptibly or irreversibly damaged, nor is {{the viability of the}} whole root destroyed. Organelles stratify generally in the order of lipid (centripetal pole), vacuoles, smooth endoplasmic reticulum and dictyosomes, proplastids (without starch), mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, proplastids with starch. The nucleus distends from the vacuolal region to the extreme centrifugal pole of the cell, while the chromatin and nucleolus seek the centrifugal pole of the nucleus. During the redistribution of organelles the rough endoplasmic reticulum is among the first to rein ient, and possible explanations for this are discussed. Mitochondria can be stretched elastically many times their original length, but proplastids seem fairly rigid. Small vacuoles, <b>forced</b> together during <b>centrifugation,</b> apparently may fuse to form a large unit. Lipid droplets, on the other hand, tend to remain separate.

40|$|Both {{experiments}} and numerical simulations {{have shown that}} centrifugation can have a large inßuence on convection and segregation during vertical Bridgman growth. The buoyancy-driven ßow pattern di¤ers dramatically from that observed without <b>centrifugation.</b> The Coriolis <b>force</b> introduces an azimuthal circulation that cannot be seen via the usual side view of the ampoule. The ßow pattern and intensity depend on the rotation rate, centrifuge arm length, and interface shape. Several {{experiments and}} numerical simulations exhibited a minimum in axial convection or segregation at a particular rotation rate. A correlation for {{these results indicate that}} the minimum in convection occurs at a rotation rate that is independent of the centrifuge arm length, proportional to the square root of the depth of the concave interface, and inversely proportional to the ampoule radius. In attempts to better understand this minimum, three simple models have been proposed, here called ªbuoyancy-Coriolis balanceº, ªßow transitionº, and ªthermal stabilityº. The thermal stability model is developed here. Unfortunately, none of these models agree with the correlation to the published experimental and numerical results. Numerical simulations show that rotation of a vertical ampoule about its own axis at a constant rate may be a better method to control convection. (1998 Elsevier Science B. V.
