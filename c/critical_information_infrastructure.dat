40|$|Abstract. In {{this chapter}} {{we discuss the}} {{susceptibility}} of <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to computer-borne attacks and faults, mainly due to their largely computerized nature, and to the pervasive interconnection of systems all over the world. We discuss how {{to overcome these problems}} and achieve resilience of <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> through adequate architectural constructs. The architecture we propose is generic and may come to be useful as a reference for modern <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> We discuss four main aspects: trusted components which induce prevention; middleware devices that achieve runtime automatic tolerance and protection; trustworthiness monitoring mechanisms detecting and adapting to non-predicted situations; organization-level security policies and access control models capable of securing global information flows. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{protection of}} <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> requires an analytical process {{to identify the}} critical components and their interplay, to determine the threats and vulnerabilities, to assess the risks and to prioritise countermeasures where risk is unacceptable. The abstraction-based approach presented here builds on a model-based construction of an attack graph with constraints given by the network security policy. A unique feature of the presented approach is, that abstract representations of these graphs can be computed that allow comparison of focused views on the behaviour of the system. In order to analyse resilience of <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> against exploits of unknown vulnerabilities, generic vulnerabilities for each installed product and affected service {{are added to the}} model. The reachability analysis now considers every possible choice of product, and so all alternatives are evaluated in the attack graph. The impact of changes to security policies or network structure can be visualised by differences in the attack graphs. Results of this analysis support the process of dependable configuration of <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The largely {{computerised}} {{nature of}} critical infrastructures and the pervasive interconnection of systems {{all over the}} world have generated the problem of achieving resilience of <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> namely against computer-borne attacks and severe faults. We believe the complexity of the problem prevents it from being solved using classical security methods. The paper focuses on the computer systems behind electrical utility infrastructures, and proposes the blueprint of a distributed systems architecture that we believe may come to be useful as a reference for modern <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in general. The architecture is populated with a set of classes of techniques and algorithms, based on paradigms providing resilience to faults and attacks in an automatic way. ...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> use Web-based {{systems for}} {{deploying}} core services (e. g., {{an information service}} {{to the citizens of}} a large city in case of a natural disaster) because of the pervasiveness of Web technologies. Web systems have been mainly modeled up to now from a performance analysis point of view through queuing networks and discrete-time simulation approaches. However, since Web systems are a building and enabling technology of <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> it is also opportune to investigate how to include in the model the interactions and interdependencies with human entities and other critical infrastructures. In this paper, we analyze how the agent-based modeling approach can be applied to a Web system that provides a critical infrastructure application and to its environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the past}} few decades, {{critical}} infrastructures have become largely computerised and interconnected all over the world. This generated the problem of achieving resilience of <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> against computer-borne attacks and severe faults. Governments and industry have been pushing an immense research effort in information and systems security, but we believe {{the complexity of the}} problem prevents it from being solved using classical security methods. The paper focuses on the computer systems behind electrical utility infrastructures. It proposes the blueprint of a distributed systems architecture that we believe may come to be useful as a reference for modern <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in general. The architecture is instantiated with a set of classes of techniques and algorithms, based on paradigms providing resilience to faults and attacks in an automatic way. ...|$|R

If we know our system and lead a safety-conscious life we can avoid unpleasant events, system down. The <b>Critical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Infrastructures</b> has become a complex network. Consequently the items of the system, their mutual effects and links and the map of the network have to be known properly. We have to realize that everything is linked with each other and the physical and logistical networks have mutual effects on each other as well. It is obvious, that the problem of mapping the complexity is very important. One of {{the most important part of}} the cognition is the obtainment and sorting of information.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{approach}} {{we have taken}} in the INcreasing Security and Protection through Infrastructure Resilience (INSPIRE) project to improve the protection of <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The core idea of the INSPIRE project is to protect <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (CIIs) by appropriately configuring, managing and securing the communication network infrastructure which interconnects supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, the key building blocks of CIIs. In order to do so, a self-reconfigurable architecture has been designed, which provides mechanisms for detecting, diagnosing, and treating faults and attacks which might compromise the correct operation of a critical infrastructure. The paper presents the overall architecture of the INSPIRE framework and provides {{a detailed description of}} some key system components, namely the subsystems in charge of the monitoring, of the diagnostic activities and of the provision of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) network support...|$|R

40|$|The INSPIRE project aims at {{enhancing}} the European {{potential in the}} field of security by ensuring the protection of <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> through (a) the identification of their vulnerabilities and (b) the development of innovative techniques for securing networked process control systems. To increase the resilience of such systems INSPIRE will develop traffic engineering algorithms, diagnostic processes and self-reconfigurable architectures along with recovery techniques. Hence, the core idea of the INSPIRE project is to protect <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> by appropriately configuring, managing, and securing the communication network which interconnects the distributed control systems. A working prototype will be implemented as a final demonstrator of selected scenarios. Controls/Communication Experts will support project partners in the validation and demonstration activities.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{penetration of}} information systems into all sectors of human activity is also a cause {{of the increase in}} the number of cyber-attacks. This trend also has also hit <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (further only - CII). Their failure could have a great impact on the population - and the state itself. Nowadays, networking between industrial systems is increasing rapidly. That is why there is an ever-growing number, sophistication and complexity of cyber-attacks on CIIs. This trend is thus leading to the formation of a new cyber battlefield, where private and state players - each promote their own interests by means of sophisticated cyber weapons. © 2015 University of Defence...|$|R
