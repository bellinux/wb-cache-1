5|$|Murray <b>cod</b> {{continue}} a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species: Murray <b>cod</b> are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout <b>cod</b> are the specialist upland species. The pattern is slightly blurred in the <b>cod</b> species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray <b>cod</b> push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout <b>cod</b> stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic pattern of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present.|$|E
5|$|Murray <b>cod,</b> like {{a number}} of other Murray-Darling native fish species, have also managed to cross the Great Dividing Range at least once through natural river capture events, leading to several species and {{subspecies}} of coastal <b>cod.</b> The best known are eastern freshwater <b>cod</b> of the Clarence River system in northern New South Wales, and Mary River <b>cod</b> of the Mary River system in south eastern Queensland, both of which are endangered, but survive today. Coastal <b>cod</b> were also found in the Richmond River system in northern New South Wales and the Brisbane River system in southern Queensland, but are now extinct.|$|E
5|$|The Murray <b>cod</b> (Maccullochella peelii) {{is a large}} Australian predatory {{freshwater}} fish of the Maccullochella genus and the Percichthyidae family. Although the species is called a <b>cod</b> in the vernacular, it {{is not related to}} the Northern Hemisphere marine <b>cod</b> (Gadus) species. The Murray <b>cod</b> {{is an important part of}} Australia's vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia's human culture. The Murray <b>cod</b> is the largest exclusively {{freshwater fish}} in Australia, and one of the largest in the world. Other common names for Murray <b>cod</b> include <b>cod,</b> greenfish, goodoo, Mary River <b>cod,</b> Murray perch, ponde, pondi and Queensland freshwater <b>cod.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this letter, we {{introduce}} a novel two-channel biorthogonal subband <b>coder.</b> The new <b>coder</b> employs the ladder structure (or so-called wavelet with lifting scheme). The coding gain of the biorthogonal <b>coder</b> is always {{greater than or}} equal to unity, and it can be expressed in closed form. Moreover the proposed <b>coder</b> has a very low complexity and the perfect reconstruction property is structurally preserved. Given any filter order, the optimal solution can be found by the well-known Levinson fast algorithm. For both AR(1) process and MA(1) process, the proposed biorthogonal <b>coder</b> with 2 taps has a higher coding than the optimal orthonormal <b>coder</b> with infinite number of taps.

5|$|The Murray <b>cod</b> is {{the apex}} aquatic {{predator}} in the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin, and will eat almost anything smaller than itself and anything in its way, including finned fishes such as smaller Murray <b>cod,</b> golden perch, silver perch, bony bream, eel-tailed catfish, western carp gudgeon, and Australian smelt and introduced fish such as carp, goldfish, and redfin (English perch), {{as well as}} crustaceans such as yabbies, freshwater shrimp, and Murray crayfish. Fish compose {{the majority of the}} diet of mature Murray <b>cod</b> in lowland river and impoundment habitats, and that Murray <b>cod</b> are apex predators in these habitats. Murray <b>cod</b> have also been known to eat ducks, cormorants, freshwater turtles, water dragons, snakes, mice, and frogs. The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray <b>cod</b> with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray <b>cod</b> as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct. While this behaviour is typical during the day, at night, Murray <b>cod</b> are active pelagic predators, venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between river flows and Murray <b>cod</b> recruitment {{are more complex}} than first thought, and in less regulated rivers, Murray <b>cod</b> {{may be able to}} recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows. (Significant recruitment of Murray <b>cod</b> in low-flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven.) This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in the survival and recruitment of Murray <b>cod</b> larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and recruitment of Murray <b>cod</b> larvae to a much greater degree than first thought; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in the current state of Murray <b>cod</b> stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than first thought.|$|E
5|$|After {{two months}} at sea, land was sighted on November 9 {{off the coast}} of Cape <b>Cod.</b> They {{attempted}} to sail south to the designated landing site {{at the mouth of the}} Hudson but ran into trouble in the region of Pollack Rip, a shallow area of shoals between Cape <b>Cod</b> and Nantucket Island.

40|$|A {{criterion}} for selecting a lossy <b>coder</b> for still images is proposed. The "optimum" <b>coder</b> using this criterion is selected {{to maximize the}} minimum Chernoff information between pairs of distributions which are {{the most difficult to}} distinguish from achievable and non-achievable regions using this <b>coder.</b> The resulting <b>coder</b> has the property that the average Bayesian error probability, for the problems of hypothesis testing between distributions from achievable and non-achievable regions, is less than the average Bayesian error probability for any other choice of <b>coder.</b> The <b>coder</b> selection procedure may be applied without a knowledge of what distortion measure is more suitable for images and does not require an explicit evaluation of error probabilities. Several examples of <b>coder</b> selection are included to illustrate the procedure...|$|R

This paper {{describes}} {{the performance of}} a simple counter based entropy <b>coder,</b> as compared to other entropy coders, especially Huffman <b>coder.</b> Lossless data compression, such as Huffman <b>coder</b> and arithmetic <b>coder,</b> are designed to perform well over a wide range of data entropy.

5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray <b>cod</b> caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray <b>cod,</b> nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray <b>cod</b> at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray <b>cod,</b> even on a catch and release basis.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals.

Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder. The highest quality <b>cod</b> was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, a {{thorough}} reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports {{reveals that the}} whole history of wild Murray <b>cod</b> between the mid–1800s and the mid–1900s was one of citizen agitation, government inaction, and ongoing stock decline. For decade after decade, riverside residents, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local fisheries inspectors, fish retailers, and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the evidently, continuously declining Murray <b>cod</b> stocks, to be met in turn either with government denials, or conversely, with various ineffective inquiries into Murray <b>cod</b> stocks and fisheries, and various ineffective control measures. For decade after decade, debate about excessive fishing pressure, number of fishermen, number of nets, net mesh size, bag limits, minimum size limits and take of small <b>cod,</b> closed seasons and the taking of spawning <b>cod</b> full of eggs during spring, and other sundry issues, raged on and on without proper resolution, with fishing regulations either not amended, or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored, and with heavy commercial, recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated. The end result was a Murray <b>cod</b> population, initially unimaginably abundant, continually fished down and down and down without pause, until in the early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation (listed below) emerged to drive the species even further into decline. All of these drivers of decline have left this iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation. There are now grave concerns for the long-term survival of wild Murray <b>cod</b> populations.|$|E

40|$|The {{feedback}} loop for temporal prediction of traditional implementations of an MPEG-compliant video <b>coder</b> requires conversion of {{images from the}} spatial domain to the transform domain {{and then back to}} the spatial domain due to the restriction of motion estimation schemes performed only in the spatial domain, severely limiting the throughput of the <b>coder.</b> However, it was shown that the low-complexity DCTbased motion estimation scheme (DXT-ME) can remove this bottleneck and thus reduce the overall <b>coder</b> complexity.
