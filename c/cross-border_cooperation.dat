25|$|Like other post-socialist {{regimes in}} eastern Europe, Bulgaria found the {{transition}} to capitalism rather painful and not easy as expected. State-owned enterprises lost their former markets and could not adapt to the now free-market competition. This led to massive unemployment {{in the city and}} emigration waves in 90s. Since 2000, Ruse has been continually regaining its former leading status. The urban economics were positively influenced by the 2007's accession of Bulgaria and Romania in the European Union, which allowed deeper <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The flow of investments through EU funds restarted long suspended projects which were finally completed.|$|E

[...] Consequently, the French authorities began to change their stance on the refugees, increasing <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation</b> with their Spanish counterparts. This involved deporting ETA members to various other countries and putting greater restrictions on those who remained.|$|E

40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} practice, methods, and regulation of <b>cross-border</b> police <b>cooperation</b> between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Despite {{legal and political}} divisions, police cooperation has survived and flourished in recent years especially among police officers on the ground. By comparison, the development of transparent regulatory and accountability structures and processes has been disappointing. While there have been domestic initiatives at the intergovernmental and legislative levels, these have tended to emphasize the centrality of direct engagement between the police chiefs and senior civil servants {{at the expense of}} formal transparent procedures. EU instruments have been marginalized as the police forces and their administrations prefer informal networks and force-to-force agreements which, it is argued, shield <b>cross-border</b> police <b>cooperation</b> from standards of transparency, oversight, and accountability which are essential to its legitimacy. They also highlight the limitations of the current EU legislative approach to <b>cross-border</b> police <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R

In this paper, the authors take issue with the myth that transnational <b>cross-border</b> infrastructure <b>cooperation</b> {{is the result of}} supra-national decision-making at the EU level. Another myth this paper addresses is that the management of trans- national and cross-border infrastructure is primarily supra-national.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{cross-border}} crimes rise, the EU {{is working}} on the development of international judicial cooperation between Member States. Increase of illegal immigration, trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings, and the advent of terrorism, made necessary a stronger judicial collaboration between States. Particular attention is paid on judicial collaboration between Western Balkans and the EU. CARDS program is a suitable evidence of it. Judicial cooperation includes mutual recognition of judicial decisions, cooperation in investigations, approximation of penal legislation of involved states, including the penalties. During the investigations, prior to an international request for warrant of arrest, an exchange of information on criminal offences and administrative infringements takes place between magistrates belonging to different countries.; this create new need for judicial cooperation environment supporting a <b>cross-border</b> judicial <b>cooperation</b> between EU and Countries of enlarging Europe. 1.

An efficient <b>cross-border</b> judicial <b>cooperation</b> is a key success factor for fighting against the globalisation trend of criminal and terrorist organisations.

For analysis and comparison, two adjoining cadastral areas (one in each state) České Velenice and Gmünd were selected.
