40|$|It {{is crucial}} for proper {{insulation}} design of <b>cast</b> <b>resin</b> <b>transformer</b> to consider voids and delamination which might exist in cast molding process and/or under long-term operation because of several surface boundaries between resin and conductor. Should such defects in the insulation system exist, {{it would lead to}} reduction {{of the life of the}} apparatus. In this report, we investigate the relation between the void size and apparent charge of partial discharge (PD) occurring in a model simulating the insulation system of <b>cast</b> <b>resin</b> <b>transformer.</b> It is also important to determine necessary PD detection sensitivity of PD test in a factory as well as in a field. In addition, we investigate X-ray irradiation induced discharge of spherical void in epoxy resin. Physical consideration of the effect of X-ray irradiation on void discharges in epoxy resin was also made. Time lag of void discharges in epoxy resin was also made with attenuation of X-ray irradiation dose considered. 2011 Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC), 5 - 8 June 2011, Annapolis, M...|$|E
40|$|This paper calculates {{the core}} and copper losses as heating sources of a 24 MVA <b>cast</b> <b>resin</b> <b>transformer,</b> and {{analyzes}} the thermal distribution of the transformer to find out its hot-spot area by FEM program. Since the winding of the transformer is composed with many series and parallel circuits, the analyzing model of the winding is simplified and modelled by axi-symmetric domain. As the results, the maximum temperature is estimated by 137 ℃ in {{the upper part of}} the low-voltage winding. The maximum temperature has discrepancy of approximately 10 ℃, which is able to be considered as an acceptable error range in the design stage of power transformers. For the overall pattern of the temperature distribution is almost same as test results, the analyzing method can be...|$|E

40|$|Coupling of {{carrier wave}} {{frequencies}} up to 95 kHz (within the European CENELEC A-band) for online diagnostic data transfer in medium voltage cables is studied. Inductive and capacitive signal coupling is considered {{not only on}} basis of technical performance, but also on basis of practical aspects. The effectiveness of coupling schemes depends on the impedances of substation equipment at the cable terminals. The frequency response of a 10 -kV, 400 -kVA three-phase <b>cast</b> <b>resin</b> distribution <b>transformer</b> is investigated. In the frequency range of interest, the behavior is well described by a capacitance of typically 1 nF. The signal transfer over a 4 -km paper cable, terminated by various load impedances to mimic real equipment is studied. From the results it is concluded that for inductive coupling performance within the CENELEC A-band may be sufficient, except for substations {{at the end of}} a grid. Transferring signals containing frequencies up to several megahertz, which is already required for synchronization of partial discharge detection and location equipment, is feasible under all conditions. Measurements on life substations indicate that up to these frequencies substation components can still be accurately modeled as lumped circuit impedances...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, The cast resin transformer's {{vibration}} {{is measured}} using noncontact raser vibrometer(LV 110 D). The vibration characteristics of transformer windings and core are analyzed for relation between vibration magnitude and cause. Using the analysis results, {{the technique is}} presented to diagnose <b>cast</b> <b>resin</b> <b>transformer.</b> which is able to diagnose transformer ' deformation in winding and core geometry. The magnetostriction and electromagnetic force act on the core and windings, causing them to vibrate. The vibration from windings and core penetrates into transformer cast resin and reaches the outside walls. The fundamental frequency of the core and windings vibration signal is twice that of the power frequency(120 ㎐).

40|$|In {{the paper}} a {{comparison}} among different analytical integral models to the simulation {{of the outer}} magnetic field generated by power transformer is presented. The proposed models are adopted for <b>cast</b> <b>resin</b> <b>transformer</b> where {{the contribution of the}} winding become significant compared to the contribution of the low voltage (LV) terminals and connection; in the case of oil transformer the metallic tank shield the field produced by the windings. An analytical integral approach is useful in order to insert the proposed model in a simulation environment that discretize only the sources by the Biot-Savart law. The two proposed models are based on the main assumption to neglect the presence of the magnetic core and consider the contributions of the two windings, primary and secondary, supplied with the same amperturns but with opposite directions. The models differ from the formula adopted in the calculation of the magnetic field generated by the coils that compose the windings of the transformer. A first model is described by an easy closed formula based on the hypothesis that the field point is far from the source and the distance is much greater than the coil dimensions; this model is less accurate close to the transformer. A second model integrate the magnetic field generated by two solid solenoids that represent the primary and secondary winding without introducing any hypothesis. The integration process requires the integration of first and second kind Bessel function. Such model can provide the magnetic field also really “near” the transformer windings. In the paper a full comparison among the models and with numerical simulation provided by FEM code is provided. Moreover a comparison with experimental results on a 630 kVA put in evidence the validity of the proposed analytical approach...|$|E
40|$|An {{industry}} {{is the major}} commercial energy consuming sector in India, where electrical energy {{is the most common}} and widely used type of energy.

40|$|The present {{review article}} {{represents}} a comprehensive study on polymer micro/nanocomposites {{that are used}} in high-voltage applications. Particular focus is on the structure-property relationship of composite materials used in power engineering, by exploiting fundamental theory as well as numerical/analytical models and the influence of material design on electrical, mechanical and thermal properties. In addition to describing the scientific development of micro/nanocomposites electrical features desired in power engineering, the study is mainly focused on the electrical properties of insulating materials, particularly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) and epoxy resins, unfilled and filled with different types of filler. Polymer micro/nanocomposites based on XLPE and epoxy resins are usually used as insulating systems for high-voltage applications, such as: cables, generators, motors, <b>cast</b> <b>resin</b> dry-type <b>transformers,</b> etc. Furthermore, this paper includes ample discussions regarding the advantages and disadvantages resulting in the electrical, mechanical and thermal properties by the addition of micro- and nanofillers into the base polymer. The study goals are to determine the impact of filler size, type and distribution of the particles into the polymer matrix on the electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of the polymer micro/nanocomposites compared to the neat polymer and traditionally materials used as insulation systems in high-voltage engineering. Properties such as electrical conductivity, relative permittivity, dielectric losses, partial discharges, erosion resistance, space charge behavior, electric breakdown, tracking and electrical tree resistance, thermal conductivity, tensile strength and modulus, elongation at break of micro- and nanocomposites based on epoxy resin and XLPE are analyzed. Finally, it was concluded that the use of polymer micro/nanocomposites in electrical engineering is very promising and further research work must be accomplished in order to diversify the polymer composites matrices and to improve their properties...|$|R
