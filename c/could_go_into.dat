The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E

In the long-term, the SwissRapide Express was to connect the major cities north of the Alps between Geneva and St. Gallen, including Lucerne and Basel.

Cleveland Pools were built around 1815 close to the River Avon, now the oldest surviving public outdoor lido in England, and plans have been submitted for its restoration.|$|E
500|$|The spec {{script was}} chosen as the crew {{believed}} it <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> production quickly. After purchasing it, the production of this episode began a week later. Groener guest starred as Elbrun, the first male Betazoid seen on the show. Michael Cavanaugh appeared as Captain Robert DeSoto, a character that was mentioned in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] and later in the franchise. The design of Gomtuu was based on an element from The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, while the chair creation special effect was made using reverse motion. [...] "Tin Man" [...] received Nielsen ratings of 10.2 percent. Critical reception has been mixed; while it has been listed in the top 70 of the best episodes of the franchise, other reviewers have called the plot predicable and trite.|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} that Congress would have to approve the NPVIC before it <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> effect. Article I, Section 10 of the US Constitution states that: [...] "No State shall, without the Consent of Congress ... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power." [...] However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in Virginia v. Tennessee, , and in several more recent cases, that such consent is not necessary except where a compact encroaches on federal supremacy. Every Vote Equal argues that the compact could never encroach upon federal power since the Constitution explicitly gives the power of casting electoral votes to the states, not the federal government. Derek Muller argues that the NPVIC would nonetheless affect the federal system {{in such a way}} that it would require Congressional approval, while Ian Drake argues that Congress is actually prohibited under the Constitution from granting approval to the NPVIC. NPVIC supporters dispute this conclusion and state they plan to seek congressional approval if the compact is approved by a sufficient number of states.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] finished 32nd in {{ratings for the}} week of September 27– October 4, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 11.8, equivalent to approximately 11.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the seventh best in the show's history. Entertainment Weeklys Dalton Ross lauded it as [...] "the show's best ever musical episode", while Dave Kehr of The New York Times called it a [...] "brilliant ... parody of Broadway musicals that should be required viewing for every Tony viewer." [...] In a list of his favorite episodes, Kevin Williamson of Canadian Online Explorer added, [...] "As pitch-perfect eviscerations of community theatre go, this tops Waiting for Guffman." [...] Series creator Matt Groening has listed {{it as one of}} his own favorites, calling the subplot [...] "Maggie's finest moment", and future Simpsons guest star Trey Anastasio said the episode [...] "may have been the best TV show ever". Executive producer James L. Brooks also listed it as one of his favorites, saying it [...] "showed we <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> areas no one thought we could go into". Following the episode, the Ayn Rand Society called Groening to say they were amazed at the references to Rand. They also asked him if the show was making fun of them.|$|E
500|$|The {{events that}} {{transpire}} between the fourth to sixth films are effectively ignored in 1998’s [...] This film opens {{twenty years after}} {{the events of the}} second film. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has faked her own death so that she <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> hiding from her brother Michael. Now working as the head mistress of a private school under the name Keri Tate, Laurie continues to live in fear of her brother’s return. Her own son, John (Josh Hartnett), attends school where she teaches. Laurie’s fear becomes reality when Michael (Chris Durand) shows up at the school and begins killing John’s friends and eventually he and Laurie come face-to-face. Laurie manages to get John and his girlfriend (Michelle Williams) to safety, but decides to return to the school to face Michael once and for all. Laurie succeeds in stopping Michael, but not satisfied until she knows that he is truly dead, Laurie steals his body and decapitates Michael. [...] (2002) picks up three years after H20, and reveals that Michael swapped clothes with a paramedic—crushing the paramedic’s larynx so that he could not talk—and that was who Laurie killed. Unable to deal with killing an innocent man, and the fact that Michael was still out there, Laurie is committed to a mental institution. Michael (Brad Loree) shows up at the institution, but Laurie captures him. Her fear of making the same mistake twice gets the better of her, and when she attempts to remove Michael’s mask he surprises and kills her. Michael travels back to his family home in Haddonfield, but finds a group of college students filming an Internet reality show. Michael proceeds to kill everyone, until he is finally electrocuted by the only surviving student, Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), and the show’s creator Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes).|$|E
