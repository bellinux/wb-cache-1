[...] The awarding institution defines which degrees meet this description themselves. The National Science Foundation defines a research doctorate as [...] "a doctoral degree that (1) requires completion of an original intellectual contribution {{in the form of}} a dissertation or an equivalent culminating project (e.g., musical composition) and (2) is not primarily intended as a degree for the practice of a profession."

The analysis is carried out based on non-dimensional parameters (i. e., discharge, head, efficiency, runner speed and mechanical power) in order to be possible comparisons. Mathematical models based on the physical principles, associated to the development of volumetric and rotordynamic machines, are developed. New turbines are suggested, which are based on similar theory among turbo machines based on applications in hydraulic systems with guarantee discharge and available head. The hydrodynamic fluid mechanical analysis requires the use of complex advanced models (CFD) which apply the equations of Navier-Stokes by using mathematical models of conservation laws, {{for the study of the}} turbulent flow behaviour. To determine the correlation between the flow velocity and pressure fields, the k-? model, is used in this research. Many turbines are evaluated (i. e., positive displacement (PD), pump as turbine (PAT), propeller with volute at inlet, four and five blades tubular propellers) and sensitivity analyses, to the best configurations, as well as comparisons between performance curves and experimental tests.

The first paper is {{a review of the}} literature, which examines the extent to which specific cognitive impairments should be taken into account when planning memory rehabilitation interventions based on teaching strategies such as cueing and errorless learning. The second paper is an empirical study which compares the effectiveness of implicit and explicit teaching instructions when using the method of vanishing cues to facilitate learning in people with memory impairment arising from acquired brain injuries. Volume II comprises five clinical practice reports presenting work undertaken in the specialties of mental health (adult and older adult), learning disabilities and neurorehabilitation. The first presents an initial assessment of a 71 year old woman with generalised anxiety alongside formulations of her difficulties from cognitive-behavioural and psychodynamic perspectives. The second report contains a single case experimental design {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a cognitive rehabilitation intervention in an 81 year old man with Alzheimer’s disease.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a didactic use of {{simulation}} software in mathematics classes. The goal is to present the ways in which pupils can gain extensive experience, study different influences on systems and, most important connect real life situations with mathematics. What makes this possible is a computer simulation which enables them to recognize functional links and observe different processes as well as complex phenomena. At the beginning of the theoretical part the concept of simulation is presented. It includes representations of mathematical concepts in mathematics classes and an explanation of the concepts of model and modelling describing their role in both, computer simulation and teaching process. The theoretical part continues with an explanation of the computer simulation process, the use of simulation in class and the descriptions of software that were and still are used in teaching mathematics. The theoretical part is concluded by presenting simulation software intended for teaching, Gizmo and SimCalcMathWorld, as well as by describing their use on practical examples. The empirical part of the thesis <b>comprises</b> <b>a</b> <b>research</b> on the effectiveness of the use of the SimCalcMathWorld computer program. Research questions consider students’ motivation for work with the SimCalcMathWorld program and the adequacy of this program for classroom use. In the research two students from grades 8 and 9 studied the topic of direct proportion using the simulation program. After the explanation, the pupils were asked to take a test that was used as an additional instrument; the main research instrument, however, was participant observation. The gathered data was examined by qualitative data analysis in order find out the capabilities and effectiveness of the program as a teaching tool as well as to gain as much information as possible about teaching methods that use the SimCalcMathWorld simulation software. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{contribute}} to the growing body of knowledge concerning the adult basic literacy education in the Nordic countries and broaden research on literacy from its traditional focus on verbal texts to include images and visual texts. The thesis <b>comprises</b> <b>a</b> <b>research</b> survey concerning adult literacy and two empirical, exploratory studies focusing on the use of visual texts in the basic Swedish language programme for adult immigrants, Svenskundervisning för invandrare (sfi). The first study presents international and Nordic research on literacy with a focus on current sociocultural, and critical perspectives. Together with the three concepts of mutual respect, meaningfulness and participation, an ‘expansive’ model for adult literacy instruction is also presented. The second study deals with the teachers´ views on appropriate visual materials for second language and literacy teaching. The results show an extensive but diversified usage of visual material but also that literacy teachers pay very close attention to participants´ sociocultural background in their image selection but tend to underestimate their cognitive ability. From a critical perspective the teachers´ statements can be regarded as part of a discursive practice in which they unintentionally contribute to a discourse construction of an identity of deficiency of the learners. The third study examines and compares, how adult second language learners interact with and understand a number of Swedish election posters. The analyses identify processes and variations in the learners´ interaction. The results show that the reconstructions of the visual texts are influenced by the participants´ linguistic, educational and cultural ‘repertoires’, as well as the posters´ graphic, visual and textual design. A certain level of linguistic proficiency as well as formal schooling and knowledge of the current discourse seem to be indispensable for making the intended interpretations...|$|E

After a general review of the empirical literature, more sustained attention is paid to specific aspects of female sex work in three contexts or figurations, the cities of London, Bangkok and Kolkarta. It is argued that norms of shame and blame and the labelling process with which they are bound up always arise within a structure nexus.
