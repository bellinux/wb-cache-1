A good correlation (r = 0. 73) was found between relative 5 -HT fluorescence in enterochromaffin cells and net fluid transport across the intestinal epithelium. Thus, a diminished 5 -HT content was associated with a decreased rate of fluid absorption or an increased rate of secretion. A hypothesis is presented for explaining the possible role of the enterochromaffin cells in the pathophysiology of cholera secretion...|$|E
