25|$|A {{modeling}} {{system based on}} {{a better understanding of}} the termination targeting of lightning, called the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horváth. It has become the standard by which traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of a lightning bolt jumps toward the ground, it steps toward the grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the <b>critical</b> <b>distance</b> and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this <b>critical</b> <b>distance.</b> It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46m near the ground.|$|E

40|$|At present, {{because of}} {{observational}} selection effects, {{we know of}} no exoplanetary systems with any planetary masses close {{to that of the}} Earth. We have therefore used computer models to see whether such planets could be dynamically stable {{in the presence of the}} more massive planets known to be present, and in particular whether planets with roughly an Earth mass could remain confined to the classical habitable zone (HZ) for long enough for life to have emerged. Measured stellar properties have been used to determine for each system the present location of the HZ. We have also determined the <b>critical</b> <b>distances</b> from the orbit of each giant planet within which an Earth-mass planet would suffer large orbital changes. We then evaluated the present habitability of each and every exoplanetary system by examining the penetration of these <b>critical</b> <b>distances</b> into the HZ. The <b>critical</b> <b>distances</b> can be obtained by extensive computer modelling of an exoplanetary system. This is far too time consuming to apply to all of the 150 or so systems already known, and to keep up with the latest discoveries. Therefore, in earlier work we studied a few systems in great detail, and developed a speedier means of obtaining the <b>critical</b> <b>distances.</b> We summarize this comparatively quick method here. We can then evaluate comparatively quickly the present habitability of each exoplanetary system by examining the penetration of the <b>critical</b> <b>distance(s)</b> into the HZ.

However, the <b>critical</b> <b>distances</b> between the terms were not obtained explicitly. Since a straight approach for computing them through tabulations cannot be used for large values of the modulus, an efficient method has been developed and is described in the present note.

25|$|An object {{outside the}} <b>critical</b> <b>distance</b> is {{unlikely}} to be struck by the leader if there is a solidly grounded object within the <b>critical</b> <b>distance.</b> Locations that are considered safe from lightning can be determined by imagining a leader's potential paths as a sphere that travels from the cloud to the ground. For lightning protection, it suffices to consider all possible spheres as they touch potential strike points. To determine strike points, consider a sphere rolling over the terrain. At each point, a potential leader position is simulated. Lightning is most likely to strike where the sphere touches the ground. Points that the sphere cannot roll across and touch are safest from lightning. Lightning protectors should be placed where they will prevent the sphere from touching a structure. A weak point in most lightning diversion systems is in transporting the captured discharge from the lightning rod to the ground, though. Lightning rods are typically installed around the perimeter of flat roofs, or along the peaks of sloped roofs at intervals of 6.1 m or 7.6 m, depending on the height of the rod. When a flat roof has dimensions greater than 15m by 15m, additional air terminals will be installed {{in the middle of the}} roof at intervals of 15m or less in a rectangular grid pattern.|$|E

In this study the spatial structure on the saliency map was investigated. It is proposed that the saliency map is structured into processing units whose size is increasing with retinal eccentricity. In two experiments the distance between a target in the stimulus and an irrelevant structure in the mask was varied systematically. Our findings had two main points. Firstly, in texture segmentation tasks the saliency signals from two texture irregularities interfere, when these irregularities appear within a <b>critical</b> spatial <b>distance.</b> Second, the <b>critical</b> <b>distances</b> increase with target eccentricity.

25|$|There were prisoners who, {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the war, began writing down the events they witnessed, usually in diary form. Soldiers could write on the front, but in the camps they were forbidden not only to write but even to possess paper. All writings found during searches were systematically confiscated and their authors punished. Thus attempts began to hide the notes from the enemy, which gave rise to some ingenious discoveries on the prisoners’ part. Diaries were most often used, first of all, because they were the simplest format. Thus the journal acquired historic value because the events recorded there had a vivid immediacy to them.

25|$|The fission of a {{heavy nucleus}} {{requires}} a total input energy of about 7 to 8 million electron volts (MeV) to initially overcome the nuclear force which holds the nucleus into a spherical or nearly spherical shape, and from there, deform it into a two-lobed ("peanut") shape in which the lobes are {{able to continue to}} separate from each other, pushed by their mutual positive charge, in the most common process of binary fission (two positively charged fission products + neutrons). Once the nuclear lobes have been pushed to a <b>critical</b> <b>distance,</b> beyond which the short range strong force can no longer hold them together, the process of their separation proceeds from the energy of the (longer range) electromagnetic repulsion between the fragments. The result is two fission fragments moving away from each other, at high energy.|$|E
25|$|New {{assessments}} of Sămănătorism and traditionalism followed the 1947–1948 {{imposition of a}} Romanian communist regime. During its first stage, when they created a local socialist realist current, the new cultural authorities imposed selective censorship on Romania's literary trends. There were, however, several meeting points with the aesthetics and policies promoted by Sămănătorul in matters {{of social and cultural}} discourse. The partial liberalization allowed by the Nicolae Ceaușescu in the late 1960s made room for a new aesthetic reaction to both communist guidelines and neo-Sămănătorism, leading from the recovery of interwar modernism and Western influences to the birth of local postmodern literature and the Optzeciști generation. During the following decades, as Ceaușescu's July Theses confirmed national communism and opened the path of isolationism, traditionalist and nationalist currents came to be officially reconsidered as ideological precedents. However, the period also saw the publishing of Z. Ornea's influential overview of Sămănătorist ideology, first printed in 1970. It took <b>critical</b> <b>distance</b> from the trend, and, literary historian Nicolae Manolescu suggests, thus stood against the renewed official endorsement for the Sămănătorist program. According to Ghemeș, the work also played an essential part in stimulating other such assessments on the current to be published in later decades, including Georgeta Ene's 1984 study of Iorga's neo-Sămănătorist periodicals.|$|E

The stellar properties in both pieces of work have been used to determine the present location of the classical habitable zone (HZ). To establish habitability, we estimate the <b>critical</b> <b>distances</b> from the giant planet(s) within which an Earth-mass planet would suffer large orbital changes.

40|$|AbstractThe Theory of <b>Critical</b> <b>Distances</b> postulates that, in cracked {{materials}} {{subjected to}} static loading, breakage takes place when a distance dependent effective stress exceeds the material tensile strength. Such an effective stress {{is equal to}} the stress calculated either at a certain distance from the notch tip (Point Method), averaged over a line (Line Method), over an area (Area Method) or, finally, averaged in a finite volume (Volume Method). The necessary characteristic length is a material property which can directly be determined by combining the material ultimate tensile strength with the plane strain fracture toughness. In the present investigation, by re-analysing a large number of experimental results taken from the literature, it is shown that the Theory of <b>Critical</b> <b>Distances</b> is successful in modelling the transition from the short- to the long-crack regime in geological materials subjected to Mode I static loading...|$|R

Iso-feature processing on feature {{maps and}} conspicuity maps precedes cross-dimensional signal processing on the master map, {{where the most}} salient location of the visual field is selected. This texture segmentation study focuses on a possible spatial structure on the master map. In four experiments the spatial distance between a texture irregularity in the stimulus (‘target’) and a cross-dimensional task irrelevant texture irregularity in the backward mask (‘patch’) was varied. The {{results show that the}} target-patch distance modulates target detection, and that this modulation is limited to <b>critical</b> <b>distances</b> around the target. We conclude that the signals from different feature dimensions compete on a spatial master map. There is first evidence that the <b>critical</b> <b>distances</b> increase with target eccentricity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{accuracy}} of gradient elasticity in estimating high-cycle fatigue strength of notched components subjected to both uniaxial and multiaxial fatigue loading. A novel design methodology is formulated by combining Ru and Aifantis’ gradient elasticity with the Theory of <b>Critical</b> <b>Distances</b> and the Modified Wöhler Curve Method. The keyfeature of this innovative design methodology is that, via the Theory of <b>Critical</b> <b>Distances,</b> gradient elasticity’s length scale parameter is directly estimated from conventional material fatigue properties (i. e., the plain fatigue limit and the threshold value of the stress intensity factor). From a stress analysis point of view, the proposed approach directly post-processes the gradient-enriched stress states determined, at the hot-spots, {{on the surface of}} the component under investigation (and independently of the sharpness of the stress concentrator being assessed). The accuracy and reliability of this design method was checked by using a large number of experimental results taken from the literature and generated by testing notched metallic samples under uniaxial as well as under multiaxial fatigue loading. This comprehensive validation exercise demonstrates that the systematic usage of this transformative design approach leads to the same level of accuracy as the one which is obtained by applying the classic Theory of <b>Critical</b> <b>Distances.</b> This result is certainly remarkable since the proposed approach is not only very efficient from a computational point of view, but it also allows high-cycle fatigue damage to be assessed by directly postprocessing gradient-enriched stress states determined {{on the surface of the}} component being assessed...|$|R
