His other '09 releases are the Nitboy books - Bug Out and Lift Off. His first Young Adult novel, It's Yr Life, co-written by former Home and Away actress and author Tempany Deckert, was released in June 2009. Tristan has also written eight short novels in Macmillan's Kids Inc. series, about kids setting up their own businesses and ventures.|$|E
50|$|This {{week the}} ten {{aspiring}} models get {{a visit from}} Stefano Fadda, a <b>coolhunter.</b> He explains that, for this weeks reward challenge, they must improvise themselves as photographers to do coolhunting in the centre of Milan, taking pictures of people who may anticipate certain fashion trends. Martina is exempt from the challenge, having injured her foot by slipping on the staircase when walking with wet feet. So the nine girls are split into groups of three and sent downtown to take snapshots. Diletta, Elena and Giorgia are declared winners and can spend an evening out in one of Milans coolest lounge bars.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coolhunters</b> {{resemble}} the intuitive fashion magazine {{editors of the}} 1960s such as Nancy White (Harper's Bazaar 1958-1971). <b>Coolhunters</b> operate mostly {{in the world of}} street fashion and design, but their work also blurs into that of futurists such as Faith Popcorn.|$|R
50|$|Focus groups, though {{quite obvious}} in their {{attempts}} at gathering information, are very popular among <b>coolhunters</b> as they provide direct insight into the thoughts and feelings of their target demographic. <b>Coolhunters</b> will typically gather a group of randomly selected individuals from their target demographic. While one or more market researchers interact with the group, they are often being monitored and recorded by a non-visible group, because not only do <b>coolhunters</b> {{want to hear what}} their subjects have to say, they also want to observe their simple mannerisms.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of methods for {{conducting}} market research online. Popular examples are online surveys where upon completion, the participant will usually receive a prize or monetary compensation. Other times <b>coolhunters</b> will enter chatrooms and webgroups posing as an individual within the target demographic and gather information.|$|R

Some vast and deeply personal insult to any ordinary notion of interiority.An experience outside of culture. —Pattern Recognition, 15. [...] "Singularity", page 137 Aged 32 during the events of the Pattern Recognition, Cayce lives in New York City. Though named by her parents after Edgar Cayce, she pronounces her given name [...] "Case". She is a freelance marketing consultant, a <b>coolhunter</b> with an unusual intuitive sensitivity for branding, manifested primarily in her physical aversion to particular logos and corporate mascots. A notable exception to her ability to immediately discern semiotic content in imagery is the succession of images of the September 11 attacks in 2001, for her [...] "an experience outside culture". The attacks had added significance to Cayce's backstory in that they encompassed the disappearance of her father, Win, which in turn impelled her mother, Cynthia, to exploring electronic voice phenomena as her own means of divining patterns in the background static. Cayce is left feeling [...] "ungrieved" [...] for her father until she reviews footage and records of that day tracking his movements until he vanishes.|$|E
5000|$|In his conclusion, Konstantinou {{discusses}} the Occupy movement. Examining a {{controversy in the}} movement in which a group attempting to sell a print of an iconic image related to the movement, he notes, [...] "though seemingly minor, this controversy showcases the political paradoxes of Occupy, illuminating how difficult {{it can be to}} differentiate 'speaking with' from 'speaking for' within the context of Occupy's style of anarchist politics" [...] and contends [...] "the characterological question Occupy raised was nothing less than what form our collective subjectivity should take." [...] He also combats the [...] "condemnations of the contemporary hipster," [...] writing that the view taken by critics in which the mid-century hipster and other iconoclast figures were entirely authentic and oppositional is [...] "an idealized past...stories about the dire need to move beyond contemporary hipster irony, toward some new form of oppositional political sincerity, are written in a narrative genre that I will call the postironic Bildungsroman" [...] Konstantinou concludes the book by arguing that irony is [...] "always political," [...] but [...] "does not have a predetermined fate or political content": [...] "As my discussions of the hipster and the punk have tried to show, irony did not, even at its most avowedly countercultural forms, necessarily aid projects of human liberation. Nor, as my discussions of the believer and the <b>coolhunter</b> sought to demonstrate, will we be able to predict in advance the future political significance of postirony." [...] Instead, he offers, [...] "we must, therefore, cultivate within ourselves an ironic understanding of our own countercultural inheritance while simultaneously developing a nonironic commitment to learning how to build enduring institutions that have the capacity not only to rouse spirits but also to dismantle the power of those whose strength partly depends on our cynicism" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Coolhunters</b> {{will often}} seek out {{individuals}} from within their target demographic who {{are regarded as}} leaders or trendsetters.

5000|$|Coolhunting is {{more than}} simple market {{research}} {{because of the nature}} of the subjects.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the Bourdieusian notion of {{cultural}} intermediaries and applies it to two open-ended professions {{of the field of}} fashion: the <b>coolhunters</b> and the fashion bloggers. Coolhunting is described as an evolution of the fashion forecasting model invented by the fashion industry in the late Sixties, aiming at collecting signals of socio-cultural trends and at finding new consumption paradigms, while blogging is presented as a subfield of the field of fashion media where young newcomers are gaining increasing popularity by challenging the rules of the printed media communication. The distinctive aspects that make bloggers and <b>coolhunters</b> as being cultural intermediaries are discussed by referring especially to the composition of their cultural capital (characterized by self-didacticism), the open-endedness of these jobs, and their role as producers of symbolic forms. Their function of junction points between production and consumption, and between mainstream and margins, is also analyzed. In conclusion, I argue that cultural intermediation is a positioning strategy in the neoliberal labor market, and not a mere adaptation to avoid the loss of social standing, and that conflict is a key concept to understand the work of the cultural intermediaries and their disruptive effect on the fields they belong to...|$|R
5000|$|The {{second half}} of Cool Characters {{analyzes}} postirony, looking at [...] "the believer," [...] the [...] "coolhunter," [...] {{and members of the}} Occupy Wall Street movement. In the chapter [...] "How to Be a Believer," [...] Konstantinou discusses David Foster Wallace and Dave Eggers' attempts to construct a feasible postironic movement. He notes that [...] "for Wallace, postironic belief underwrites the possibility of genuine communication" [...] He contends that Wallace's attempts to construct an ethos centered around belief differs from one tied to religion like seen in the series Left Behind, as [...] "Wallace wants to invent a new form of secular belief, a religious vocabulary (God, prayer) that is emptied out of any specific content and is engineered to confront the possibly insuperable condition of postmodernity" [...] Konstantinou argues that like Wallace, Eggers [...] "means to make his readers into believers. Eggers has asked his readers to believe in him, in the truthfulness of his memoir, the sincerity of his various enterprises" [...] Konstantinou concludes that while [...] "Wallace's brand of postirony, for all its power, was more concerned with overthrowing the rule of a particular type of person, the ironist, than with changing the institutional relations that facilitated the rise to this type....Because he did not focus on transforming postmodern institutions, Wallace may have been doomed to fail to achieve his aims in strictly literal terms" [...] Eggers [...] "by contrast, seems to have understood the importance of constructing alternative institutions" [...] He lauds Eggers (and the institutions he has created, such as McSweeney's) for [...] "creating a relatively optimistic ethos of belief that mixes a quirky aesthetic sensibility with an urge toward philanthropy and the active construction of alternative institutional structures" [...] In his next chapter, Konstantinou examines the [...] "coolhunter," [...] a figure that seeks out [...] "cool" [...] cultural items for use by corporations and other capitalist institutions. He discusses the use of this figure in fiction, such as in Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad, where Egan envisions [...] "a near future in which the advanced understanding and manipulation of the cool leads to the rise of a postironic youth culture" [...] He contends that [...] "after all, Egan seems to show, new forms of authentic experience can still emerge unexpectedly even in a world whose social life is fully enclosed within corporate platforms" [...] Konstantinou concludes the chapter by asserting that [...] "the lesson the <b>coolhunter</b> teachers is that such sensitivity requires, at a minimum, both a critically distant and aesthetically invested sense of the market and the world" ...|$|E

In 2005 he contributed to the exhibition <b>Coolhunters</b> (ZKM Karlsruhe); in 2007 he co-edited the interdisciplinary essay collection Rebels Without a Cause (Peter Lang Publishing Group), to encourage a revaluation of the period.

40|$|What {{happens when}} economies 'heat up'? This book {{looks at the}} 1990 s, years of intense {{economic}} experimentation, when buzz words such as 'network society', 'the experience economy', 'creative cities' and 'glocalization' were everywhere. A fascinating perspective on 'The New Economy' emerges as the authors explore the worlds of <b>coolhunters,</b> biotech brokers, career coaches, software entrepreneurs and event managers and tackle such questions as: How is magic used {{in the quest for}} newness and change? What happens when cultural techniques such as branding and styling colonize new arenas? And, what turns out to be just a flash-in-the-pan and what has a lasting impact? This book is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand how economies operate in periods of rapid transformation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 In this thesis, I {{argue that}} the {{cooptation}} and commodification of young peoples’ creative expressions of individuality through the practice of “coolhunting” causes alienation within said young people and is, therefore, unethical. I support this claim by using Marxist theory of the Frankfort Institute, viz., Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno’s critique of enlightenment, to show how society has become sterilized by the “sameness” formula of “the culture industry. ” Thereafter, I explain how {{a small number of}} young people known as “trendsetters” penetrate the sameness boundary by originating genuinely creative expressions of individuality, and I show how <b>coolhunters</b> extract, co-opt, and commodify those expressions. I then discuss the ramifications of this process for both individuals and broader society, and I propose a course of action that counteracts these effects by reinvigorating the human creative imagination...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the identities}} of brands and {{consumers}} have been extensively explored, less is understood about the subjectivity of marketers themselves. In the ambiguous and dynamic exchange process of marketing, the articulation of identities is fundamental to demarcate the activities and actions that take place between market actors. In recent times, growing importance {{has been placed on}} a different breed of marketer in these exchanges - the cultural intermediary. For these marketing practitioners, knowledge about the interplay between culture and economy generates the cultural capital that legitimises their expertise and value. Yet, this simultaneously gives rise to the difficult navigation and accomplishment of boundaries between their work and pleasure. Through a case study of two coolhunting agencies, this paper examines how marketers discursively perform boundary work in the construction of their identities. The findings show that, for <b>coolhunters,</b> a tension exists in drawing on discourses of renegadism and professionalism to construct their identities, resulting in their engagement in chameleon-like identity work. The research proposes that the tensions pervading the construction of boundaries and identities for marketers can be usefully understood through a paradox lens, and offers the metaphor of the nomad as a theoretical representation of interwoven identity conflicts for marketers.

40|$|The {{transition}} from haute couture to prêt-à-porter in the 60 ’s has {{created in the}} fashion industry a great revolution both {{on the sides of}} production and consumption. One of the most relevant aspects in this process is the emergent demand of predicting future trends, in order to acquire a higher level of competitiveness compared to rivals. It is the birth of a structured activity known as fashion forecasting, managed by bureaux de style and embodied in trendbooks. Nowadays, this activity {{is often referred to as}} coolhunting, a striking term that implies an idea of research as intuitive ‘hunt’ of incipient signals in fashion and in consumers’ lifestyles. The chapter discusses coolhunting, a developing professional activity, as an emblematic place of symbolic mechanisms that are crucial in order to explain not only the fashion system but also many cultural processes of production and consumption of material goods rich in immaterial contents. The aim suggests that coolhunting is historically rooted in fashion forecasting, but it is also characterised by a relevant set of novelties, above all the shifting of research from a monolithic interest in fashion fads to socio-cultural trends that involve the whole symbolic imagination of the customer. A second important point is the extension of the fashion forecasting model to many branches of cultural production, more and more involved in a trend-oriented logic. <b>Coolhunters</b> emerge also as ‘messengers of distinction,’ the matching point between the consumers’ need of distinction and the producers’ attempt of creating distinctive goods...|$|R
