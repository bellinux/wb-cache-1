5|$|The smalltail shark forms large aggregations {{segregated}} by sex, {{with the}} males generally found {{deeper than the}} females. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, including sea catfish, <b>croakers,</b> jacks, and grunts. Shrimp, crabs, and squid are secondary food sources, while adults are also capable of taking young sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon), hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and stingrays (Dasyatis). Opportunistic in habits, the dietary composition of this shark generally reflects what is most available in its environment; off northern Brazil, the most important prey species are the <b>croakers</b> Macrodon ancylodon and Stellifer naso. Juveniles consume {{a wider variety of}} prey than adults. In turn, the smalltail shark may potentially be preyed upon by larger sharks.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, <b>croakers,</b> surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, <b>croakers,</b> flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E

50|$|Larimichthys crocea, {{called the}} large yellow <b>croaker,</b> the yellow <b>croaker</b> or the croceine <b>croaker,</b> is {{a species of}} marine fish in the <b>croaker</b> family (Sciaenidae) native to the northwestern Pacific, {{generally}} in temperate waters such as the Taiwan Strait. It lives in coastal waters and estuaries, often in brackish water also, and is found on muddy-sandy bottoms. Males can reach 80 cm, but a common size is 60 cm.|$|R
5|$|A small, fast-swimming predator, the blacknose shark feeds {{primarily}} on small, bony fishes, including pinfish, <b>croakers,</b> porgies, anchovies, spiny boxfish, and porcupinefish, {{as well as}} on octopus and other cephalopods. When competing for bait, their speed allows them to snatch food from larger sharks such as the Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi). This species may form large schools that are sometimes associated with anchovies and mullet. Blacknose sharks demonstrate a high degree of philopatry: both juveniles and adults have been documented returning to the same local area year after year.|$|E
5|$|The bowmouth {{guitarfish}} is {{a strong}} swimmer that propels itself with its tail like a shark. It is more active at night and is not known to be territorial. This species feeds mainly on demersal bony fishes such as <b>croakers</b> and crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp; bivalves and cephalopods are also consumed. Its bands of flattened teeth allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. Curiously, two bowmouth guitarfishes examined in a 2011 stable isotope study {{were found to have}} fed on pelagic rather than demersal animals, in contrast to previous observations.|$|E
5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as <b>croakers,</b> flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E
40|$|Atlantic <b>croaker</b> Micropogonias {{undulatus}} is {{a commercially}} and ecologically important bottom-associated fish {{that occurs in}} marine and estuarine systems from Cape Cod, MA to Mexico. I documented the temporal and spatial variability in the diet of Atlantic <b>croaker</b> in Chesapeake Bay and found that in the summer fish, particularly bay anchovies Anchoa mitchilli, make up at least 20 % of the diet of <b>croaker</b> by weight. The use of a pelagic food source seems unusual for a bottom-associated fish such as <b>croaker,</b> but {{appears to be a}} crepuscular feeding habit that has not been previously detected. Thus, I investigated the bioenergetic consequences of secondary piscivory to the distribution of <b>croaker,</b> to the condition of individuals within the population and to the ecosystem. Generalized additive models revealed that the biomass of anchovy explained some of the variability in <b>croaker</b> occurrence and abundance in Chesapeake Bay. However, physical factors, specifically temperature, salinity, and seasonal dynamics were stronger determinants of <b>croaker</b> distribution than potential prey availability. To better understand the bioenergetic consequences of diet variability at the individual level, I tested the hypothesis that <b>croaker</b> feeding on anchovies would be in better condition than those feeding on polychaetes using a variety of condition measures that operate on multiple time scales, including RNA:DNA, Fulton's condition factor (K), relative weight (Wr), energy density, hepatosomatic index (HSI), and gonadosomatic index (GSI). Of these condition measures, several morphometric measures were significantly positively correlated {{with each other and with}} the percentage (by weight) of anchovy in <b>croaker</b> diets, suggesting that the type of prey eaten is important in improving the overall condition of individual <b>croaker.</b> To estimate the bioenergetic consequences of diet variability on growth and consumption in <b>croaker,</b> I developed and validated a bioenergetic model for Atlantic <b>croaker</b> in the laboratory. The application of this model suggested that <b>croaker</b> could be an important competitor with weakfish and striped bass for food resources during the spring and summer when population abundances of these three fishes are high in Chesapeake Bay. Even though anchovies made up a relatively small portion of <b>croaker</b> diet and only at certain times of the year, <b>croaker</b> consumed more anchovy at the population level than striped bass in all simulated years and nearly as much anchovy as weakfish. This indicates that weak trophic interactions between species are important in understanding ecosystem processes and should be considered in ecosystem-based management...|$|R

5|$|The diet of the smalltail shark {{consists}} {{mainly of}} bony fishes such as <b>croakers,</b> while crustaceans, cephalopods, and smaller {{sharks and rays}} may also be consumed. It is viviparous, meaning the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. Females bear litters of two to nine young on a biennial cycle, following an approximately 12-month gestation period. The smalltail shark is often caught as bycatch and {{may be used for}} meat, fins, liver oil, cartilage, and fishmeal. The impact of fishing on its population is largely unknown except off northern Brazil, where it seems to have declined significantly since the 1980s. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as Data Deficient overall and as Vulnerable in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, lizardfish, mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, <b>croakers,</b> jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as <b>croakers,</b> goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

25|$|The {{dominant}} shark species {{within the}} daggernose shark's range are the smalltail shark (Carcharhinus porosus) and the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo).

The snout bears a superficial similarity to the goblin shark (Mitsukurina owstoni), some Apristurus catsharks, and the long-nosed chimaeras, all found in the deep sea. With long jaws and numerous small teeth, the daggernose shark is well-suited for capturing the small schooling fishes that comprise most of its diet.

In this study, 31, 191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) evenly distributed across the large yellow <b>croaker</b> (Larimichthys crocea) genome were identified using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Among them, 10, 150 high-confidence SNPs were assigned to 24 consensus linkage groups (LGs). The total length of the genetic linkage map was 5451. 3 cM with an average distance of 0. 54 cM between loci.

During the day, the Pacific {{electric ray}} is an ambush predator: when a fish approaches its head, the ray [...] "jumps" [...] forward from its resting place and folds down its disc to envelop it, while delivering strong shocks. Once the fish is subdued, the ray repositions itself to swallow it head-first. The entire process takes about two minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Born in England, Hutchings {{immigrated to}} the U.S. in 1848, then went to California in 1849 during the Gold Rush.

[...] On July 5, 1855 James Hutchings set out on what {{would be one of}} the most {{historic}} trips to the region, leading the second tourist party into Yosemite. (The first tourist party, in 1854, was led by Robert C. Lamon, but no account of the trip is known to be written.) He then became one of the first settlers in Yosemite Valley. Hutchings published an illustrated magazine, Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine that told the world about Yosemite and the Sierra. It was said [...] "...upon the return of Hutchings' party, the descriptions staggered the skeptics and silenced the <b>croakers.</b> From this time forward can be considered the commencement of the visits of tourists." [...] He was a tireless promoter, of himself and Yosemite. After Yosemite Valley was dedicated as State Park in 1864, Hutchings, through his interpretation of existing preemption laws, believed he was entitled to 160 acres (647,000 m²) of land in the Valley. He sued, unsuccessfully, to have those acres deeded to himself. He did, however, get a generous payment from the state to help compensate for loss of land use. In 1875, he was banished from Yosemite Valley because of his constant challenging of the law prohibiting the construction of buildings on public lands.|$|E
