40|$|The {{occurrence}} of cancer during childhood {{represents one of}} the leading causes of death within the pediatric and adolescent age group.

40|$|Carcinomas {{arise in}} a complex {{microenvironment}} consisting of multiple distinct epithelial lineages surrounded {{by a variety of}} stromal cell types. Understanding <b>cancer</b> <b>etiologies</b> requires evaluating the relationship among cell types during disease initiation and through progression. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models facilitate the prospective examination of early oncogenic events, which is not possible in humans. Since most solid tumors harbor aberrations in the RB network, we developed an inducible GEM approach for the establishment and assessment of carcinoma initiation in a diverse range of epithelial tissues and subtypes upon inactivation of RB-mediated tumor suppression (RB-TS). The system allows independent assessment of epithelial subtypes that express either cytokeratins (K) 18 or 19. By Cre-dependent expression of a protein that dominantly inactivates RB and functionally redundant proteins p 107 and p 130, neoplasia could be initiated in either K 18 or K 19 expressing cells of numerous tissues. By design, because only a single pathway aberration was engineered, carcinomas developed stochastically only after long latency. Hence, this system, which allows for directed cell type-specific carcinoma initiation, facilitates further definition of events that can progress neoplasms to aggressive cancer...|$|R
40|$|Background: Colon {{cancer is}} among the leading causes of cancer {{mortality}} and its incidence is increasing worldwide. This is true in spite of broad basic research into colon cancer while, concurrently, physical activity {{has been shown to}} offer signifi cant preventive potential. This background led to the formulation of the following research questions: • Why is physical activity so effective in decreasing the incidence of colon cancer? • Is there a common denominator to colon cancer and physical activity, which has a reciprocal function? • Knowing the potential for public health impact of physical activity on colon cancer, has physical activity-colon cancer relationship been in the forefront of research efforts? Methods: Content analysis of archival literature has been carried out on census of 32, 822 message units, extracted from the National Library of Medicine and its PubMed database. The following search terms were used: colon cancer, physical activity, melatonin, age/genetics, diet (obesity, vitamin D, calcium), immunity/infl ammation, and bioactive substances incorporating insulin-like growth factor 1, interleukins, and prostaglandins.

40|$|Ror 2 is {{an orphan}} {{receptor}} tyrosine kinase with expression normally restricted to early stages of development. However, emerging evidence has placed aberrantly expressed Ror 2, leading to an invasive phenotype, in several cancers including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Although Ror 2 is currently identified as up-regulated in an assortment of cancers, neither the regulatory role or mechanism of action have been delineated. We sought to place Ror 2 in the most commonly mutated pathway of RCC, {{the loss of the}} tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which causes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α and - 2 α stabilization and the transcriptional activation of a broad repertoire of response genes. We found that Ror 2 was indeed associated with the pVHL loss in RCC as well as with VHL somatic mutations tightly coordinated with the induction of RCC. Additionally, knockdown and rescue analysis of HIF expression suggests that Ror 2 is dependent on pathologic stabilization of either HIF- 1 α or HIF- 2 α. Subsequent evaluation of the ROR 2 promoter suggests that HIF- 2 α and its dimerization partner, aryl hydrocarbon nuclear transferase localize to the ROR 2 promoter via a cryptic transcriptional element. This data substantiates a unique regulation pattern for Ror 2 in the VHL-HIF axis that {{has the potential to be}} applied to other <b>cancer</b> <b>etiologies...</b>|$|R

In this era of shared responsibility for data dissemination, improved patient care through research depends {{on the development of}} powerful and secure data-sharing systems. As part of the concerted effort to share research resources, the project entitled Personalized Risk Stratification for Prevention and Early Detection of Breast Cancer (PERSPECTIVE) makes effective data sharing through the development of a data-sharing framework, one of its goals. The secondary uses of data from PERSPECTIVE for future research promise to enhance our knowledge of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>etiologies</b> without duplicating data-gathering efforts. Despite its benefit for research, we recognize the ethical challenges of data sharing on the local, national, and international levels. The effective management of ethical approvals for projects spanning across jurisdictions, the return of results to research participants, and research incentives and recognition for data production, are but a few pressing issues that need to be properly addressed. We discuss how we managed these issues and suggest how ongoing innovations might help to facilitate data sharing in future genomic research projects.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest in the interaction of genetic susceptibility and xenobiotic exposures in <b>cancer</b> <b>etiology.</b> Study of gene-environment interactions may increase our ability to characterize relatively low population risks if a substantial {{proportion of the population}} cancer burden is attributed to high risk among a smaller group of genetically susceptible members. Further, these studies may provide insight into the mechanism of carcinogenesis, which can help establish the biologic plausibility of an exposure-cancer relationship. Biologic processes important in tumorigenesis that exhibit substantial interindividual differences may function as susceptibility factors. Potential examples include polymorphic enzymes, which activate and detoxify procarcinogens and carcinogens (e. g., certain P 450 enzymes, N-acetyltransferase [NAT 2], glutathione S-transferase M 1), and variation in the capacity to repair DNA.

40|$|Abstract Background Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most common {{diseases}} affecting women. Inherited susceptibility genes, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, are considered in breast, ovarian and other common <b>cancers</b> <b>etiology.</b> BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes have been identified that confer a high degree of breast cancer risk. Objective Our study was performed to identify germline mutations in some exons of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes for the early detection of presymptomatic breast cancer in females. Methods This study was applied on Egyptian healthy females who first degree relatives to those, with or without a family history, infected with breast cancer. Sixty breast cancer patients, derived from 60 families, were selected for molecular genetic testing of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes. The study also included 120 healthy first degree female relatives of the patients, either sisters and/or daughters, for early detection of presymptomatic breast cancer mutation carriers. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of all the studied subjects. Universal primers were used to amplify four regions of the BRCA 1 gene (exons 2, 8, 13 and 22) and one region (exon 9) of BRCA 2 gene using specific PCR. The polymerase chain reaction was carried out. Single strand conformation polymorphism assay and heteroduplex analysis were used to screen for mutations in the studied exons. In addition, DNA sequencing of the normal and mutated exons were performed. Results Mutations in both BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes were detected in 86. 7 % of the families. Current study indicates that 60 % of these families were attributable to BRCA 1 mutations, while 26. 7 % of them were attributable to BRCA 2 mutations. Results showed that four mutations were detected in the BRCA 1 gene, while one mutation was detected in the BRCA 2 gene. Asymptomatic relatives, 80 (67 %) out of total 120, were mutation carriers. Conclusions BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes mutations are responsible for a significant proportion of breast cancer. BRCA mutations were found in individuals with and without family history. </p...|$|R
