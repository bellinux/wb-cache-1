5|$|Construction {{began in}} March 1958 {{to enlarge the}} village to house a {{population}} of 15,000 and the basics were completed {{by the time that}} the French granted independence on 28 November 1960. Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.|$|E
5|$|Germany: The {{species is}} known from two {{different}} areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-Württemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> site. The species is also known from the Kyffhäuser hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest. The species was also recorded in deciduous forest at a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia. M.alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water. However, the species was also recorded {{in the center of}} the city of Chemnitz in Saxony.|$|E
5|$|The first metagenomic studies {{conducted}} using high-throughput sequencing used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing {{one of the main}} biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling.|$|E

25|$|Most living tissues prosper at a near-neutral pH; that is, a pH {{close to}} 7. The pH of blood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, for instance. When cells are grown in tissue culture, the medium {{in which they}} grow is held <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{physiological}} pH. A small amount of phenol red added to this growth medium will have a pink-red color under normal conditions. Typically, 15mg/l are used for cell culture.|$|E
25|$|The minimum stable star to circumbinary planet {{separation}} is about 2-4 times the binary star separation, or orbital period about 3-8 times the binary period. The innermost planets {{in all the}} Kepler circumbinary systems have been found orbiting <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> radius. The planets have semi-major axes that lie between 1.09 and 1.46 times this critical radius. The reason could be that migration might become inefficient near the critical radius, leaving planets just outside this radius.|$|E

Excellent views {{of the inner city}} can be gained from the Roslyn overbridge, which is 1,500 metres {{northwest}} of the city centre, and 150 metres above sea level. Several of the city's most prestigious schools are located <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> suburb and its northern neighbour, Maori Hill. Its southwestern end merges imperceptibly into Belleknowes. Roslyn's 2001 population was 3,957.|$|E
25|$|In AD 630, the Battle of Hunayn {{took place}} at Hunayn, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> city. Shortly after that, the {{unsuccessful}} Siege of Ta'if took place. The city was assaulted by catapults from Banu Daws, but it repelled the attacks. The Battle of Tabouk in 631 left Tā'if completely isolated, so members of Thaqīf arrived in Mecca to negotiate {{the conversion of the}} city to Islam. The idol of Al-lāt was destroyed along with all of the other signs of the city's previously pagan existence.|$|E
25|$|A child named Giulia Romola, with {{an unknown}} father, was baptized in Florence on November 5, 1535; this was {{probably}} Giulia. <b>Close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> date, her father had commissioned a portrait of himself drawing a female profile in silverpoint. Art historians believe the portrait may have been intended {{as a gift for}} his mistress, Taddea Malaspina, the sister of the marchioness of Massa, to commemorate the birth of their second child, Giulia. Giulia also had an older full brother, Giulio di Alessandro de' Medici, and at least one half-sister, Porzia de' Medici.|$|E

25|$|Carlingford was {{occupied}} in the 12th century by Norman knight Hugh de Lacy after laying the foundation stone for a castle on a strategic outcrop of rock. A settlement sprang up <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> fortress. The castle is {{known by the}} name of King John's Castle following a visit in the year 1210. The castle is an extensive ruin seated on a solid rock - the sides of which are enclosed by the sea. Mountains rise on the inland side, at the foot of which is a narrow pass which was formerly commanded by the fortress.|$|E
25|$|The remains, however, were clandestinely {{rescued by}} a handful of Bábis and were hidden. Over time the remains were {{secretly}} transported according to instructions of Bahá'u'lláh and then `Abdu'l-Bahá by way of Isfahan, Kirmanshah, Baghdad and Damascus, to Beirut and thence by sea to Acre on the plain below Mount Carmel in 1899. On March 21, 1909, the remains were then interred in a special tomb, the Shrine of the Báb, erected for this purpose by `Abdu'l-Bahá, on Mount Carmel in present-day Haifa, Israel. The Bahá'í World Centre is located <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> site and visitors are welcome to tour the gardens.|$|E
25|$|Significant changes {{occurred}} {{in the construction of}} the violin in the 18th century, particularly in the length and angle of the neck, as well as a heavier bass bar. The majority of old instruments have undergone these modifications, and hence are in a significantly different state than when they left the hands of their makers, doubtless with differences in sound and response. But these instruments in their present condition set the standard for perfection in violin craftsmanship and sound, and violin makers all over the world try to come as <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> ideal as possible.|$|E

25|$|The Ω limit (i.e., limit set) of a {{solution}} to a dynamic system is the outer limit of solution trajectories of the system. Because trajectories become <b>closer</b> and <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> limit set, the tails of these trajectories converge to the limit set.|$|R
25|$|Because {{there is}} no {{reference}} in any source prior to this work to this figure named Pharamond, who is placed prior to Chlodio (that is, before ca. 428), scholars consider him a legendary rather than historical figure. As {{a matter of fact}} in several sources, for example Gregory of Tours, multiple kings are attested to rule simultaneously in later times. It is thus a dubious matter to assume that, even if Pharamond existed, he was ever recognized as sole king. The first king of the Franks who may have been <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> position was Clovis I, but after his death his empire was divided again amongst his sons, who ruled again simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The New Course started just {{downstream}} of Temple Island, on the Buckinghamshire {{side and}} finished opposite the upstream end of Phyllis Court, {{very close to}} the current finish line. There were two slight bends (at Remenham and just after Fawley) and a staggered start to compensate for them. The course was also piled for the first time, although not boomed. Unfortunately, it became apparent that in trying to eliminate the unfairness of the Old Course, a new problem had been introduced. Downstream of Fawley, bushes grew alongside the Buckinghamshire bank and provided shelter from the prevailing wind. The course now ran <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> bank and crew on the Buckinghamshire station gained the advantage of shelter whenever a ‘Bushes Wind’ was blowing. From 1886 to 1905, Bucks took 59% of wins against 41% on Berks.|$|E
25|$|The {{axillary}} {{block is}} particularly useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery to the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. The axillary block {{is also the}} safest of the four main approaches to the brachial plexus, as it does not risk paresis of the phrenic nerve, nor does it {{have the potential to}} cause pneumothorax. In the axilla, the nerves of the brachial plexus and the axillary artery are enclosed together in a fibrous sheath which is a continuation of the deep cervical fascia. The easily palpated axillary artery thus serves as a reliable anatomical landmark for this block, and the injection of local anesthetic <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> artery frequently leads to a good block of the brachial plexus. The axillary block is commonly performed due to its ease of performance and relatively high success rate.|$|E
