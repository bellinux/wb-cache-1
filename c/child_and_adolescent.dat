5|$|According to the American Academy of <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> <b>Adolescent</b> Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E

40|$|In the {{theoretical}} part participation {{is defined as}} a process in which <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> express their views on matters of their concern. It is the need and the right of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Through participation in the family, friends, school, local <b>and</b> social environment, <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> develop into active citizens. In {{spite of the fact that}} participation has a positive effect on both <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> as well as on the society in which they live, there are barriers in individuals or in the society, which prevent them from active participation of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> youth in decision-making. Empirical part is based on a study, which included 293 children from eighteen different elementary schools in Slovenia <b>and</b> 101 <b>adolescents</b> from nine different secondary schools in Slovenia. I was interested in how do <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> know the right to participation and the extent to which they practice it in everyday life. I acquired the data by questionnaire. Results confirm two of the nine hypotheses and one partially. Through analysis of the answers I have found that <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> have a very poor knowledge of children's rights and that on average children know more than <b>adolescents,</b> <b>and</b> the right to participation is known to both groups the same. In defining the right to participation <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> have the same definitions, the most common is the "right to expression of opinion". The study did not demonstrate differences among <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> in understanding behaviours that define (not) participation. Among all the social environments <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> most commonly participate within the family environment, in the local environment, however, the differences in participation is shown only in carrying out voluntary work as fireman. In environment with friends children more often begin to resolve some of the problems independently, and in other environments we have not demonstrated differences between <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> in solving problems independently. Surprising, however, is the fact that <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> are least frequently involved in solving the problems in the school environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Obesity affects ethnic {{minority}} groups disproportionately, especially in the pediatric population. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of obesity on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> from mixed-ethnic samples. The purpose of this study was to: 1) measure HRQoL in a mixed-ethnic clinical sample of obese <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> 2) compare HRQoL assessments in obese participants and healthy controls, and 3) compare HRQoL in obese <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> according to their pubertal status. Methods: A clinical sample of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> with obesity (n = 96) <b>and</b> healthy <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> attending local schools (n = 444) completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL; UK version 4). Age-appropriate versions were self-administered by <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> aged 8 - 18 years, and interview administered to children aged 5 - 7 years. Multiple regression analyses controlling for age, gender, pubertal status, and ethnicity were used to compare the PedsQL scores of the two samples. Results: The clinical sample of obese <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> had poorer HRQoL scores on all dimensions of the PedsQL compared to the healthy controls (p < 0. 005). Subsequent analyses also demonstrated that in this sample of mixed-ethnic <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> prepubescent obese <b>children</b> achieved the poorest scores in the emotional functioning dimension. Conclusions: Obesity significantly impacts on physical, emotional, social and school functioning of mixed-ethnic <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Clinicians need to be aware of the significant impact of obesity on all aspects of functioning. More effort is required to target interventions to improve the quality of life of children with obesity. ...|$|R
