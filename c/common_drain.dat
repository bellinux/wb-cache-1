2500|$|Bethlem {{had been}} built over a sewer that served both the {{hospital}} and its precinct. This <b>common</b> <b>drain</b> regularly blocked and resulting in overflows of waste {{at the entrance of}} the hospital. The 1598 visitation by the Governors had observed that the hospital was [...] "filthely kept", but the Governors rarely made any reference to the need for staff to clean the hospital. The level of hygiene reflected the inadequate water supply, which, until its replacement in 1657, consisted of a single wooden cistern in the back yard from which water had to be laboriously transported by bucket. In the same yard since at least the early seventeenth century there was a [...] "washhouse" [...] to clean patients' clothes and bedclothes and in 1669 a drying room for clothes was added. Patients, if capable, were permitted to use the [...] "house of easement", of which there were two at most, but more frequently [...] "piss-pots" [...] were used in their cells. Unsurprisingly, inmates left to brood in their cells with their own excreta were, on occasion, liable to throw such [...] "filth & Excremt" [...] into the hospital yard or onto staff and visitors. Lack of facilities combined with patient incontinence and prevalent conceptions of the mad as animalistic and dirty, fit to be kept on a bed of straw, appear to have promoted an acceptance of hospital squalor. However, this was an age with very different standards of public and personal hygiene when people typically were quite willing to urinate or defecate in the street or even in their own fireplaces.|$|E

5000|$|In electronics, a common-source {{amplifier}} is one {{of three}} basic single-stage field-effect transistor (FET) amplifier topologies, typically used as a voltage or transconductance amplifier. The easiest way to tell if a FET is common source, <b>common</b> <b>drain,</b> or common gate is to examine where the signal enters and leaves. The remaining terminal is what is known as [...] "common". In this example, the signal enters the gate, and exits the drain. The only terminal remaining is the source. This is a common-source FET circuit. The analogous bipolar junction transistor circuit may be viewed as a transconductance amplifier or as a voltage amplifier. (See classification of amplifiers). As a transconductance amplifier, the input voltage is seen as modulating the current going to the load. As a voltage amplifier, input voltage modulates the amount of current flowing through the FET, changing the voltage across the output resistance according to Ohm's law. However, the FET device's output resistance typically is not high enough for a reasonable transconductance amplifier (ideally infinite), nor low enough for a decent voltage amplifier (ideally zero). Another major drawback is the amplifier's limited high-frequency response. Therefore, in practice the output often is routed through either a voltage follower (common-drain or CD stage), or a current follower (common-gate or CG stage), to obtain more favorable output and frequency characteristics. The CS-CG combination is called a cascode amplifier.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the LNC relied on taking over all, {{or at least a}} {{significant}} portion, of the burials of London's dead. However, while the Metropolitan Interment Amendment Act 1852 had repealed Chadwick's scheme for two very large cemeteries near London, it had also permitted London's parishes to make their own arrangements for the burial of their dead. Each parish could make arrangements with the cemetery of its choosing, or use money from the rates to create their own cemeteries. The financial mismanagement and internal disputes within the LNC had delayed the opening of Brookwood Cemetery by 18 months, and during this period new cemeteries nearer London had opened or were nearing completion. While some parishes did choose Brookwood as their burial site, many preferred either to make arrangements with less distant cemeteries, or to buy land on the outskirts of London and open their own suburban cemeteries. Concerns over the financial irregularities and the viability of the scheme had led to only 15,000 of the 25,000 LNC shares being sold, severely limiting the company's working capital and forcing it to take out large loans. Buying the land from Lord Onslow, compensating local residents for the loss of rights over Woking <b>Common,</b> <b>draining</b> and landscaping the portion to be used for the initial cemetery, and building the railway lines and stations were all expensive undertakings. With far fewer burial contracts with London parishes than had been anticipated, by the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in November 1854 the LNC {{was on the verge of}} bankruptcy.|$|R

40|$|Power Amplifer (PA), {{is a key}} {{component}} in a wireless communication system. It is challanging to design a PA having sucient gain, linearity and eciency {{all at the same}} time. Linearity is important to avoid interference among the channels while high effciency corresponds to longer battery life. Gain is important to reduce multiple stages. All the RF power ampli ers are made in common source configuration which offers high power gain but significant nonlinearity. To improve linearity, the amplifer is operated in backoff or advanced techniques like digital predistortion are used.
