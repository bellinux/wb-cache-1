However, many of the most fundamental aspects of the process are still not fully understood, or described, and many questions have been left unanswered. The thesis is divided into three sections:Section A introduces the AWJ technique by a discussion of the technical and commercial strengths and weaknesses of AWJ cutting as compared to laser cutting. The paper presented shows how and when the two techniques compete, and when they are complementary. The economic comparison is based on a market survey where a product was priced by companies working with AWJ and laser cutting.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from October 6, 2016 - October 6, 2018 In the past half century, industrial robots have developed a strong presence in manufacturing. They now commonly perform tasks such as materials handling, assembly, welding, and painting. Unfortunately robotic machining tasks have seen limited deployments. The majority of machining robots are designed for soft materials like wood or plastic and only apply repetitive cutting trajectories to create a particular geometry. The current systems fail to work for less predictable tasks with harder materials. In response, this thesis presents a novel robotic machining system for casting defect removal. Removing defects from metal castings requires flexibility to a high variance in workpiece geometry, defect locations, and defect geometry. With the proposed methods, a six-axis industrial robot arm efficiently maneuvers custom tools between sorted target locations. It applies surface-aligned custom tool paths to localized surfaces, producing <b>cut</b> <b>geometries</b> appropriate for post-removal welding.

A 3 D transient finite element method for a moving Gaussian laser heat source was developed to predict the depth and width of the heat affected zone on the Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy workpiece. There was a close correlation between the experimental data and the simulation results. It was found that the depth and width of the heat affected zone were strongly dependent on the laser parameters (laser power, laser scan speed, the angle of incidence and the diameter of the laser spot) and material properties (thermal conductivity, specific heat and density). Parametric studies showed that the depth and width of the heat affected zone increased with an increase in the laser power and decreased with an increase of the laser spot size and the laser scan speed.

40|$|Micro-end-milling {{requires}} high spindle {{rotational speed}} to achieve effective material removal. This results in the requirement of tool stoppage or slowdown during a micro-end-milling operation, a deterrent to productivity and to part acceptability. A circular tool path geometry can avoid discontinuities in the tool movements leading to a more consistent and smooth material removal. However, optimal process planning for such a tool path will require detailed understanding of the chip-formation mechanism in circular end-milling. The <b>cut</b> <b>geometry</b> during end-milling along a circular tool path is often approximated {{as that of a}} linear tool path. Although this assumption works well for circular tool paths with higher tool path radius, {{this is not the case}} for lower tool path radius often used in micro-milling. In this study, the effect of circular tool path on the cutting force for varying tool path rotation angle, tool path radius, and feed rate is experimentally investigated. Systematic signal processing was applied to analyse the measured cutting force signal along linear and several circular tool paths. Qualitative as well as quantitative differences were observed in the cutting force profiles obtained using different tool path radii, tool path orientations, and feed rates. This implies the need for an improved chip thickness formulation dedicated to micro-end-milling with circular tool path rather than approximating it with formulations derived for linear tool path. 9 Authors 2011.

The process of turning is influenced by many {{factors such as the}} cutting velocity, feed rate, depth of <b>cut,</b> <b>geometry</b> of cutting tool cutting conditions etc. The finished product with desired attributes of size, shape, and surface roughness and cutting forces developed are functions of these input parameters. Properties wear resistance, fatigue strength, coefficient of friction, lubrication, wear rate and corrosion resistance of the machined parts are greatly influenced by surface roughness. Forces developed during cutting affect the tool life hence the cost of production. In many manufacturing processes engineering judgment is still relied upon to optimize the multi-response problem. Therefore multi response optimization is used in this study to optimization problem to finds the appropriate level of input characteristics. The objective of this project is to evaluate the optimal setting of cutting parameters cutting velocity (N), depth of cut(d), feed(f) and variation in principal cutting edge angle (Φ) of the tool to have a minimum cutting force and surface roughness(Ra) In this project dry turning of aluminium 6061 as a work piece and carbide insert tool (SCMT 09 T 308 -TN 5120) is performed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine for the first time the {{feasibility}} of performing complete osteotomy of sheep tibia using a computer-guided CO 2 -laser osteotome, and to examine bone healing under functional loading. BACKGROUND DATA: Bone cutting without aggravating thermal side effects has been demonstrated with scanning CO 2 -laser osteotomy. Further research is necessary to develop a clinically usable laser osteotome, which may allow new types of bone surgical procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The scanning parameters for performing tibial osteotomies were determined in preliminary ex vivo trials. Osteotomies were performed in the mid-diaphysis of sheep tibia using either the prototype laser osteotome (osteoLAS, study group; n = 12), or an oscillating saw (control group; n = 12). Both groups were divided into two subgroups each (n = 6), and the two groups were sacrificed after 4 and 12 wk. Radiographs were taken postoperatively and after 4, 8, and 12 wk to compare the course of bone healing. RESULTS: Laser osteotomies of sheep tibia up to a depth of 20 mm were possible without visible thermal damage to the bone. A sequential PC-controlled <b>cut</b> <b>geometry</b> with artificial widening of the osteotomy gap was required for a complete osteotomy. Both clinically and radiologically, the laser and control groups showed undisturbed primary gap healing. Bone healing was similar and undelayed after both laser osteotomy and osteotomy done by mechanical saw. CONCLUSIONS: Osteotomy of multi-layered bones with a scanning CO 2 -laser demonstrates clinical and radiological healing patterns comparable to those seen with osteotomy done by standard mechanical instruments. It is, however, a technically demanding procedure, and complete laser osteotomies of long bones are only reasonable in bones with a diameter < 20 mm, which will likely restrict the use of this technique to bones 7 - 10 mm thick. Through the use of computer guidance, extremely precise osteotomies and sophisticated cut geometries are possible using this technique.

40|$|In many {{applications}} of cold-rolled steel tubes, {{negative effects of}} residual stresses in the tube material are experienced. For example in tube laser cutting, the residual stresses are gradually relieved during the cutting process, leading to an imprecise geometry of the cut tube. We {{believe that it is}} possible to anticipate on the residual stress effects if their magni-tude and distribution are known. Residual stresses in cold-rolled steel tubes are due to two main sources: (i) the rolling of the flat plate into a circular cross-section and (ii) afterwards closing this section with a weld bead. The first is causing plastic deformation, the second is mainly a non-uniform heating and cooling cycle on the material, preventing the elastic spring-back of the bent material. Focus in this research is on the second step in the produc-tion process: the welding. To reveal the residual stress after welding the tube, a finite element analysis (FEA) of the welding process is performed. This has the advantage that the residual stress/strain state in the tube as a whole is known and can be used further on in cutting simulations. Generally the welding analysis is split up into two parts: first the temperature during the welding is pre-dicted in a thermal analysis, and this temperature field is then used as the input for a me-chanical analysis predicting the stress/strain state during the welding and as the tube is cooled down, the residual stress state in the tube. The simulation is validated by a laboratory setup of the real production process. With this setup it is possible to compare the numerical results with both the experimental tempera-tures, measured with thermocouples, and the experimental strains, measured with the full-field digital image correlation (DIC) technique. In the laboratory environment, abstraction is made of the real production process by setting up the tube statically and using a robot-controlled GTAW torch, putting a weld bead on the tube. The tube under consideration is a stainless steel (AISI 304) tube with a diameter of 60 mm and a thickness of 1. 5 mm. As soon as this work-in-progress is finished, the predicted residual stresses will be checked with residual stresses in finished tubes with the slitting method. Next, to simulate the real welding process, the welding parameters of the real welding process will be adopted. Once the numerically predicted stress/strain state of the tube can be trusted, it should be possible to alter the laser cutting process in such a way that the <b>cut</b> <b>geometry</b> is in agreement with the intended one. status: publishe...|$|E
