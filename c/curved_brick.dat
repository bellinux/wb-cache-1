5|$|Bradman practised batting incessantly {{during his}} youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a golf ball. A water tank, {{mounted on a}} <b>curved</b> <b>brick</b> stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the <b>curved</b> <b>brick</b> facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman would attempt to hit it again. This form of {{practice}} developed his timing and reactions to a high degree. In more formal cricket, he hit his first century {{at the age of}} 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.|$|E
5|$|At {{the west}} end of the Lower Ward is the Horseshoe Cloister, {{originally}} built in 1480, near to the chapel to house its clergy. It houses the vicars-choral, or lay clerks of the chapel. This <b>curved</b> <b>brick</b> and timber building {{is said to have been}} designed to resemble the shape of a fetlock, one of the badges used by Edward IV. George Gilbert Scott heavily restored the building in 1871 and little of the original structure remains. Other ranges originally built by Edward III sit alongside the Horseshoe, featuring stone perpendicular tracery. As of 2011, they are used as offices, a library and as the houses for the Dean and Canons.|$|E

Some <b>curved</b> <b>bricks</b> have been found {{on the site of the}} mill.|$|R
5000|$|By 1938, the Bayko {{sets were}} {{described}} as [...] "Bayko Building Sets", as a period of change began. The 20s series, updated Ornamental sets, were introduced, in which <b>curved</b> <b>bricks</b> and windows and orange turrets were perhaps the most noteworthy introductions.

In Kerry, Montgomeryshire the estate architects J W Poundley and D Walker produced an unusual composition of a terrace of houses built for the Naylors next to the former Kerry workhouse. The red bricks are punctuated by a double string of white brick and a pattern of white and black bricks below the eaves and for the upper voussoirs.
