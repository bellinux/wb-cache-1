[...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a <b>couple</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution." ...|$|E
500|$|Other critics {{indicated}} befuddlement as to U2's purpose. The Asbury Park Press {{wrote that}} the long string of Achtung Baby song presentations that opened the show made one forget about the band's past, and that [...] "almost everything you knew about U2 a <b>couple</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> is, in fact, wrong now". The Star-Ledger said that the band shortchanged its music with its video presentations and that especially during the opening sequence, [...] "one was only aware of the music as a soundtrack to the real 'show'". [...] It concluded {{by saying that the}} group had lost the sense of mystery and yearning that made it great and that they had succumbed to the style of music videos. Jon Pareles of The New York Times acknowledged that U2 was trying to break its former earnest image and that they were a [...] "vastly improved band" [...] for being [...] "trendy" [...] and [...] "funny"; yet, he commented, [...] "U2 wants to have its artifice and its sincerity at the same time—no easy thing—and it hasn't yet made the breakthrough that will unite them." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Greil Marcus, Martin Scorsese {{said that}} the first fifteen minutes of his 1976 film Taxi Driver was based on Astral Weeks. Marcus {{referred}} {{to the impact of}} the album, calling it a [...] "common language", and relates that [...] "I was so shocked when I was teaching a seminar at Princeton just a <b>couple</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and out of 16 students, four of them said their favorite album was Astral Weeks." [...] Marcus goes on to say, [...] "Now, how did it enter their lives? We're talking about an album that was recorded well before they were born, and yet it spoke to them. They understood its language as soon as they heard it." [...] Elvis Costello described Astral Weeks as [...] "still the most adventurous record made in the rock medium, and there hasn't been a record with that amount of daring made since". Johnny Depp, in a Rolling Stone interview in 2008, recalled how when he was a preteen his older brother (by ten years), tiring of Johnny's favourite music of the time said, [...] "'Try this.' And he put on Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. And it stirred me. I'd never heard anything like it." [...] Joan Armatrading has said that Astral Weeks was the first album she purchased as a teenager and that it opened her up musically. In August 2010, director and choreographer, Jessica Wallenfels, staged a production in Portland, Oregon of a rock opera/story ballet of Astral Weeks called [...] "Find me Beside You".|$|E
500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{called the}} show [...] "possibly her flashiest, fastest moving, and most {{entertaining}} production yet", {{and added that}} the night belonged to Spears, as [...] "she managed to prove that she's still progressing as a showgirl. Not only that, she's doing it better than even diehard defenders would’ve predicted. At 29, the pop star whose career seemed in danger of ending just a <b>couple</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> has shown that she's back– hopefully this time to stay." [...] Evelyn McDonnell of Spin said that [...] "the idol America loves to hate went all out. Her body perpetually moved, she sang steadfastly into her headset (okay, she's got plenty of digital support, but she doesn't merely lip-sync), and she shimmied through an endless parade of outfits. [...] Having been knocked down by the tabloid press and the public repeatedly in recent years, Spears is now desperately seeking our attention. And she earns it. Haters go home." [...] Kelley L. Carter of MTV commented that [...] "the Spears that captivated the audience at the Staples Center [...] was the old, fun-loving, free-wheeling Spears— with a sexy, showgirl twist. There wasn't much pretense, though those glamazon outfits blinded {{in the best way}} possible. Instead, there was just good dance music." [...] Carla Meyer of The Sacramento Bee stated that [...] "Though Spears performed like a pro throughout the show, hitting all her marks, she had shown hesitancy in her movements— natural for the first stop on a tour. But that hesitancy vanished when she put on the denim. She seemed at ease." ...|$|E

Grohl returned to his other projects and was replaced on the European leg of the tour by former Danzig drummer Joey Castillo, who joined the band full-time. After the tour, Homme fired Oliveri, as he was convinced that Oliveri had been physically abusive to his girlfriend: [...] "A <b>couple</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> I spoke to Nick about a rumor I heard. I said, 'If I ever find out that this is true, I can't know you, man.'" [...] Homme considered breaking up the band after firing Oliveri, but found a new determination to continue. Oliveri countered in the press that the band had been [...] "poisoned by hunger for power" [...] and that without him, they were [...] "Queens Lite." [...] He later softened his opinion and said: [...] "My relationship with Josh is good. The new Queens record kicks ass."

2500|$|Regarding the album's title, Welch told MTV News, [...] "It {{was an art}} {{installation}} done in the '70s, {{this video}} piece all done on Super 8, this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different colored robes and masks, {{and it was all}} to do with color, really saturated, brightly colored pastas and balloons. I saw it a <b>couple</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and I think the whole idea of performance, and kind of putting on this outfit and going out almost to find some sort of exorcism or absolution, to kind of get outside yourself, there's a sense of ceremony to it." [...] Welch also revealed that she wanted to call the album Violence, stating, [...] "I wanted to make an album that sounded like the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, the violence mixed with the classical Shakespearean drama mixed with the pop and the pulp, extreme neon stuff." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she described the album as [...] "much bigger" [...] and categorised its genre as [...] "chamber soul", a mixture of chamber pop and soul. The liner notes of Ceremonials contain an essay by English writer Emma Forrest, dated 21 September 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a <b>couple</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
