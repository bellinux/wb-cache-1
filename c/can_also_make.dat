5|$|Deus Ex {{features}} twenty-four weapons, {{ranging from}} crowbars, electroshock weapons, and riot baton, to laser guided anti-tank rockets and assault rifles; both lethal and non-lethal weapons are available. The player <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> use of several weapons of opportunity, such as fire extinguishers.|$|E
5|$|Like all ants, they <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> use {{of visual}} {{landmarks}} when available {{as well as}} olfactory and tactile cues to navigate. Some species of ant are {{able to use the}} Earth's magnetic field for navigation. The compound eyes of ants have specialised cells that detect polarised light from the Sun, which is used to determine direction.|$|E
5|$|Visitors {{arrive and}} leave via a bus. The entry price can be set, and loans {{can be taken}} out. The player starts with {{a limited number of}} shops, rides, and {{facilities}} available. Research must be carried out to purchase others. Research <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> rides more durable, staff more efficient, and buses larger with increased capacity. The topic of research and how much funding goes into it is determined by the player.|$|E
25|$|Deep dives {{with open}} water ascents <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{occasionally}} <b>make</b> use of surface standby divers {{who can provide}} contingency gas to ascending divers whose position {{is marked by a}} shotline or decompression buoys.|$|R
30|$|With the {{increase}} in L, {{there is no doubt}} that Prfnwill increase rapidly. But, unlike the impact of m on the performance, the rate of precision declines very slowly (Fig.  5 a). This shows that {{the increase}} of L has less impact on the quality of the candidates. On the other word, OPRCP can guarantee that most (usually greater than 70 %) points in candidates are the near neighbor of the query object. This feature <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> the F 1 -score up to 0.8 (Fig.  5 b).|$|R
25|$|Along {{with normal}} profile and club profile users <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> an escort account.|$|R
5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> certain computations easier.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E
5|$|To remain undetected, {{the player}} can perform {{techniques}} which {{make use of}} both Solid Snake's abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to distract enemies. An on-screen radar provides the player with location of nearby enemies and their field of vision. Snake <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> use of many items and gadgets, such as infra-red goggles and a cardboard box disguise. The emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay, as fights against large groups of enemies will often result in serious damage for the player.|$|E
5000|$|Bumping {{is often}} {{described}} as happening behind the play, meaning that unless it occurs during a contest for the ball, it is not always the focus of television cameras or spectators. This <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> it difficult for field umpires to detect infringements. An umpire will often call [...] "fair bump", or [...] "play on" [...] in response to a legal bump. If a bump is late and the player has already kicked the ball, then it often results in a relayed free kick, which is given to a player on the same team further towards their goal.|$|R
50|$|Combo box - Like a {{drop down}} list, but users <b>also</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> entries {{not on the}} list.|$|R

5000|$|In 2005, several experts {{recommended}} e-governance {{to develop}} agriculture and {{provide services to}} livestock owners, farmers, and NGOs. [...] The services suggested included timely information during disasters to minimize loss of life and material. The information provided <b>can</b> <b>also</b> help <b>make</b> decisions with data about the market.|$|R
50|$|Native PHP {{support was}} added in Bricolage 1.10, that embeds a PHP 5 {{interpreter}} inside a Perl 5 interpreter. As a result, PHP code {{runs in a}} native PHP 5 environment, but <b>can</b> <b>also</b> transparently <b>make</b> use of any and all Perl libraries, including the complete Bricolage API.|$|R

25|$|The main {{elevation}} {{is influenced by}} Italian Cinquecento, with its pilastered windows and the triangular pediments. One <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> out fine details, such as scrollworks, lions' heads {{at the top of}} the elevation, and a nice row of rosettes just beneath, stretching like a frieze.|$|E
25|$|Some medical {{conditions}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> patients susceptible to bleeding. These are conditions {{that affect the}} normal hemostatic (bleeding-control) functions of the body. Such conditions either are, or cause, bleeding diatheses. Hemostasis involves several components. The main components of the hemostatic system include platelets and the coagulation system.|$|E
25|$|Renewable energy {{projects}} {{in many developing}} countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty alleviation by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.|$|E
5000|$|By 1962, Nurmi {{was making}} a living {{installing}} linoleum flooring. [...] "And if things are slow in linoleum, I <b>can</b> <b>also</b> do carpentry, <b>make</b> drapes or refinish furniture", she told the Los Angeles Times.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the name}} of the company {{includes}} the word [...] "gelato", Ciao Bella also serves sorbet and frozen yogurt. Ciao Bella <b>can</b> <b>also</b> custom <b>make</b> flavors by chef's request. Ciao Bella's gelato is handmade, based on a family recipe, with 12% butterfat and has 20% air by volume (In comparison to up to 50% air found in some ice creams, and 7~8% found in most gelatos).|$|R

25|$|ReadyDrive is {{the name}} Microsoft has given to its support for hybrid drives, a new design of hard drive {{developed}} by Samsung and Microsoft. Hybrid drives incorporate non-volatile memory into the drive's design, resulting in lower power needs, as the drive's spindles {{do not need to}} be activated for every write operation. Windows Vista <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> use of the NVRAM to increase the speed of booting and returning from hibernation.|$|E

25|$|Wikis <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>make</b> WYSIWYG editing {{available}} to users, usually {{by means of}} JavaScript control that translates graphically entered formatting instructions into the corresponding HTML tags or wikitext. In those implementations, the markup of a newly edited, marked-up version of the page is generated and submitted to the server transparently, shielding the user from this technical detail. An {{example of this is}} the VisualEditor on Wikipedia. However, WYSIWYG controls do not always provide all of the features available in wikitext, and some users prefer not to use a WYSIWYG editor. Hence, many of these sites offer some means to edit the wikitext directly.|$|E
