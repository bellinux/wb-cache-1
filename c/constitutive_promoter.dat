The model prokaryote Escherichia coli K- 12 contains seven species of the sigma subunit, each recognizing a specific set of promoters. For identification of the "constitutive promoters" that are recognized by each RNAP holoenzyme alone in the absence of other supporting factors, we have performed the genomic SELEX screening in vitro for their binding sites along the E. coli K- 12 W 3110 genome using each of the reconstituted RNAP holoenzymes and a collection of genome DNA segments of E. coli K- 12. The whole set of <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters</b> for each RNAP holoenzyme was then estimated based on the location of RNAP-binding sites. The first successful screening of the <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters</b> was achieved for RpoD (σ 70), the principal sigma for transcription of growth-related genes.

40|$|The {{promoter}} selectivity of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase {{is determined}} by the sigma subunit with promoter recognition activity. The model prokaryote Escherichia coli contains seven species of the sigma subunit, each recognizing a specific set of promoters. The major sigma subunit, sigma- 70 encoded by rpoD, {{plays a major role in}} transcription of growth-related genes. Concomitant with the increase in detection of promoters functioning in vivo under various stressful conditions, the variation is expanding in the consensus sequence of RpoD promoters. In order to identify the canonical sequence of "constitutive promoters" that are recognized by the RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing RpoD sigma in the absence of supporting transcription factors, an in vitro mixed transcription assay was carried out using a whole set of variant promoters, each harboring one base replacement, within the model promoter with the conserved - 35 and - 10 sequences of RpoD promoters. The consensus sequences, TTGACA(- 35) and TATAAT(- 10), were identified to be ideal for the maximum level of open complex formation and the highest rate of promoter opening, respectively. For identification of the full range of <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters</b> on the E. coli genome, a total of 2, 701 RpoD holoenzyme-binding sites were identified by Genomic SELEX screening, and using the reconfirmed consensus promoter sequence, a total of maximum 669 <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters</b> were identified, implying that the majority of hitherto identified promoters represents the TF-dependent "inducible promoters".

5000|$|The {{promoter}} of the 35S RNA {{is a very}} strong <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoter</b> responsible for the transcription of the whole CaMV genome. It is well known for its use in plant transformation. It causes high levels of gene expression in dicot plants. However, it is less effective in monocots, especially in cereals. The differences in behavior are probably due to differences in quality and/or quantity of regulatory factors. Interestingly, recent study has indicated that the CaMV 35S promoter is also functional in some animal cells, although the promoter elements used are different from those in plants. While this promoter had low activity compared to canonical animal promoters, levels of reporter products were significant. This observation suggests that the 35S promoter may have potential for use in animals. The promoter was named CaMV 35S promoter ("35S promoter") because the coefficient of sedimentation of the viral transcript, whose expression is naturally driven by this promoter, is 35S. It {{is one of the most}} widely used, general-purpose constitutive promoters. It was discovered at the beginning of the 1980s, by Chua and collaborators at The Rockefeller University. The 35S RNA is particularly complex, containing a highly structured 600 nucleotide long leader sequence with six to eight short open reading frames (ORFs). This leader is followed by seven tightly arranged, longer ORFs that encode all the viral proteins. The mechanism of expression of these proteins is unique, in that the ORF VI protein (encoded by the 19S RNA) controls translation reinitiation of major open reading frames on the polycistronic 35S RNA, a process that normally only happens on bacterial mRNAs. TAV function depends on its association with polysomes and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3.|$|E
30|$|Different {{types of}} {{promoters}} {{have been used}} in plant transformation research; these promoters can be divided into three classes: <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoter,</b> organ-specific promoter and inducible promoter (Potenza et al. 2004). The most representative <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoter</b> is CaMV 35 S (Odell et al. 1985), {{which is one of the}} most widely used promoters. However, the <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoter</b> might result in the over-expression of exogenous gene and break the regular growth process of plants (Scheid et al. 2002). The use of organ-specific promoters, such as potato tuber-specific patatin promoter, can make up for this weakness. SWPA 2 (Oxidative stress-inducible peroxidase promoter) is inducible promoter cloned by Kim in 2003 from sweet potato. This was confirmed by transforming the glucuronidase gene with SWPA 2 and CaMV 35 S promoters respectively into tobacco. Under water stress, the gene expression of SWPA 2 -GUS was 30 -fold that of CaMV 35 S-GUS, suggesting that SWPA 2 has a very strong stress-inducible ability (Kim et al. 2003).|$|E

Quantification of GFP signals in infected cells demonstrated that the CMV promoter produced the highest GFP expression in the six promoters and maintained relatively high GFP expression for up to eight weeks after infection of HCT 116, DLD- 1, and HT- 1080. Exogenous human CDKN 2 A gene expression was also introduced into DLD- 1 and MCF- 10 A in a similar pattern by using AAV vectors bearing the human b-actin and the CMV <b>promoters.</b> The six <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters</b> were subsequently placed upstream of the neomycin resistance gene within AAV vectors, and HCT 116, DLD- 1, and HT- 1080 were infected with the resulting vectors.

Since S. cerevisiae prefers glucose as a carbon source, and since its growth rate is higher in glucose than in galactose-containing media, we compared and evaluated seven different promoters expressed during growth on glucose (pTEF 1, pADH 1, pTPI 1, pHXT 7, pTDH 3, pPGK 1 and pPYK 1) with two strong galactose-induced promoters (pGAL 1 and pGAL 10), using lacZ as a reporter gene and measuring LacZ activity in batch and continuous cultivation.

Numerous cellular/viral promoters that ensure sustained gene expression in various cell types have been identified but systematic comparison of their activities in hESCs is still lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have quantitatively compared promoter activities of five commonly used <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters,</b> including the human b-actin promoter (ACTB), cytomegalovirus (CMV), elongation factor- 1 a, (EF 1 a), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and ubiquitinC (UbC) in hESCs.

Conclusion/Significance: The ACTB, EF 1 a and PGK promoters showed stable activities during long term culture of undifferentiated hESCs. The ACTB promoter was superior by maintaining expression in 75 – 80 % of the cells after 50 days in culture. During embryoid body (EB) differentiation, promoter activities of all five promoters decreased.

40|$|Regulated {{expression}} of a therapeutic gene is crucial for safe and efficacious gene therapy. Many inducible regulatory systems use a <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoter</b> to express a regulatory protein, such as rtTA in the Tet-On system, which may restrict their use because of cytotoxicity and immunogenicity. Autoregulatory {{expression of}} rtTA provides extremely low levels of rtTA when transgene expression is off, with rapid transgene induction upon addition of doxycycline.

The promoters were tested with the aid of an E. coli–Sulfolobus shuttle vector in reporter gene experiments. As the most suitable inducible promoter a maltose inducible promoter was identified. It comprises 266  bp of the sequence upstream of the gene coding for the maltose/maltotriose binding protein (mbp, Saci_ 1165). Induction is feasible with either maltose or dextrin at concentrations of 0. 2 – 0. 4 %. The highest increase in expression (up to 17 -fold) was observed in late exponential and stationary phase around 30 – 50  h after addition of dextrin. Whereas in the presence of glucose and xylose higher basal activity and reduced inducibility with maltose is observed, sucrose can be used in the growth medium additionally without affecting the basal activity or the inducibility. The minimal promoter region necessary could be narrowed down to 169  bp of the upstream sequence. The ABCE 1 protein from S. solfataricus was successfully expressed under control of the inducible promoter with the shuttle vector pC and purified from the S. acidocaldarius culture with a yield of about 1  mg L− 1 culture.

Results The transcriptional profiles of 13 key genes that participate in glucose metabolism in T. reesei were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The {{results indicated that the}} mRNA levels of pdc (encoding pyruvate decarboxylase) and eno (encoding enolase) genes were much higher than other genes under high glucose conditions.

To avoid the phenomenon of transgene down-regulation, we have employed strong, <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters</b> and compared this expression system with the inducible Tet expression system incorporated in a single plasmid vector or in lentiviral vectors. Plasmid-based transgene expression directed by the <b>constitutive,</b> human ubiquitin <b>promoter,</b> UbC, was stable in transfected HiB 5 cells in vitro and comparable in strength to the CMV promoter. However, after transplantation of UbC and CMV HiB 5 clones to the rat striatum, silencing of the transgene occurred in most cells soon after implantation of transfected cells. The Tet-on elements were incorporated in a single plasmid vector and inducible HiB 5 clones were generated. Inducible clones displayed varying basal expression activity, which could not be ascribed to an effect of cis-elements in the vector, but rather was due, at least in part, to intrinsic activity of the minimal promoter. Basal expression activity could be blocked in a majority of cells by stable expressing the transrepressor tTS. Fully induced expression levels were comparable to CMV and UbC promoters. Similar to the <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters</b> transgene expression was down-regulated soon after grafting of Inducible HiB 5 clones to the rat striatum. Lentiviral vectors can direct long-term stable in vivo transgene expression. To take advantage of this quality of the lentiviral vector, the Tet-on elements were incorporated in two lentiviral transfer vectors followed by transduction of Hib 5 cells. Interestingly, all HiB 5 clones established by lentiviral transduction showed very similar expression patterns and tight regulatability that apparently was independent of transgene copy number and integration site. Nevertheless, transgene expression in all lentiviral HiB 5 clones was down-regulated shortly after transplantation to the rat striatum.

A major challenge facing the cotton industry is that of crop loss to insect attack. The primary insect pests of cotton preferentially attack the boll, causing damage to the commercially important fibres. The recent introduction of Bt-transgenic varieties, containing genes with anti-pest properties from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, has had positive impacts on pest control and pesticide usage. These transgenes are under control of <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters,</b> resulting in endotoxin expression {{in all parts of the}} plant. This constant high level transgene expression may have several detrimental effects, such as placing strong selective pressure on pest populations to develop resistance, non-target effects of the transgene on other organisms, a yield penalty to the plant, and the presence of transgenic protein in secondary commercial products. For these reasons, this project aims to identify promoters that could be used for tissue-specific expression of anti-pest molecules in only the boll wall of the plant. A differential screening approach was used to identify several boll wall-specific mRNAs and the temporal and spatial abundance of these transcripts was determined using Northern analysis.

These plasmids were separately transferred to Agrobacterium rhizogenes, strain AR 15834. In the next step, petiole explants of sugarbeet were inoculated with the bacterial cells. Transformation-derived hairy roots were analyzed by GUS staining and/or PCR and were then inoculated with nematode larvae. Primary results showed partial resistance against nematode larvae in some hairy roots. As a result, this resistance {{can be related to}} OF 2 and VAP genes effect...|$|E
30|$|A genetic {{toggle switch}} with {{negative}} {{feedback to the}} genes consists of two mutually coupled genes. The transcription products of these genes are two inhibitory repressor proteins competing to shut off the production of two <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters</b> [1, 3, 25]; the protein transcribed by a gene of one type is capable of deactivating the transcription of the other gene. A toggle switch typically {{has more than one}} possible stable steady state depending on the reaction parameters under consideration [3]. There are a number of instances in nature where this switch-like behavior is utilized. The lysogeny/lysis switch of the bacteriophage λ virus infecting the bacterium Escherichia coli is a representative example and has been discussed in detail by Ptashne [1] and Ptashne and Gann [25].|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} map the {{immunogenic}} epitope for the monoclonal antibody E 7 H 2 on the human tumour necrosis factor (hTNF-α) molecule, a number of chimeric proteins were developed by in-frame joining segments of the human genes encoding TNF-α and lymphotoxin (TNF-β) {{as well as by}} coupling appropriate coding regions for human and mouse TNF-α. High level expression of these chimeric genes was achieved in Escherichia coli by placing the coding sequences under control of either E. coli trp-promoter or a tandem of bacteriophage T 7 <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters</b> A 2 and A 3. As revealed by Western blot analysis with monoclonal antibody E 7 H 2 directed against human TNF-α, the region involved in the binding of this antibody includes sequence ValGluLeuArg in the N-terminal part of the TNF-α molecule...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The RNA {{silencing}} {{technique is}} an effective tool to examine the biological function of the target mRNA in plants. The recent development of versatile-type RNAi vectors, which are driven by <b>constitutive</b> <b>promoters,</b> and GATEWAY TM cloning technology {{makes it easy to}} construct the RNAi vectors with trigger sequences and to analyze the function of a target gene. Although these vectors are highly useful, constitutive defects of the target mRNA expression sometimes result in lethality or seed abortion. Here, we summarize recent approaches to RNA silencing research designed to overcome these difficulties and to dissect gene expression. Key words: RNA silencing, RNAi vector, Waxy gene. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process of posttranscriptional mRNA degradation that is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or 21 – 26 nt smal...|$|R
