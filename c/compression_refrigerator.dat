40|$|Purpose This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a thermostatic chamber for the performance analysis of commercial vapor compression refrigerators. The thermostatic chamber and the refrigerators are equipped {{with a range of}} sensors to monitor respectively the temperature and humidity inside and outside the chamber and the thermodynamic conditions of the working fluid, i. e. temperature, pressure and mass flow rate, in the circuit critical points. The acquisition of sensor data and the refrigerator performance evaluation are provided thanks to a real-time and automatic interface developed adopting LabView© integrated development environment (IDE). The thermostatic chamber is adopted to compare the performance of refrigerants R 407 f and R 410 a as environmentally-friendly alternatives to the R 404 a, the current working fluid in the considered commercial refrigerator. Indeed, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of R 404 a is approximately twice the value of refrigerants R 407 f and R 410 a. The purpose of the experimental campaign is verify whether the R 407 f and R 410 a refrigerants allow comparable thermodynamic performances to R 404 a without requiring substantial component replacements.   Design/methodology/approach The paper focuses on the description of the developed thermostatic chamber and the system setup for the experimental campaign of a commercial vapor <b>compression</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> The chamber is composed by a 180 x 180 x 220 cm stainless steel climatic room with an internal volume of 5. 12 m 3, properly insulated by 100 mm of expanded polyurethane. The thermostatic chamber integrates the commercial vapor <b>compression</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> the refrigerant charging equipment and all the necessary sensors to monitor the environment conditions and evaluate the system performance. Originality/Value Global warming concerns have increased the efforts of the scientific community to identify alternative refrigerants in air conditioning systems with lower environmental impact and many results in the literature show their technical and economical feasibility. However, the introduction of these refrigerant alternatives in industrial products encounters some difficulties and, nowadays, several commercial refrigerators still adopt working fluids with a significant global warming potential. In this context, this paper presents the development and setup of a thermostatic chamber that can be adapted to real refrigerators to compare the thermodynamic performance of different refrigerants. An automatic control and data acquisition systems allow to test the thermostatic chamber in several technical configurations, i. e. ambient temperature and operating temperatures etc. The experimental campaign, applied to a commercial vapor <b>compression</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> compares the performance of environmentally-friendly refrigerants alternatives, i. e. R 407 f and R 410 a, to the currently adopted working fluid, i. e. R 404 a.

The design of an absorption refrigeration system operating with solar energy was carried out. The refrigerator is used to conserve sea food.

The lowest temperature the evaporator reaches is- 10 C, {{the high and low}} system pressures are 13. 4 atm and 2. 87 atm respectively. The refrigerant-absorbent mixture is ammonia and water, where the refrigerant is ammonia.

Magnetic refrigeration is a technique that utilizes the magnetocaloric effect, with possible energy savings of up to 30 % compared to commercial gas <b>compression</b> <b>refrigerators.</b> A material appropriate for commercial magnetocaloric devices should be both cheap and non-toxic; it should also exhibit a first-order magnetic transitions close to room temperature. The magnetic properties of Fe 2 P-related materials can be relevant in this context, since their magnetic properties can be finely tuned through the substitution of Fe by Mn and P by Si, As, Ge or B to meet the general requirements for a magnetocaloric device. An in-depth study has therefore here {{been made of the}} structural and magnetic properties of the (Fe,Mn) 2 (P,Si) -system. The phase diagram of the FeMnP 1 -xSix-system has been carefully re-examined. It is found to contain two single-phase regions: an orthorhombic Co 2 P-type structure (x < 0. 15) and a hexagonal Fe 2 P-type structure (0. 24  ≤ x < 0. 50). Selected compounds within the Fe 2 P-type region of the phase diagram have been shown to exhibit potential for use in magnetic refrigeration applications. Neutron powder diffraction has here been used to determine the magnetic structures of selected crystalline compositions within the FeMnP 1 -xSix-system {{to gain a better understanding}} of its magnetic properties. The Fe 2 P-type region is mainly ferromagnetic, but an incommensurate antiferromagnetic structure has also been identified close to the Co 2 P/Fe 2 P-type phase border for x ≈ 0. 25. The so-called ''virgin effect'' in the Fe 2 P-type region of the FeMn(P,Si) phase diagram is found to be accompanied by an irreversible structural phase transition induced by magnetostriction. This new phase is found to be preserved during successive cooling-heating cycles. Furthermore, the magnetic properties of the substituted Fe 2 P-type structure changes significantly for metal:non-metal ratios away from 2 : 1.

The heat energy required to run an absorption cycle is greater than the energy required to operate a similar sized vapour compression system. However if readily available or waste heat can be utilized then refrigeration can be provided without the need to generate more energy. It has been calculated that the sun provides 1. 3 kW/m 2 of energy which is largely unutilized as an energy source, (Kopp & Lean 2011).
