50|$|The Interceptor {{body armor}} system {{consists}} of an Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and two Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) ballistic plates. The OTV features a <b>carrier</b> <b>shell,</b> and three main ballistic panel inserts (left and right side panels, and a rear back panel), which are made with a finely woven Kevlar KM2 fiber. These {{two parts of the}} vest are both bullet and heat resistant. The soft ballistic panels are produced in five different sizes (S-XXL), which are installed into their respective pocket on the OTV <b>carrier</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>carrier</b> <b>shell</b> {{is simply}} a hollow carrier {{equipped}} with a fuze that ejects the contents at a calculated time. They are often filled with propaganda leaflets (see external links), but can be filled with anything that meets the weight restrictions {{and is able to}} withstand the shock of firing. Famously, on Christmas Day 1899 during the siege of Ladysmith, the Boers fired into Ladysmith a <b>carrier</b> <b>shell</b> without a fuze, which contained a Christmas pudding, two Union Flags and the message [...] "compliments of the season". The shell is still kept in the museum at Ladysmith.|$|E

50|$|A modern {{illumination}} shell has a {{time fuze}} that ejects a flare 'package' through {{the base of}} the <b>carrier</b> <b>shell</b> at a standard height above ground (typically about 600 metres), from where it slowly falls beneath a non-flammable parachute, illuminating the area below. The ejection process also initiates a pyrotechnic flare emitting white or 'black' infrared light.|$|E
50|$|The fuze {{action is}} {{initiated}} by impact, elapsed time after firing or proximity to a target. In {{most cases the}} fuze action causes detonation of the main high explosive charge in a shell or a small charge to eject a <b>carrier</b> <b>shell’s</b> contents. These contents may be lethal, such as the now-obsolete shrapnel shell or modern sub-munitions, or non-lethal such as canisters containing a smoke compound or a parachute flare.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Carrier</b> <b>shells</b> in {{the family}} Xenophoridae are marine shelled gastropods, fairly large sea snails. Most species of xenophorids cement a series of objects to the rim of their shells as they grow. These objects are {{sometimes}} small pebbles or other hard detritus. Very often shells of bivalves or smaller gastropods are used, depending on what {{is available on the}} particular substrate where the snail itself lives. It is not clear whether these shell attachments serve as camouflage, or whether they are intended to help prevent the shell sinking into a soft substrate.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, {{during the}} Sinai War, Tzafriri {{took part in}} the battle over Rafah. He was wounded during the battle, but carried on fighting. His Armoured {{personnel}} <b>carrier</b> was <b>shelled</b> and Tzafriri, along with his 9-man crew, was instantly killed.|$|R
50|$|The {{smoke shell}} is {{designed}} to create a smoke screen. The main types are bursting (those filled with white phosphorus WP and a small HE bursting charge are best known) and base ejection (delivering three or four smoke canisters, or material impregnated with white phosphorus). Base ejection shells are a type of <b>carrier</b> <b>shell</b> or cargo munition.|$|E
5000|$|... 155 BONUS is a 155 mm {{artillery}} round, {{developed in}} cooperation between Bofors of Sweden and Nexter of France, {{designed for a}} long range, indirect fire top attack role against armoured vehicles. The BONUS base bleed <b>carrier</b> <b>shell</b> contains two submunitions, which descend over the battlefield on winglets and attack hardened targets with explosively formed penetrator warheads.|$|E
50|$|Fuzes {{normally}} have two explosive components in their explosive train: {{a very small}} detonator (or primer) struck by a firing pin, and a booster charge {{at the base of}} the fuze (sometimes called the 'magazine'). This booster is powerful enough to detonate the main charge in a high-explosive shell or the ejecting charge in a <b>carrier</b> <b>shell.</b> The two charges are typically connected by a 'flash tube'.|$|E
40|$|A new {{pathway to}} {{nano-sized}} hollow-sphere particles from six-arm star polymers with an amphiphilic core-corona structure, synthesized in a four-step-procedure {{by means of}} reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is presented, {{in order to achieve}} more stable and versatile nano-container systems, which could be applied in the fields of drug delivery or catalyst storage. Star-shaped amphiphilic, diblock copolymers serve as globular platforms for synthesizing uniform hollow structures. By the introduction of monomer units carrying UV-cross-linkable dimethyl maleimido functionalities into the outer sphere of these star polymers, the <b>carrier’s</b> <b>shell</b> could be stabilized under UV-irradiation. After removal of the RAFT-core—constituting the central hub of the star polymer—by aminolysis, the carrier is ready for loading...|$|R
50|$|A fuze {{assembly}} {{may include}} {{more than one}} fuze function. A typical combination would be a T & P ("Time & Percussion") fuze with the fuze set to detonate on impact or expiration of a preset time, whichever occurred first. Such fuzes were introduced around {{the middle of the}} 19th century. This combination may function as a safety measure or as an expedient to ensure that the shell will be actuated no matter what happens and hence not be wasted. The United States called mechanical T & P fuzes ‘mechanical time super quick’ (MTSQ). T & P fuzes were normal with shrapnel and HE shells (including proximity fuzes), but were not always used with high bursting <b>carrier</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R
50|$|He was {{assigned}} in 1976 {{to develop a}} Light Field Gun of 105 mm for the Army. In {{a very short period}} from the date of his take over, he produced the first proto-type involving induction of most modern materials (three new varieties of steel were developed at Durgapur steel plant) and sophisticated technology in the field of gun development resulting in a light carriage of half weight and India's first Ordnance design. Simultaneously, he developed a time fuze for the <b>carrier</b> <b>shells</b> of long range guns by modifying an existing time fuze. The development of Smoke and HESH ammunition for this light gun IFG Mark II and IFG Mark I had his contribution.|$|R
50|$|Sensor fuzes can be {{considered}} smart proximity fuzes. Initial developments were the United States ‘Seek and Destroy Armour’ (SADARM) in the 1980s using sub-munitions ejected from 203mm <b>carrier</b> <b>shell.</b> Subsequent European developments, BONUS and SMArt 155, are 155 mm calibre due to advances in electronics. These sensor fuzes typically use millimetric radar to recognise a tank and then aim the sub-munition at it and fire an explosively formed penetrator from above.|$|E
50|$|Shells of Xenophora crispa {{can reach}} a size of 30 - 63 mm. They are trochoid, depressed-conical shells, non-porcellanous ventrally, with narrow {{peripheral}} edge and 7-8 whorls decorated with irregular spirals wrinkles. The base is slightly concave. Foreign objects are usually attached to all whorls of these shells, usually mollusk shells, pebbles, or {{small pieces of}} coral rock. The Mediterranean <b>Carrier</b> <b>Shell</b> uses these fragments for camouflage and to strengthen its rather fragile shell.|$|E
50|$|SMArt 155 is a German 155 mm {{artillery}} round, {{designed for}} a long range, indirect fire top attack role against armoured vehicles. The SMArt <b>carrier</b> <b>shell</b> contains two submunitions with infrared sensor and millimeter wave radar, which descend over the battlefield on ballutes and attack hardened targets with explosively formed penetrator warheads. Built with multiple redundant self-destruct mechanisms, these submunitions were specifically designed to fall outside the category of submunition weapons prohibited by the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions.|$|E
50|$|The Aviation {{business}} {{is an important}} and profitable part of Shell Pakistan Limited’s (SPL) portfolio. Shell's presence at five major airfields across Pakistan has enabled the company {{to be involved in}} supplying both domestic and foreign airline <b>carriers,</b> making <b>Shell</b> Aviation the second largest Jet fuel supplier in Pakistan with over 30% market share.|$|R
50|$|The {{problem with}} igniferous fuzes {{was that they}} were not very precise and {{somewhat}} erratic, but good enough for flat trajectory shrapnel (ranges were relatively short by later standards) or high bursting <b>carrier</b> <b>shells.</b> While improvements in powder composition helped, there were several complex factors that prevented a high degree of regularity in the field. Britain in particular encountered great difficulty in achieving consistency early in World War I (1914 and 1915) with its attempts to use its by-then obsolescent gunpowder-train time fuzes for anti-aircraft fire against German bombers and airships which flew at altitudes up to 20,000 feet. It was then discovered that standard gunpowder burned differently at differing altitudes, and the problem was then rectified to some extent by specially designed fuzes with modified gunpowder formulations. Britain finally switched to mechanical (i.e. clockwork) time fuzes just after World War I which solved this problem. Residual stocks of igniferous fuzes lasted for many years after World War 2 with smoke and illuminating shells.|$|R
5000|$|... "However, the unstated {{goal was}} to [...] "convince" [...] the villagers half are {{pensioners}} to relocate permanently in Armenia." [...] This military action was officially called [...] "Operation Ring," [...] because its basic strategy consists of surrounding villages (included Martunashen and Chaykand) with tanks and armored personnel <b>carriers</b> and <b>shelling</b> them. Azerbaijani villagers were allowed to come and loot the empty Armenian villages, while more than ten thousand Armenian villagers {{have been forced to}} leave Azerbaijan.|$|R
50|$|Cluster shells are {{a type of}} <b>carrier</b> <b>shell</b> or cargo munition. Like cluster bombs, an {{artillery}} shell {{may be used to}} scatter smaller submunitions, including anti-personnel grenades, anti-tank top-attack munitions, and landmines. These are generally far more lethal against both armor and infantry than simple high-explosive shells, since the multiple munitions create a larger kill zone and increase the chance of achieving the direct hit necessary to kill armor. Most modern armies make significant use of cluster munitions in their artillery batteries.|$|E
50|$|The chosen new {{penetrator}} material, tungsten carbide, was {{too heavy}} at full bore to be accelerated to a sufficient muzzle velocity. To overcome this, a lightweight full diameter <b>carrier</b> <b>shell</b> (APCR) was developed to sheathe the inner high density core. However, the low sectional density of the APCR resulted in high aerodynamic drag. Instead, the British devised {{a way for the}} outer sheath to be discarded after leaving the bore. The name given to the discarded outer sheath was the sabot (a French word for a wooden shoe, also used to describe the standardized wood or paper-mache wadding around round shot in a smooth bore cannon).|$|E
50|$|To allow {{increased}} impact velocity, {{a stronger}} penetrator material was required. The chosen new penetrator material was tungsten carbide (WC), {{due to its}} greater hardness {{and its ability to}} withstand the greater shock and pressure generated during a higher velocity impact. As the density of WC (≈15.7 g/cm³) is twice that of steel (≈7.86 g/cm³), such a shot was too heavy at full bore to be accelerated to a sufficient muzzle velocity. To overcome this, a lightweight full diameter <b>carrier</b> <b>shell</b> was developed to sheathe the inner high density core. The name given to this projectile type was the Armour-Piercing Composite Rigid (APCR). The APCR projectile was about half the weight of a standard AP shot, but of the same diameter. Due to the large surface area for the gases to impinge upon the lightweight APCR projectile, it experienced a higher average acceleration in the gun barrel, in turn imparting a higher muzzle velocity. Unfortunately the low sectional density of the APCR resulted in poor carrying power (high aerodynamic drag), losing velocity and penetration rapidly over distance.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of excitons in GaAs/(Al,Ga) As core-shell nanowires by continuous-wave and time-resolved photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Strong Al segregation in the shell of the nanowires leads {{to the formation of}} Ga-rich inclusions acting as quantum dots. At 10 K, intense light emission associated with these shell quantum dots is observed. The average radiative lifetime of excitons confined in the shell quantum dots is 1. 7 ns. We show that excitons may tunnel toward adjacent shell quantum dots and nonradiative point defects. We investigate the changes in {{the dynamics of}} charge <b>carriers</b> in the <b>shell</b> with increasing temperature, with particular emphasis on the transfer of <b>carriers</b> from the <b>shell</b> to the core of the nanowires. We finally discuss the implications of carrier localization in the (Al,Ga) As shell for fundamental studies and optoelectronic applications based on core-shell III-As nanowires...|$|R

500|$|Between the mid-1940s and {{the early}} 1990s, the Iowa-class battleships fought in four major US wars. In World War II, they defended {{aircraft}} <b>carriers</b> and <b>shelled</b> Japanese positions. During the Korean War, the battleships provided seaborne artillery support for United Nations forces fighting North Korea, and in 1968, New Jersey shelled Viet Cong and Vietnam People's Army forces in the Vietnam War. All four were reactivated and modernized {{at the direction of}} Congress in 1981, and armed with missiles during the 1980s, as part of the 600-ship Navy initiative. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Missouri and Wisconsin fired missiles and [...] guns at Iraqi targets.|$|R
