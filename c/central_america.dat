5|$|<b>Central</b> <b>America</b> gained its {{independence}} along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence {{was signed in}} Guatemala City which declared <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported {{the terms of the}} Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of <b>Central</b> <b>America.</b> The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.|$|E
5|$|Colpothrinax is a genus of solitary-stemmed pinnate-leaved palms {{native to}} <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> and the Caribbean.

5|$|Widespread {{rainfall}} occurred throughout <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> {{in early}} October 2008 {{due to the}} passage of a tropical wave through the region. Later, another tropical wave approached the region, which was believed to have left the west coast of Africa on September17. The wave developed a low pressure area on October10 in the southwestern Caribbean, with sporadic convection. On October13, the system consisted of a large area of convection drifting northward offshore eastern <b>Central</b> <b>America,</b> and Dvorak classifications began, indicating gradual organization. At that time, there was another low pressure area on the Pacific coast, and both systems were producing rainfall across <b>Central</b> <b>America.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Joan was a {{powerful}} hurricane that caused death and destruction in over a dozen countries in the Caribbean and <b>Central</b> <b>America.</b> Moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in October 1988, Hurricane Joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into <b>Central</b> <b>America.</b> Widespread suffering and economic crises were exacerbated by Joan, primarily across Nicaragua, as heavy rains and high winds impacted those near the hurricane's path.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 1953, {{an unusually}} {{long-lasting}} upper-level low persisted across Mexico and <b>Central</b> <b>America.</b> On May 25, a weak warm-core surface circulation developed east of Nicaragua.

5|$|A {{significant}} tropical wave {{with very}} little deep convection left Africa on July 22. It crossed the Atlantic, with convection associated with its southern part passing over the Windward Islands on July 28 and crossing <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> on July 31.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave crossed <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> {{and entered}} the eastern Pacific Ocean on November 7. An area of convection along the wave tracked westward {{to the south of}} <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> and Mexico, and became more concentrated on November 12 while located about 400miles (645km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection for it to be designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while located about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later.|$|E
