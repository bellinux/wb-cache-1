25|$|The {{manufacturer}} may {{specify the}} voltage drop across the fuse at rated current. There {{is a direct}} relationship between a fuse's <b>cold</b> <b>resistance</b> and its voltage drop value. Once current is applied, resistance and voltage drop of a fuse will constantly grow {{with the rise of}} its operating temperature until the fuse finally reaches thermal equilibrium. The voltage drop should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in low-voltage applications. Voltage drop often is not significant in more traditional wire type fuses, but can be significant in other technologies such as resettable (PPTC) type fuses.|$|E
25|$|Scenarios {{are used}} in order to {{estimate}} climate changes effects on crop development and yield. Each scenario {{is defined as a}} set of meteorological variables, based on generally accepted projections. For example, many models are running simulations based on doubled carbon dioxide projections, temperatures raise ranging from 1°C up to 5°C, and with rainfall levels an increase or decrease of 20%. Other parameters may include humidity, wind, and solar activity. Scenarios of crop models are testing farm-level adaptation, such as sowing date shift, climate adapted species (vernalisation need, heat and <b>cold</b> <b>resistance),</b> irrigation and fertilizer adaptation, resistance to disease. Most developed models are about wheat, maize, rice and soybean.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamics}} of PTC thermistors being powered also is extremely useful. When first {{connected to a}} voltage source, a large current corresponding to the low, <b>cold,</b> <b>resistance</b> flows, but as the thermistor self-heats, the current is reduced until a limiting current (and corresponding peak device temperature) is reached. The current-limiting effect can replace fuses. They are also used in the degaussing circuits of many CRT monitors and televisions where the degaussing coil only has to be connected in series with an appropriately chosen thermistor; a particular advantage is that the current decrease is smooth, producing optimum degausing effect. Improved degaussing circuits have auxiliary heating elements to heat the thermistor further (and reduce the final current) or timed relays to disconnect the degaussing circuit entirely after it has operated.|$|E

Exogenous calcium treated seeds were transferred to 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mM NaCl combined with air temperature incubation at 5 and 15 °C in germination chamber for 14 days.

40|$|Background: Aging or {{senescence}} is {{a complex}} biological phenomenon. Artificially selected Drosophila for extended longevity {{is one of the}} experimental models used to understand the mechanisms involved in aging and to test various theories. Objective: To examine the life history traits and biochemical defenses in relation to aging in an extended longevity phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster. Methods: Life history traits viz., survivability, fecundity, development time, dry weight, wing size, lipid content, starvation, desiccation and <b>cold</b> <b>resistances,</b> locomotory ability, antioxidant enzyme activities and reactive oxygen species level between control and selected lines of D. melanogaster were investigated. Results: In our model of Drosophila, extended longevity is associated with no trade-off in fecundity and shows variable resistance to environmental stress such as starvation, cold and desiccation. Enhanced biochemical defense involving the antioxidant enzymes was positively correlated with longevity. Conclusion: Extended longevity phenotypes of Drosophila represent genomic plasticity associated with variable life history traits attributed to the genetic background of the progenitor population and the environment of selection. Oxidative stress resistance seems to be a significant factor in longevity...|$|R
40|$|Although fast growth {{seems to}} be {{generally}} favored by natural selection, growth rates are rarely maximized in nature. Consequently, fast growth is predicted to carry costs resulting in intrinsic trade-offs. Disentangling such trade-offs is of great ecological importance in order to fully understand the prospects and limitations of growth rate variation. A recent study provided evidence for a hitherto unknown cost of fast growth, namely reduced <b>cold</b> stress <b>resistance.</b> Such relationships could be especially important under climate change. Against this background we here investigate the relationships between individual larval growth rate and adult heat as well as <b>cold</b> stress <b>resistance,</b> using eleven data sets from four different insect species (three butterfly species: Bicyclus anynana, Lycaena tityrus, Pieris napi; one Dipteran species: Protophormia terraenovae).
