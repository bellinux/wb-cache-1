40|$|This review {{presents}} {{information on}} declining population trends of critically endangered red deer of Kashmir {{commonly known as}} hangul (<b>Cervus</b> <b>elaphus</b> <b>hanglu)</b> belonging to the family Cervidae. It is restricted to Dachigam National Park (DNP) of Jammu and Kashmir State in India {{and is on the}} verge of extinction. The causes of decline of its population are both physical and biological factors. The physical factors include grazing by domestic livestock, fuel-wood and timber extraction, charcoal making and grass cutting. The biological factors include poaching by man and predation by leopard and black bear which are the main predators in DNP. The staff and vehicles of several government departments plying in the park also pose a threat to deer...|$|R
40|$|Observations on {{seasonal}} rutting behaviour of Hangul Deer <b>Cervus</b> <b>elaphus</b> <b>hanglu</b> {{were recorded}} in Dachigam National Park (DNP) during the years 2005 to 2007. A total of 24 breeding herds were seen. The size of the herd varied from 2 - 5, and usually comprised of one large stag and one or more hinds. The rutting season commenced in the main valley of lower Dachigam by late September and extended {{up to the first}} week of November. The peak was from October 9 to 20. The stags in rut became intolerant of each other and separated. The most conspicuous feature of the rut was the reverberating resonant roars by stags. The courtship behaviour was observed on six occasions and only mature stags (8 -tined and above) were involved in courtship. Various anthropogenic activities in the habitat were found to impair the rutting behaviour of deer...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} in the diets of Hangul Deer <b>Cervus</b> <b>elaphus</b> <b>hanglu</b> in Dachigam National Park (DNP) were determined by analyzing 95 freshly collected pellet samples. The pellets were collected along well defined transects during a two year study from January 2005 to December 2006. The diets showed marked seasonal variations. The spring diet was constituted by forbs (45. 2 %), shrubs (24 %), grasses (20 %) and climbers (10. 7 %). In summer forbs accounted for 42. 7 % of the diet, trees 38 %, grasses 14. 3 % and shrubs 4. 8 %. Except the lone representation of forb species (5. 6 %) the autumn diet was mainly represented by shrubs (75 %) and trees (19. 4 %). The winter diet was constituted by trees (35. 6 %), shrubs (28. 6 %), forbs (21. 3 %), grasses (8. 6 %) and climbers (5. 8 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The hangul (<b>Cervus</b> <b>elaphus</b> <b>hanglu)</b> is {{of great}} {{conservation}} concern because it represents the easternmost and only hope for an Asiatic survivor of the red deer species in the Indian subcontinent. Despite the rigorous conservation efforts of the Department of Wildlife Protection in Jammu & Kashmir, the hangul population has experienced a severe decline in numbers and range contraction {{in the past few}} decades. The hangul population once abundant in the past has largely become confined to the Dachigam landscape, with a recent population estimate of 218 individuals. We investigated the genetic variability and demographic history of the hangul population and found that it has shown a relatively low diversity estimates when compared to other red deer populations of the world. Neutrality tests, which are used to evaluate demographic effects, did not support population expansion, and the multimodal pattern of mismatch distribution indicated that the hangul population is under demographic equilibrium. Furthermore, the hangul population did not exhibit any signature of bottleneck footprints in the past, and Coalescent Bayesian Skyline plot analysis revealed that the population had not experienced any dramatic changes in the effective population size over the last several thousand years. We observed a strong evidence of sub-structuring in the population, wherein the majority of individuals were assigned to different clusters in Bayesian cluster analysis. Population viability analysis demonstrated insignificant changes in the mean population size, with a positive growth rate projected for the next hundred years. We discuss the phylogenetic status of hangul for the first time among the other red deer subspecies of the world and strongly recommend to upgrade hangul conservation status under IUCN that should be discrete from the other red deer subspecies of the world to draw more conservation attention from national and international bodies...|$|R

Weight significantly increased in 0. 3 % <b>Cervus</b> <b>elaphus</b> aquapuncture group on Chunchu loci and in 0. 2 % Ginseng Radix aquapuncture group on Chunchu loci compared to normal saline aquapuncture group on Chunchu loci. 2.

Significance was acknowledged in the effect by density difference of medicines.
