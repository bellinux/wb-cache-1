50|$|The {{electronic}} {{function of}} the <b>Computron</b> design incorporated steered, rather than gated, multiple electron beams.

The Additron Tube design by Josef Kates gated electron beams of a fixed trajectory with several control grids which either passed or blocked a current. The <b>Computron</b> was a complex cathode ray tube while the Additron was a triode with multiple grids and targets.|$|E

50|$|A {{simple way}} to {{describe}} the physically complex <b>Computron</b> is {{to begin with a}} cathode ray tube structure {{in the form of a}} right-circular cylinder with a central vertical cathode structure. The cylinder is composed of 14 discrete planes, each plane having 14 individual radial outward projecting beams. Each of the 196 individual beams is steered by multiple deflection plates toward its two targets. Some deflection plates are connected to circuitry external to the <b>Computron</b> and are the data inputs. The balance of the plates are connected to internal targets and are the partial sums and products from other stages within the tube. Some of the targets are connected to circuitry outside the tube and represent the result.|$|E

While Tommy Jagger defeats Bane in combat, but lets him go (despite Bane's murder of Jagger's father, the Judomaster), Fire kills <b>Computron</b> at Waller's behest. The other royals learn Waller is blackmailing Fire, a one-time assassin, with knowledge of her father, Ramon Corvalho's participation in war crimes decades earlier, and convince her to testify against him to avoid a court martial. The Black King confronts Waller with {{the fact that she is}} still covertly directing ops missions.|$|E
5000|$|Grimlock {{helped to}} sniff out the [...] "dinosaur {{transform}} static" [...] that implicated Trypticon in {{the theft of}} world monuments. Later in the year, when Decepticon leader Galvatron had Cybertron infused with function-inverting anti-electrons, a dose of the particles gave Grimlock super-intelligence. For the first time Grimlock identified himself as [...] "I, Grimlock". During a mission to Unicron's disembodied head, where the Autobots were outmatched by the new Decepticon Terrorcons, Grimlock used components of Unicron's head to construct the Technobots to battle them. Combined as <b>Computron,</b> the Technobots felt they could not match the Terrorcons, until Grimlock transferred his super-intelligence into <b>Computron,</b> reverting to his old self and allowing the Technobots to claim victory.|$|E

5000|$|The {{numerical}} {{function of the}} <b>Computron</b> was to solve the equation [...] where A, B, C, and D are 14 bit inputs and S is a 28 bit output.

50|$|The <b>Computron</b> was an idea {{born of the}} {{necessity}} of war research. It was to be a key element of the electronic digital computer which had yet to be built.

50|$|The <b>Computron</b> was an {{electron}} tube designed {{to perform the}} parallel addition and multiplication of digital numbers. It was conceived by Richard L. Snyder, Jr., Jan A.

50|$|In the mid-1980s, as he {{came closer}} to {{retirement}} age, Ferzetti's career in film began to decline, mainly appearing in low-budget TV movies and mini series, including an uncredited role in The Scarlet and the Black (1983) under Jerry London, and the mini-series Quo Vadis?

5000|$|The <b>Computron</b> {{design was}} an early attempt to produce not only a vacuum tube {{integrated}} circuit for both size and reliability (lifetime) issues, but to minimize external electrical connections between active elements. The goal of integration is not merely to reduce external signal connections {{into and out of}} a package by including multiple active devices in one package, as in the Loewe 3NF tube. It is to merge the functions of the active devices for a technical synergy. A modern example would be the multiple-emitter transistor of Transistor-transistor logic integrated circuits ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{her past}} as a dutiful soldier and daughter, Bea {{expressed}} remorse over {{taking part in a}} Checkmate mission that resulted in the deaths of as many as 50 Kobra agents, many of whom were immolated by Fire herself. Waller once again blackmailed Fire into covering up a coup in Santa Prisca. There, Fire killed Colonel <b>Computron</b> for Waller in order to protect her father, who, in the mid-1970s, under a right wing military dictatorship, had ordered thousands of innocent deaths in Operation Condor, a US-supported [...] South American anti-communist program that involved assassinations, torture and forced disappearances. He was never caught and Beatriz had always kept his secret.|$|E
50|$|Windblade {{is a major}} {{character}} in Transformers: Combiner Wars, where her history is somewhat similar to her IDW counterpart: she is a female Transformer from Caminus who previously served as Cityspeaker. She was left on her planet-which was desolated by the Combiner Wars-with only her friend Maxima, a similar Transformer who wielded an energy rifle. When Menasor and <b>Computron</b> arrived on their planet in battle, the pair attacked the victorious Decepticon Combiner and succeeded in killing him, though {{at the cost of}} Maxima's life. Learning that the Cybertronian Council-including Caminus' former ruler the Mistress of Flame-had come into possession of the Enigma of Combination, Windblade took Maxima's rifle and departed for Cybertron. After verifying Menasor's claim, Windblade prepared to destroy the Enigma only to be halted by the exiled Autobot leader Optimus Prime, who believed she was attempting to assassinate Starscream.|$|E
