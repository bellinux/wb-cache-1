40|$|<b>Business</b> <b>contracts</b> play {{a central}} role in {{governing}} commercial interactions between organizations. It is increasingly recognized that <b>business</b> <b>contract</b> conditions need to be closely linked to internal and external business processes, both to reduce the risk of contract violations and to ensure compliance with legislative regimes. Recent research has proposed contract languages allowing the specification of obligations, permissions and prohibitions in <b>business</b> <b>contracts.</b> <b>Business</b> processes that cross-organizational boundaries can be specified in choreography and coordination languages but these do not provide appropriate abstractions for contract constraints. In this paper, we examine the transformation of contract constraints in a <b>business</b> <b>contract</b> language into expressions in a choreography language. An example cross-organizational process is presented, along with a specification of the process in a choreography language and a specification of a set of contract conditions for the process in a <b>business</b> <b>contract</b> language. The contract terms are then translated into choreography expressions that govern the process to ensure compliance. Subsequent discussion explores a number of business and technology issues related to the results. We conclude that cross-organizational business processes can be monitored and enforced according to <b>business</b> <b>contract</b> specifications through the transformation of a contract definition to constraints on process behavior...|$|R
