40|$|AbstractLarge weighable lysimeters allow {{a precise}} {{determination}} of the soil water balance and the quantification of both water exchange at the soil-atmosphere interface and the flux below the root zone toward the groundwater. If well embedded into an equally-vegetated environment, they reach a hitherto unprecedented accuracy in estimating precipitation (P) by rain, dew, fog, rime and snow, and evapotranspiration (ET). Lysimeters largely avoid errors made by traditional measurement systems, such as the wind error of Hellmann rain gauges, the island error of <b>class-A</b> <b>pans,</b> or errors from soil-water measurements that are subject to subsurface heterogeneity. If the amount of seepage water {{is added to the}} lysimeter mass, temporal changes of the lysimeter mass can be used to solve the water balance equation for atmospheric fluxes. Increasing mass indicates P, decreasing mass ET. The {{determination of the}} net water balance (sum of P and ET) is accurate and robust. A problem arises in the separate estimation of the underlying P and ET fluxes, because weight differences in specified time intervals are affected by stochastic fluctuations due to mechani- cal vibration, which may be caused by wind or other factors. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate algorithms that aim on eliminating the effects of these fluctuations and to estimate actual fluxes across the soil-atmosphere boundary and the soil water balance from lysimeter measurements. We use synthetic and real measured data from large lysimeters to test which strategies of data evaluation can be applied, and which degree of accuracy can be reached...|$|R

The main plots consisted of three levels of irrigation after 50, 100 and 150 mm evaporation from a <b>Class-A</b> evaporation <b>pan</b> and subplots consisted of four biological fertilizer treatments (seed inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum, application of arbuscular mycorrhizae, both biofertilizers and no biofertilizer).

The three latter growth indices were decreased by 63, 50. 8 and 47. 6 percent, respectively, in severe water stress compared to the non stress condition. Application of biofertilizers in general and mycorrhizae in particular led to decreases in the measured growth indices in the absence of water stress. But at the presence of severe water stress (i. e. irrigation after 150 mm evaporation) simultaneous application of both biofertilizers led to significant increases in a majority of the growth indices including maximum crop growth rate, maximum leaf area index and total dry matter duration (by 50, 28. 6 and 45. 8 percent, respectively) compared to no-biofertilizers application...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} use {{of shade}} covers to reduce evaporation from agricultural reservoirs motivated this {{study on the}} effect of black polyethylene shade on the evaporation rate from a small water body (<b>Class-A</b> <b>pan)</b> and of its driving variables. Evaporation was measured hourly in two pans during the summer in Cartagena (Spain), along with the measurements of air temperature and humidity, water temperature, solar radiation and wind speed. The first pan was uncovered whereas the second pan was covered with black polyethylene shade as either a single or double-layer. The main factors influencing reduced evaporation (mass transfer coefficient and surface-to-air vapour pressure deficit) were analyzed, focusing on the changes in the uncovered pan. In the shaded pan there was a decrease in daily evaporation of 75 and 83 % for single and double-layer shade respectively. Condensation on the shade was considerable and was 14 and 21 % of the daily evaporation losses for the single and double-layer shade respectively. It was concluded that (i) black polyethylene shade appears to be an efficient way to reduce evaporative loss from agricultural reservoirs, and (ii) an economic analysis of their implementation under the current scarce water supply, for agriculture, in southern Spain justified their use.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of different reference evapotranspiration methods compared to <b>Class-A</b> <b>pan</b> or E-pan over different agro-climatic regions in Egypt. In this study, Egypt has divided into several agro-climatic regions according to the average air temperature and the reference evapotranspiration from <b>Class-A</b> <b>pan.</b> These were Nile Delta in the north, middle and Upper Egypt. Four reference evapotranspiration (ETo) methods namely; Blaney-Criddle, Hargreaves, Thornthwaite and FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith (PM) have been evaluated in this study. The results revealed that, there were statistically no significance between E-Pan and PM at P-value less than 0. 05, while the other equations had significant differences. The Hargreaves equation reported the highest ETo value at all regions while Thornthwaite was the lowest one. The difference percentage ratios between FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith, Blaney-Criddle, Thornthwaite and Hargreaves and E-Pan were 3. 7, - 13. 3, - 24. 8 and 10. 7 respectively. Hence, FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith method has proved its capability in {{estimation of}} reference evapotranspiration over different agro-climatic regions in Egypt.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} some physiological responses and grain yield of five chickpea cultivars under {{different levels of}} moisture and salinity, two experiments (i. e. a pot and a field experiment) were conducted in 2012. In the pot experiment, effects of four salt levels (i. e. control, 50, 75 and 100 mM of NaCl) on five chickpea cultivars, i. e. Arman, Azad, Hashem, ILC- 482 and Noorabad were studied in a 3 -replicate factorial completely random design experiment. In the field experiment, responses of the latter cultivars to four moisture regimes (i. e. no irrigation, irrigation after 75, 100 and 150 mm of evaporation) based on evaporation from a <b>Class-A</b> Standard <b>Pan</b> were evaluated in a 3 -replicate split-plot randomized complete block experiment. Data obtained from the pot experiment indicated that proline accumulation, Na+ concentration and Na+/K+ were increased, but K+ concentration, relative water content and plant dry mass were decreased with increase in salt level. Since cultivar ILC- 482 tended to indicate a greater proline concentration, in contrary to a smaller Na+ concentration and plant dry mass, compared to the remaining cultivars, {{it seemed to be}} more tolerant to the salinity. Data from the field experiment confirmed that delayed irrigation leads to increase in proline accumulation and decreases in leaf area index, plant dry mass and grain yield. Irrigating chickpea after 75, 100 and 150 mm evaporation resulted in 1964, 1675 and 1503 kg/ha of grain yield, leading to 114 %, 84 % and 64 % increases in grain yield, respectively, compared to the no irrigation control. Cultivars Noorabad and Hashem produced the greatest (i. e. 1610 kg/ha) and smallest (i. e. 1361 kg/ha) grain yields, respectively. According to the findings of this one-year field study, seeding cultivar Noorabad concomitant to irrigation after 150 mm evaporation could, perhaps, lead to a substantial increase in grain yield in Noorabad region of the Lorestan Province in Iran. Though, cultivar ILC 482 tended to indicate a more stable plant dry mass, when subjected to different irrigation regimes and different levels of saline water...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{physiological}} performance of Conocarpus erectus and Eucalyptus microtheca trees under deficit of irrigation water were studied through a field experiment lasted for a year. The experiment {{was carried out}} at The Experiments and Research Station of The Faculty of Food Sciences and Agriculture, King Saud University, 50 km south of Riyadh City. The treatments used in this experiment were irrigation at 100, 200 and 400 mm evaporation according to accumulation evaporation readings of a <b>Class-A</b> evaporation <b>pan</b> evaporation represent sufficient irrigation, moderate water deficit and severe water deficit, respectively. The statistical design used in carrying out this experiment was RCBD with four blocks in a factorial arrangement included the species and treatments with two and three levels, respectively. The results showed that irrigation at 400 mm evaporation caused significant reductions {{in most of the}} growth characteristics of C. erectus and E. microtheca trees comparing with irrigation at 100 mm evaporation. On the other hand, irrigation at 200 mm evaporation only decreased branch and root dry weight, branch weight ratio, relative leaf water content and soil water content comparing with irrigation at 100 mm evaporation. The fraction of dry weight partitioned to the branches decreased due to water deficit while that partitioned to the roots increased. Root to shoot dry weight ratio increased with decreasing water availability. Relative growth rate decreased with increasing water deficit mainly due to decreasing specific leaf area. Both Relative leaf water content and soil water content were decreased with increasing water deficit. In most of the growth characteristics measured, C. erectus trees had lower values comparing with those of E. microtheca trees. It seems that E. microtheca trees were conserving water through increasing the rate of water uptake into the plant in order to postpone desiccation during water deficit, while C. erectus trees responded to water deficit by increasing root dry weight and consequently increased root to shoot ratio.

Topics include estimating actual evaporation from deep lakes and from farm dams and for catchment water balance studies, estimating potential evaporation as input to rainfall-runoff models, and reference crop evapotranspiration for small irrigation areas, and for irrigation within large irrigation districts. Inspiration for this guide arose {{in response to the}} authors' experiences in reviewing research papers and consulting reports where estimation of the actual evaporation component in catchment and water balance studies was often inadequately handled. Practical guides using consistent terminology that cover both theory and practice are not readily available. Here we provide such a guide, which is divided into three parts. The first part provides background theory and an outline of conceptual models of potential evaporation of Penman, Penman-Monteith and Priestley-Taylor, and discussions of reference crop evaporation and then <b>Class-A</b> <b>pan</b> evaporation. The last two sub-sections in this first part include techniques to estimate actual evaporation from (i) open-surface water and (ii) landscapes and catchments (Morton and the advection-aridity models). The second part addresses topics confronting a practicing hydrologist, e. g. estimating actual evaporation for deep lakes, shallow lakes and farm dams, lakes covered with vegetation, catchments, irrigation areas and bare soil. The third part addresses six related issues (i) hard-wired evaporation estimates, (ii) evaporation estimates without wind data, (iii) at-site meteorological data, (iv) dealing with evaporation in a climate change environment, (v) 24 -h versus day-light hour estimation of meteorological variables, and (vi) uncertainty in evaporation estimates.

The PRD practice simply requires wetting of {{one half of}} the rooting zone and leaving the other half dry, thereby utilising reduced amount of irrigation water applied. The wetted and dry sides are interchanged in the subsequent irrigations. Six irrigation treatments were tested: (1) TR, traditional farmers ’ method of irrigation where irrigation management was left to the full control of a grower; (2) FULL irrigation where the full amount of irrigation water (60 % <b>Class-A</b> <b>pan</b> evaporation) was applied to the both halves of tree-root zone; (3) 1 PRD 30 and (4) 1 PRD 50, 30 and 50 % reduced amount of irrigation water, compared respectively to FULL irrigation, was applied alternately on each half side of the tree rows, and the irrigated side was changed every irrigation; (5) 2 PRD 50, 50 % reduced amount of irrigation water was applied on each half side of the tree rows, and the irrigated side was changed every other irrigation; (6) DI 50, conventional deficit irrigation where 50 % reduced amount of irrigation water, compared to FULL irrigation, was applied to the both halves of the tree-root zone, similar to FULL irrigation.

40|$|In the boreal zone, {{the annual}} amounts of {{evapotranspiration}} in forests Ef (mma– 1) {{and the growth}} of growing stands G (m– 3 ha– 1 a– 1) are practically determined by climate; the spatial variation of both of them can be largely explained by the effective temperature sum L (°Cd– 1) and the maximum soil frost depth in winter F (cm); the latter, in its turn, is a function of snow depth and frost sum. In the southern boreal regions, particularly on sandy glacial tills, drought in early summer is also noticeable. This, which somewhat counterbalances the effect of L, was roughly estimated. The partial derivatives of G with respect to the effective temperature sum L and winter’s maximum soil frost depth F were approximated by those obtained earlier by the author from spatial analysis. Applying the relation between Ef and the volume of growing stands K as obtained by Hyvärinen et al. (1995) and the mean ratio G/K on the basis of forest inventories, as well as the derivatives of Ef with respect to L and F, the temporal standard deviations of G and Ef could be roughly approximated for various regions south of the Arctic Circle in Finland. The results were verified by the actual temporal standard deviations of G found in ring-width studies, and evaporation observed by the <b>Class–A</b> <b>pan.</b> The results of this study, albeit rough, were of the right magnitude. It was also shown that the mean snow depth during winter more affected the soil frost depth, Ef and G, than did the frost sum.

Karoon and SC 704 had the highest and the lowest grain yield of 6370 kg/ha and 5160 kg/ha, respectively. Karoon and Mobin hybrids had a greater ability to maintain their yield under drought stress conditions, compared to SC 704. Drought led to increase in root depth and Mobin hybrid had the maximum root penetration of 26. 6 cm. Drought stress also led to early maturity in the maize hybrids and plants of Karoon hybrid grown under drought were matured 5 days earlier than the non-stressed plants. Increasing the severity of drought led to decrease in dry matter yield by about 56. 2 percent compared to control, indicating the key role of water availability in dry matter production.

Monthly water balances were compiled for four pilot-scale HF TWs receiving horticultural runoff over a two year period (Sep. 1999 –Aug. 2001) on the sub-tropical east-coast of Australia. The mean annual wetland ET rate increased from 7. 0 mm/day in the first year to 10. 6 mm/day in the second, in response {{to the development of the}} reed (Phragmites australis) population. Consequently, the annual crop coefficients (ratio of wetland ET to pan evaporation) increased from 1. 9 in the first year to 2. 6 in the second. The mean monthly ET rates were generally greater and more variable than the <b>Class-A</b> <b>pan</b> evaporation rates, indicating that transpiration is an important contributor to ET in HF TWs. Evapotranspiration rates were generally highest in the summer and autumn months, and corresponded with the times of peak standing biomass of P. australis. It is likely that ET from the relatively small 1 m wide by 4 m long HF TWs was enhanced by advection through so-called “clothesline” and “oasis” effects, which contributed to the high crop coefficients. For the second year, when the reed population was well established, the annual net loss to the atmosphere (taking into account rainfall inputs) accounted for 6. 1 – 9. 6 % of the influent hydraulic load, which is considered negligible. However, the net loss is likely to be higher in arid regions with lower rainfall. The Water Use Efficiency (WUE) of the wetlands in the second year of operation was 1. 3 g of above-ground biomass produced per kilogram of water consumed, which is low compared to agricultural crops. It is proposed that system level WUE provides a useful metric for selecting wetland plant species and TW design alternatives to use in arid regions where excessive water loss from constructed wetlands can be problematic. Further research is needed to accrue long-term HF TW water balance data especially in arid climatic zones...|$|E
