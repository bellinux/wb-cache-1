40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} the <b>combustion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and further the heat release rates for pool fires in ceiling vented compartments. The concept of plume {{equivalence}} ratio (PER) is introduced to express the ventilation conditions for the flames in such compartments. The transient PER is estimated using the fire plume theories because the complex bi-directional vent flow {{makes it impossible to}} measure or calculate directly. The <b>combustion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> can thus be predicted utilizing the empirical correlation proposed by Tewarson, and subsequently the heat release rates can be decided in combination with the fuel mass loss rates. Heptane pool fires in a small-scale ceiling vented compartment were experimentally investigated. The increment of the opening size had limited impacts on the fuel mass loss rates, but significantly raised the oxygen concentrations in the compartment; however, the oxygen concentrations at the bottom began to decrease earlier. The PERs inclined with the burning procedure until extinction in general indicating the ventilation conditions for the flame grew worse; the <b>combustion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> declined correspondingly. Increasing the opening size may improve the ventilation conditions for the flame in general and consequently increase the <b>combustion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> but it seemed to have little impacts on the heat release rates...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted with}} a single combustor from a J 47 turbojet engine using weathered aviation gasoline and several spark-plug modifications to determine altitude ignition, acceleration, and steady state operating characteristics. Satisfactory ignition was obtained with two modifications of the original opposite-polarity spark plug {{up to and including}} an altitude of 40, 003 feet at conditions simulating equilibrium windmilling of the engine at a flight speed of 400 miles per hour. At a simulated altitude of 30, 000 feet, satisfactory ignition was obtained over a range of simulated engine speeds. No significant effect of fuel temperature on ignition limits was observed over a range of fuel temperatures from 80 deg to - 52 deg F. At an altitude of 30, 000 feet, the excess temperature rise available for acceleration at low engine speeds was limited by the ability of the combustor to produce temperature rise, whereas at high engine speeds the maximum allowable turbine-inlet temperature became the restricting factor. Altitude operational limits increased from about 51, 500 feet at 55 percent of rated engine speed to about 64, 500 feet at 85 percent of rated speed. <b>Combustion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> varied from 59. 0 to 92. 6 percent over the range investigated and decreased with a decrease in engine speed and with an increase in altitude; higher efficiencies would have been obtained if lower altitudes had been investigated.

In ultra-compact combustors (UCC), engine length is reduced and pressure losses are decreased by merging a combustor with adjacent components using a systems engineering approach. High-pressure turbine inlet vanes can be placed in a combustor to form a UCC. In this work, experiments were performed to understand the performance and associated physics within a UCC. Experiments were performed using a combustor operating at pressures in the range of 520 – 1030 kPa (75 – 150 psia) and inlet temperature equal to 480 – 620 K (865 R– 1120 R).
