40|$|Calculating leakage inductances between {{windings}} of {{traction transformer}} {{is one of}} the most important schemes in design procedure. In this paper, ana-lytic, semi-analytic and nite element methods are introduced for electromagnetic modeling of dierent geometries of the traction transformer. Using these methods, the leakage inductances between windings are calculated and the methods have been validated with the help of a traditional analytic method and experimental data gathered from a typical 4000 kVA dry-type transformer. The analytic method which usually used for electromagnetic modeling of trans-formers with <b>concentric</b> <b>windings,</b> assumes the wind-ings to be constructed of straight wires. This method is fast and suitable for calculating the axial mag-netic eld and leakage inductance between <b>concentric</b> <b>windings.</b> However, in order to increase the accuracy of leakage inductance calculations between pancake windings, a semi-analytic method is proposed. It is shown that this semi-analytic method has a better ac-curacy in comparison with the analytic method and despite of the longer computing time, it is still a faster method compared to nite element...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of a magnetic gear and a brushless permanent magnet machine to realize a “pseudo” direct drive (PDD) with alternative winding configurations is investigated. It is shown topologies which facilitate the winding process and achieve a more robust stator construction exist. Comparisons with conventional PDD topologies which are essentially equipped with <b>concentric</b> <b>windings</b> {{have shown that}} similar efficiencies can be achieved, albeit {{at the expense of}} reduced torque densities. Furthermore, analysis of the magnetic forces exhibited by a pole piece has shown that both the average and dynamic forces are significantly affected by the rated load condition, exacerbating the radial forces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was {{to work out the}} {{mechanical}} stresses within transformer resulting from the extreme short-circuit currents. The forces and stresses set up in transformer windings as the result of exterior or interior short-circuits or of switching operations, are measured in detail. A variety of arrangements of windings in large power transformers are described. Points at which mostly high mechanical stresses take place in <b>concentric</b> <b>windings</b> are discussed in detail. Analytical and FEM calculations for individual short circuit forces, axial and radial have been discussed. The result was then compared with actual measurements on a prototype 20 MVA 132 / 11. 5 kV power transformer [15]. Various failure mechanisms due to these forces have been discussed. Design parameters are also discussed, whose values determine the maximum stresses which may occur in any part of the transformer. Effects of irregularity in various parts and various properties of materials have been studied and the usage of appropriate material for withstanding the dynamic effects of SC is discussed. Effect of workmanship errors on short circuit withstand capability has also elucidated. Finally, a complete model is developed...|$|E

This kind of current density occurs, for example, in winding with thin and highly stranded superconducting cables. Numerical evaluation and comparison with constant-current-density windings, leads to equivalent magnetic field performance, if a constant cross-sectional current density in the conductor is assumed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} implementation of analytical and numeral methods in computing the winding eddy losses of power transformers. It is appreciated that the computation of any component of stray losses of a transformer is intricate and involves a multitude of variables. The eddy current losses of a single conductor are treated using the rectangular and cylindrical coordinates of the differential form of Maxwell’s equations. The governing equations have limited use when the conductor thickness is increased; this is observed when thicknesses exceed 5 mm. The analytical method, known as Rabins’ method is implemented in Mathematica to evaluate local flux density quantities. The analytical method is compared to the two-dimensional finite element method (FEM) approach. The FEM methodology {{is found to be}} robust, flexible and fast to compute flux density components. The leakage flux distribution around the circumference of <b>concentric</b> <b>windings</b> is studied. The windings of a three-phase, three limb transformer that are subject to the non-homogenous distribution of the field due to the presence of the core yokes and adjacent winding influence are modelled. The developed three-dimensional model shows that this effect can introduce an error in the region of 32...|$|E
40|$|Compulsator is a {{specially}} designed generator capa¬ble of delivering high current pulses to a low-impedance load, such as the electromagnetic railgun. In order to increase the tip speed of the rotor, advanced composite materials {{have been used in}} the recent compulsator prototype, which is mentioned as air core instead of the traditional iron core. For typical air-core compulsators, there are no slots and steel teeth to place the armature windings due to the nonmachinability of composite materials. Therefore, <b>concentric</b> <b>windings</b> in racetrack style are often adopted instead of traditional lap winding in most cases, since it is more convenient to be fixed by composite materials. However, overlap occurs at the end winding part for multiphase compulsators, which are not easy to be formed during the manufacture process. In this paper, a fractional slot multiphase air-core compulsator with concentrated windings is proposed and analyzed. The main advantage of fractional slot configuration is that it can offer a concentrated winding structure under certain conditions, which means each coil only spans one “tooth,” and will not cause any intersection between each phase at the end winding. Two referenced fractional slot air-core compulsators with two phases, six poles, and four “slots” or eight “slots” (q = 1 / 3 and q = 2 / 3, q is the “slot” per pole per phase) are analyzed and compared with the performance of a traditional integral slot machine. The results indicated that the output voltage and self-excitation performance of a fractional slot compulsator can reach the same level with an integral slot one, and the discharging performance can reach an acceptable level. Thus, the fractional slot multiphase concept can be further used to improve the manufacture process of the winding in the future...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{pollution}} {{caused by the}} massive use of fossil fuel is a well-known critical issue makes {{the design of the}} electrical machines a crucial task because {{the vast majority of the}} industrial or household applications are integrated with this kind of technology; hence improving the efficiency of electric motors is expected to result in an extraordinary benefit in terms of energy saving. On the other side, the increasing use of renewable energies (like wind energy, hydropower, tidal energy), combined with the distributed generation concept, call for new electric machine technology and for modern design approaches. This doctoral thesis has been mainly focused on finding analytical procedures to model and analyze some types of electrical machines which are of interest for renewable and distributed generation. The use of analytical approaches is, in some cases, fundamental because numerical methods, mostly based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA), are very inefficient in terms of required time and computation resources. The types of electrical machines considered in this work are various. The attention is first placed on the slotless surface permanent magnet (SPM) topology (with different types of rotor magnetization). Wound-field synchronous generators with both three phase or multiphase stator are then considered. For the various kinds of the machines taken into account, some modeling, design and analysis studies have been conducted in the attempt to fill some gaps in the existing technical literature. In the first part of the thesis the purely analytical modeling of slotless SPM machines is addressed. In the work, it has been considered how the stator slotless design can be combined with different surface permanent magnet rotor topologies. The main efforts of the study have been addressed to the purpose of finding an explicit analytical expression to compute slotless machine torque and no-load back-EMF, covering all the SPM rotor topologies of interest. The subsequent part of the thesis, is about the analytical computation of end-coil leakage inductance in <b>concentric</b> <b>windings.</b> For a good dynamic modeling of machines equipping this kind of winding, it is useful that their mathematical model is implemented and that model parameters are identified with good accuracy. The proposed technique shows a very good accordance compared with a 3 D FEA simulation and is also validated though tests conducted on a dedicated experimental set-up. Multiphase machines are attractive for many energy-saving fault-tolerant applications thanks to their higher efficiency and intrinsic resilience to faults. A challenging task in the modeling of multiphase machines for design and simulation is identifying the self and mutual inductances due to leakage fluxes. In this thesis is also presented a novel approach for the leakage inductance determination in multiphase machines based on routine tests combined with very simple 2 D magnetostatic FEA simulations. The subsequent part of the thesis is about the design of wound-field synchronous generators specifically required to operate in a distributed generation system where significant fluctuations are known to frequently occur in both voltage and frequency. Design provisions are investigated to improve the generator resilience to these grid disturbances. In the last part of this thesis the attention is focused on multiphase alternators interfaced to DC distribution systems through multiple rectifiers. As a new finding presented as a part of this investigation, it is shown that a short circuit fault occurring on AC/DC rectifier terminals generates a strongly oscillatory behavior with much larger current peaks than could be predicted with conventional models regarding short circuit transients in DC networks.
