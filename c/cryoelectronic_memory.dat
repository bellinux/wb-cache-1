40|$|The {{goal of the}} Hybrid Technology MultiThreading (HTMT) {{project is}} to develop a multithreaded {{computer}} architecture that would utilize novel electronic and optoelectronic technologies to achieve petaflops-scale performance. The RSFQ subsystem consists of processors (SPELLs), <b>cryoelectronic</b> <b>memory,</b> and switching interprocessor network (CNET). Our estimations show that a future 0. 8 Â¯m niobium-trilayer RSFQ technology should make it possible to implement SPELLs operating with average clock frequency of 100 GHz. The total bandwidth of CNET would be 0. 7 PB/sec, with end-to-end latency of only 17 ns. The physical size of the subsystem (excluding cryogenic equipment) would be only 0. 5 m 3, and power dissipated in helium would be as low as 250 W. We have successfully fabricated and tested several key functional blocks of the subsystem, including the critical path of an integer adder. I. Introduction The development of digital superconductor technology is dominated presently by RSFQ logic [...] ...|$|E
