5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in <b>crystal</b> <b>form.</b> Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E

5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC <b>crystal</b> <b>form,</b> but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single <b>crystal</b> <b>form</b> or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
5|$|This {{treatise}} documented a {{wide range}} of pharmaceutical practices, including the use of ephedrine as a drug. It includes valuable information on metallurgy and the steel and iron industries during 11th century China. He created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of mica {{that could be used to}} cure ills through digestion. He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on <b>crystal</b> <b>form.</b> Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with copper sulphate. Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants. According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine realgar, its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied in sizes ranging from the size of a pea to a walnut.|$|E

25|$|Avalanche {{formation}} {{requires a}} slope shallow enough for snow to accumulate but steep {{enough for the}} snow to accelerate once {{set in motion by}} the combination of mechanical failure (of the snowpack) and gravity. The angle of the slope that can hold snow, called the angle of repose, depends on a variety of factors such as <b>crystal</b> <b>form</b> and moisture content. Some forms of drier and colder snow will only stick to shallower slopes, while wet and warm snow can bond to very steep surfaces. In particular, in coastal mountains, such as the Cordillera del Paine region of Patagonia, deep snowpacks collect on vertical and even overhanging rock faces. The slope angle that can allow moving snow to accelerate depends on a variety of factors such as the snow's shear strength (which is itself dependent upon <b>crystal</b> <b>form)</b> and the configuration of layers and inter-layer interfaces.|$|E

25|$|Replacement {{occurs when}} the shell, bone or other tissue is {{replaced}} with another mineral.

25|$|A single {{material}} may have several distinct solid states capable of forming separate phases. Water {{is a well-known}} {{example of such a}} material.

25|$|Crystal habit {{refers to}} the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to {{describe}} this property. Common habits include acicular, which described needlelike crystals like in natrolite, bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in native copper), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to <b>crystal</b> <b>form,</b> the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.|$|E

25|$|Dropping dilute acid (often 10% HCl) aids in {{distinguishing}} carbonates {{from other}} mineral classes. The acid reacts with the carbonate (2−) group, which causes {{the affected area}} to effervesce, giving off carbon dioxide gas. This test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original <b>crystal</b> <b>form</b> or powdered. An example of this test is done when distinguish calcite from dolomite, especially within rocks (limestone and dolostone respectively). Calcite immediately effervesces in acid, whereas acid must be applied to powdered dolomite (often to a scratched surface in a rock), for it to effervesce. Zeolite minerals will not effervesce in acid; instead, they become frosted after 5–10 minutes, and if left in acid for a day, they dissolve or become a silica gel.|$|E

Sodium metaborate dihydrate can be prepared through leaching of the szaibelyite ore in NaOH solution and the leaching liquor mainly consists of NaBO 2 and NaOH. In this work, the induction time for sodium metaborate dihydrate crystallized in NaOH solution from 30 to 50 degrees C was systematically investigated. The primary nucleation and growth mechanism were determined {{on the basis of}} the induction time measurements. The crystals of various morphologies under different crystallization conditions were obtained: the rodlike <b>crystals</b> preferred to <b>form</b> at low temperature, while the plate-like <b>crystals</b> <b>formed</b> at high temperature; when the crystallization temperature was 30 degrees C, the flat rod-like <b>crystals</b> <b>formed</b> at low supersaturation, while the slim rod-like <b>crystals</b> <b>formed</b> at high supersaturation.

500|$|As the crystal's repeating unit, its unit cell, becomes {{larger and}} more complex, the atomic-level picture {{provided}} by X-ray crystallography becomes less well-resolved (more [...] "fuzzy") for a given number of observed reflections. Two limiting cases of X-ray crystallography—"small-molecule" [...] (which includes continuous inorganic solids) and [...] "macromolecular" [...] crystallography—are often discerned.
