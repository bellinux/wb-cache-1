40|$|In {{recent years}} unusual high {{mortality}} of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) {{has been observed}} in the Swiss Rhone Valley. The exact causes, however, are not known. At a 2 -ha monitoring plot, tree mortality and crown condition have been monitored since 1996. Between 1996 and 2004, 59 % of the Scots pines died, most of them following the drought periods 1996 – 1998 and 2003 – 2004, while only 15 % of the deciduous trees died. <b>Crown</b> <b>transparency,</b> needle discolouration, dead branch percentage, mistletoe (Viscum album ssp. austriacum) rating, Tomicus sp. shoot feeding, male flowering effect, tree stem diameter, crown shading and social tree class assessed in 1998 were used in a logistic regression model to predict tree mortality. <b>Crown</b> <b>transparency,</b> mistletoe rating and percentage of dead branches were found significant in the model and the probability of tree mortality increased with increasing rankings of these parameters. Needle discolouration {{could be used to}} substitute dead branch percentage as predictor. While <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> increased with mistletoe rating, for trees in the same transparency class, trees with medium and heavy mistletoe infection were two to four times more likely to die than trees with no or only low mistletoe infection. For the surviving trees we found that trees with mistletoes showed a significantly higher increase in transparency in the year following a drought than trees without, while in a drought year the opposite was true. At the beginning of the observations no significant differences in transparency had been found between the trees with and without mistletoe. However, {{by the end of the}} observation period trees with mistletoe had significantly higher <b>crown</b> <b>transparency.</b> We conclude that mistletoe infection can be considered as both a predisposing factor for tree death, by increasing needle loss following drought and a contributing factor by increasing water stress during drought...|$|E
40|$|Context - One {{short-term}} {{adjustment of}} trees to drought is {{the reduction of}} photosynthetic tissues via leaf shedding. But in conifers, it usually takes several years to fully restore needle mass and assimilation capacity. Aims - This study aims to evaluate whether leaf shedding sustainably damages conifers or if these trees still {{have the ability to}} recover from drought with respect to their foliage and wood formation. Methods - An irrigation experiment was established in a mature dry forest to test the growth reactions of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) differing in <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> (low, medium, high) to a drought release by irrigation in comparison with equivalent control trees growing under naturally dry conditions on the same site. Results - Drought and high <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> had a combined negative effect on radial tree growth: Control trees with medium to high crown transparencies showed a substantially shorter growth period and a long-lasting growth depression in response to the severe summer drought in 2003. However, all trees benefited from irrigation, irrespective of their crown status, and immediately increased growth in response to irrigation. Conclusion - The progressed drought-induced defoliation seemed to be a weakening factor for trees suffering from drought, but this can be reversed if the water supply is improved...|$|E
40|$|The {{transparency}} of trees {{is the most}} important indicator for a forest health assessment. This paper presents an efficient method for calculating the <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> coefficient from tree binary images. This coefficient is based on the automated quantification of the deep indentation, macro-hole and micro-hole densities. Circular structuring elements are introduced, among other things, to automatically find the significant biological size. The symmetric tree convex hull and the tree smoothed contour are defined to delineate the reference areas necessary to evaluate the above-mentioned densities. Statistical thresholds are proposed to eliminate human operator subjectivity, especially in the automated identification of anatomical elements such as soft and deep crown-indentations or macro and micro crown-holes. A point-wise transparency map is produced to better appreciate the origin of the visible skylight areas in the crown. The crown micro-hole density is calculated from the 0. 1 -to- 0. 5 transparency points, the crown macro-hole density from the 0. 5 -to- 1 transparency points. We finally opt for weighting of the above three densities with regard to the importance of the symptoms they describe for a more relevant <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> coefficient. A comparative study on several trees from full-size and half-size binary images showed that our method is similar overall to the DSO and less sensitive to scale reduction. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
50|$|The USDA Forest Service has {{published}} a guidance document on field evaluations {{of a variety of}} crown characteristics beyond that of the normally taken basic measurements.

50|$|Crown {{density is}} the amount of crown branches, foliage and {{reproductive}} structures that blocks light visibility through the crown. Each tree species has a normal crown that varies with the site, genetics, tree damage, etc. It also serves as an indicator of expected growth in the near future. The crown density may be estimated using a <b>Crown</b> Density-Foliage <b>Transparency</b> Card. Using the card for reference the observer estimates what percentage of the light is being blocked by the crown mass. Estimates are made from two different directions at right angles and reconciled to determine crown density. There also are various electronic densitometers that will measure crown or foliage density.|$|R
40|$|Quantifying dieback in forests {{is useful}} for land {{managers}} and decision makers seeking to explain spatial disturbances and understand the cyclic nature of forest health. Crown condition is assessed as reference to dieback {{in terms of the}} density, transparency, extent and in-crown distribution of foliage. At 20 sites in the Yalgorup National Park, Western Australia, a total of 80 Eucalyptus gomphocephala crowns were assessed both in situ (2008) and using two acquisitions (2008 and 2010) of airborne imagery. Each tree was assessed using four crown-condition indices: <b>Crown</b> Density, Foliage <b>Transparency,</b> the <b>Crown</b> Dieback Ratio and Epicormic Index combined into a single index called the Total Crown Health Index (TCHI). The airborne imagery is like value calibrated then classified and modelled using in situ canopy condition assessments resulting in a quantification of crown-condition change over time. Comparison of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and a novel Red-Edge Extrema Index (REEI) suggests that the latter is more suited to classification applications of this type...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s {{defoliation}} (often {{assessed by}} means of <b>crown</b> <b>transparency)</b> is the most used indicator of tree condition adopted in Europe. It {{has been criticized for}} its subjectivity and scarce relation with meaningful endpoints. Here we collated the results of three different studies carried out in France and Italy to investigate the relationship between defoliation/transparency and other measured indicators of tree growth and health. In a first study, basal area increment (BAI) and mean defoliation of conifers and broadleaves in the French Level II network RENECOFOR were examined for the growing periods 1995 - 2004 (47 plots, 2008 trees) and 2000 - 2009 (63 plots, 3116 trees). A second, similar study was carried out on Picea abies (L.) Karts., in Trentino, Northern Italy, on 13 Level I plots and two growing periods, 2001 - 2005 (136 trees) and 2005 - 2009 (111 trees). The third study was carried out also in Trentino: nine Picea abies trees were randomly selected along an elevation gradient (900 - 1500 m asl) and examined for <b>crown</b> <b>transparency,</b> shoot length, needle weight, chlorophyll fluorescence, and stable isotopes in needles (δ 13 C and δ 18 O). BAI resulted negatively and significantly related to defoliation at both the French and Italian plots, and growth reduction of 0. 73 - 1. 49...|$|E
40|$|Air pollution, bulk {{deposition}} and throughfall, soil characteristics, needle chemistry, and forest injury were studied on six permanent plots {{from the south}} (Brenna and Salmopol in the Beskidy Mountains) to the north (Gac, the Baltic Sea coastal area) in Poland. The concentrations of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were the highest at the Katowice location and the lowest at Gac. Annual mean concentrations of sulfur dioxide at the Brenna, Salmopol, Katowice, and Puszczykowo sites, have exceeded the critical level of 20 µg m- 3 proposed by United Nations- Economical Committee for Europe (UN-ECE) bodies, and the Polish national standard (32 µg m- 3 for the whole country, and 11 µg m- 3 for special protected areas, e. g. National Parks). Nitrogen dioxide concentration has neither exceeded the UN-ECE nor the Polish national standards for the whole country (30 and 50 µg m- 3, respectively). Bulk deposition from all locations was acidic. The pH of throughfall in spruce stands was lower than the {{bulk deposition}} by about 0. 5 of a unit. A larger decrease of pH has been found occasionally. Concentration of all elements measured was higher in throughfall as compared to bulk deposition. However, the differences in concentration of elements between bulk deposition and throughfall varied. The differences were from {{three to five times}} for sulfates, but for nitrogen compounds, such as nitrates and ammonium, differences were smaller or did not exist at all. The soil pH of all plots ranged from 2. 9 to 3. 6 (H 2 O) in the organic layer. The highest concentrations of lead and zinc were found in the organic layer of the sites in southern Poland. The greatest needle loss (<b>crown</b> <b>transparency)</b> was found at the highest elevation site (Salmopol) for Norway spruce (Picea abies) and in the most polluted site (Katowice) for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The smallest <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> of spruce was found for the Gac location. Discoloration of needles was the highest at Gac, followed by Katowice and Salmopol. Insects contributed to the observed higher <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> on plots at Brenna and needle discoloration at Gac...|$|E
40|$|Crown {{defoliation}} of oak (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) was analysed in 808 trees {{during three}} forest condition surveys (1988, 1993, and 1999) {{in the southern}} Sweden. From 1988 to 1999 crown defoliation {{increased by more than}} 20 %. Changes in crown defoliation were related to the pH in the upper 20 – 30 cm of the mineral soils, which was closely connected to other measures of soil fertility (cation exchange capacity, CEC and C/N ratio). Trees growing on soils with a high pH (≥ 4. 00, in BaCl 2 filtrate), high CEC and low C/N ratio had significantly lower crown defoliation than trees growing on more acid soils (pH < 4. 00), indicating that less favourable soil conditions may further enhance oak decline. Age did not differentiate trees with respect to crown defoliation, indicating that decline in crown condition was not due to an age-related increase in <b>crown</b> <b>transparency.</b> Considering only trees younger than 100 years, a significant interaction was observed between changes in crown defoliation and soil pH. Trees younger than 100 years old growing on more acidic soils had a greater increase in <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> than trees on more basic soils between 1988 and 1999. Trees ≥ 100 years old had significantly higher defoliation on more acidic than on more basic soils, however defoliation dynamics of these trees over 1988 – 99 was not related to soil acidity. Two biotic agents (insect and fungal leaf infections) evaluated in this study did not prove to be important drivers of defoliation dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing of {{vegetation}} condition using high resolution digital multispectral imagery (DMSI) {{is an option}} for land managers interested in quantifying the distribution and extent of dieback in native forest. Crown condition is assessed as reference to the physical structure and foliage (i. e. density, transparency, extent and in-crown distribution) of a tree crown. At 20 sites in the Yalgorup National Park, Western Australia, a total of 80 (Eucalyptus gomphecephala) crowns are assessed both in-situ and using 2 acquisitions (2008 and 2010) of airborne DMSI. Each tree was assessed using four crown-condition indices: <b>Crown</b> Density, Foliage <b>transparency,</b> and the <b>Crown</b> Dieback Ratio and Epicormic Index. DMSI data is trained against canopy condition assessment data from 2008, crown condition is predicted using only spectral data.

40|$|The USDA Forest Service 2 ̆ 7 s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) {{program and}} the Forest Health Monitor- ing (FHM) program {{maintain}} networks of sample locations providing coarse-scale information that characterize general indicators of forest health. Tree mortality is the primary FIA variable for analyzing forest health. Recent FIA inventories of New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia reveal that {{the current rate of}} mortality, expressed as percent of basal area of live trees, is 1. 01. The Virginia Pine (Pinus virginiana) and Pitch Pine (Pinus rigida) forest types, growing along the ridges of the Appalachian Mountains, had high rates of mortality compared to the average rate for the study region. By diameter class, mortality rates were above average in the two smallest diameter classes and the largest diameter class. Counties with above-average mortality were concentrated in northern New York, the southern half of Pennsylvania, and in a patchwork pattern in West Virginia. The top five mortality species/species groups were American elm (Ulmus americana), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), aspen (Populus grandidentata and P. trernuloides), and Virginia pine.

40|$|The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) is {{negatively}} impacting hemlock {{stands in}} New Jersey. Mortality {{in the most}} heavily infested stands is increasing and is above 90 % in some plots. There are 15 to 20 remaining moderately impacted hemlock stands in New Jersey, primarily in the northwestern corner of the State. The greatest mortality occurred in stands that were heavily infested during multiple periods. Tree mortality occurred within 5 to 6 years after a stand became heavily infested, followed by a crash in HWA populations. During periods of low adelgid densities, the remaining trees begin to recover until adelgid populations rebound, resulting {{in an increase in}} the rate of tree mortality. It has taken about 10 to 12 years from the initial heavy infestation to see mortality level of more than 90 % in some stands. Other factors such as site conditions and water supply are likely a factor, but consistent across the stands where the mortality is the greatest is a heavy population of HWA. Foliage transparency typically increased in stands as the HWA populations increased, and significant tree mortality was observed when foliage transparency approached 60 percent. Foliage transparency would be a useful tool for forest managers interested in assessing tree health.

40|$|Forest health {{monitoring}} {{is essential to}} sustainable management of Pinus radiata D. Don plantations. Conventional survey techniques such as aerial sketch mapping are qualitative and subjective, their effectiveness depending on the skill of the surveyor. In contrast, digital remote sensing {{has the potential to}} provide quantitative and objective data on the location, extent, and severity of crown damage at a range of spatial scales. Decision tree analysis can incorporate both categorical and continuous data and is inherently non-parametric. Decision trees were used to model the crown condition of P. radiata plantations in southern New South Wales in three situations involving discoloured leaves, stunted crowns, and transparent crowns associated respectively with the Diplodia pinea (Desm.) Kickx fungus, nitrogen deficiency, and the pine aphid Essigella californica Essig. Spectral indices and fraction images derived from linear spectral mixture analyses of remote sensing scenes were used to classify crowns into either two or three condition classes.

40|$|Summary In recent decades, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) {{forests in}} inner-Alpine dry valleys of Switzerland have {{suffered}} from drought and elevated temperatures, resulting in a higher mortality rate of trees than the mean mortality rate in Switzerland. We investigated the responses of fine roots (standing crop, morphological and physiological features) to water supply in a Scots pine forest in the Rhone valley. Before irrigation started in 2003, low- and high-productivity Scots pine trees were selected based on their <b>crown</b> <b>transparency.</b> The fine root standing crop measured in spring from 2003 to 2005 was unaffected by the irrigation treatment. However, irrigation significantly enhanced the fine root standing crop during the vegetation period when values from spring were compared with values from fall in 2005. Irrigation slightly increased specific root length but decreased root tissue density. Fine root O 2 -consumption capacity decreased slightly {{in response to the}} irrigation treatment. Using ingrowth cores to observe the responses of newly produced fine roots, irrigation had a significantly positive effect on the length of fine roots, but there were no differences between the low-and high-productivity trees. In contrast to the weak response of fine roots to irrigation, the aboveground parts responded positively to irrigation with more dense crowns. The lack of a marked response of the fine root biomass to irrigation in the low- and high-productivity trees suggests that fine roots have a high priority for within-tree carbon allocation...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Horse {{chestnut}} (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) may {{be found}} in most urban areas in Croatia. Over the years it showed to be resistant to various negative urban influences. In this research we tested trees on randomly selected streets with intense traffic in smaller towns. The main goal of this research was to establish the link between pollution and tree growth and to analyze to what extent pollution influences the increase in the measured parameters. Material and Methods: The research was done in 7 settlements, in towns with the population of up to 75 000 inhabitants. The measured parameters were the morphological characteristics of trees, shoots, leaves and nuts. From the selected branches we measured the annual shoot (thickness and length), leaves, the number of flowers and nuts. The <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> was assessed according to the ICP Forest method. Results and Conclusion: The phenotype of the urban Horse chestnut significantly differs from its natural phenotype, and it is transformed by multiple radical pruning, what may be seen in the following ratios: the diameter at breast height - tree height, trunk height - tree height, crown height – tree height, crown width – crown height. The most significant characteristic of the tree is the vitality expressed by crown-damage classes. On the selected trees the worst crown damage class was “ 3 b” and the best was “ 0 ”. The measured parameters of yearly shoot characteristics were defined. All measured parameters (trees, shoots, leafs and nuts) show significant differences from the given average values...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey on}} the {{occurrence}} of Phytophthora species in oak ecosystems in Austria was conducted from April to May 1999 and in June 2000. The investigations were carried out at 35 study sites distributed throughout the zone of oak forests in eastern Austria. Four oak species, including Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. cerris and Q. pubescens were considered in the survey. Rhizosphere soil samples were taken from sample trees, which consisted of healthy and declining trees as indicated by their <b>crown</b> <b>transparency.</b> Young oak leaflets were used as baits to recover Phytophthora species. The assemblage of Phytophthora spp. detected in Austrian oak forests consisted of five species, including Phytophthora quercina, P. citricola, P. gonapodyides, P. europaea and P. syringae. P. quercina and P. citricola were isolated from 11 and seven sites, respectively, and were thus {{the most common and}} most widely distributed species. The three other species were recovered only sporadically. P. citricola could be separated into two morphologically and genetically well-characterized types (A and B). Phytophthora species, in particular the common P. quercina and P. citricola occurred on sites showing a wide variety of soil types, soil textures and moisture classes. There was mild evidence for connection between deteriorating crown status and the presence of Phytophthora spp. Furthermore, significant differences in contents of magnesium, as well as calcium, aluminium, nitrogen and carbon at different soil depths (0 – 10, 10 – 20 and 20 – 40 cm) were detected between Phytophthora-infested and Phytophthora-free sites. The {{results of the present study}} provide circumstantial evidence that Phytophthora species are involved in oak decline at certain sites in Austria. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess susceptibility to acidification and nitrogen (N) satura-tion caused by atmospheric deposition to northeastern US forests, evaluate the benefits and shortcomings of making critical load assessments using regional data, and assess the relationship between expected risk (exceedance) and forest health. We calculated the crit-ical loads of nutrient N and of sulfur (S) +N using the steady-state mass balance method at> 4, 000 regional and national vegetation and soil monitoring network plots in the northeastern USA. Regional calculations of critical loads necessitate use of soil maps which provide a range for each soil characteristic resulting in a broad range of critical load of S+N and exceedance values. For the scenario most representative of region-al conditions, over 80 % of the critical loads fell into the range of 850 – 2050 eq ha− 1 yr− 1; at 45 % of the plots, deposition exceeded the critical load. In contrast, the critical load for nutrient N, 200 – 300 eq ha− 1 yr− 1, was lower. Site measurements, especially to estimate soil weathering, would in-crease the certainty of the critical load. We ob-served significant negative correlations between critical load exceedance and growth (17 species) and crown density (4 species); we observed signif-icant positive correlations of exceedance with de-clining vigor (four species), with crown dieback (six species) and <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> (seven species). Among the species which demonstrate the most signif-icant detrimental responses to atmospheric deposition are balsam fir, red spruce, quaking aspen, and paper birch. These results indicate that significant detrimental responses to atmospheric deposition are being observed across the northeastern USA...|$|E
40|$|Regulating air {{pollution}} and climate are important ecosystem services provided by forests. Among {{air pollution}}, ozone is particularly important because its high values and wide distribution in remote forest areas. Forests may help in reducing ozone concentration because stomatal and non-stomatal deposition. Ozone, however, can potentially affect the vegetation, leading to a reduction of photosynthesis with consequences, from plant to ecosystem level. In a cost-benefit approach, this may {{be considered as a}} biological cost. To assess the size of ozone and climate regulating services provided by Alpine forests, a fully randomized study was established along an altitudinal gradient (900 - 1500 m a. s. l.) in Trentino, northern Italy. Environmental variables (O 3, NO 2, T, RH, LAI) were measured between May and August 2013. Tree response variables (crown condition, needle weight, shoot length, chlorophyll fluorescence, C and O isotopes) were also investigated on mature Norway spruce trees. Ozone concentration increased with altitude, both inside and outside forests. Significant (P< 0. 001; Wilcoxon test) lower ozone concentrations, however, were observed within the forest (64. 8 g m- 3) with respect to open areas (71. 3 g m- 3). Effect of forests on temperature was particularly marked for maximum daily values. As for response indicators, a distinct elevation pattern with concurrent increase of <b>crown</b> <b>transparency</b> and decrease of shoot growth, needle weight and photosynthetic activity potential was obvious. Nested within such a superimposed effect, the various response indicators were related to each other. Estimates of ozone removal in terms of AOT 40, relationship between exposure to ozone, ozone removal and tree- and plot-related variables will be presented and discussed. This will allow (i) the evaluation of possible biological costs of removing air pollutants and (ii) the functional interpretation of monitoring data. All together, this will help understanding the role of tree health on the regulating services provided by forests and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasive}} rust Puccinia psidii (myrtle rust) {{was detected}} in Australia in 2010 {{and is now}} established along the east coast from southern New South Wales to far north Queensland. Prior to reaching Australia, severe damage from P. psidii was mainly restricted to exotic eucalypt plantations in South America, guava plantations in Brazil, allspice plantations in Jamaica, and exotic Myrtaceous tree species in the USA; the only previous record of widespread damage in native environments is of endangered Eugenia koolauensis in Hawai’i. Using two rainforest tree species as indicators {{of the impact of}} P. psidii, we report for the first time severe damage to endemic Myrtaceae in native forests in Australia, after only 4 years’ exposure to P. psidii. A 3 -year disease exclusion trial in a natural stand of Rhodamnia rubescens unequivocally showed that repeated, severe infection leads to gradual crown loss and ultimately tree mortality; trees were killed in less than 4 years. Significant (p < 0. 001) correlations were found between both incidence (r = 0. 36) and severity (r = 0. 38) of P. psidii and subsequent crown loss (<b>crown</b> <b>transparency).</b> This provided supporting evidence to conclude a causal association between P. psidii and crown loss and tree mortality in our field assessments of R. rubescens and Rhodomyrtus psidioides across their native range. Assessments revealed high levels of damage by P. psidii to immature leaves, shoots and tree crowns—averaging 76 % (R. rubescens) and 95 % (R. psidioides) crown transparency—as well as tree mortality. For R. psidioides, we saw exceptionally high levels of tree mortality, with over half the trees surveyed dead and 40 % of stands with greater than 50 % tree mortality, including two stands where all trees were dead. Tree mortality was less prevalent for R. rubescens, with only 12 % of trees surveyed dead and two sites with greater than 50 % mortality. Any alternative causal agents for this tree mortality have been discounted. The ecological implications of this are unclear, but our work clearly illustrates the potential for P. psidii to negatively affect Australia’s biodiversity. © 2015 The Author(s...|$|E
