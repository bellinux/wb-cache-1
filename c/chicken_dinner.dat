5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried <b>Chicken</b> <b>Dinner</b> Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E

25|$|The {{theme park}} {{sits on the}} site of a former berry farm {{established}} by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. Cordelia Knott's efforts in the Mrs. Knott's <b>Chicken</b> <b>Dinner</b> Restaurant were essential to putting Knott's Berry Farm on the map, and the ensuing crowds prompted the creation of even more tourist attractions. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property. Knott added several other attractions over the years, and began charging admission to the attractions in 1968. In 1983, Knott's Berry Farm added Camp Snoopy, which began the park's present-day association with the Peanuts characters.|$|E

60|$|Can {{you imagine}} Reddy Fox with a <b>chicken</b> <b>dinner</b> right {{before him and}} not {{touching}} it? Well, that is just what happened in Farmer Brown's henhouse.

Yet here he was with a <b>chicken</b> <b>dinner</b> right before him, and he didn't touch it.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Meecher was {{friendly}} and garrulous. Variety, the journal which, {{next to the}} dog Toto, was the thing she loved best in the world, had informed her on the Friday morning that Mr. Foster's play had got over big in Detroit, and that Miss Doland had made every kind of hit. It was not often that the old alumni of the boarding-house forced their way after this fashion into the Hall of Fame, and, according to Mrs. Meecher, the establishment was ringing with the news.

There was also, though you could not see it, a <b>chicken</b> <b>dinner</b> in Toto's interior, by way of further celebration.|$|E

60|$|The Hoppers, who {{operated}} the establishment, did an excellent business. On week days the farmers {{who came to}} town to trade {{made it a point}} to eat one of Silas Hopper's twenty-five cent dinners, famous for at least five miles around for profusion and good cookery. On Sundays--and sometimes on other days--an automobile party, touring the country, would stop at the hotel for a meal, and Mrs. Hopper was accustomed to have a <b>chicken</b> <b>dinner</b> prepared every Sunday in the hope of attracting a stray tourist. There were two guest rooms upstairs that were religiously reserved in case some patron wished to stay overnight, but these instances were rare unless a drummer missed his train and couldn't get away from the Crossing until the next day.|$|E
60|$|There was no Sunday paper, so the girlish editors {{found the}} morrow a veritable day of rest.

60|$|The Sunday {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Ingua's mother in town proved a dull day with the Hoppers, who had been compelled to eat their <b>chicken</b> <b>dinner</b> themselves in default of customers.

He was very elaborately dressed, with silk hat, patent-leather shoes and a cane setting off his Prince Albert coat and lavender striped trousers. Across his white waistcoat was a heavy gold watch-guard with an enormous locket dangling from it; he had a sparkling pin in his checkered neck-scarf that might be set with diamonds but perhaps wasn't; on his fingers gleamed two or three elaborate rings. He had curly blond hair and a blond moustache and he wore gold-rimmed eyeglasses. Altogether the little man was quite a dandy and radiated prosperity. So, when the driver of the automobile handed out two heavy suit cases and received from the stranger a crisp bill for his services, Mary Ann Hopper realized with exultation that the hotel was to have a guest.|$|E
50|$|Soon other {{restaurants}} emerged which {{copied the}} distinctive style. Helen DeVore, {{who had worked}} for Belgrade Gardens, opened up Hopocan Gardens in 1946.

The Serbian-American Milich family opened Milich's Village Inn, in 1955. The Milich family announced in July 2014 that they would close down their restaurant on December 31. A month later, the location reopened under new ownership as Village Inn Chicken, still serving the signature fried poultry.|$|R
