5|$|The allies had no 'standing army', nor {{was there}} any {{requirement}} to form one; since they were fighting on home territory, they <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> armies as and when required. Different-sized allied forces thus appeared throughout the campaign. These numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the Belgian Army's mobilisation, it <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> five Regular Corps and two reserve Army Corps consisting of 12 regular infantry divisions, two divisions of Chasseurs Ardennais, six reserve infantry divisions, one brigade of Cyclist Frontier Guards, one Cavalry Corps of two divisions, and one brigade of motorised cavalry. The Army contained two anti-aircraft artillery and four artillery regiments, and an unknown number of fortress, engineer, and signals force personnel.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, late on 13 February, having {{successfully}} regrouped what forces he <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> at Bergères-lès-Vertus, Blücher {{had launched}} {{an attack against}} Marmont's single division, pushing him out of Étoges and advancing as planned towards Champaubert and Fromentières, {{in the rear of}} Napoleon's force. However, having read Blücher's intentions, Napoleon had given orders for a concentration of French forces in that very sector.|$|E

5|$|Facing the Wehrmacht {{were three}} Soviet fronts forming a {{defensive}} {{line between the}} cities of Vyazma and Bryansk, which barred the way to Moscow. The armies comprising these fronts had also been involved in heavy fighting. Still, it was a formidable concentration consisting of 1,250,000 men, 1,000 tanks and 7,600 guns. The Soviet Air Force (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS) had suffered appalling losses of some 7,500 to 21,200 aircraft. Extraordinary industrial achievements had begun to replace these, and {{at the outset of}} Typhoon the VVS <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> 936 aircraft, 578 of which were bombers.|$|E
5|$|Having {{escaped to}} the east, Villaret made what sail his {{battered}} fleet <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> {{to return to}} France, and dispatched his frigates {{in search of the}} convoy. Villaret was also hoping for reinforcements; eight ships of the line, commanded by Admiral Pierre-François Cornic, were patrolling near the Ushant headland. Behind him to the west, the British took the whole night to secure their ships and prizes, not setting out to return to Britain until 05:00 on 2 June.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city <b>could</b> <b>muster.</b> This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E
50|$|Dave Dickenson {{had some}} success moving the ball for BC, but the Lions <b>could</b> only <b>muster</b> a 36-yard field goal by Duncan O'Mahony.|$|R
5000|$|Notre Dame <b>could</b> only <b>muster</b> two {{field goals}} in the first half, but they led 6-3 at halftime in a game clouded by rain. However Wade Richey and Abram Booty got the Tigers into the lead (on a field goal and {{touchdown}} reception, respecitvely) in the 3rd quarter. Trailing 13-6, Notre Dame <b>could</b> only <b>muster</b> one more field goal to narrow the lead as LSU scored twice on Rondell Mealey touchdown runs. [...] Mealey had 34 carries for 222 yards and 2 touchdowns.|$|R
50|$|Favorite Animal Kingdom {{lost his}} footing {{at the start}} and <b>could</b> only <b>muster</b> sixth; Ruler On Ice, with jockey Jose Valdivia Jr., sprinted to the finish ahead of Stay Thirsty.|$|R
5|$|Western civilization {{could only}} be saved, Innis argued, by {{recovering}} the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing {{institutions of higher learning}} from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, A Plea for Time, he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.|$|E
5|$|Grouchy's I Cavalry Corps and II Cavalry Corps, each of two divisions, {{numbered}} {{a combined}} 3,600 horsemen. The two Guard cavalry divisions together counted 3,300 troopers. The 1st Old Guard Division had 4,000 {{men and the}} 2nd Old Guard Division had 3,000. The 1st Young Guard Division {{was made up of}} 4,000 soldiers while the 2nd Young Guard Division had 2,500 troops. Marmont's two divisions <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> only 3,000 men. Jean François Leval's 7th Division comprised 4,500 soldiers. Of these forces, only the cavalry, Marmont's infantry and one battalion of the Old Guard were actually engaged in the fighting. The others were marching along behind.|$|E
5|$|In the {{six weeks}} of {{intensive}} combat, RAF strength had been maintained to extent far greater than the Luftwaffe intelligence had believed possible. On the evening of 14 September, Fighter Command <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> 269 Supermarine Spitfire and 533 Hawker Hurricane fighters. The two vital groups could put up just over 500 fighters. No. 11 Group RAF had 310 fighters, including 92 Spitfires and 218 Hurricanes. No. 12 Group RAF could field 85 Spitfires and 109 Hurricanes. Should No. 10 Group RAF come into the battle, a further 48 Spitfires and 78 Hurricanes could be committed. Compared with 17 August, there were just 22 fewer Spitfires and Hurricanes.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, Ottinger fell to 9th in points. This {{was largely}} because of 9 DNFs. Also, Ottinger <b>could</b> only <b>muster</b> 6 top-5s and 10 top-10s. Despite that, Ottinger {{finished}} 2nd four times.|$|R
50|$|The {{visitors}} <b>could</b> only <b>muster</b> ten men, {{and had two}} {{of their}} best players absent, and the Saints won easily, 10-0, with five goals from A. A. Fry and four from Ned Bromley.|$|R

5|$|On {{the night}} of June 25, 1950, 10 {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion on the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. Advancing with 89,000 men in six columns, the North Koreans caught the South Korean Army by surprise, resulting in a disastrous rout for the South Koreans who were disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared for war. Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the South Koreans who <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> just 38,000 men to the front-line to oppose them. The majority of the South Korean forces retreated {{in the face of}} the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the capital Seoul, and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw further southwards.|$|E
5|$|The 'congress' {{met again}} {{in the spring of}} 480BC. A Thessalian {{delegation}} suggested that the allies <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance. A force of 10,000 hoplites was dispatched under the command of the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles to the Vale of Tempe, which they believed the Persian army would have to pass through. However, once there, Alexander I of Macedon warned them that the vale could be bypassed by several other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelmingly large, and the Greeks retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.|$|E
5|$|The Allied 'congress' {{met again}} {{in the spring of}} 480 BC. A Thessalian {{delegation}} suggested that the allies <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance. A force of 10,000 Allies led by the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles was thus despatched to the pass. However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed by at least two other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming; the Allies therefore retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont. The abandonment of Tempe meant that all of Thessaly submitted to the Persians, as did many cities {{to the north of the}} pass of Thermopylae when it seemed help was not forthcoming.|$|E

50|$|The {{next week}} went ever worse for Washington, as quarterback Hohensee, Running back Craig James and wide {{receiver}} Reggie Smith all were injured. McQuilken <b>could</b> only <b>muster</b> 3 points of offense, while throwing two more interceptions.|$|R
50|$|Colchester were relegated {{back to the}} Fourth Division with Franklin {{having already}} been handed a year's {{contract}} extension mid-season. Average attendance hit an all-time low figure of 3,634 and the Supporter's Club <b>could</b> only <b>muster</b> 997 members.|$|R
5|$|The Belgian Army <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> 22 divisions, which {{contained}} 1,338 artillery pieces but just 10 AMC 35 tanks. However, the Belgian combat vehicles included 200 T-13 tank destroyers. These {{had an excellent}} 47mm antitank gun and a coaxial FN30 machine gun in a turret. The Belgians also possessed 42 T-15s. They were officially described as armoured cars but were actually fully tracked tanks with a 13.2mm turret machine gun. The standard Belgian anti-tank gun was the 47mm FRC, towed either by trucks or by fully tracked armoured Utilitie B-tractors. One report states that a round from a 47mm gun went straight through a Sd kfz 231 and penetrated the armour of the Panzer IV behind it. These Belgian guns were better than the 25mm and 37mm guns of respectively the French and the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The French {{response}} to the impending British invasion was to mobilise the island's 10,000 strong militia. Despite their large numbers, this force was untrained, poorly armed and poorly motivated. Decaen himself recognised {{that they would be}} unreliable in the face of attack by British regular soldiers. He also bolstered his forces by attempting to recruit volunteers from among the hundreds of prisoners of war held in the island's prisons (a principal cause of the food shortages on Isle de France). Over 500 volunteers agreed to join his army, the majority of them Irishmen promised French assistance in obtaining Irish independence from Britain. Altogether, Decaen <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> 1,300 regular soldiers to defend the capital, which he placed under the command of General Edmé-Martin Vandermaesen.|$|E
5|$|The German forces {{consisted}} of the 1st, 2nd and 10th Panzer Divisions. The 1st Panzer Division {{under the command of}} General-Major (Major General) Friedrich Kirchner, had on strength 52 Panzer IIs, 98 Panzer III, 58 Panzer IV, 40 Panzer 35(t) and eight SdKfz 265 Panzerbefehlswagens. The 2nd Panzer Division, under the command of Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Rudolf Veiel, had to hand 45 Panzer I, 115 Panzer II, 59 Panzer III and 32 Panzer IVs. It also had 16 SdKfz 265. The 10th Panzer Division, under the command of Generalleutnant Ferdinand Schaal, had 44 Panzer I, 113 Panzer II, 58 Panzer III, 32 Panzer IV and 18 SdKfz 265. In total Guderian <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> 60,000 men, 22,000 vehicles, 771 tanks and 141 artillery pieces. He could also call upon 1,470 aircraft.|$|E
6000|$|... "To that, and to {{the fact}} that, I believe, we <b>could</b> not <b>muster</b> {{as much as a}} pocket-pistol to defend {{ourselves}} with, everything in the shape of fire-arms having been sent with the party in the boats." ...|$|R
50|$|By contrast, the Pittsburgh Penguins {{finished}} fifth, led {{by former}} Ranger star Andy Bathgate. Behind an elderly roster—nine of their top ten scorers and both of their goaltenders were over thirty—they <b>could</b> neither <b>muster</b> much offense nor defense.|$|R
50|$|Lacking local {{industry}} {{understanding and}} acceptance of the new initiative, the publication <b>could</b> not <b>muster</b> enough support to sustain the publication. Moreover, the host service provider went bust, practically erasing the young website from the web around 1997.|$|R
5|$|With the Cumans' {{departure}} Béla {{lost his}} most valuable allies. He <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> {{an army of}} less than 60,000 against the invaders. The royal army was ill-prepared and its commandersthe barons alienated by Béla's policy"would have liked the king to be defeated {{so that they would}} then be dearer to him", according to Roger of Torre Maggiore's account. The Hungarian army was virtually annihilated in the Battle of Mohi on the Sajó River on 11 April 1241. A great number of Hungarian lords, prelates and noblemen were killed, and Béla himself narrowly escaped from the battlefield. He fled through Nyitra to Pressburg (Nitra and Bratislava in Slovakia). The triumphant Mongols occupied and ravaged most lands to the east of the Danube River by the end of June.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in Eastern Europe {{began with}} the first Austro-Hungarian {{invasion}} of Serbia in early August 1914, {{under the command of}} Oskar Potiorek. The number of Austro-Hungarian troops assigned to the invasion was far smaller than the 308,000-strong force intended when war was declared. This was because {{a large portion of the}} Austro-Hungarian 2nd Army had moved to the Russian Front, reducing the number of troops involved in the initial stages of the invasion to approximately 200,000. On the other hand, the Serbs <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> some 450,000 men to oppose the Austro-Hungarians upon full mobilization. The main elements to face the Austro-Hungarians were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Užice armies, with a combined strength of approximately 180,000 men. The Serbian Army was commanded by Crown Prince Alexander, with the chief of the Serbian general staff, Radomir Putnik, who had commanded Serb forces in the Balkan Wars, as his deputy and de facto military leader. Petar Bojović, Stepa Stepanović, Pavle Jurišić Šturm and Miloš Božanović commanded the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Užice armies, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Men {{continued}} {{to arrive in}} the brigade area, and by 16:00 the 4th Battalion <b>could</b> <b>muster</b> over two companies while the 6th (Welch) Battalion had over 300 men. Patrols were sent out to ambush German convoys retreating from Le Muy and to reconnoitre the town. At 18:00 the brigade anti-tank battery arrived by glider with two American battalions and other supporting units. Patrolling continued over the night of 15/16 August, and Le Muy was captured by an American battalion at 15:30. At the same time 115 men of the 5th (Scottish) Battalion arrived in the brigade area. On the morning of 18 August units of the American 36th Infantry Division, advancing from the coast, reached Le Muy. The 2nd Brigade then moved to the Frejus area, on 20 August; Cannes was liberated on 25 August. The next day the brigade sailed for Naples arriving on 28 August.|$|E

60|$|Osborne {{was quite}} savage. The little governess patronised him and persiffled him until this young British Lion felt quite uneasy; nor <b>could</b> he <b>muster</b> {{sufficient}} {{presence of mind}} to find a pretext for backing out of this most delectable conversation.|$|R
50|$|Initially Garibaldi <b>could</b> only <b>muster</b> 4 battalions, {{but in the}} end {{managed to}} obtain some 38,000 men, which were to face the roughly 15,000 Austrian regulars under general baron Franz von Kuhn. The Austrians were {{supported}} by their fleet on Lake Garda.|$|R
