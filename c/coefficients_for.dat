25|$|Reactions in {{chemical}} processes are either unimolecular or bimolecular. The rate of a unimolecular reaction is an average over a vast ensemble {{of the rate}} <b>coefficients</b> <b>for</b> the microscopic events of collisional energy transfer and of reaction of a completely isolated molecule. Gilbert's {{work in the field}} of unimolecular processes started with the development of theorems for this relationship. These theorems are elegant developments in matrix algebra, proving relations that had been previously known only for particular cases. His theorems also became the basis for numerical methods that he developed to perform the requisite calculations. For this purpose, he created a computer code, UNIMOL, which is widely used by researchers.|$|E

For the propagation reaction, Gilbert led an international team that produced a methodology that overcame the long-standing problem of obtaining reliable rate <b>coefficients</b> <b>for</b> this process. He showed that the Arrhenius parameters for different types of monomer take different classes of values, and developed qualitative and quantitative understanding of these classes from fundamental transition-state theory and quantum mechanics. These new methods were based on those that he had developed in his work on unimolecular gas-phase processes. For the termination reaction, his data and models led to the qualitative and quantitative understanding of this process as diffusion-controlled.|$|E
25|$|In any {{discretised}} wavelet transform, {{there are}} only a finite number of wavelet <b>coefficients</b> <b>for</b> each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a multiresolution analysis. This means that there has to exist an auxiliary function, the father wavelet φ in L2(R), and that a is an integer. A typical choice is a = 2 and b = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the Daubechies 4-tap wavelet. Note that not every orthonormal discrete wavelet basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe wavelet admits no multiresolution analysis.|$|E

Skew <b>coefficient</b> <b>for</b> stress of skewly supported three-span continuous box girder is introduced {{to reflect the}} decrease degree of the normal stresses at the {{cross section of the}} middle span of the box girder. The finite element models of the skewly supported three-span continuous box girders with different skew angles are established by applying the SHELL 63 shell element in software ANSYS. The variation of the skew <b>coefficient</b> <b>for</b> stress at different calculation points of middle span cross section under concentrated load is analyzed and the corresponding influence law is revealed. Research results show that the skew <b>coefficient</b> <b>for</b> stress of top slab is different from that of bottom slab at the cross section of the skewly supported three-span continuous box girder. The skew <b>coefficient</b> <b>for</b> stress of top slab is smaller than that of bottom slab. Skew <b>coefficient</b> <b>for</b> stress decreases with the increasing of the skew angle. Because of the shear lag effect, the minimal skew <b>coefficient</b> <b>for</b> stress of flanges occurs at the free tip of cantilever slab while the maximal skew coefficient occurs at the intersection of web and flange slabs...|$|R

25|$|Gilbert's {{mathematical}} {{treatments and}} experimental techniques revealed the fundamentals controlling these steps by enabling {{each of the}} processes to be effectively studied in isolation. His advances allowed rate coefficients to be measured for virtually any process in emulsion polymerisation, values of these rate <b>coefficients</b> <b>for</b> simple systems to be predicted, and the reliability of new measurements to be checked from theory. He used data from applying these methods to obtain the dependence of rate coefficients on controllable quantities, such as initiator concentration. Thus, he tested existing models, developed new tests—some of which refuted extant models—and refined the older models that withstood his tests. At last, {{it was possible to}} achieve consistency between supposed microscopic events and experiment, and, {{for the very first time}} in the field, to refute postulated models authoritatively.|$|E
25|$|Irrevocability principle: The fusion {{approach}} assumes that, once developed, fusion {{will remain}} largely stable over time. This stability persists even in varying situations. Identity fusion theory proposes {{that this is}} due to the strong emotions, beliefs, and intra-relationships experienced by the strongly fused individuals. That is, although the overall fusion of a group of persons may shift in response to powerful situational forces, the rank orderings of individuals within the group will remain stable. Researchers have tested the “once fused, always fused” hypothesis by comparing the temporal stability of fusion-with-country scores for highly fused individuals with those of moderately or weakly fused individuals. The stability <b>coefficients</b> <b>for</b> highly fused participants were significantly higher than the coefficients associated with weakly or moderately fused participants. Even when ostracized strongly fused individuals will go to serious lengths to reaffirm their steadfastness to the group.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that this}} {{principle}} only holds strictly for light reflected at normal incidence. For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at grazing incidence (an angle beyond the Brewster angle) will still emerge as right handed, but elliptically, polarized. Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may {{be solved by}} decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, commonly denoted p and s respectively. The reflected components in the p and s linear polarizations are found by applying the Fresnel coefficients of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, {{where there is no}} distinction between p and s, are the Fresnel <b>coefficients</b> <b>for</b> the two components identical, leading to the above property.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} clear that the quantum {{mechanical}} formulation of the Franck–Condon principle {{is the result of}} a series of approximations, principally the electrical dipole transition assumption and the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Weaker magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole electronic transitions along with the incomplete validity of the factorization of the total wavefunction into nuclear, electronic spatial and spin wavefunctions means that the selection rules, including the Franck-Condon factor, are not strictly observed. For any given transition, the value of P is determined by all of the selection rules, however spin selection is the largest contributor, followed by electronic selection rules. The Franck-Condon factor only weakly modulates the intensity of transitions, i.e., it contributes with a factor on the order of 1 to the intensity of bands whose order of magnitude is determined by the other selection rules. The table below gives the range of extinction <b>coefficients</b> <b>for</b> the possible combinations of allowed and forbidden spin and orbital selection rules.|$|E
25|$|Finally, upon {{termination}} of the algorithm, the result needs to be read off. In {{the case of a}} classical computer, we sample from the probability distribution on the three-bit register to obtain one definite three-bit string, say 000. Quantum mechanically, one measures the three-qubit state, which is equivalent to collapsing the quantum state down to a classical distribution (with the coefficients in the classical state being the squared magnitudes of the <b>coefficients</b> <b>for</b> the quantum state, as described above), followed by sampling from that distribution. This destroys the original quantum state. Many algorithms will only give the correct answer with a certain probability. However, by repeatedly initializing, running and measuring the quantum computer's results, the probability of getting the correct answer can be increased. In contrast, counterfactual quantum computation allows the correct answer to be inferred when the quantum computer is not actually running in a technical sense, though earlier initialization and frequent measurements are part of the counterfactual computation protocol.|$|E
