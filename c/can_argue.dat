5|$|Evolutionary theory <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> {{against the}} {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

One <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> that Euclid's axioms were arrived upon in this manner. In particular, it is thought that Euclid felt the parallel postulate was forced upon him, as indicated by his reluctance to make use of it, and his arrival upon it by the method of contradiction.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} that followed, the Parliament of Scotland {{declared}} the extensive Douglas lands forfeit and permanently annexed them to the crown, {{along with many other}} lands, finances and castles. The Earl fled into a long English exile. James finally had the freedom to govern as he wished, and one <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> that his successors as Kings of Scots never faced such a powerful challenge to their authority again. Along with the forfeiture of the Albany Stewarts in the reign of James I, the destruction of the Black Douglases saw royal power in Scotland take a major step forward.|$|E

25|$|Status Planning {{suggests}} that a particular language or variety may be chosen for specific purposes and given official status. This {{may result in a}} language policy which is a product of language planning, and can be comprehended within the discourse of language politics and society, or the more informal but powerful political and social aspects of language planning. In this view, one <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> that language status planning issues are related to political issues as status planning focuses on legislative decisions that affect the reallocation of language functions. Language status can also mean the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.|$|E
25|$|Appeals to {{simplicity}} {{were used}} to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, ball lightning, continental drift, and reverse transcriptase. One <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the atomic theory was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles {{that had not been}} directly detected. Ernst Mach and the logical positivists rejected John Dalton's atomic theory until the reality of atoms was more evident in Brownian motion, as shown by Albert Einstein.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, a report by the Australian Communications and Media Authority was {{compiled}} {{a few days after the}} incident. The report concluded that loopholes in broadcasting rules should be closed, and Internet content regulations tightened. It was found that Big Brother itself could not be penalised as the footage was never broadcast by Network Ten but was seen only via web streaming, and the Internet falls outside ACMA's authority. Websites running the footage would not be penalised under other regulations governing web broadcasts as they had removed the footage when requested. Rival network current affairs programs A Current Affair on the Nine Network, and the Seven Network's Today Tonight, both broadcast the footage in full. Neither show faced a reprimand from ACMA as they <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> the footage was used as part of a news story. Presenting the ACMA report, Communications Minister Helen Coonan said that legislation to broaden the authority's regulatory powers to cover the Internet and mobile phone broadcasts, would be introduced into Parliament as soon as possible.|$|E

The series is presented without explanation or narration as a showcase of surreal footage arranged around a single loose theme (expressed in the episode title) and blended without pause {{into a single}} continuous presentation. The show follows a strange format of euphoric images that transform into something dark, then into calm. Many audience members claim it caters to the [...] "trip-head" [...] community, offering LSD/DMT ready images.

Richards commented that the most [...] "disappointing" [...] thing about the song was that [...] "there were too few voices from the country, rock and Latin music communities." [...] He also noted that [...] "nobody <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> with its worthy cause" [...] because of the song's proceeds to relief in Haiti, but remarked that the song did not have [...] "We Are the World"'s [...] "original thrill" [...] due to the song's [...] "panoply of voices". [...] Jon Pareles, a writer for The New York Times, remarked that while the song's [...] "Hollywood gloss" [...] was [...] "durable", the song has [...] "all the pitfalls of a Hollywood remake". Parales commented {{that the quality of}} the song and performance [...] "rises or falls on its talent pool" [...] and criticized the choice of male musicians compared to [...] "We Are the World"'s original male artists.|$|E

[...] Adam's kidnapping of Faith is revealed; Sharon remains in love with him, to the chagrin of her family and friends.

After trying to get Adam acquitted for Skye's (his ex-wife's) murder, Sharon is jailed. Case liked [...] "Shadam", noting that the relationship [...] "took us all by surprise...that is what I was referring to with this storyline because of the pace and the vitality that 'Shadam' has."

Barrichello said [...] "It is the most dangerous thing that I have been through", and [...] "There is not a rule for that, but between ourselves we should take a line, stick to it and that's it." [...] Schumacher said that [...] "Obviously there was space enough to go through. We didn't touch, so I guess I just left enough space for him to come through." [...] Ross Brawn said [...] "at {{the end of the}} day he gave him enough space. You <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> that it was marginal, but it was just tough – tough racing." [...] A range of ex-drivers and commentators were highly critical of Schumacher. Although there was no accident, the race steward, the same Derek Warwick of the 1991 Nürburgring incident, wanted to black flag Schumacher since that [...] "would have shown a better example to our young drivers". The Hungaroring incident was ruled to be dangerous and Schumacher received a 10 place grid penalty for the next race. Schumacher accepted the decision, and apologised.|$|E
500|$|Adam {{has been}} {{involved}} with his brother's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case)a relationship which SoapNet described as [...] "dark". Adam stole Sharon's newborn baby, Faith, and gave her to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson)whom he caused to have a miscarriage and a phantom pregnancy. Despite knowing this and seeing Sharon grieve, Adam bonded with her out of guilt; however, they fell in love and married. Muhney told SoapNet that Adam [...] "unequivocally loves her 100%", and [...] said, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> as much logic as you want about what Adam has done and what he is doing."

Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described Adam and Sharon's relationship as [...] "inappropriate" [...] yet [...] "red-hot". Several of Sharon's friends, including her ex-husband Jack, disowned her because of the relationship. After Sharon's conviction for the murder of Adam's ex-wife Skye, she escaped after being sentenced to life imprisonment. During this storyline, Case still supported the coupledubbed [...] "Shadam" [...] by viewerssaying that the pairing [...] "took us all by surprise".
