5|$|On September 10, 2015, Miyamoto {{confirmed}} a fan theory {{stating that}} the entirety of Super Mario Bros. 3 takes place as a stage play. The game opens with curtains being pulled, featuring obstacles hanging from the <b>catwalk,</b> objects bolted to the background, and shadows on the skyline. When Mario finishes a level, he walks off the stage.|$|E
5|$|Dot {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics; {{she has been}} referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by Alistair McGowan, and has been credited as inspiration for <b>catwalk</b> collections.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously tested in a laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a <b>catwalk</b> is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were ever needed. As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, <b>catwalks</b> {{are located}} in {{positions}} hidden from audience view or directly above an audience, and are considered [...] "behind-the-scenes". For example, many proscenium theaters {{have a series of}} two or more <b>catwalks</b> running parallel to the proscenium arch above a false ceiling. Stairs or a ladder up to the <b>catwalks</b> is usually located somewhere backstage. In modern theatres, many architects design <b>catwalks</b> into the [...] "look" [...] of the theatre. In black box theatres, <b>catwalks</b> and pipe grids may be the only architectural feature.|$|R
25|$|In mid-June 2011, {{preparations}} for the spinning of the main cable began by installing the temporary <b>catwalks</b> on the SAS span. Both western <b>catwalks</b> were installed and by mid-August, all four <b>catwalks</b> were installed in place and an approximation of the completed outline of the bridge could then be seen. All four <b>catwalks,</b> the traveler, its suspension cable and the drafting cables and the winches and specialized tracks at the deviation saddles {{had to be in}} place before strand dragging could begin. These <b>catwalks</b> were required for worker's access to the cable strands for bundling and arrangement as the individual wires are placed.|$|R
25|$|Temporary {{suspended}} walkways, called <b>catwalks,</b> {{are then}} erected using {{a set of}} guide wires hoisted into place via winches positioned atop the towers. These <b>catwalks</b> follow the curve set by bridge designers for the main cables, in a path mathematically described as a catenary arc. Typical <b>catwalks</b> are usually between eight and ten feet wide, and are constructed using wire grate and wood slats.|$|R
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of Minogue in a white room {{dressed in a black}} swimsuit. She is then shown lying on top of a white {{platform}} with a python wrapped around her body. Scenes of Minogue and her three dancers walking a <b>catwalk,</b> posing for photographs and dancing are intercut throughout the music video. The video concludes with Minogue trapped inside a spinning perspex box.|$|E
5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts {{to cash in on}} the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the <b>catwalk</b> in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 1935, the {{building}} shifted to within 2.5 {{feet from the}} edge of the cliff following a landslide caused by a severe storm. The warden at the time, James A. Johnston, proposed extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim to dislike {{the building}} because it was irregularly shaped. A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed by the end of 1935. A guard tower and a <b>catwalk</b> from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades of exposure to the salt air and wind, and neither the guard tower on top of the building nor the Hill Tower still exist.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} cited criticisms about the stadium are the four <b>catwalks</b> that {{hang from the}} ceiling. The <b>catwalks</b> {{are part of the}} dome's support structure. The stadium was built with {{cable-stayed}} technology {{similar to that of the}} defunct Georgia Dome. It also supports the lighting and speaker systems. Because the dome is tilted toward the outfield, the <b>catwalks</b> are lower in the outfield.|$|R

50|$|<b>Catwalks</b> {{are used}} to suspend {{lighting}} instruments and microphones directed at the stage. The <b>catwalks</b> provide easy access for theater personnel to perform common tasks. For example lights {{may need to be}} accessed for maintenance, position adjustment, or addition and removal of gels and gobos.|$|R
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow <b>catwalk</b> on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{reputation}} of tailoring on Savile Row is for made-to-measure suits, ready-to-wear clothes were introduced by Gieves & Hawkes, a company formed in 1974 by the merger of two separate businesses who both date from the late 19th century: Gieves, a Royal Navy tailor founded in Portsmouth; and Hawkes, a London-based cap-maker and tailor to the British Army. Hardy Amies Ltd further broadened the scope and appeal of tailoring in Savile Row: in 1961, he staged the first men's ready-to-wear <b>catwalk</b> shows, at the Ritz Hotel in London, he designed costumes for the 1966 England World Cup team, and for the 1968 film , and dressed the Queen, designing the gown used for the Silver Jubilee portrait in 1977. Hardy Amies founded the company in 1946, converting the bombed out shell of No.14. Though Amies sold the business and retired in 2001, the company is still operating from No. 14, now {{under the control of}} Fung Capital.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks of}} filming were {{spent in the}} Hotel Earle, a set created by art {{director}} Dennis Gassner. The film's climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel's hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post-production. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternate set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at Long Beach. A series of gas jets were installed behind the hallway, and the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead <b>catwalk</b> opened each jet, giving {{the impression of a}} fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes. The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock.|$|E

5|$|Tickets {{were made}} {{available}} to members of Madonna's official fan club, Icon, and winners with details announced at Madonna.com and through concert promoter Telstra's promotional webpage. According to newspaper reports, the tickets were non-transferable, and had the person's name printed on them. However, {{all of them were}} in the general admission category at Forum Theatre, which holds a maximum capacity of 1,500. With the production design and addition of <b>catwalk,</b> the space allocated became smaller than that. Prior to the show The Sydney Morning Herald reported that fans started queuing {{up in front of the}} venue, while Madonna rehearsed inside, as well as at Hisense Arena. Images and songs rehearsed were leaked to fan website Drownedmadonna.com, along with Madonna's manager Guy Oseary uploading pictures on Instagram. Madonna made several references to clowns on her own Instagram account, including uploading a short video of her riding a small tricycle. The show was confirmed to be recorded and released along with the DVD for the Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E
5|$|Everest {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of the bespoke casual movement which, as the name suggests, provides individually tailored casual clothing of Savile Row quality, including: casual shirts; smart-casual jackets; T-shirts; and jeans. In collaboration with Levi's in 2004, he designed a tailored-denim suit, sold in Japanese retailer Oki-Ni's stores. Expanding the bespoke casual concept, he offered a bespoke denim tailoring service dressing celebrities from sports, Hollywood and rock music, such as David Beckham, Kevin Bacon and Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs. Everest designed a suit collection in 2004/05 in collaboration with Rocawear, the fashion clothing company founded by American hip hop artists Damon Dash and Jay-Z. The advertising campaign was fronted by Dash's friends Kevin Bacon and Naomi Campbell. He teamed up with British casual and sportswear designer Kim Jones during 2005 and 2006. The collaboration produced tailoring collections for four seasons that were shown on the <b>catwalk</b> at Paris fashion week. For his next collaboration, in 2006 Everest showed a limited collection of menswear with New York hair salon Bumble and bumble, including a fully bespoke denim line, which retailed at around US$1,000. Marketed as a 'destination location', the retail space on the store's 8th floor, in the fashionable Meatpacking District of Manhattan, also featured a barbershop, a café and a teahouse. In autumn 2007, the Timothy Everest ready-to-wear collection was available in shops for the first time, including Flannels, Liberty and John Lewis. The range included suits, shirts and trousers. He was costume designer for the 2008 film Mamma Mia!, dressing its stars, including Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth. He opened a West End store in 2008, at Bruton Street, Mayfair, off Bond Street; less than five minutes walk from Savile Row. He has been a creative contributor and Sartorial Advisor to men's magazine The Rake since 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Stord Bridge was undertaken {{as part of the}} same contract as the Bømla Bridge, which was awarded in December 1998 to Triangle Contractors, a joint venture between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Most of the work was carried out by NCC with HBG having responsibility for the steel parts of the deck and the cables. HBG had previously built the steel for the Osterøy Bridge, which opened in 1997. The responsibility for the cables was given to Brown Beach Associates and Hordaland Mekaniske Verksted. Construction started on 20 February 1999. After the pylons were completed on 25 September 1999, two <b>catwalks</b> were erected between them, with the constructors choosing two continuous <b>catwalks</b> instead of three separate pairs. Extra stability to the <b>catwalks</b> was achieved by building connections between the two.|$|R
