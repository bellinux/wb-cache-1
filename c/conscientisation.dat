RDRS was established in 1972 following the War of Liberation, after assisting refugees in camps {{across the border in}} India. RDRS returned to help rehabilitate the disadvantaged northwest region of Rangpur-Dinajpur, providing relief, running health services, providing education, developing agriculture and roads, and also starting <b>conscientisation</b> applying the Frierian approach. It is the field program of the Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation. RDRS became a fully Bangladeshi NGO in 1997 with a national Board of Trustees and Executive Director. RDRS is still a major development actor across the northwest working with around 2 million landless and marginal farmers, indigenous minorities, vulnerable communities such as the river islands and 360 Federations, i.e. community-based organisations. The RDRS Rangpur Guesthouse based on the RDRS Complex is the leading hotel in town.|$|E
40|$|Many {{community}} development programmes are initiated without taking the community {{members and their}} needs into consideration. The question arose as to whether, by implementing Paolo Freire's theory concerning the process of <b>conscientisation,</b> sustainable {{community development}} could be successfully accomplished in Ivory Park, a developing community in Midrand. The <b>conscientisation</b> process has four components: desocialization, critical thinking, power awareness and self-organization. The participants were guided {{to become involved in}} making use of introspection, by means of which they started to find solutions to their problems. The object of this introspection was to impact their decision-making abilities and their sense of self-worth, thus empowering them {{to reach out to the}} community in an effort to combine resources in initiating community development programmes. The researcher made use of a participatory research approach during this study, in which concrete and abstract goals were identified. The concrete goals were achieved through the community development process by the participants themselves, whereas the abstract goals were realized through the process of <b>conscientisation.</b> These two processes are closely linked together. The data were collected by means of a tape-recorder during weekly discussions, and then transcribed to enable the researcher to describe the process of community development that took place. Using Miles and Huberman's (1994) data analysis techniques, the transcribed data were analysed according to the four categories from the process of <b>conscientisation,</b> i. e. desocialization, critical thinking, power awareness and self-organization. Interpretations could then be made and a conclusion drawn as to whether, by awakening a critical consciousness, sustainable community development could be initiated. In conclusion: community development programmes can be sustainable only if they have been initiated by the community itself by the implementation of Paolo Freire's process of <b>conscientisation.</b> Key words: process of <b>conscientisation,</b> desocialization, critical thinking, power awareness, self-organization, introspection, Paolo Freire, sustainable community development, participatory research, active participation.

40|$|This paper {{draws upon}} the {{capability}} approach and critical pedagogy to analyse {{the value of}} using Problem-posing Education, a participatory action research method, in a digital inclusion initiative in Brazil. First it the capability approach and explains why using critical pedagogy is a valuable {{way to deal with}} issues of power, collective <b>conscientisation</b> and adaptive preference. Freire's pedagogy is then presented and <b>conscientisation</b> is explained as a process of raising critical awareness and praxis. The case study, presents empirical work conducted in Campinas, together with a NGO named CDI, which offers free internet access and basic ICT skills using a Freire's inspired methodology. Findings are then explained and discussed using the theoretical framework. This paper concludes that there is great value in using Freire's critical pedagogy for digital inclusion, but that further research is necessary to identify less resource intense solutions that can provide students with both <b>conscientisation</b> and skills...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} Hermann Hesse’s novel, The Glass Bead Game, in {{the light}} of Paulo Freire’s educational philosophy. The Glass Bead Game is set in Castalia, a “pedagogical province” of the 23 rd century. It is argued that the central character in the book, Joseph Knecht, undergoes a complex process of <b>conscientisation.</b> Knecht develops an increasingly critical understanding of Castalian society, questioning some of its most cherished assumptions while nonetheless deepening his appreciation of the beauty of the Glass Bead Game. He becomes less certain of his certainties as he grows older, and eventually decides to give away his prestigious post as Magister Ludi (Master of the Glass Bead Game) to pursue a quiet life as a tutor. Dialogue {{plays a key role in}} the development of Knecht’s critical consciousness. Freirean theory is seen to provide a robust framework for the analysis of key themes in Hesse’s text. At the same time, The Glass Bead Game is helpful in demonstrating the meaning and significance of <b>conscientisation</b> and dialogue for educational lives...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{digital inclusion}} programmes in Brazil through the combined theoretical {{lens of the}} Capability Approach (CA) to development and Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Findings suggest that a process of <b>conscientisation</b> is needed for individuals to fully {{take control of their}} appropriation of the technologies. Appropriation is understood as individuals being able to use ICT as tools to achieve what they value and have reason to value. Through interviews, focus groups, observation, participatory methods and action research, the research examined two separate digital inclusion initiatives in Campinas, Brazil. The courses were offered free of charge, one by a public body and one by an NGO, and targeted disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. The thesis contributes to the growing literature of operationalising the CA in the field of Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT 4 D). It integrates Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed into the CA, as a way to address some of the critiques this approach has received, and to strengthen concepts related to power and distinct mechanisms for social change. Further, the thesis offers a key contribution by developing concrete methods to implement the CA in a participatory manner with organisations in the field. Further developing Kleine’s Choice Framework, an operationalisation of the CA, it proposes a visualisation tool to reflect changes in the portfolio of resources {{over the course of a}} digital inclusion programme. This tool can be used in monitoring, evaluation and reporting, as well as within the <b>conscientisation</b> dialogue between teachers and students. Empirically, the in-depth research shows that the process of <b>conscientisation</b> is time-consuming and resource-intensive, but effective in supporting learner-led appropriation of the technology, in line with the lives the learners themselves have reason to value...|$|E

40|$|Social attitudes can be {{problematic}} {{for mental health}} service user’s (MHSU’s) in everyday settings, medical encounters, at work, and within social networks. The present research ‘The Artivism Intervention’ aimed to generate a proactive intervention {{to raise awareness of}} mental illness by producing artwork of MHSU’s experiences to exhibit to the general public. This thesis aims to understand two questions (1) can art be used to conscientise (raise consciousness) amongst artists (MHSUs) and audience (the general public), and (2) are discussions about artwork an effective intervention to raise awareness of mental health stigma and suggest possible solutions? Artivism is a proaction strategy using art as a tool to raise public awareness of Disability and Mental Health Service Users experiences. A mixed methodological approach using a qualitative Thematic Analysis was utilised to examine MHSU’s experiences in studies one (chapter four). The Workshops (study one) were undertaken at Reachout: With Arts in Mind a mental health and arts charity. An exhibition (study two) exhibited MHSU’s artwork (produced by study one), at The University of Stirling Central Library. Questionnaires (study 2 A) and group interviews (study 2 B) were employed to gauge public views after viewing the exhibition. A quantitative analysis provided numerical findings in study 2 A (the questionnaires) and a Thematic Analysis was employed in study 2 B (the group interviews). The findings show that new knowledge and <b>conscientisation</b> was produced. However, there was limited evidence of <b>conscientisation</b> in practice, during the art workshop process. Overall, the present research found that ‘The Artivism Intervention’ has the potential to generate positive change and raise awareness of mental illness and disability. The intervention could be incorporated into integrated care pathways providing a supportive role to aid patient recovery in their local communities after hospital discharge...|$|E
40|$|The {{author of}} this paper {{considers}} the influence of Paulo Freire’s pedagogical philosophy on educational practice in three different geographical/political settings. She begins with reflections on her experience as a facilitator at Freire’s seminar, held in Grenada in 1980 for teachers and community educators, on the integration of work and study. This case demonstrates how Freire’s method of dialogic education achieved outcomes for the group of thoughtful collaboration leading to <b>conscientisation</b> in terms of deep reflection on their lives as teachers in Grenada and strategies for decolonising education and society. The second case under consideration is the arts-based pedagogy shaping {{the work of the}} Area Youth Foundation (AYF) in Kingston, Jamaica. Young participants, many of them from tough socio-economic backgrounds, are empowered by learning how to articulate their own experiences and relate these to social change. They express this <b>conscientisation</b> by creating stage performances, murals, photo-novella booklets and other artistic products. The third case study describes and evaluates the Honey Ant Reader project in Alice Springs, Australia. Aboriginal children, as well as the adults in their community, learn to read in their local language as well as Australian Standard English, using booklets created from indigenous stories told by community Elders, featuring local customs and traditions. The author analyses how the “Freirean” pedagogy in all three cases exemplifies the process of encouraging the creation of knowledge for progressive social change, rather than teaching preconceived knowledge. This supports her discussion {{of the extent to which}} this is authentic to the spirit of the scholar/teacher Paulo Freire, who maintained that in our search for a better society, the world has to be made and remade. Her second, related aim is to raise questions about how education aligned with Freirean pedagogy can contribute to moving social change from the culture circle to the public sphere...|$|E

Dialogue plays a pivotal {{role in the development of}} Knecht's critical awakening and his understanding of himself and his vocation as a human being.

An extensive review of literature spanning from Freire’s original writings to application of his teachings was done. Besides adult education, Freire’s model has been used in community organisation, health education, alcohol and substance abuse prevention, development work in agrarian cultures, and coalition building. The effectiveness of this model has generally been measured qualitatively. In order to quantitatively transcribe this model, five distinct constructs comprising of dialogue, <b>conscientisation,</b> praxis, transformation, and critical consciousness were identified. Specific directions for quantitative applications for developing and evaluating community-based rehabilitation programmes using these constructs are presented. The model of Freire offers lot of potential in developing and evaluating community-based rehabilitation programmes...|$|E

This paper will analyse CODGO's ability to achieve its aims through using Yip's four levels of reflective practice (0 = absence of reflectivity, 1 = basic practical reflectivity, 2 = reflectivity in action, and 3 = critical practical reflectivity - perception transformation) and four categories of interlocking factors: philosophical/ideological, politico-economic, sociocultural and practical/pragmatic. A tool based on the four categories of factors is also discussed as a means of making explicit and mitigating against some of the potential difficulties surrounding CODGO's approach...|$|E

The {{thesis is}} an {{exploratory}} and primarily empirical {{study with the}} objective to construct a detailed chronology {{of the events of}} the 1985 school crisis particularly in African schools in the Western Cape and to reflect on the relationship between the school crisis and the organic crisis in South Africa and the Western Cape in particular. The data for the thesis were derived from primary and secondary documentary sources and in-depth interview material. A total of 51 interviewees were selected principally {{on the basis of the}} specific role they played particularly within the Department of Education and Training institutions as well as in community, political, workers', parents', teachers' and student organisations during the 1985 school crisis in the Western cape. Interviews were open-ended with a semi-structured interview schedule which consisted of topical headings. The thesis's theoretical framework was informed by Gramsci's Marxism am the key concepts employed in the analysis included Gramsci's notions of hegemony and organic crisis as well as Freire's concept of <b>conscientisation.</b> Utilising Gramsci's Marxism, the historical transformations in economic, political and ideological spheres which affected the development of student struggles and the crisis in the Department of Education and Training schools in 1985 were examined. Chapter 1 deals with. the 'Total strategy' as a form of state "formative action" to overcome the general crisis. It also documents in chronological order the main events of the school boycotts and both political and economic struggles on a national level from 1953 to 1984 and early 1985 in order to provide a sound background for the 1985 school crisis in the Western Cape. Chapter 2 which is offered as an empirical contribution to sociology of education covers a series of complex events and processes which constituted the core of the 1985 school crisis in the Western Cape in a chronological order. In the conclusion, Gramsci's concepts of 'hegemony' and 'organic crisis' supplemented by Freire's notion of <b>conscientisation</b> were directly utilised to analyse the slogan 'People's education for people's power'. One crucial observation explicit in the thesis am expressed through verbatim interview extracts was that the school crisis could only be resolved when the apartheid capitalist system in its entirety has been abolished...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates and {{reflects}} on the methodologies employed, results achieved and questions raised in two recent transformative educational interventions. Both interventions fall under the broader Emerging Arts Activist Programme created by artist and educator Farieda Nazier. Chewing the Cud, the first workshop, {{was held at the}} Apartheid Museum in 2013 and facilitated by Nazier; the Angry Youth Workshop was subsequently held with students of the New Nation School in Fietas, 2014, led by Mocke J van Veuren with mentoring by Nazier and Cedric Nunn. The authors compare the ways in which transformative processes and methods developed in their own critical arts practice has influenced the design and delivery of the youthoriented arts interventions mentioned above. Processes of <b>conscientisation,</b> decolonisation, and the exercise of agency are explored through arts practices that address the interface between historicity, the everyday and personal experience as a field of critical discourse. Through the analysis of creative outputs and student feedback, and reflection on methodology, this paper forms part of an on-going project, which aims to develop and test youth-focused critical pedagogies specifically focused on dealing with the aftermath of Apartheid...|$|E
40|$|Black {{theology}} and apartheid theology are theologies {{making use of}} an epitheton. The use to which the epitheton is put in these theologies is of crucial importance, that is, they are couplet theologies being used in a subjective genitive fashion. The {{question is whether the}} couplet becomes a theology of/concerning the epitheton or is it used in an objective genitive fashion. When the epitheton is used in the objective genitive sense it of necessity has to generate an epistemological break in order to distinguish it from orthodox theology. This in turn necessitates a <b>conscientisation</b> of a contextually predicated theology The theology becomes reductive. In this way an epitheton theology forming part of a couplet becomes attenuated and diverges from orthodox theology in the construction of its theology. This can lead to the espousal of heretical teachings. Conclusion: The conclusion arrived at is the objective genitive sense, that an epitheton theology, in for the purpose of advancing a particular secular base or pseudo-theological base for Christian society, once it has gained a life of its own, will lead to heresy unless erroneous or sinful teachings are confessed and repented of.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a gender {{analysis}} of literature on impacts of climate change. It uses feminist political ecology as a theoretical lens and the women empowerment framework as a tool of analysis. Paper reveals that inequitable distribution of rights, power and resources, and the repressive cultural gender roles and norms prohibit womenâ€™s full participation. Sustainable development can be realized if women empowerment is pivotal in developmental issues such as climate change. Women are not groomed to plan and make decisions concerning the interventions as these are imposed. They are brewed not to reflect on the strategies, thus failing to bring about women empowerment. Interventions used also focus on giving women increased access to practical gender needs such as education in the face of climate change. This paper argues that it is in addressing the strategic gender needs of women that empowerment can be realized. By focusing on practical gender needs of women, the strategies leave the structures of oppression and domination unchanged leading to their failure. The paper therefore calls for mitigation and adaptation strategies that ensure proactive empowerment of women. Potent empowerment strategies that focus on mobilization, <b>conscientisation,</b> participation and control must be invoked...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This article explores {{historical}} and current connections and dissonances between centre and periphery {{in the particular}} context of Anglican schools in New South Wales, Australia, and their contested relationship with Britain. There is increasing recognition of Australia as a multi-faith society linked {{to the growth of}} multiculturalism. In attempting to embrace this new multicultural and multi-faith reality Australian faith-based schools experience significant tensions with their historical traditions within a colonial, settler society. This dialectic is seen in the challenge to delineate a faith-based understanding of the transforming nature of their education and the transformed nature of the society they seek to serve, engaging in the critical self-consciousness and authentic praxis that are the hallmarks of <b>conscientisation.</b> The authors consider the public documentation of four Anglican schools as cases, and argue that there are no clear statements that locate the schools as proudly Australian, pursuing Australian values as they seek to transform Australian society, in the spirit of Freire’s prophetic church. The authors ask whether (1) the solid foundations for Anglican schools {{are to be found in}} the liberal traditions of the North and (2) whether there are new expressions of faith and educational philosophy appropriate to post-colonialist Australia which can form the basis of an authentic and transformative praxis...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on the philosophies and {{writings}} of Paulo Freire regarding education as activism, {{this paper will}} explore the history and activities of the Popular Education Network of Australia (PENA). The network, founded in 2009, involves educators, academics and community workers, working together on issues relating to critical pedagogy and social change in schools, communities and adult education contexts. Two symposia have been organised on critical education in Australia. In 2010, ‘Teaching and Learning for Social Justice and Action’ was the inaugural gathering. In 2012, ‘Freire Reloaded: Learning and Teaching to Change the World’ featured a diverse range of workshops and Professor Antonia Darder as keynote speaker and observer. Through the perspectives and experiences of five academics involved in PENA, this paper will explore the group’s activities and reflect on the inspiration drawn {{from the work of}} Freire, Darder and others. Creating spaces for discussion of critical pedagogy affords opportunities for academics, educators, teachers and activists to reflect on their practice and also leads to further spontaneous networking and planning of action. In this paper we argue that there is continuing importance, in fact urgency, in producing places and spaces for <b>conscientisation</b> to occur, and for examples of critical education to be shared amongst 21 st century educators...|$|E
40|$|M. A. Despite some {{improvement}} in the living standards of the world's population, poverty persists, and affects millions of people on a daily basis. The poverty issue has received extensive coverage over the past decade. Both development specialists and international donor organisations study this elusive phenomenon. The result is often impressive academic analysis and heated intellectual debates, whilst development orientated institutions {{go as far as}} trying to capture, analyse and measure the realities of the poor in various indexes and measurement methods. Despite this intensive search, albeit it academic, the situation for the poor remains the same. Through a consultation with the poor, {{in various parts of the}} world, the multi-dimensional nature of poverty was highlighted. The result is the inclusion of non-economic factors such as vulnerability, powerlessness and isolation in the problematique. Furthermore, the initial `urban focus' to poverty shifted to the rural areas, where poverty was felt more acutely. The rural poor - the 'forgotten people' were brought back onto the social development agenda. In South Africa, the alleviation of poverty has been a priority above other developmental issues. The government is committed to alleviating poverty through various policies and programmes, as stated in the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Academic studies, using methods of participatory research, revealed the importance of participation, as a precondition for development. Although no consensus exists on the definition of this concept, development specialists now agree on the importance of participation in poverty alleviation programmes. Participation is closely related to the concepts of <b>conscientisation</b> — 'becoming aware' and empowerment — 'taking of control'. The low level of economic development and growth that holds a community hostage can apparently be redirected by the two parallel ideas of awareness and empowerment. The combination of these elements is essential for the alleviation of poverty. The cycle of participation accentuates this basic theory. Participation is a prerequisite in all the components of the development process. It is only through participation that poverty can be alleviated on a sustainable basis. Participation is, therefore, the key to a better life for all. The above mentioned processes will assist the poor in changing their own reality towards a better life. The importance of the process of participation, incorporating the concepts of <b>conscientisation</b> and empowerment, is reiterated in development efforts in the community of Maboloka. Despite the continuous attack by poverty on the community of Maboloka, some progress has been made towards the alleviation of this poverty. This is mainly due to the levels of participation that exist in the community. Development efforts in this community, once again, showed that participation is the fundamental key in any poverty alleviation effort. As Fisher et al (1980 : 30) stated: "It can be said that the factor of participation is of decisive importance for the realisation of a directly poverty orientated approach"...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Across the world, a {{paradigm}} shift in educational research and reform is calling {{for the inclusion of}} the student voice to enhance the utility and relevance of curriculum within higher education, yet within nursing education this practice is not systemic. This project collected self-reported adverse workplace events from seven nursing students across a 3 -year undergraduate programme, explored the students’ perspectives on the lessons they learned and invited them to co-create curricula activities to prepare future nurses for workplace adversity. Methods: Critical social theory was the theoretical foundation of the study. Data were collected through a process of individual, guided interviews, using a critical incident questioning framework. Critical discourse analysis was used for analysis. Results: The two critical research processes—self-reflection and narrative reconstruction—used in the interviews elicited four key discourses in the data: <b>conscientisation,</b> liberation, agency and empowerment. Conclusions: Participants’ exposure to critical research methods raised their awareness of the complexities of professional socialisation in hostile workplace cultures. It appears that critically-reflective processes may increase nursing students’ capacity to notice, critique and respond constructively to adversity. A major insight from the data is that a poorly constructed curriculum exacerbated students’ experiences of adversity. The new insights into how critical research design gave voice to students in the co-construction of curricula activities may help undergraduate educators to implement critically-based strategies in “preparation for practice” learning modules...|$|E
40|$|India {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of volunteerism and charity. Movements for liberalisation, social reforms, welfare and development, and <b>conscientisation</b> per se have taken place in this country and continue to do so. The history of social organisation seems to have largely been influenced by a laissez-faire movement {{on the basis of the}} promulgation of the theory of minimisation of state intervention on the one hand, and dissemination of the concern of volunteerism on a more planned and organised way on the other. During the colonial period the voluntary movement witnessed the era of the Christian church, Gandhian philosophy and reformist approach. The early post-independence period was the era of religion-based and Gandhian voluntary organisations. An important feature during this period was that the state had provided financial support to NGOs. In the 1960 s and 1970 s NGOs had grown manifold. In the 1980 s NGOs occupied a prominent place in the development sector. Nonetheless, in recent years massive changes have been occurring. Indian experiences have revealed that there is a need for the critique of their own work and contributions. In the era of globalisa-tion, successful implementation of development programmes requires appropriate policy framework, formulation of suitable plan schemes, and effective delivery machinery. This has to be based on appropriate research studies to validate presence, position, challenges and relevance...|$|E
40|$|Indigenous students, {{particularly}} those from regional and remote areas, are under-represented in both {{higher education and}} vocational education in Australia. Enabling programs seek to address this under-representation. They offer pathways to higher education, are important in lifting participation rates and potentially encourage mobility between the sectors. However, strategic development of enabling programs is based on little evidence about student or staff experiences. This paper presents a qualitative research project underpinned by the strengths-based approach of <b>conscientisation,</b> exploring how Indigenous learning journeys via enabling programs can respect and grow cultural identity, while simultaneously developing study skills. The research considered interpretations of ‘success’ {{from the perspectives of}} students and teachers participating in enabling courses. The research found enabling programs were an ‘important’ and ‘exciting journey’ for students that brought about transformation of the inner Self through the building of ‘resilience’, ‘strength’, ‘confidence’, ‘self-esteem’, ‘self-worth’, ‘cultural understanding’ and ‘identity’. Success was experienced across multiple dimensions of students’ lived experience including ‘cultural identity’, ‘voice’, self-realisation, self-acceptance and ‘pride’. Staff suggested that enabling programs imparted an ‘underlying layer’ of skills. Recognition of Indigenous people as ‘yarners’ and ‘story tellers’, along with ways of incorporating ‘both-ways’ methodologies, need to be considered when developing the curriculum. This research will inform the development of a best-practice framework for Indigenous enabling education programs in Australia, particularly in regional and comprehensive education settings...|$|E
