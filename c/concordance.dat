5|$|Organothallium {{compounds}} {{tend to be}} thermally unstable, in <b>concordance</b> {{with the}} trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also {{the lowest in the}} group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R2TlX. Thallium forms the stable + ion in aqueous solution: like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and 2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like indium, thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).|$|E
5|$|Systematic {{interest}} in the letter preference began in 1959 with brand-preference studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of letters for use in package labels. In {{an extension of the}} studies, subjects were asked to rank the English alphabet by the pleasantness of the appearance of capital letters. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the coefficients of <b>concordance</b> were low), a strong positive correlation was found between a letter's average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of family names.|$|E
5|$|Seeds of Evil {{begins with}} the new Turok, Joshua Fireseed, {{appearing}} through a portal to face a female alien named Adon. She explains he has been called by the Elders of the Lost Land, the Lazarus <b>Concordance,</b> to defeat the Primagen, a powerful alien entity that was imprisoned in the wreckage of his own Lightship after attempting to witness {{the creation of the}} universe. This incident {{led to the creation of}} the Lost Land, a bizarre and barbarian world where time has no meaning. Awakened by the events of Dinosaur Hunter, the Primagen mobilizes several races of primitive creatures from the Lost Land to destroy five Energy Totems, powerful devices that bound the Primagen to his Lightship. The destruction of these Energy Totems would allow the Primagen to escape the confines of his Lightship, and the resulting shockwave would destroy the known universe.|$|E
