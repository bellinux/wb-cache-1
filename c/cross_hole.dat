5000|$|Tapered shank {{tools are}} removed from a socket using {{different}} approaches, depending {{on the design of}} the socket. In drill presses and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a [...] "drift" [...] into a rectangular shaped <b>cross</b> <b>hole</b> through the socket and tapping it. As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, {{the result is that the}} drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out. In many lathe tailstocks, the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into the tailstock, which brings the tool up against the end of the leadscrew or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool. Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some mill spindles, the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some mill spindles have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a drift punch is inserted axially from behind and the tool tapped out.|$|E

40|$|Excess global {{elemental}} sulphur (So) production {{has resulted in}} a decrease in its price. As a result, many companies, such as Syncrude Canada Ltd., have resorted to above ground storage alternatives. Geochemical reactions in these above ground blocks produce elevated concentrations of H 2 SO 4 (acid). This acid can have potentially deleterious effects on the environment. As such, these blocks will require long-term (500 years) monitoring and maintenance. Presently the So is removed from the product stream, piped in a molten state, and poured over a low permeability liner in thin lifts. As the So cools and undergoes crystal structure change it fractures, creating preferential flow passages which are potentially highly conductive. An understanding of the liquid conductivity (Kl) of the block and knowledge regarding the spatial and temporal distribution of acid (H 2 SO 4) within these blocks is required. In this thesis, gas pumping tests were conducted on an above ground block to determine the gas flow rates within the block and to indirectly determine the Kl of the block. Measurements of the relative humidity (RH) in the block were used to observe changes in stored acid concentrations with time and location. The results of the gas conductivity (Kg) testing showed that the block is anisotropic and is highly conductive in both the horizontal and vertical directions. <b>Cross</b> <b>hole</b> tests appeared to produce the most representative estimates of Kg due to the negation of turbulence that arises {{in the vicinity of the}} borehole. The choice of gas used in the analysis had negligible effect on the resulting Kl in contrast to choice of liquid, which resulted in larger variations in Kl. The Kl was a maximum when the liquid was pure water and decreased with increasing acid strength. The geometric mean of the resulting <b>cross</b> <b>hole</b> Kl values was 2 x 10 - 3 m s- 1 (pure water). RH measurements were observed to fluctuate with depth and increased following precipitation.

40|$|Rayleigh {{scattering}} of elastic waves by an inclusion is investigated and the limitations determined. In the near {{field of the}} inhomogeneity, the scattered waves are up to a factor of 300 stronger than in the far field, excluding {{the application of the}} far field Rayleigh approximation for this range. The investigation of the relative error as a function of parameter perturbation shows a range of applicability broader than previously assumed, with errors of 37 % and 17 % for perturbations of {minus} 100 % and + 100 %, respectively. The validity range for the Rayleigh limit is controlled by large inequalities, and therefore, the exact limit is determined as a function of various parameter configurations, resulting in surprisingly high values of up to k{sub p}R = 0. 9. The nonlinear scattering problem can be solved by inverting for equivalent source terms (moments) of the scatterer, before the elastic parameters are determined. The nonlinear dependence between the moments and the elastic parameters reveals a strong asymmetry around the origin, which will produce different results for weak scattering approximations depending on the sign of the anomaly. Numerical modeling of <b>cross</b> <b>hole</b> situations shows that near field terms are important to yield correct estimates of the inhomogeneities {{in the vicinity of the}} receivers, while a few well positioned sources and receivers considerably increase the angular coverage, and thus the model resolution of the inversion parameters. The pattern of scattered energy by an inhomogeneity is complicated and varies depending on the object, the wavelength of the incident wave, and the elastic parameters involved.

40|$|We {{present the}} fine scale {{investigations}} of seismic noise {{carried out in}} a geologically complex site in the Aterno R. Valley (LâAquila, central Italy). The goals of the study are {{to point out the}} efficiency of seismic noise technique in geologically complex site by comparing those data with other geophysical investigations (active seismic techniques, gravimetric survey) and geological data (more than 60 well logs and a detailed fine scale geological mapping), to fine-tune the subsoil model and to locate the geometry of seismic and geological bedrock. The study area is located {{in the western part of}} LâAquila intramontane plain which was struck by the recent April 6 earthquake (Mw: 6. 3). LâAquila intramontane plain is a typical Quaternary basin of central Apennines and it is a halfgraben extending in a WNW-ESE direction, along the Aterno River Valley. The carbonate bedrock is variably displaced by normal faults, with both Apennine (NW-SE) and anti-Apennine (NE-SW) directions, and by a N-dipping back-thrust. The alluvial deposits consist of more or less coarse gravels, sands and silty clays of fluvial and alluvial-fan environments organised in lenticular bodies. The model of subsoil was reconstructed by correlating borehole stratigraphies with data from geophysical tests (down-hole, cross-hole and microtremor measurements). In the study area the presence of a double amplification peak is the main characteristics of HVNSR data. This feature can be related to the presence of two strong impedance contrasts in the deposits filling the Aterno R. Valley. A first shallow contrast, due to the presence of the gravel layer found in the <b>cross</b> <b>hole</b> data, is responsible for the high frequency (> 10 Hz) HVNSR peak, while the deeper contrast between recent sedimentary layers and the limestone, acting as seismic bedrock,k at depth of few tents of meters produces the second peak centered at 3 Hz. The inversion of microtremor data, constrained by stratigraphic logs and seismic in-hole tests (down-hole, cross-hole), made it possible to demarcate zones with constant Vs and to reconstruct the depth of the carbonate (or seismic) bedrock; this depth ranged from 0 to 52 m from ground level. The Vs velocities of the alluvial and slope covers range from 300 m/s to 600 m/s. The Vs velocities in the central sector of the valley exceed 400 m/s; this is due to the occurrence of gravely lenses, which reach their maximum thickness in this sector. This study is a good example of how the seismic noise could furnish a useful contribution to fine-tune the subsoil model also in geologically complex sites...|$|E
