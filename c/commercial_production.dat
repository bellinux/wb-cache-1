5|$|At {{its peak}} of popularity, the Large Black was used mainly for meat production, {{especially}} bacon. The {{meat from the}} Large Black {{is known for its}} lean quality and flavour without an excess of back fat, but for <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> it was often crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs, producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers. However, today commercial processors do not favour the black skin of the purebred Large Black.|$|E
5|$|Growers {{register}} new daffodil cultivars by {{name and}} colour with the RHS, whose International Daffodil Register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is searchable. The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth; the fifth was published in 2012. More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the number has continued to grow. However, because of synonymy, the actual number is probably closer to 18,000; only about 500 are in <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> (470 in 2009–2010).|$|E

5|$|In 1832, James S. Mason of Philadelphia {{began the}} <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> of shoe {{blacking}} and inks. In 1851, James S. Mason & Co. constructed a building at 138/140 Front St. where ultimately ten million boxes were produced annually, to hold tins of blacking produced by two hundred employees. Later, tins of blacking were labeled as Mason Shoe Polish. This business ceased operation in 1919 {{and the building}} was razed in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium {{is used in}} cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests of tellurium demonstrated {{some of the greatest}} efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators. Massive <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} process was {{and still is}} chemically straightforward, effectively dissolving lead in aqua fortis (nitric acid), and subsequently harvesting the precipitate. However, the production remained small-scale for many centuries, and the <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> of lead(II) nitrate as raw material for the manufacture of other lead compounds was not reported until 1835. In 1974, the U.S. consumption of lead compounds, excluding pigments and gasoline additives, was 642tons.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Oregon in the United States has {{established}} an international reputation for its production of wine, ranking {{fourth in the}} country behind California, Washington, and New York. Oregon has several different growing regions within the state's borders that are well-suited to the cultivation of grapes; additional regions straddle the border between Oregon and the states of Washington and Idaho. Wine making dates back to pioneer times in the 1840s, with <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> beginning in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} gap year to finance Painted Faces, Hooper read English at University College, Oxford. He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society, where he {{directed}} Kate Beckinsale in A View From the Bridge and Emily Mortimer in The Trial. Hooper also {{had his first}} paid directing work, earning £200 for a corporate Christmas video, and he directed his first television advertisements, including one for Sega featuring Right Said Fred. He continues to direct advertisements alongside television and film projects. In 1996 he joined the <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> company John S.

5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings by Native Americans. Native copper {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> did not start until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for <b>commercial</b> <b>production.</b> Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{remained}} {{merely a}} chemical curiosity for decades {{before it was}} used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the manufacture and application of silicon nitride. By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) silicon nitride was in <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> for thermocouple tubes, rocket nozzles, and boats and crucibles for melting metals. British work on silicon nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded silicon nitride and hot-pressed silicon nitride. In 1971, the Advanced Research Project Agency of the US Department of Defense placed a US$17million contract with Ford and Westinghouse for two ceramic gas turbines.|$|E

5|$|The DU {{spectrophotometer}} or Beckman DU, {{introduced in}} 1941, {{was the first}} commercially viable scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance. This model of spectrophotometer enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its absorption spectrum, the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. Arnold O. Beckman's National Technical Laboratories (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.|$|E
5|$|The current {{paper mill}} building, whose water wheel {{is powered by}} a small canal from the river, dates from around 1860 and is a Grade II listed building. The <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> of {{handmade}} paper ceased in February 2008 after owner Gerry Cottle concluded there was no longer a market for the product, and therefore sold most of the historic machinery. Visitors to the site are still able to watch a short video of the paper being made from cotton. Other attractions include the dinosaur yard, a small museum about the cave and cave diving, a theatre with circus shows, a house of mirrors and penny arcades.|$|E
5|$|The largest area of {{production}} {{is also the}} Netherland, with 76% of the global cultivated area, followed by France, Chile, Japan, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. Approximately ten countries produce lilies commercially altogether. About half of the <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> is for cut flowers. Many of these countries export bulbs as well as supplying the domestic market. The Netherland produces about 2,200 million lily bulbs annually, of which 96% is used domestically and the remainder exported, principally within the European Union. One particularly important crop is the production of Lilium longiflorum, whose white flowers are associated with purity and Easter.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{method for}} {{producing}} glass wool is {{the invention of}} Games Slayter working at the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933. The first <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> of glass fiber was in 1936. In 1938 Owens-Illinois Glass Company and Corning Glass Works joined to form the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation. When the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber, they introduced continuous filament glass fibers. Owens-Corning is still the major glass-fiber producer in the market today.|$|E
5|$|Today, New South Wales waratahs {{are grown}} commercially in Australia north of Sydney {{and in the}} Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne. They are also grown commercially in New Zealand and in Israel, and also in Hawaii, {{where they have been}} grown since 1961. One major {{challenge}} in <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> is that in any one location the flowering season is generally short (five weeks total, with only small numbers in the earliest and latest weeks). The season for cut flowers may be extended, however, by growing plants at different latitudes. The vase life of a cut waratah is 10 to 14 days, and cut flower waratahs can be revived somewhat by water.|$|E
5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to <b>commercial</b> <b>production</b> of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
