5|$|The {{ship would}} have been faster and larger {{than any of the}} other ships Germany {{intended}} to convert into auxiliary carriers. However, a number of design problems emerged as the drawing up of the <b>conversion</b> <b>plan</b> progressed. Her speed and capacity advantages were offset by several serious practical problems. These included structural weakness, caused by the need to recess the hangar deck into the primary structural deck; instability, normally resolved by adding bulges; and high fuel consumption. Another significant obstacle was the unwillingness of Hermann Göring, the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, to provide the Kriegsmarine with sufficient aircraft and pilots. By the time the design was completed in November 1942, these problems had proved impossible to rectify, and so the project was abandoned. As a result, no construction work began. After the end of the war, Europa was seized by the US Army and commissioned as a troop transport under the name AP 177 before being transferred to France, where she resumed her commercial duties.|$|E

25|$|The final {{proposal}} for an auxiliary aircraft carrier conversion {{was for the}} incomplete French cruiser , {{which was in the}} shipyard at Lorient. As projected, the ship was to have carried a force of eleven fighters and twelve bombers. The <b>conversion</b> <b>plan</b> was prepared by August 1942, but work never began, and the project was cancelled by February 1943. There was not a sufficient work force remaining in Lorient to complete the ship, the harbor was within range of Allied bombers in Britain, and the ship's propulsion system proved to be troublesome for the designers. Ultimately, the unfinished cruiser was retaken by Allied forces and she was completed as an anti-aircraft cruiser for the French Navy by 1956.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, in 1948, {{a similar}} <b>conversion</b> <b>plan</b> was put forth. This plan, {{designated}} Project SCB 26A, proposed that Hawaii {{be converted into}} a Ballistic Guided Missile Ship. This plan called for Hawaii to be completed with 12 vertical launchers for U.S.-made V-2 short-range ballistic missiles and 6 launchers for the SSM-N-2 Triton surface-to-surface cruise missile. Triton {{was an attempt to}} give the Navy a reliable cruise missile that it could launch off of its ships. The design process began with an approval from the U.S. Navy in September 1946. After [...] "formulating performance objectives and possible design baselines", the designers settled on attempting to fit a [...] ramjet-powered cruiser missile onto solid-fuel rocket boosters that could carry the missile [...] at Mach 1.62.5 in 1950. After lowering the ambitious goals to more realistic levels in 1955, a fully operational version was expected by 1965, but with tests for the SSM-N-9/RGM-15 Regulus II planned for that year and the up-and-coming UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched cruise missile, the project was terminated in 1957. One source has a variation of this scheme, with the developmental XPM (Experimental Prototype Missile) from Operation Bumblebee replacing the Triton launchers. XPM eventually led to the RIM-8 Talos surface-to-air missile.|$|E

50|$|The American National Metric Council (ANMC) was {{established}} in 1973 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization for planning and coordinating metric activity in all sectors of the U.S. economy. The ANMC became a separately incorporated organization in 1976. The ANMC was intended to facilitate U.S. metrication by maintaining a voluntary and orderly process that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits, and to provide information, forums, individual assistance, and other services for its subscribers. The ANMC attempted to coordinate the metric planning of many industrial sectors, unlike the USMB, which only attempted to implement the policy {{set forth in the}} Metric Conversion Act of 1975. After the formation of the USMB, committees of the ANMC submitted <b>conversion</b> <b>plans</b> for the chemical sector and for the instruments sector. These sector <b>conversion</b> <b>plans</b> were later approved by the USMB. From 1975 through 1987, the ANMC held a series of well-attended annual conferences. Subsequently, a series of National Metric Conferences, jointly sponsored by the ANMC, the U.S. Metric Association (USMA), the Department of Commerce, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), were held from 1989 through 1993.|$|R
