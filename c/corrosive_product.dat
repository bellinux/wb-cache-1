Theshapes of the initial and corroded cylinders were measured at room temperature using a 3 D coordinate measuring machine equipped with a laser-plane sensor. These measurements enabled monitoring of the evolution of the residual radial deformation versus the depth from the surface in contact with the salt pellets, and consequently the characterisation of the local volume expansion induced by the phase change.

40|$|Corrosion of {{reinforcement}} {{leads to a}} volume increase; thus, splitting stresses are induced in the concrete. Thereby, the bond mechanism between the reinforcement and the concrete is influenced. In order to model the splitting stresses of the corrosion, the mechanical behaviour of the <b>corrosive</b> <b>products</b> needs to be known. Analyses of corrosion cracking tests led to {{the assumption that the}} <b>corrosive</b> <b>products</b> behave like a granular material; i. e. its stiffness increases with the stress level. This mechanical behaviour was, together with the volume of the rust relative to the uncorroded steel, given as input for a corrosion layer. This corrosion layer was combined with an earlier developed model of the bond mechanism, and implemented as a user-supplied subroutine in the finite element program DIANA. Finite element analyses of corrosion cracking tests and pull-out tests with corroded reinforcement were carried out. A reasonable good agreement between test results and analyses was obtained. The results show that this way of modelling can predict the decrease of bond when splitting of the concrete occurs, due to the combined action of corrosion and the bond mechanism...|$|R

This review aims to indicate the advantages and disadvantages of magnets in orthodontics and dentofacial orthopaedics over traditional techniques, and update related clinical experiences. The treatment of impacted teeth and Class II malocclusions by means of magnetic force is favoured and the correction of Class III and open bite malocclusions involving the use of magnets also appears promising. The advantages of magnets over traditional force delivery systems are: frictionless mechanics, when the magnets are in attractive configuration; predictable force levels, no force decay over time and less patient co-operation. However, the size of the magnets can increase the bulk of the appliance and three-dimensional control is limited when the magnets are in a repulsive configuration. In addition magnets used in vivo require a coating to prevent corrosion and the possible side effects of <b>corrosive</b> <b>product...</b>|$|E

25|$|Thin-film {{deposition}} is {{a process}} applied in the semiconductor industry to grow electronic materials, in the aerospace industry to form thermal and chemical barrier coatings to protect surfaces against corrosive environments, in optics to impart the desired reflective and transmissive properties to a substrate and elsewhere in industry to modify surfaces to {{have a variety of}} desired properties. The deposition process can be broadly classified into physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).

The PVD process can be carried out at lower deposition temperatures and without <b>corrosive</b> <b>products,</b> but deposition rates are typically lower.

Polymers containing halogen and hydrogen (polyvinyl chloride, polyolefins with halogenated additives, etc.) have the highest CI as the corrosive acids are formed directly with water produced by the combustion, polymers containing halogen only (e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene) have lower CI as the formation of acid is limited to reactions with airborne humidity, and halogen-free materials (polyolefins, wood) have the lowest CI. However, some halogen-free materials can also release significant amount of <b>corrosive</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{corrosion}} products flowing through cracks becomes significant when large corrosion penetrations {{take place in}} reinforced concrete structures and wide cracks develop; this is favorable, as it decreases the splitting stress around the bar. The effect becomes more important when the corrosion rate is low, such as for natural corrosion. A corrosion model describing the expansion due to voluminous <b>corrosive</b> <b>products</b> was previously developed. The model is here extended to include the flow of corrosion products through cracks. The volume flow of corrosion products through a crack is assumed {{to depend on the}} splitting stress and the crack width. The splitting stress is evaluated from the strain in the corrosion products, and the crack width is computed from the displacements across the crack. A one-dimensional flow model is used to formulate the flow phenomenon and to estimate the volume flow of corrosion products. The extended corrosion model, applied in detailed three-dimensional non-linear finite element analyses of highly corroded eccentric pull-out specimens, resulted in more corrosion cracks with smaller crack openings, which better corresponded to measurements of the tested specimens. Moreover, the results indicated the important effect of the flow phenomenon on the bond strength...|$|R

An energy dispersive spectrometry elemental mapping has been used to assess the damage of the galvanized zinc coating {{and the nature of the}} <b>corrosive</b> <b>products.</b> Welding current and time have the strongest influence on the shear strength of the spot welds, whereas clamping force is of minor importance. However, clamping force has the primary effect on avoiding expulsion of molten metal from the nugget during the joining process. Furthermore, clamping force has a beneficial influence on the corrosion resistance because it mainly hinders the permeation of the corrosive environment towards the spot welds. Although the welded samples can exhibit high shear strength also when a metal expulsion occurs, this phenomenon should be avoided because it enhances the damage and vaporization of the protective zinc coating...|$|R

Furthermore, these reinforced concretes are often exposed to severely corrosive environments such as sea water, contaminated water, acid rain and seashore etc [...] Thus, the corrosion problem of a steel bar embedded in the concrete {{is very important in}} terms of the safety and economic points of view. In this study, a multiple mortar test specimen(W/C: 0. 4) that had six types of cover thickness was prepared and immerged in flowing seawater for five years. And the effects of cover thickness and immersion years on the corrosion properties of the steel bars were investigated using electrochemical methods such as measuring corrosion potential, anodic polarization curve, and impedance. At the beginning of immersion(0 year), corrosion potentials exhibited increasingly nobler value with increasing the cover thickness. However, after being immersed for 5 years, the corrosion potentials conversely shifted in the positive direction with decreasing the cover thickness. As a result, the relationships between corrosion potential and cover thickness were not in good agreement with each other after 5 years.

However, poor corrosion resistance and high interfacial contact resistance (ICR) are major challenges for metallic bipolar plates used in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Corrosion of metallic parts in PEM fuel cells not only increases the interfacial contact resistance {{but it can}} also decrease the proton conductivity of the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA), due to catalyst poisoning phenomena caused by <b>corrosive</b> <b>products.</b> In this paper, a composite coating of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was deposited on stainless steel alloys (SS 304, SS 316 L) and Titanium (G-T 2) via a CoBlast™ process. Corrosion resistance of the coated and uncoated metals in a simulated PEM fuel cell environment of 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 + 2 ppm HF at 70 °C was evaluated using potentiodynamic polarisation. ICR between the selected metals and carbon paper was measured and used as an indicator of surface conductivity. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), 3 D microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and contact angle measurements were used to characterise the samples. The results showed that the PTFE coating improved the hydrophobicity and corrosion resistance but increased the ICR of the coated metals due to the unconductive nature of such coating. Thus, it was concluded that it is not fully feasible to use the PTFE alone for coating metals for fuel cell applications and a hybrid coating consisting of PTFE and a conductive material is needed to improve surface conductivity...|$|R
