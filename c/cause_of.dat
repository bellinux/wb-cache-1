Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} some of {{the most}} important findings from research that evaluated the hypothesized <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> specific reading disability (dyslexia).

The paper then discusses hypothesized deficiencies in cognitive abilities underlying reading ability as basic <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> specific reading disability, and concludes that phonological skills deficiencies associated with phonological coding deficits are the probable <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> the disorder rather than visual, semantic, or syntactic deficits. Hypothesized deficits in general learning abilities are also ruled out as probable <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> reading disability. The paper concludes with a brief review of results from a...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the impact <b>of</b> assessing the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> interindividual variation within a population when the research question of interest is about <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> differences between populations or time periods. This discrepancy between the research focus and the research question {{is referred to as}} a type III error, one that provides the right answer for the wrong question. METHODS: Homelessness, obesity, and infant mortality were used to illustrate different consequences of type III errors. These different consequences depend on the relationships between the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> within- and between-group variation. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> inter-individual variation and the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> variation between populations and time periods may be distinct.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death {{in patients who}} were /= 10 years. Neurological assessments were performed according to the American Spinal Injury Association scale. Data on <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were analyzed using the ICD- 10 classifications. Differences were calculated using the Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients, with 38 and 62 surviving /= 10 years, respectively, were included. No significant differences in <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were identified between these two groups. In patients surviving >/= 10 years, paraplegia {{was associated with a}} higher life expectancy compared with tetraplegia, 34 and 25 years (p = 0. 008), respectively, and the leading <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were septicemia (n = 14), ischemic heart disease (n = 10), neoplasms (n = 9), cerebrovascular diseases (n = 5), and other forms of heart diseases (n = 5). Septicemia, influenza/pneumonia, and suicide were the leading <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death in tetraplegics, whereas ischemic heart disease, neoplasms, and septicemia were the leading <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death in paraplegia. CONCLUSION: Our monocentric study showed that in 62 deceased patients with SCI, the leading <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were septicemia, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and cerebrovascular diseases. In addition, no significant differences were identified between <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death among patients surviving /= 10 years post-injury...|$|R
