500|$|In 2011 in Edinburgh, Scotland, a pub named The Fiddler's Elbow {{served a}} dessert dish named [...] "Braveheart Butter Bombs" [...] that {{consists}} of deep-fried butter served with ice cream infused with Irn Bru soda and <b>coulis.</b> Some critics in Edinburgh have referred to deep-fried butter as a [...] "coronary on a plate", but chefs at the pub have stated that when consumed in moderation it [...] "should be all right". The pub also planned on offering a variation using whisky in place of Irn Bru.|$|E
60|$|The maitre d'hotel here {{announced}} that supper was served. It was remarked {{that even the}} <b>coulis</b> de dindonneau made no impression on Bagnigge that night.|$|E
6000|$|Everybody {{stared at}} such an exclamation of enthusiasm from the lips of the young Earl of Bagnigge, who was never heard to admire {{anything}} except a <b>coulis</b> de dindonneau a la St. Menehould, or a supreme de cochon en torticolis a la Piffarde; such as Champollion, the chef of the [...] "Traveller's," [...] only knows how to dress; or the bouquet of a flask of Medoc, of Carbonell's best quality; or a goutte of Marasquin, from the cellars of Briggs and Hobson.|$|E
6000|$|Here {{a curious}} point arises. We have all studied the ingenious lady who calls herself Ouida. Now, is Ouida, or rather was Ouida {{in her early}} state sublime, {{the last of the}} old fashionable novelists, or did Thackeray unconsciously prophesy of her when he wrote his burlesque Lords and Liveries? Think of the young earl of Bagnigge, [...] "who was never heard to admire {{anything}} except a <b>coulis</b> de dindonneau a la St. Menehould, [...] . or the bouquet of a flask of Medoc, of Carbonnell's best quality, or a goutte of Marasquin, from the cellars of Briggs and Hobson." [...] We have met such young patricians in Under Two Flags and Idalia. But then there is a difference: Ouida never tells us that her hero was [...] "blest with a mother of excellent principles, who had imbued his young mind with that morality which is so superior to all the vain pomps of the world." [...] But a hero of Ouida's might easily have had a father who [...] "was struck down {{by the side of the}} gallant Collingwood in the Bay of Fundy." [...] The heroes themselves may have [...] "looked at the Pyramids without awe, at the Alps without reverence." [...] They do say [...] "Corpo di Bacco," [...] and the Duca de Montepulciano does reply, [...] "E' bellissima certamente." [...] And their creator might conceivably remark [...] "Non cuivis contigit." [...] But Lady Fanny Flummery's ladies could not dress as Ouida's ladies do: they could not quote Petronius Arbiter; they had never heard of Suetonius. No age reproduces itself. There is much of our old fashionable authoress in Ouida's earlier tales; there is plenty of the Peerage, plenty of queer French in old novels and Latin yet more queer; but where is the elan which takes archaeology with a rush, which sticks at no adventure, however nobly incredible? where is the pathos, the simplicity, the purple splendour of Ouida's manner, or manners? No, the spirit of the world, mirroring itself in the minds of individuals, simpered, and that simper was Lady Fanny Flummery. But it did many things more portentous than simpering, when it reflected itself in Ouida.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>coulis</b> ( [...] French) {{is a form}} {{of thick}} sauce made from puréed and {{strained}} vegetables or fruits.

50|$|The {{signature}} dish of {{the restaurant}} was scrambled duck egg, which was flambéed tableside with vodka. This was then topped with Sevruga caviar, and served with both buckwheat and plain blinis as well as chilled vodka.

5000|$|Purées {{overlap with}} other dishes with similar consistency, such as thick soups, creams (crèmes) and gravies—although these terms often imply more complex recipes and cooking processes. <b>Coulis</b> (French for [...] "strained") {{is a similar}} but broader term, more {{commonly}} used for fruit purées. The term is not commonly used for paste-like foods prepared from cereal flours, such as gruel or muesli; nor with oily nut pastes, such as peanut butter. The term [...] "paste" [...] is often used for purées intended {{to be used as}} an ingredient, rather than eaten.|$|E
5000|$|After the war, the Whizzers added Luftwaffe test {{pilots to}} the team. One was Hauptmann Heinz Braur. On 8 May 1945, Braur flew 70 women, {{children}} and wounded troops to Munich-Riem airport. After he landed, Braur {{was approached by}} one of Watson's men who gave him the choice of either going to a prison camp or flying with the Whizzers. Braur thought flying preferable. Three Messerschmitt employees also joined the Whizzers: Karl Baur, the Chief Test Pilot of Experimental Aircraft, test pilot Ludwig Hoffman, and engineering superintendent Gerhard <b>Coulis.</b> Test pilot Herman Kersting joined later.|$|E
50|$|In Florida, {{the fruit}} {{is used in}} its fully ripe form with a more mature flavor profile than the unripe version. Tasters note {{elements}} of apricot, tangerine, lemon, pineapple and guava. The peel is so thin, each fruit must be hand snipped from the tree to avoid tearing. The entire fruit minus the stems and seeds can be used. It is hand processed and pureed or juiced and used in various products such as calamondin cake, <b>coulis,</b> marmalade, and jam. The peels can be dehydrated and used as gourmet flavoring with salt and sugar. The fruit was popular with Florida cooks in cake form from the 1920s to 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 November 2013, Jean Sulpice hosted and {{judged the}} popular TF1 {{television}} show MasterChef France during the 4th season. He welcomed the eight contestants and the TV team in his restaurant. They {{were divided into}} 2 teams (red and yellow) and the main goal of this test was {{to learn how to}} work in teams. They had to reproduce two of his famous recipes : Beaufort foam, herbs and mountain flowers, beetroot <b>coulis</b> and Grenoble’s walnuts plus féra fillet, quail eggs and cucumber jelly in one and a half hour. The tasting was done by the panel of judges (Frédéric Anton, Yves Camdeborde, Sebastien Demorand and Amandine Chaignot) and also by Jean Sulpice himself, to decide which team had done the best imitation.|$|E
50|$|The Cantonese (Guangdongnese) people (Keńg-tang-lâng, Guǎngdōngren) form roughly 1.2% of the unmixed ethnic Chinese {{population}} of the Philippines, {{with large numbers of}} descendants originally from Taishan city, Macau, and nearby areas. Many are not as economically prosperous as the Minnan (Hokkienese). Barred from owning land during the Spanish Colonial Period, most Cantonese were into the service industry, working as artisans, barbers, herbal physicians, porters (<b>coulis),</b> soap makers, and tailors. They also had no qualms in intermarrying with the local Filipinos and most of their descendants are now considered Filipinos, rather than Chinese or Chinese mestizos. During the early 1800s, Chinese migration from Cantonese-speaking areas in China to the Philippines trickled to almost zero, as migrants from Hokkienese-speaking areas gradually increased, explaining the gradual decrease of the Cantonese population. Presently, they are into small-scale entrepreneurship and in education.|$|E
5000|$|Part of the {{function}} of menu prose is to impress customers {{with the notion that}} the dishes served at the restaurant require such skill, equipment, and exotic ingredients that the diners could not prepare similar foods at home. In some cases, ordinary foods are made to sound more exciting by replacing everyday terms with their French equivalent. For example, instead of stating that a pork chop has a dollop of applesauce, a high-end restaurant menu might state [...] "Tenderloin of pork avec compôte de pommes." [...] Although [...] "avec compôte de pommes" [...] translates directly as [...] "with applesauce," [...] it sounds more exotic—and more worthy of an inflated price tag. Menus may use the culinary terms concassé to describe coarsely chopped vegetables, <b>coulis</b> to describe a puree of vegetables or fruit, or au jus, to describe meat served with its own natural gravy of pan drippings.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the rest}} of his dishes have evolved over time, Chiang keeps one dish, {{entitled}} [...] "Memory", the same as when he first created it in 1997. It is a warmed foie gras jelly served with a black truffle <b>coulis.</b> Chiang has called this a [...] "pure André dish", having been the first dish he developed on his own. In 2008, he opened Jaan par André at the Swissôtel The Stamford in Singapore, and after 18 months at the restaurant it was placed at the 39th spot in the overall list of The World's 50 Best Restaurants. He closed the restaurant in 2010 {{to move out of the}} hotel and open Restaurant André in the Bukit Pasoh area of Singapore. At his self-titled restaurant, he and his team creates a menu on a daily basis depending on the quality of produce available in the markets, crediting this for making both him and his team think about the courses and the techniques that they can use.|$|E
5000|$|The true {{origin of}} the blancmange is obscure, but it is {{believed}} by some {{that it was a}} result of the Arab introduction of rice and almonds in early medieval Europe. However, {{there is no evidence of}} the existence of any similar Arab dishes from that period; though the Arabic mahallabīyah is similar, its origins are uncertain. Variants of the dish appear in numerous other European cultures with closely related names including Biancomangiare in Italy and Manjar Blanco in Spain. Additionally, related or similar dishes have existed in other areas of Europe under different names, such as the 13th-century Danish hwit moos ("white mush"), and the Anglo-Norman blanc desirree ("white Syrian dish"); Dutch calijs (from Latin colare, [...] "to strain") was known in English as cullis and in French as <b>coulis,</b> and was based on cooked and then strained poultry. The oldest recipe found so far for blancmange is from a copy of the oldest extant Danish cookbook, written by Henrik Harpestræng, who died in 1244, which dates it to the early 13th century at the latest. The Danish work may simply be a translation of a German work which is in turn assumed to have been based on a Latin or Romance vernacular manuscript from the 12th century or even earlier.|$|E
