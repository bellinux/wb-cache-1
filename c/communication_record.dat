30|$|A study {{similar in}} design {{to that of}} NetSense is {{discussed}} in [29]. The authors analyze a multilayer network of high school students, including a face-to-face interaction layer and a friendship survey layer. They study the difference in structural properties of three layers in their successive paper [30]. Smieszek et al. study a multilayer network between conference participants in [29] including a proximity sensor interaction layer, and the self-reported friendship layer. The authors study in what ways these two layers differ. In contrast to these two papers, our study focuses {{on the evolution of}} the edges in our multilayer network. The dataset that contains only records of communication between people is presented in [31]. The participants are high school students transitioning to college. The authors study the change of communication volume between pairs of students as they come into contact with new people, to discover the evolution of communication edges in response to external events. In our study, we focus on how changes of edges in one layer impact edges in other layers. Stopczynski et al. introduce in [32] the Copenhagen dataset defining a multilayer network that includes communication layer, a face-to-face interaction layer, and a Wi-Fi signal-based proximity layer. Several papers on the Copenhagen study describe how different social structures, like groups congregating at the same locations, are discovered using different layers of the network. Large-scale <b>communication</b> <b>record</b> datasets typically focus on basic features, such as call patterns, temporal features of communication records, and evolving communities in such network, as exemplified by [32, 33]. Miritello et al. [34] study how individuals adopt different tie formation strategies to activate and maintain ties. The Copenhagen dataset and the large-scale <b>communication</b> <b>record</b> dataset contain only behavioral edges, while an important element of our study is to investigate how behavioral edges impact changes in the nomination layer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{algorithm}} {{to detect}} invisible relevant persons in a homo-geneous social network is studied with computer simulation. The network is {{effective as a}} model for contemporary inter-working terrorists where large hub persons do not exist. Absense of large hub persons results in that the observed communication flow is also homogeneous.

40|$|In a {{previous}} <b>communication</b> (<b>Record</b> and McKeown, 1949) we described {{an investigation of}} 930 consecutive malformations of {{the central nervous system}} certified as the causes of stillbirths or of first year deaths in the City of Birmingham in the years 1940 - 1947. Certain data were available for all these malformations in the Maternity and Child Welfare Department's records; additional information was obtained by home visits from 742 mothers of 755 t of the 930 malformations, and from a control group of 742 mothers of 757 of the 892 infants born free from malformation, selected by taking every two hundredth name from the registers of live births and stillbirths for the same years. For a fuller discussion of the material and for an account of the procedure followed in classification of the malformations, we refer the reader to the earlier paper. The most interesting observations so far recorded in this inquiry concerned the association of age and parity of the mother with the risk of birth of a central nervous malformation.

40|$|Poorly {{controlled}} diabetes adversely {{affects a}} child's education, with concentration difficulties, alterations in mood, behaviour and fatigue {{associated with high}} or low blood glucose levels. Between years 2004 - 6 we started all toddlers and children on intensive insulin regimens (multiple dose injection or pump) making it imperative that they received support during the school day. This required close monitoring of blood glucose levels and counting carbohydrate intake to adjust rapid-acting insulin dose or pump bolus at every meal. We report our experience of formulating a sustainable structure of support in primary schools based on trained volunteers who partake in the daily 'Individualised Care Plan (ICP) '. After overcoming multiple barriers, an acceptable system was negotiated with our Primary Care Trust (PCT) and Local Education Authority (LEA). In 2009, the PCT confirmed 3 years funding for a Paediatric Diabetes specialist nurse (PDSN) for schools. In 2010, the first full school year with agreed protocols was in place. By July 2012, our nurses had trained a total of 342 volunteers who provide care for 132 children. The Oxfordshire Schools Intervention Programme ensures that legal obligations are met. A risk assessment allows the LEA to provide indemnity to their school staff to give injections and do blood tests, after training and competency sign-off by a PDSN.

40|$|Background: Exposure to Biological Agents during work is an {{emergent}} type {{of occupational}} risk. Aim: To characterize occupational biological risk exposure among Chilean workers {{which have been}} registered by the Toxicology Information Center, between January 2006 and December 2009. Material and Methods: All incoming calls reporting exposure to biological agents during the studied period were analyzed. The information obtained from the caller was registered using the <b>Communication</b> <b>Record</b> Instrument of the WHO International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS INTOX). Results: In the studied period, 77 calls were received. The mean age of exposed patients was 35 ± 15 years and 57 % of them were females. The most common involved agents were vaccines for veterinary use (42 %) followed by Loxosceles laeta bites in 16 %. The main routes of exposure were injections, cuts and needle stick injuries in 39 % and stings and bites in 38 %. The highest exposure rates were observed in Southern Chile due to self-inoculation of veterinary vaccines used in the salmon industry (22. 7 / 100. 000 actual workers). Fifty-eight percent of calls were from health care workers, and 51 % of them were from health care facilities. Sixty percent of exposures occurred during summer and spring. There was a fourfold higher risk of calls involving women exposed to bites or stings (odds ratio (OR) 4. 5 (CI 95 1. 5 - 13. 9, p < 0. 01). Men had a fourfold higher risk of being exposed to vaccines or medications for veterinary use (OR 4. 2, CI 95 1. 4 - 12. 6 p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Most calls involving an exposure to a biological agent were caused by self-inoculation of veterinary medications...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{popularity}} of Online Social Networks (OSN) is generating {{a large amount of}} <b>communication</b> <b>records</b> that can be easily accessed and analysed to study human social behaviour. This represents a unique opportunity to understand properties of social networks that were impossible to assess in the past. Although analyses on OSN conducted hitherto revealed some important global properties of the networks, there is still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms underpinning these properties, their relation to human behaviour, and their dynamic evolution over time. These aspects are clearly important to understand and characterise OSN and to identify the evolutionary strategy that favoured the diffusion of the use of online communications in our society. In this paper we analyse a data set of Twitter <b>communication</b> <b>records,</b> studying the dynamic processes that govern the maintenance of online social relationships. The results reveal that people in Twitter have highly dynamic social networks, with a large percentage of weak ties and high turnover. This suggests that this behaviour can be the product of an evolutionary strategy aimed at coping with the extremely challenging conditions imposed by our society, where dynamism seems to be the key to success. © 2013 ACM...|$|R
