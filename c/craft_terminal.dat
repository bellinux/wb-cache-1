Jurong Port handled about 17.33 million tonnes and 320,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU)s of containers in 2014. Its port facilities are as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Kerala has {{one major}} port, 17 minor ports {{and a few}} mini ports. The state has {{numerous}} backwaters, which are used for commercial inland navigation. Transport services are mainly provided by country craft and passenger vessels. There are 67 navigable rivers in the state while the total length of inland waterways is [...] The main constraints {{to the expansion of}} inland navigation are; lack of depth in waterways caused by silting, lack of maintenance of navigation systems and bank protection, accelerated growth of the water hyacinth, lack of modern inland <b>craft</b> <b>terminals,</b> and lack of a cargo handling system. A canal [...] long, National Waterway 3, runs between Kottapuram and Kollam, which is included in the East-Coast Canal.|$|R
5000|$|Trading routes {{are a very}} {{effective}} {{way to make money}} or if one chooses [...] "Gilda Stars" [...] to unlock building or castle plans. A player gathers or farms specific materials in order to craft resources at a destination specific terminal and walks or rides them to a corresponding trading post merchant. Upon creating the resource (example: farm strawberries to create strawberry jam), this resource is then placed in a pack on a player and the player is unable to walk at full speed. This makes using the public transportation system (automated bus carts and airships) essential for the fast transportation of these goods. The further the trading post is from the <b>crafting</b> <b>terminal,</b> the higher the reward a player will receive. However, if the player is in neutral land, other players are free to kill them and take the player's pack. A player can place the pack on the ground whenever they wish to fight and pick it back up. Using a mount while carrying a pack will slow it down too (the fastest mount with a pack being a donkey), but packs can be stored in player-made vehicles (farm cart, ships).|$|R
50|$|The Craft Access System was {{a system}} {{developed}} by an AT&T subsidiary BellSouth Telecommunications Advanced Systems Division in 1984 that allowed telephone installers and repair personnel to access their work order system (e.g., LMOS) {{by means of}} various pocket-PC like devices (<b>Craft</b> Access <b>Terminals)</b> which connected to the landline telephone system. The developer, Muchiri Motilewa, designed and coded the proof-of-concept prototype on a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100 computer in BASIC and a DEC VAX-11/780 Unix machine in C and Shell. The system went live as the Dispatcher Installer Networking System, DINS, with 10 installers in Birmingham, AL and 10 installers in Atlanta, GA in August of that year and was later ported to the hand-held system shown here.|$|R
50|$|In July 1966, British Rail Hovercraft {{began its}} Seaspeed {{hovercraft}} service between Cowes and Southampton with two SR.N6 <b>craft.</b> The Cowes <b>terminal</b> was located on Medina Road, and the Southampton terminal on Crosshouse Road {{next to the}} Woolston Floating Bridge ramp; the site is currently under {{the western end of}} the Itchen Bridge. During the winter of 1971-72, both craft were lengthened by 10 ft and named the Sea Hawk and Sea Eagle. Each craft's capacity was increased from 36 to 58 passengers. The service transferred to Hovertravel of Ryde in 1976, who operated it until the end of 1980.|$|R

30|$|Istanbul is a mega {{city with}} various coastal {{utilities}} {{located on the}} northern coast of the Sea of Marmara. At Yenikap覺, there are critical vulnerable coastal utilities, structures, and active metropolitan life. Fishery ports, commercial ports, small <b>craft</b> harbors, passenger <b>terminals</b> of intercity maritime transportation, waterfront commercial and/or recreational structures with residential/commercial areas and public utility areas are some examples of coastal utilization that are vulnerable to marine disasters. Therefore, the tsunami risk in the Yenikap覺 region {{is an important issue}} for Istanbul. In this study, a new methodology for tsunami vulnerability assessment for areas susceptible to tsunami is proposed, in which the Yenikap覺 region is chosen as a case study. Available datasets from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Turkish Navy are used as inputs for high-resolution GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) evaluation of tsunami risk in Yenikap覺. Bathymetry and topography database is used for high-resolution tsunami numerical modeling where the tsunami hazard, in terms of coastal inundation, is deterministically computed using the NAMI DANCE numerical code, considering earthquake worst case scenarios. In order to define the tsunami human vulnerability of the region, two different aspects, vulnerability at location and evacuation resilience maps were created using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method of MCDA. A vulnerability at location map is composed of metropolitan use, geology, elevation, and distance from shoreline layers, whereas an evacuation resilience map is formed by slope, distance within flat areas, distance to buildings, and distance to road networks layers. The tsunami risk map is then computed by the proposed new relationship which uses flow depth maps, vulnerability at location maps, and evacuation resilience maps.|$|R
