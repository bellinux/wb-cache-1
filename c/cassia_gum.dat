5000|$|<b>Cassia</b> <b>gum</b> is a food {{additive}} {{made from}} the endosperm of Senna obtusifolia (also called Cassia obtusifolia or Cassia tora). It {{is used as a}} thickener and gelling agent, and has E-number E427 or E499 in pet foods.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the name}} Cassia is not precise, it is {{sometimes}} difficult {{to know what is}} meant by references to plants known as [...] "cassias". <b>Cassia</b> <b>gum,</b> for example, is made from Senna obtusifolia, a species formerly included in genus Cassia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cassia</b> <b>gum,</b> {{an extract}} {{of the seeds}} of Chinese senna (S. obtusifolia), {{is used as a}} {{thickening}} agent. The leaves and flowers of Siamese cassia (S. siamea) are used in some Southeast Asian cuisines, such as Thai and Lao cuisines. They are known as khi-lek in Thai, and are used in curries.|$|E
40|$|It {{is evident}} that, plant gums and {{mucilage}} {{have been widely}} used in various industries like paper, textile, food, pharmaceuticals, ink, cosmetics, petroleum due to their abundance in nature, non-toxic, bio-degradable, ecofriendly and comparitivley cheap. They are frequently used in pharmaceuticals as thickening, binding, emulsifying, suspending, and stabilizing agents and coating materials in micro encapsulation. Various plant gums, which have been used as Suspending agents include, Acacia, Compound Tragacanth, xanthan gum. In view of importance of mucilage in pharmaceuticals for the manufacture of suspension, <b>Cassia</b> roxburghii seed <b>gum</b> (family Fabaceae/Leguminosae) were evaluated by comparing with Acacia and Compound Tragacanth gum at concentration 2. 5 and 3 %w/v in sulphamethoxazole suspension. The prepared suspension was evaluated for its sedimentation volume, rheology and particle size analysis. The <b>Cassia</b> roxburghii (filtered <b>gum)</b> at 2. 5 %w/v produced good suspendability compared to the <b>Cassia</b> roxburghii (Defatted <b>gum),</b> Acacia and Compound Tragacanth gum [...] The suspending ability of the suspending agents were in the order of <b>cassia</b> roxburghii (filtered <b>gum)</b> >Compound Tragacanth> <b>cassia</b> roxburghii (defatted <b>gum)</b> >Acacia gum. The results showed that sedimentation volume, viscosity and particle size were directly proportional to the concentration of the suspending agents. The reverse case was observed with the flow rate. The present studies indicates that Cassia roxburghii mucilage obtained by filteration method appeared to exhibit the best suspendability for sulphamethoxazole suspensions, compared with compound Tragacanth, <b>Cassia</b> roxburgii (defatted <b>gum)</b> and Acacia gum, and can be employed as stabilizer and thickener of choice in pharmaceutical suspension...|$|R

30|$|Several {{methods are}} {{reported}} [1, 4, 7] for AgNPs synthesis, among them, most conventional and comfortable method is {{the reduction of}} the metal salt solution by means of reducing agents like N,N-dimethyl form amide, when the above chemicals used as reducing agent, it causes environmental toxicity or hazards. Alternatively, researchers are interested towards the green synthesis of AgNPs to avoid the negative impact on the environment [21, 22]. AgNPs synthesis using polysaccharides [14, 15, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] is an alternative resolution for the aforementioned complications. The synthesis of AgNPs by different plant parts such as leaf, fruit, bark, latex, stem, gums and various biological systems has been reported [16, 17, 19, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Although the synthesis of AgNPs using polysaccharides has some disadvantages, it needs more time for the synthesis. Similarly, the as-synthesized AgNPs showed lower catalytic and biological activity. To activate the AgNPs, carboxymethylation is one of the systems utilized for the functionalization of natural polymers [33]. Carboxymethylation in general expands the hydrophilicity and solution clearness of the polysaccharides and improves it dissolvable in an aqueous system. It is a broadly utilized alteration technique in light of its simplicity of handling, bring down cost of chemicals and versatility of the product obtained. Many natural <b>gums</b> such as <b>Cassia</b> tora <b>gum,</b> gellan, guar gum, and gum karaya were investigated using the carboxymethylation process [34, 35, 36, 37].|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cassia</b> <b>gum</b> is {{currently}} (mid-2009) being used mainly in pet food applications. In the EU, cassia tora gum is approved as E-427.

5000|$|The {{green leaves}} of the plant are {{fermented}} to produce a high-protein food product called [...] "kawal" [...] which is eaten by many people in Sudan as a meat substitute. Its leaves, seeds, and root are also used in folk medicine, primarily in Asia. It is believed to possess a laxative effect, {{as well as to}} be beneficial for the eyes. As a folk remedy, the seeds are often roasted, then boiled in water to produce a tea. The plant's seeds are a commercial source of <b>cassia</b> <b>gum,</b> a food additive usually used as a thickener and named for the Chinese Senna's former placement in the genus Cassia. Roasted and ground, the seeds have also been used as a substitute for coffee. In traditional Korean medicine, they are called gyeolmyeongja (결명자) and usually prepared as tea. They are also used in Kampō (traditional Chinese medicine in Japan), where they are called ketsumei-shi (ケツメイシ, 決明子) or by their Chinese name jué míng zǐ (traditional: 決明子, simplified: 决明子).|$|E
5000|$|The galactomannans (a form of polysaccharide) from <b>Cassia</b> tora (CT- <b>gum),</b> after proper {{processing}} and chemical derivatization (converting chemical into {{a product of}} a similar structure), could function as an improved and more economical thickener than locust bean gum for textiles, because of the bean gum’s current high price ($18/kg) and limited availability. Most of the CT-gum processing plants in India are located in Gujarat state because of the availability of Cassia tora beans in the neighbouring states, but the widespread use of these beans as vegetables and seeds as cattle feed has been pushing up the raw material cost for the CT-gum industry. The total fixed capacity in the country is 0.2 million tonnes for splits and 59,000 for powder based on Cassia tora seeds. The capacity utilization in the industry has been around 70 percent for the last three years. Apart from domestic consumption, there are now noteworthy exports of cassia powder of the international standard to various countries. This includes the United States of America, Australia, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan. The export value of Cassia tora has been progressively increasing over the last five years. Comprehensive export data disclosed that Japan and the UK receive a regular supply, while the United States market fluctuates. However, the export growth rate of Cassia tora plainly shows the difference between quantity and value, which leads to a low price per unit price.|$|R

40|$|Aqueous {{solution}} of <b>cassia</b> <b>gum</b> (CG), which is categorized as a galactomannan polysaccharide having mannose/galactose ratio = 5 / 1, forms hydrogels by freezing and thawing. When frozen CG aqueous solution was thawed, transparent sol {{was separated from}} a turbid gel, i. e. syneresis occurred. Gel concentration ({(Mass of dry gel) / (Mass of gel) } × 100) increased with increasing CG concentration. Viscoelastic properties of CG hydrogels formed by freezing and thawing were investigated by thermomechanical analysis (TMA) in water using an oscillation mode at 0. 05 Hz. Dynamic modulus (E′) increased from 3 kPa to ca. 5 kPa with increasing freezing rate. In contrast, E′ maintained a constant value regardless of repeating number of freezing and thawing. From TMA results, it is concluded that the density of cross-linking network structure depends {{on the size of}} ice formed by freezing. At the same time, the low E′ value of CG gels is ascribed to the fact that association of galactosyl side group is disturbed by the stiff chain attributed to the unsubstituted region of CG...|$|E
