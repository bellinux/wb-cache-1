5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds <b>check)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{won their}} final two games {{to secure a}} 13–3 record and a first-round playoff bye as the NFC's #2 seed. They {{defeated}} Chicago 31–3 in the Divisional Playoffs, setting up a rematch with the 49ers in San Francisco for the NFC Championship. As they had in Week 13, the Giants' defense held San Francisco's offense in <b>check.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> game's waning moments, nose tackle Erik Howard caused a Roger Craig fumble, and Taylor recovered it. New York drove downfield into San Francisco territory, and on the game's last play, kicker Matt Bahr hit a 42-yard field goal to defeat the 49ers, 15–13.|$|E
5|$|Nine shelters {{throughout}} the Northern Mariana Islands were opened to accommodate families needing assistance. Several schools opened classrooms as evacuation centers. On Guam, ten schools {{were used as}} shelters, and {{on the day of}} impact 2,271people were in shelters. On Rota, 159people sought shelter, and in Saipan, 549 were in shelters by the day of impact. The Guam Memorial Hospital officials advised all pregnant women within 32weeks of their delivery date to <b>check</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> Guam Office of Civil Defense filed the paperwork for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to declare the island a disaster area. Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez took similar measures to declare a state of emergency for the area. Following experience from previous typhoons, Guam newspaper Pacific Daily News underwent preparations to provide internet updates for the storm, including reinforcing the building, maintaining sufficient food supplies for the staff, and stationing two reporters elsewhere on the island; the paper was the only immediate source of information about the typhoon outside of Guam.|$|E

5|$|Since {{substitute}} {{checks are}} considered legal checks, substitute checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute <b>check</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E

25|$|The aircraft, {{destroyed}} in the accident, was a Fairchild SA 227-BC Metro III, c/n BC-789B, registration EC-ITP. It was owned by a Spanish bank and leased to Líneas Aéreas de Andalucía, known as Air Lada based in Seville, Spain. The aircraft was subleased to Flightline S.L. {{and was on the}} Air operator's certificate (AOC) of Flightline, which is based in Barcelona, Spain. Tickets were sold by a company called Manx2, which was based in the Isle of Man.

25|$|However, it is {{acknowledged}} that the British never paid such compensation to the Sultanate of Sulu but during a meeting of Maphilindo between the Philippine, Malayan and Indonesian governments in 1963, the Philippine government said the Sultan of Sulu wanted the payment of 5,000 from the Malaysian government. The first Malaysian Prime Minister at the time, Tunku Abdul Rahman said he {{would go back to}} Kuala Lumpur and get on the request. Since then, the Malaysian Embassy in the Philippines issues a <b>check</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of 5,300 ringgit (US$1710 or about 77,000 Philippine pesos) to the legal counsel of the heirs of the Sultan of Sulu. Malaysia considers the amount an annual “cession” payment for the land, while the sultan’s descendants consider it “rent”.|$|E

25|$|Lacking a party {{base in the}} Minnesota House of Representatives and Senate, Ventura's policy ambitions {{had little}} chance of being {{introduced}} as bills. Initially, the residents of Minnesota feared Ventura's vetoes would be overturned. He vetoed 45 bills in his first year, only three of which were overridden. The reputation for having his vetoes overridden comes from his fourth and final year, where six of his nine vetoes were overturned. Nevertheless, Ventura was still successful in several initiatives. One of the most notable was the rebate on sales tax. In each year of his administration, Minnesotans received a tax-free <b>check</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late summer. The state was running a budget surplus at the time, and Ventura believed that the money {{should be returned to}} the public.|$|E
25|$|In the 1977 draft, Torrey had the 15th {{overall pick}} and was {{deciding}} between forwards Mike Bossy and Dwight Foster. Bossy {{was known as}} an emerging scorer who lacked physicality, while Foster could check and had led the Ontario Hockey League in scoring. Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing {{it was easier to}} teach a scorer how to <b>check.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> upcoming 1977-78 season, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, having scored 53 goals that season, the most scored by a rookie at the time. The team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships. Six players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them being players drafted by the Islanders, showing the success of the draft building process. The season ended with a familiar result as the team lost in the overtime during playoffs Game 7 of the quarterfinals against the Toronto Maple Leafs; Billy Harris failed on a breakaway which was followed by Lanny McDonald scoring to complete an upset.|$|E
500|$|A {{substitute}} check (also {{called an}} Image Replacement Document or IRD) is a negotiable instrument {{used to represent}} the digital reproduction of an original paper <b>check.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, as a negotiable payment instrument, a substitute check maintains {{the status of a}} [...] "legal check" [...] in lieu of the original paper check as authorized by the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as the Check 21 Act). Instead of presenting the original paper checks, financial institutions and payment processing centers electronically transmit data from a substitute check by either the settlement process through the United States Federal Reserve System or by clearing the deposit based on a private agreement between member financial institutions of a clearinghouse that operates under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).|$|E

500|$|Finkelstein noted 20 instances, {{in as many}} pages, where Dershowitz's book {{cites the}} same sources and {{passages}} used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with ellipses in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims. Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas. Examining {{a copy of a}} proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his secretarial assistant, Holly Beth Billington, <b>check</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book. Dershowitz answered the charge {{in a letter to the}} University of California's Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up the smoking gun quotation, in that he had changed its wording (from 'cite' to 'copy') in his book. In public debate he has stated that if [...] "somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether Mark Twain had said that, obviously that would be a serious charge"; however, he insisted emphatically that he himself did not do that, that he had indeed checked the original source by Twain.|$|E
