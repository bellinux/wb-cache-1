5|$|The Reactionary Party (the former {{dissident}} conservative {{elements within}} the Moderate Party) began by passing the Interpretation of the Additional Act, which {{was followed by the}} reform of the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Procedure.</b> Both laws, built upon the 1834 Additional Act, would allow the national government to reassert its control over provincial police and courts. They would provide the means to deal effectively with provincial rebellions and inevitably grant the national government greater sway over the provincial governments. In turn, the party in power would gain greater ascendancy in national politics through patronage and office appointments. Fearful that their adversaries would stay in power indefinitely, the Liberals began to call for PedroII to attain majority at a younger age. They hoped to regain their influence by doing away with the regency and dealing directly with a pliable young emperor. Towards that end, the Liberals allied themselves with the Facção Áulica (Courtier Faction), led by Aureliano Coutinho (Feijó's ally in the 1832 coup attempt).|$|E

The committee noted that not all States possessed domestic laws which would enable them to combat serious criminality efficiently. Investigations, searches, seizures and other measures were often carried out on the basis <b>of</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>procedure</b> which were drafted a number of years ago. In respect of confiscation, the member States' legislation differed widely, in respect of both substantive and procedural rules.

40|$|Much that we {{know about}} crime and {{criminal}} justice has come from comparisons between different countries and systems. Particularly fruitful have been comparisons between the world's two great legal families ⎯ the Anglo-American common law system and the continental civil law system. Over hundreds of years, comparisons between these two great systems have led to many major, and countless smaller, improvements in both systems and many countries. American criminal justice has benefitted immensely from this interchange. Penal <b>codes,</b> <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>procedure,</b> minimum and maximum sentences, and organized police forces {{are just a few of}} the ideas that have come from the continent. Even the concept of a public prosecutor may be a product of this interchange. England had no public prosecutor in colonial times. It made its first small beginning in 1869 and did not fully adopt the idea until 1985. There have been public prosecutors in the United States, however, German and American Prosecutions 1 since early colonial days. While the evidence is far from conclusive, the first American public prosecutor was probably Dutch. Having long had a public prosecutor in their home country, it was natural that the Dutch should bring this institution with them to the New World. When New Amsterdam became New York in 1664, the Dutch system of prosecution seems to have been continued. ...|$|R

Second, the attorney cannot do this discretionary. The attorney can only stop criminal case prosecution for technical reason. Third, in the real situation the attorney often find criminal case (hat because of technicil reason) in which the case must be threaten properly for discretionary. But unfortunately it cannot be done by the attorney because there are some reasons which made discretionary cannot be done by the attorney for instance : a) Law Factor that is there hasn't been any rule of law to arrange discretionary which can be done by the attorney. b). Factor from the people who upholds the law, because of the lack in socialization of opportunism principles and because there are some misunderstanding about duty and the power of prosecutorial in prosecution that is the attorney general office are one and cannot be separated from each other, and because of attorney general office are not independen and less of coordination between judicature officials. ...|$|R

The aim is to describe the legislative framework of the linguistic assistance provided in this area in Italy, point out the shortcomings {{in the provision of}} this service, including the difficulties faced by legal interpreters, and investigate whether the Italian legislation on the matter is correctly applied in the city of Arezzo by interviewing people who work with legal interpreters in police stations, courthouses and the prison. Chapter 1 aims to give an overview on the presence of non-Italian speaking people in Italy, such as foreign residents, foreign tourists and migrants. There follows a description of {{the situation of}} foreign-born arrestees. Chapter 2 focuses on the legal framework of the linguistic assistance provided in Italian legal settings. It contains an analysis of the articles <b>of</b> several <b>Codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Procedure</b> in force in different historical states of Italy that refer to the position of the interpreter, and {{a detailed description of the}} current legislation. Chapter 3 analyses the most frequent difficulties acknowledged by the interpreters, as well as several problems arising due to an incomplete implementation of the EU directives in Italy’s legislation. Chapter 4 deals with the situation of legal interpreting in Arezzo. Interviews were carried out with people who work frequently with interpreters in the city’s police stations, courthouses and prison. Moreover, the person in charge of the service of cultural mediation in the city was also interviewed. The problems acknowledged by the interviewees are presented.
