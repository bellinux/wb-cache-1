Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes, and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> for foundations, make-up, eye shadows, blushers, kohl pencils, lipsticks and other skincare products.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products.</b> The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.|$|E

Since 1971, Arad has been producing phosphoric acid, made from brine collected from the Dead Sea, and phosphates from the nearby Tzefa. Rotem Amfert Negev Ltd, a subsidiary of Israel Chemicals Ltd (ICL), has been planning a new phosphate plant in the Sdeh Brir area for several years.

5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} animals is banned in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway while {{legislation}} in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans. In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban {{on the sale of}} animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any <b>cosmetic</b> <b>products</b> that are tested on animals.|$|E

When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing.

30|$|The {{efficiency}} of a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>product</b> depends {{not only on}} the active ingredients, but also on the carrier system with the aim to improve its bioavailability. The real efficacy of new or old active compounds is not enough for obtaining a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>product</b> really efficient. The product depends not only on used active principles, but also on the penetrating degree into the skin layers which is strongly dependent on the used carriers. The nanodisperse systems represent a mild way in order to enhance the penetration degree and increase the performance of a <b>cosmetic</b> <b>product</b> [6, 7]. In this context, lipid nanoparticles are attractive colloidal carrier systems for cosmetics and dermatologic formulations due to their beneficial effects on skin, compared to other colloidal carrier systems [7], being based on nontoxic and nonirritant lipids [8]. This is the most remarkable advantage of these systems - the lipid matrix being composed of well-tolerated and physiological lipids, thus leading to minimise the danger of acute and chronic toxicity.|$|R
