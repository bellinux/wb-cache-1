5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's {{shoulders}} were sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he <b>could</b> <b>step</b> with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they <b>could</b> <b>step</b> into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E
25|$|Spatuzza's {{allegations}} {{were included in}} the prosecution of Dell'Utri's Mafia collusion appeal and Spatuzza repeated his allegations at the Appeal Trial. Prosecutors argued that the Mafia spread panic with a campaign of terrorist bombings in mainland Italy in 1993 so that Forza Italia <b>could</b> <b>step</b> onto the political stage in the guise of national saviour. The bombings stopped after Berlusconi first won power in 1994.|$|E

25|$|On Andrea Doria, the {{decision}} to abandon ship was made within 30minutes of impact. A sufficient number of lifeboats {{for all of the}} passengers and crew were positioned {{on each side of the}} Boat Deck. Procedures called for lowering the lifeboats to be fastened alongside the glass-enclosed Promenade Deck (one deck below), where evacuees <b>could</b> <b>step</b> out windows directly into the boats, which would then be lowered down to the sea.|$|E
25|$|During a waterstart, {{a sailor}} clears the sail {{of water and}} powers {{it up in the}} wind. The powered sail then pulls the sailor out of the water enough so they <b>could</b> <b>step</b> up and onto the board. When the sail is first being lifted, it often helps to push the back of the board {{slightly}} underwater, and setting the front of the boom onto the board (near the footstraps). The buoyancy of the board will then push the boom upward, helping to lift the sail out of the water.|$|E

500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios {{has a bit of}} a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who <b>could</b> <b>step</b> outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [...] treated {{in such a way that}} their freak flags are allowed to fly free.|$|E
500|$|SNK {{released}} [...] a {{few months}} before Street Fighter II. It was designed by Takashi Nishiyama, the creator of the original Street Fighter, which it was envisioned as a spiritual successor to. Fatal Fury placed more emphasis on storytelling and the timing of special moves, and added a two-plane system where characters <b>could</b> <b>step</b> into the foreground or background. Meanwhile, Sega experimented with Dark Edge, an early attempt at a 3D fighting game where characters could move in all directions. Sega however, never released the game outside Japan because it felt that [...] "unrestrained" [...] 3D fighting games were unenjoyable. Sega also attempted to introduced 3-D holographic technology to the genre with Holosseum in 1992, though it was unsuccessful. Several fighting games achieved commercial success, including SNK's Art of Fighting and Samurai Shodown as well as Sega's Eternal Champions. Nevertheless, Street Fighter II remained the most popular, spawning a Champion Edition that improved game balance and allowed players to use additional characters. The popularity of Street Fighter II led it to be released for home game consoles and allowed it to define the template for fighting games. Fighting games soon became the dominant genre in the arcade game industry of the early 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|French {{members of}} Parliament and other French {{politicians}} also organised a protest. All {{political parties in}} Parliament—UMP, Socialists, New Centre, Communists, Democratic Movement (centre) and Greens—jointly requested a pause in the National Assembly's session, which was granted, so that MPs <b>could</b> <b>step</b> outside and unfurl a banner which read [...] "Respect for Human Rights in China".

2500|$|Meyer {{decided to}} include the {{pregnancy}} in her story while she was researching vampires, early in 2003, and came across {{the legend of the}} incubus, a demon who could father children. Bella's insistence to not let her child die was inspired by Meyer's reaction when asked if she would let one of her children die so she could live, which was to deliver the child no matter what the consequences were. Meyer {{said in an interview with}} Shannon Hale, published in , that the birth scene published is a little less grotesque than the one she wrote before editing due to her editor, agent and publisher's requests to [...] "tone down the violence a little". She stated that Bella's pregnancy and childbirth, for her, were [...] "a way to kind of explore that concept of what childbirth used to be" [...] in the past and acknowledged that they were [...] "taking Bella in a new direction that wasn't [...] relatable for a lot of people." [...] Concerning the subject of the relatability of Bella, Meyer admitted that she lost some of her relatability to the character when she became a vampire and said, [...] "every point up until that point in the story [...] I would say I <b>could</b> <b>step</b> into this story right here and I could do everything she could do which made it really fun." [...] Meyer wanted to experience Bella's vampiric experiences and [...] "enjoyed very much" [...] writing about them and wanted to end the book from her perspective, but still thought it was [...] "a little bit harder" [...] as she couldn't step in into the story anymore.|$|E

2500|$|In the Cornish {{examples}} {{the motive}} power {{was provided by}} waterwheels, {{or one of the}} mine's steam engines. The steam engine or water wheel would be linked to a series of beams – known as [...] "rods" [...] – [...] fastened together and reaching {{to the bottom of the}} mineshaft. [...] These were arranged to offer a reciprocating motion of, typically, twelve to fifteen feet (three to five metres). Small foot platforms were attached to the rods at the same distance apart as the engine stroke and fixed platforms were built onto the shaft walls, spaced to coincide with the top and bottom positions of each of the moving platforms. The moving platforms were often small, typically [...] square, to make the miner stand close to the centre-line of the rod and thus keep a safe distance from the sides of the shaft. For the same reason, grab handles were fitted directly above each one. To go up or down, the miner would step onto the travelling platform and allow himself to be carried to the next fixed platform, where he would step off and wait. At the end of the next stroke the next moving platform would line up and he <b>could</b> <b>step</b> onto it and repeat the process. [...] Miners could ascend and descend at the same time: the pause at the changeover point was made long enough for two men to change places. Counterweights – large boxes filled with stones attached through [...] "see-sawing" [...] horizontal beams – were installed to avoid the full weight of the shaft and men bearing on the top linkage. In the deepest mines, which could sink to more than 350fathoms (640metres), extra counterweights were provided at regular intervals, in horizontal side galleries.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the decade, Zbyszko became {{frustrated}} with his inability to shed his label as Bruno Sammartino's protégé. He challenged Sammartino to an exhibition match, claiming this was the only way he <b>could</b> <b>step</b> out of Sammartino's shadow. Sammartino eventually agreed to the match after Zbyszko threatened to retire if he was not granted the match. The trainer and pupil faced one another in Allentown on January 22, 1980, with Sammartino dominating {{the early stages of the}} match. After Sammartino threw him out of the ring, an irate Zbyszko seized a wooden chair and struck Sammartino, leaving him in a pool of blood in the middle of the ring and instantly turning Zbyszko into a reviled heel. So despised was Zbyszko by partisan Sammartino fans in the northeast that his car was repeatedly damaged and taxis in which he was travelling were overturned by fans. Zbyszko was struck with an iron pole following a match with Ivan Putski, and was stabbed in the buttock following a match with Pedro Morales in the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany, New York. After turning against Sammartino, Zbyszko was approached by the WWWF's [...] "Unholy Trio" [...] of managers (Fred Blassie, The Grand Wizard, and [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano), but he decided to continue wrestling without a manager. Sammartino and Zbyszko fought one another repeatedly in a lengthy feud that stretched throughout 1980. In the course of the feud, Zbyszko began referring to himself as [...] "The New Living Legend" [...] (a reference to Sammartino, who was often addressed as [...] "The Living Legend"). The feud culminated in a steel cage match at Showdown at Shea at Shea Stadium in Flushing, New York on August 9, 1980 that saw Sammartino defeat Zbyszko in front of an audience of 36,295.|$|E
