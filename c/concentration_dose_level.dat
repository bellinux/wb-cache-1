40|$|Introduction: Reliable {{in vitro}} and in silico assays as {{alternatives}} for in vivo developmental toxicity studies are urgently needed, for the replacement, reduction and refinement (3 Rs) of animal use in toxicological research. Therefore, relevant biomarkers for in vivo developmental toxicity in in vitro assays are needed. Areas covered: The present review gives {{an overview of}} alternative assays, as described in literature, for in vivo developmental toxicity, including the effects (readouts) assessed in these assays. The authors discuss how these data {{may be used to}} obtain relevant biomarkers for in vivo developmental toxicity, and how in vitro effect data can be translated to the in vivo situation using physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modeling. Expert opinion: Relevance of readouts in in vitro developmental toxicity assays as predictive biomarkers for in vivo developmental toxicity should be evaluated by comparing the obtained in vitro effect concentrations with in vivo internal <b>concentrations</b> at <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> causing developmental toxicity. Extrapolation of the in vitro effect concentrations to in vivo <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> using PBK modeling (i. e., reverse dosimetry) is promising in its use to derive points of departure for risk assessment, enabling the use of in vitro toxicity data in the safety assessment of compounds.

One aspect of this program involves monitoring plutonium levels in at-risk workers. High-risk workers are monitored using the ultra-sensitive Therrnal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) technique to ensure compliance with DOE standards. TIMS is used to measure atom ratios of 239 Pua nd 240 Puw ith respect to a tracer isotope ('Pu). These ratios are then used to calculate the amount of 239 Pu and 240 Pup resent. This low-level atom counting technique allows the calculation of the concentration levels of 239 Pu and 240 Pu in urine for at risk workers. From these <b>concentration</b> <b>levels,</b> <b>dose</b> assessments can be made and worker exposure levels can be monitored.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionSafety Pharmacology {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in mouse, rat, and non-human primate to determine in vivo effects of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) on the central nervous system, respiratory system, and cardiovascular system. Effects on the hERG potassium channel current was evaluated in vitro. MethodsASOs contained terminal 2 ′-O-methoxyethyl nucleotides, central deoxy nucleotides, and a phosphorothioate backbone. Neurobehavior was evaluated by Functional Observatory Battery in rodents. Respiratory function was directly measured in rodents by plethysmograph; respiratory rate and blood gases were measured in monkey. Basic cardiovascular endpoints were measured in rat; cardiovascular evaluation in monkey involved implanted telemetry units. In single and repeat dose studies ASOs were administered by subcutaneous injection at up to 300 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, and 40 mg/kg in mouse, rat, or monkey, respectively. Assays were performed in HEK 293 or CHO-K 1 cells, stably transfected with hERG cDNA, at ASO concentrations of up to 300 μM. ResultsNo apparent effects were noted for respiratory or CNS function. Continuous monitoring of the cardiovascular system in monkey demonstrated no ASO-related changes in blood pressures, heart rate, or ECG and associated parameters (i. e., QRS duration). Specific assessment of the hERG potassium channel indicated no potential for actions on ventricular repolarization or modest effects only at excessive concentrations. DiscussionThe absence of direct actions on neurobehavior and respiratory function associated with the administration of ASOs in safety pharmacology core battery studies is consistent with published toxicology studies. The combination of in vitro hERG studies and in vivo studies in rat and monkey are consistent with no direct actions by ASOs on cardiac cell function or electrical conduction at relevant <b>concentrations</b> and <b>dose</b> <b>levels.</b> Taken as a whole, dedicated studies focused on the safety pharmacology of specific organ systems {{do not appear to}} add significant data for interpretation of potential adverse effects. The need for dedicated studies for future ASOs in the same class is questionable, as a more encompassing data set can be collected in repeat dose and longer-term toxicology studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimisation}} {{of image}} quality vs. radiation dose {{is an important}} task in medical imaging. To obtain maximum validity of the optimisation, it {{must be based on}} clinical images. Images at different <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> can then either be obtained by collecting patient images at the different <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> sought to investigate-including additional exposures and permission from an ethical committee-or by manipulating images to simulate different <b>dose</b> <b>levels.</b> The aim of the present work was to develop a method of simulating dose reduction for digital radiographic systems. The method uses information about the detective quantum efficiency and noise power spectrum at the original and simulated <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> to create an image containing filtered noise. When added to the original image this results in an image with noise which, in terms of frequency content, agrees with the noise present in an image collected at the simulated <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b> To increase the validity, the method takes local dose variations in the original image into account.

30|$|The maximum {{tolerable}} dose (MTD) {{was defined}} as the <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> at which there was a 1 / 3 probability to experience a dose-limiting event averaged over the cycles 1 – 5. The following events were defined as dose-limiting (1) recovery of WBC (> 2500 /mm 3) later than day 15, (2) recovery of plt count (> 80.000 /mm 3) later than day 15, (3) active infection preventing start of next course. A generalization to parallel accrual of the up and down sampling scheme described by Storer et al. (Storer 1989) was developed to determine the idarubicin <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> for a new patient. The sampling algorithm made use of all the information on toxicities and dose-limiting events observed in the CIVEP cycles number one to five of patients who had been treated before. Essentially, a patient was assigned to the next higher <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> once two cycles, who had been treated at the current or a higher <b>dose</b> <b>level,</b> did not experience a dose-limiting event. The <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> for a new patient was decreased by one step if a patient experienced a dose-limiting event during a cycle at the current or a lower <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b> Toxicity results that did not have an immediate effect on the current dose by these rules were queued to have an effect in case a change in the current <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> rendered them relevant. Using this sampling scheme the current <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> oscillates stochastically around the maximal tolerable dose. A close telephone monitoring after each of the chemotherapy courses was necessary to gather the information from treating physicians whether the retreatment on day 16 was possible.

Three or six patients at each <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> received 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg kg– 1 of MKC- 454 as 90 -min intravenous infusions. The first dose was followed in 3 weeks by nine weekly doses. Target trough serum concentration has been set at 10 μg ml– 1 based on in vitro observations. The mean value of minimum trough serum <b>concentrations</b> at each <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> were 3. 58 ± 0. 63, 6. 53 ± 5. 26, 40. 2 ± 7. 12 and 87. 9 ± 23. 5 μg ml– 1 respectively. At 2 mg kg– 1, although minimum trough serum concentrations were lower than the target trough concentration {{with a wide range}} of variation, trough concentrations increased and exceeded the target concentration, as administrations were repeated weekly. Finally 2 mg kg– 1 was considered to be sufficient to achieve the target trough concentration by the weekly dosing regimen. One patient receiving 1 mg kg– 1 had grade 3 fever, one at the 1 mg kg– 1 level had severe fatigue defined as grade 3, and one at 8 mg kg– 1 had severe bone pain of grade 3. No antibodies against MKC- 454 were detected in any patients. Objective tumour responses were observed in two patients; one receiving 4 mg kg– 1 had a partial response in lung metastases and the other receiving 8 mg kg– 1 had a complete response in soft tissue metastases.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{performed}} a dose-escalation study {{to investigate the}} safety of sorafenib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in chemo-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). METHODS: Six patients were included per <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b> Following docetaxel infusion on day 1 (75 mg/m(2) /q 3 weeks), sorafenib was administered at 200 mg BID on days 2 - 19 (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1), at 200 mg BID on days 1 - 21 (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2), at 400 mg BID on days 2 - 19 (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 3), at 400 mg BID on days 1 - 21 (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 4). Maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded if ≥ 2 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during cycle 1. The recommended phase 2 dose for sorafenib was defined as one <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> below MTD. If MTD was not reached, the highest feasible dose would be selected to treat an expanded cohort to confirm safety. RESULTS: Two DLTs were observed during sorafenib dose-escalation consisting of grade 4 febrile neutropenia (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2) and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (HFS) (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 3). Our pharmacokinetic results showed an increased exposure to docetaxel across all <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> during sorafenib comedication. The main grade ≥ 3 toxicities were neutropenia (35 %), HFS (27 %), and febrile neutropenia (19 %). The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate was 74 %. Median overall survival was 25. 2 months. CONCLUSION: Three-weekly docetaxel and prednisone could be combined with sorafenib at 400 mg BID on days 1 - 21 without reaching MTD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{simultaneous}} integrated boost (SIB) technique with dose per fraction {{slightly higher}} than 2 Gy offers the advantages of shortening the treatment time and increasing the biologically equivalent dose to the tumor. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the feasibility of a dose-escalating radiotherapy treatment by using a SIB-IMRT approach in patients with early and moderately advanced head and neck cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven consecutive patients with pharyngo-laryngeal T 2 N 0 or T 2 N 1, or laryngeal T 3 N 0 SCC were included. The therapeutic PTVs were treated according to three consecutive <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> i. e., 69 Gy in 30 fractions of 2. 3 Gy (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> I), 72 Gy in 30 fractions of 2. 4 Gy (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> II) or 75 Gy in 30 fractions of 2. 5 Gy (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> III). The prophylactic PTVs received a dose of 55. 5 Gy delivered in 30 fractions of 1. 85 Gy. The primary endpoint of the study was acute toxicity assessed during treatment and during the first 3 months following the completion of radiotherapy. The secondary endpoints included loco-regional control, disease-free survival, overall survival and late toxicity at 2 years of follow-up. The study design allowed patients to be enrolled in the second <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> group if no more than 10 % of grade 4 acute toxicity was observed on the first <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> group within 3 months after the completion of IMRT, and so on for the third level group. RESULTS: Forty-four men and 13 women were included in the trial. The majority of them presented with oropharyngeal cancer (53 %) and laryngeal cancer (33 %). Only 3 patients developed grade 4 acute mucositis during treatment, one in each <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b> Thirty-two patients (56 %) experienced grade 3 toxicity, mostly dermatitis and mucositis, without any significant difference between the groups. Late grade 1 and 2 xerostomia was seen in 53 % and 33 % of patients, respectively. Transient grade 4 late toxicity was observed in 16 % of all patients and was equally distributed among the groups. The 2 -year loco-regional control was 82 % for all 3 groups (79 % <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> I, 88 % <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> II, 79 % <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> III).

Complete response was observed in 18 of 21 (86 %) and 13 of 16 (81 %) evaluated patients at <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> I and II (p < 0. 7), respectively, with actuarial 1 -year local control at 85 % and 87 % (p = n. s.), and 1 -year overall survival at 82 % and 54 % (p = 0. 06), at <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> I and II, respectively. In 4 of 9 patients, the site of relapse was in the boosted (18) F-FDG-PET-delineated region. CONCLUSIONS: For head and neck cancer, PET-guided dose escalation appears to be well-tolerated.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Strontium 89 (Sr 89), a beta-emitter {{particle}} that precipitates in bone, has a palliative role in {{the treatment}} of painful bony metastases in androgen-resistant prostate cancer (ARPC) patients. Questionable additional bene-fit has been reported when it was combined with chemotherapy. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of Sr 89 given in combination with gemcitabine in ARPC patients with painful bony metas-tases. Methods: Gemcitabine was given at a loading dose of 1000 mg/m 2 on day 1. A single dose of strontium- 89 (4 mCi) was administered on day 8. On day 29, gemcitabine at a dose of 100 (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1), 200 (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2) and 400 (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 3) mg/m 2 was delivered for once weekly for 7 weeks.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{integration}} of the non-cross-resistant chemotherapeutic agents capecitabine and vinorelbine into an intensified dose-dense sequential anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimen in high-risk early breast cancer (EBC) could improve efficacy, but this combination was not examined in this context so far. Methods Patients with stage II/IIIA EBC (four or more positive lymph nodes) received post-operative intensified dose-dense sequential epirubicin (150 mg/m² every 2 weeks) and paclitaxel (225 mg/m² every 2 weeks) with filgrastim and darbepoetin alfa, followed by capecitabine alone (<b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> 1 and 3) or with vinorelbine (<b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> 2 and 4). Capecitabine was given on days 1 - 14 every 21 days at 1000 or 1250 mg/m 2 twice daily (<b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> 1 / 2 and 3 / 4, respectively). Vinorelbine 25 mg/m 2 was given on days 1 and 8 of each 21 -day course (<b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> 2 and 4). Results Fifty-one patients were treated. There was one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1. At <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2 (capecitabine and vinorelbine), five of 10 patients experienced DLTs. Therefore evaluation of vinorelbine was abandoned and <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 3 (capecitabine monotherapy) was expanded. Hand-foot syndrome and diarrhoea were dose limiting with capecitabine 1250 mg/m 2 twice daily. At 35. 2 months' median follow-up, the estimated 3 -year relapse-free and overall survival rates were 82 % and 91 %, respectively. Conclusions Administration of capecitabine monotherapy after sequential dose-dense epirubicin and paclitaxel is feasible in node-positive EBC, while the combination of capecitabine and vinorelbine as used here caused more DLTs.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the performance of ultra-low dose CT for the diagnosis of pediatric-like fractures and ascertain the lowest <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> sufficient for diagnostics. Materials and Methods: Fifty-one bones of young pig cadavers were artificially fractured and subsequently examined by using a 64 multi-detector CT with 36 various <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> down to a dose comparable with that of X-rays. Two pediatric radiologists analysed the CT scans {{according to the presence}} or absence of a fracture, determination of the fracture type and the displacement as well as the diagnostic certainty. For each dose protocol, a success rate for the correct determination of the above-mentioned CT analyses was calculated. A success rate of at least 95 % was considered sufficient for diagnostics. Results: All but the lowest <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> were sufficient to identify the fracture. Only the two lowest <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> were insufficient to detect the fracture type. All <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> were adequate for the identification of the displacement. The lowest <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> sufficient for diagnostics was 120 kVp, 11 mAs, and pitch 1. 5, with a CTDIvol of 10 % of a standard dose and an effective dose three times as large as that of X-rays.

Treatment was administered for a maximum of 9 cycles or until PD or unacceptable toxicity (UT). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) {{was defined as the}} <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> immediately preceding that in which dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) has been identified. DLT was the dose causing UT (defined with conventional NCI criteria) in ‡ 2 patients within a 3 - 6 patients cohort during the first cycle. Pharmacodynamic studies were conducted to evaluate tissue and circulating biologic factors. Results: To date 9 {{patients were}} enrolled. During the first cycle of therapy, according to the phase I objective definition, DLT was recorded in 1 patient at <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> I (diarrhea G 3) and 2 patients at <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> II (diarrhea G 3 - 4). Therefore, <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> II was defined as the DLT and 3 additional patients were treated at I <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> and no further UT was experienced.

40|$|PURPOSE: Pre{{clinical}} {{and clinical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that inhibition of prenylation can radiosensitize cell lines with activation of Ras and produce clinical response in patients with cancer. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the maximally tolerated dose of the dual farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor L- 778, 123 in combination with radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: L- 778, 123 was given by continuous intravenous infusion with concomitant radiotherapy to 59. 4 Gy in standard fractions. Two L- 778, 123 <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> were tested: 280 mg/m 2 /day over weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5 for <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1; and 560 mg/m 2 /day over weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 for <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2. RESULTS: There were no dose-limiting toxicities observed in the eight patients treated on <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1. Two of the four patients on <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2 experienced dose-limiting toxicities consisting of grade 3 diarrhea in one case and grade 3 gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with grade 3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in the other case. Other common toxicities were mild neutropenia, dehydration, hyperglycemia, and nausea/vomiting. One patient on <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1 showed a partial response of 6 months in duration. Both reversible inhibition of HDJ 2 farnesylation and radiosensitization of a study patient-derived cell line were demonstrated in the presence of L- 778, 123.

40|$|The {{county of}} Dalarna is at present {{carrying}} {{through a process}} of digitalization where traditional x-ray film is being replaced with digital detectors. Earlier used methods for dose optimization turned out not being sufficient. This report presents a method to harmonize <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> between x- ray sites equipped with Fujifilm imaging plate systems. An exposure index, S, related to the <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> of the examination is computed to every x-ray image.

40|$|SUMMARY: When Efexor(R) (venlafaxine) became {{available}} in Sweden, a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) service {{was developed in}} the authors' laboratory. This analytical service was available to all physicians in the country. From March 1996, to November 1997, 797 serum concentration analyses of venlafaxine (VEN) and its main metabolites, O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV), N-desmethylvenlafaxine (NDV), and N,O-didesmethylvenlafaxine (DDV) were requested. These samples, each of which was accompanied by clinical information on a specially designed request form, represented 635 inpatients or outpatients, comprising all ages, treated in a naturalistic setting. The first sample per patient, drawn as a trough value in steady state and with documented concomitant medication, was further evaluated pharmacokinetically (n = 187). The doses prescribed were from 37. 5 mg/d to 412. 5 mg/d. There was a wide interindividual variability of serum <b>concentrations</b> on each <b>dose</b> <b>level,</b> and the mean coefficient of variation of the dose-corrected concentrations (C/D) was 166 % for C/D VEN, 60 % for C/D ODV, 151 % for C/D NDV, and 59 % for C/D DDV. The corresponding CV for the ratio ODV/VEN was 110 %. However, within patients over time, the C/D VEN and ODV/VEN variation was low, indicating stability in individual metabolizing capacity. Patients over 65 years of age had significantly higher concentrations of C/D VEN and C/D ODV than the younger patients. Women had higher C/D NDV and C/D DDV, and a higher NDV/VEN ratio than men, and smokers showed lower C/D ODV and C/D DDV than nonsmokers. A number of polycombinations of drugs were assessed for interaction screening, and a trend for lowered ODV/VEN ratio was found, predominantly with concomitant medication with CNS-active drug(s) known to inhibit CYP 2 D 6...|$|R

40|$|Background:Irinotecan and {{cisplatin}} individually {{are active}} in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Each is synergistic with radiation. Dosages of 65 mg/m 2 of irinotecan and 30 mg/m 2 of cisplatin Q weekly times four every 6 weeks yielded a 36 % response rate and median survival of 11. 6 months in advanced NSCLC (Jagasia et al.; Clinical Cancer Reserch 7 : 68, 2001). A weekly schedule for each agent (versus less frequent doses) limits toxicity and increases the opportunity for radiosensitization. Materials and Methods:We initiated a phase I study of weekly irinotecan and cisplatin during radical thoracic radiation (TRT). Cisplatin was fixed at 25 mg/m 2 Q weekly times seven. Irinotecan was dosed initially at 30 mg/m 2 per week for 7 weeks and was increased by 10 mg/m 2 per week in three- to six-patient cohorts. TRT was administered in 34 single daily fractions to 63 Gy. Eligibility stipulated locally advanced NSCLC; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1; ≤ 10 % unintended weight loss; and adequate physiologic indices. Results:Fifteen patients were accrued: nine were stage IIIB, five were stage IIIA, and one had isolated mediastinal node recurrence after prior surgery. Median age was 65 years (range, 47 – 77). Seven patients received irinotecan at a dose of 30 mg/m 2 per week; (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1). Seven other patients received irinotecan at a dose of 40 mg/m 2 per week; (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2). The one other patient received irinotecan in doses of 50 mg/m 2 per week; (<b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 3). Neutropenic fever occurred in one patient each at <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> 1 and 2. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in three patients at each <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b> Transient grade 3 diarrhea occurred in one patient at <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1. Esophagitis of grade 3 or higher occurred in one patient each at <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> 2 and 3. There was one late grade 3 pneumonitis at <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2. Delivered irinotecan dose intensity for <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1 was 27 mg/m 2 per week; for <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2, it was 31. 4 mg/m 2 per week. Nine of 13 evaluable patients (69 %) responded. At median potential follow-up of 5 years, 14 have progressed, and 11 have died. Projected median survival is 28 months; one patient who was treated for mediastinal node recurrence remains free from progression at 6 years. Conclusion:Weekly irinotecan and cisplatin combined with radical TRT (63 Gy) is active and fairly well tolerated in locally advanced NSCLC. In combination with fixed-dose cisplatin (25 mg/m 2 per week), the maximum-tolerated dose of irinotecan is 30 mg/m 2 per week...|$|R
