The system reliability is evaluated by recursive relations with unit-lifetimes Ti (i = 1, [...] ., n) that have a general joint distribution function F(t). On the basis of the derived expression, simulation techniques have been developed for the evaluation of the system reliability and the mean time to failure, useful when dealing with large systems or correlated unit-lifetimes and less mathematically manageable distributions. Simulation results are presented for various lifetime distributions and comparisons are made with derived analytic results for some special distributions and moderate values of n. © 2005 Elsevier B.

30|$|Machine {{interference}} {{problems with}} spares are widely studied by many authors in different frameworks using queueing theoretic approaches. The maximum profit with {{the utilization of}} any machining system {{can be obtained by}} providing proper combination of maintainability and standby support to the system which may improve the system’s reliability under unavoidable techno-economic constraints. It is worthwhile to cite some important contribution in this direction. The analytic solutions of a single-server queueing system with a warm type of standbys were given by Gopalan (1975). The concept of standby support in machine repair problems was incorporated by many researchers, namely Sivazlian and Wang (1989), Gupta and Rao Srinivasa (1996), Wang and Kuo (2000), and many more. Jain (1997) developed a (m, M) machine repair problem model with state-dependent rates and standby support. Jain et al. (2004 b) have proposed a bilevel control policy model for machine repair systems. Ke and Wang (2007) obtained the steady-state probabilities of the number of failed machines in the system and other performance measures for the machine repair problem with vacations and two types of spares. A survey report on the machine interference problem has been presented by Haque and Armstrong (2007). Jain et al. (2008) investigated a multi-component repairable system with mixed <b>standbys</b> (warm and <b>cold).</b> Hajeeh and Jabsheh (2009) analyzed a multi-component machining system having two modes of failure. Jain et al. (2010) also published a survey article on various aspects of machine repair problems by emphasizing the practical importance of Markov queueing models. Recently, Yuan and Meng (2011) analyzed the reliability of a warm standby repairable system with priority constraint. The reliability and availability analysis of four series configurations with warm and <b>cold</b> <b>standbys</b> was studied by Hajeeh (2011). More recently, Ke and Wu (2012) have done an investigation on machine repair problem with standbys support.|$|R
40|$|High {{demands on}} {{advanced}} safety and driving functions, such as active safety and lane departure warnings, increase a vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s dependency on automotive electrical/electronic architectures. Hard real-time requirements and high reliability constraints must be satisfied for the correct functioning of these safety-critical features, {{which can be}} achieved by using the AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) standard. The AUTOSAR standard was introduced to simplify automotive system design while offering inter-operability, scalability, extensibility, and flexibility. The current version of AUTOSAR does not assist in the replication of tasks for recovering from task failures. Instead, the standard assumes that architecture designers will introduce custom extensions to meet such reliability needs. The introduction of affordable techniques with predictable properties for meeting reliability requirements will prove to be very valuable in future versions of AUTOSAR. In this paper, we propose a new Software-Component (SW-C) allocation algorithm called R-FLOW (Reliable application-FLOW-aware SW-C partitioning algorithm) for fail-stop processors to support fault-tolerance with bounded recovery times, and we integrate the R-FLOW algorithm into AUTOSAR. R-FLOW leverages different types of replication schemes to satisfy reliability and timing constraints, while offering a high degree of resource utilization and flexibility. Specifically, R-FLOW classifies real-time periodic tasks into Hard Recovery tasks, Soft Recovery tasks, andBest-Effort Recovery tasks. Hot Standbys are used for recovering from failures of hard recovery tasks, whereas <b>Cold</b> <b>Standbys</b> are utilized for recovering from failures of soft recovery and best-effort recovery tasks. With this goal in mind, we design and implement our proposed architecture within the guidelines of the current AUTOSAR framework. We have built an at-scale prototyping platform, comprising of Freescale HCS 12 X processing boards, a dual-channel FlexRay bus, and a CAN network. Our proposed architecture is evaluated on this platform using reliability and timeliness metrics in the context of different fault scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Electricity {{consumption}} in the United Kingdom is continually growing with demand from the domestic sector a potential/major contribution to this increase in consumption. Although demand is increasing, little information exists on the domestic components that contribute {{to an increase in}} domestic energy consumption. Thus, a greater understanding on what is contributing to the increase in domestic energy usage is a pre-requisite to understand how it can be reduced in the future or, if not reduced, contained at its current level. This article discusses a separation filter designed for disaggregating domestic electrical demand data into different appliance categories. The filter is applied to a real time domestic electrical dataset spanning 1 Â year, and trends in <b>standby,</b> <b>cold,</b> heating element spikes and residual demand are identified. Several reasons to account for each of the trends are discussed. Additionally, the filter is applied to synthetic data both to confirm the accuracy of the separation filter and to finely adjust the filter for future application. The results indicate an increase in occupancy-related demand consumption during the winter months and an increase in cold consumption during the summer months. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that in contrast to changes observed in occupancy-related demand and cold consumption, there is little variation in standby and heating element spike consumption throughout the year. Finally, the potential advantage of incorporating a tailored separation filter into domestic smart meters is discussed. Domestic Electrical demand Power Appliances Energy Demand profiles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new fault tolerance scheme suitable for humanoid robot applications. In the future, various tasks ranging from daily chores to safety-related tasks {{will be carried}} out by individual humanoid robots. If the importance of the tasks is different, the required dependability will vary accordingly. Therefore, for mobile humanoid robots operating under power constraints, fault tolerance that dynamically changes based on the importance of the tasks is desirable because fault-tolerant designs involving hardware redundancy are power intensive. In the proposed fault tolerance scheme, a duplex computer system switches between hot standby and <b>cold</b> <b>standby</b> according to each individual task. However, in mobile humanoid robots, a safety issue arises when <b>cold</b> <b>standby</b> is used for the standby computer unit.

Various researchers including (Goel et al. 1990) have analyzed two-unit <b>cold</b> <b>standby</b> system models assuming that the repair of the failed unit continues until the unit becomes as good as new. Gupta and Goel (1991) analyzed a two-unit (one priority and other ordinary) <b>cold</b> <b>standby</b> system model assuming that each unit has no independent and non-identical components. It is also assumed that, if the repair of the ordinary unit is not complete within a specified time, known as the maximum repair time, then the ordinary unit is discarded. They have assumed that failure and repair times are uncorrelated. Gupta and Mumtaz (1996) analyzed a two-identical unit <b>cold</b> <b>standby</b> system model, assuming that an order is placed to replace the failed unit by a new one if the unit is not repaired during the specified time limit. Many papers in the field of reliability theory have investigated system models assuming that upon failure of a unit, it is replaced by its standby unit. Moafi et al. (1991) presented a comparison of two models of a system that has two non-identical active series units with identical cold standbys. Mokaddis et al. (1997) have studied the two-unit <b>cold</b> <b>standby</b> redundant system where the repairman is always available to inspect and repair the failed unit, and replace the failed unit with the standby unit if it is available instantaneously.
