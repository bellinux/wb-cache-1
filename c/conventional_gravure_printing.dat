40|$|To {{realize the}} {{potential}} cost savings promised by printed electronics, high-speed, large-volume manufacturing methods must be established. Rotary printing {{techniques such as}} those used in the graphic arts are ideal candidates. However, very {{little research has been}} done on utilizing these techniques for printed electronics because digital processes such ink-jet printing have offered researchers a low-cost flexible solution for demonstrating the printability of their materials, despite the fact that these processes may be difficult to scale for large-volume manufacturing. 	In this thesis, gravure, a printing process which offers the highest resolution, highest speed, and largest volume production in the graphic arts is demonstrated as a viable technique for printed electronics. In order to make laboratory-scale research with this technique possible, a custom table-top gravure printing press was designed. This press allows for small amounts of ink to be utilized during a print and enables multi-layer prints with a registration accuracy not seen in <b>conventional</b> <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> presses and suitable for printed electronics. With this press, printing processes to deposit functional materials for printed circuits are investigated with a focus on developing process modules to manufacture fully printed organic thin film transistors. Considerable effort is made to establish processes to deposit metallic lines with feature sizes below 20 &# 956;m and a total surface roughness below 20 nm, uniform thin films of polymer dielectrics with thicknesses as low as 70 nm, and high performance polymer semiconductors. These processes are then integrated to manufacture capacitors suitable for integrated circuit components and organic thin film transistors with operating frequencies as high as 18 kHz...|$|E

40|$|Printed {{electronics}} {{is a novel}} microfabrication paradigm that {{is particularly}} well suited for fabrication of low-cost, large-area electronics on flexible substrates. Applications include flexible displays, solar cells, RFID tags or sensor networks. <b>Gravure</b> <b>printing</b> is a particularly promising printing technique because it combines high print speed with high resolution patterning. In this thesis, <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> for printed electronics is advanced on multiple levels. The gravure process is advanced in terms of tooling and understanding of printing physics {{as well as its}} application to substrate preparation and device fabrication. <b>Gravure</b> <b>printing</b> is applied to transform paper into a viable substrate for printed electronics. Paper is very attractive for printed electronics because it is low-cost, biodegradable, lightweight and ubiquitous. However, printing of high-performance electronic devices onto paper has been limited by the large surface roughness and ink absorption of paper. This is overcome here by <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> a local smoothing layer and printed organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) are demonstrated to exhibit performance on-par with device on plastic substrates. If highly-scaled features are to be <b>printed</b> by <b>gravure,</b> traditional gravure roll making techniques are limited in terms of pattern definition and surface finish.

The obtained analytical dependencies were used to confirm the explanation of the processes that occur during the fabrication of nanophotonic coverings with offset <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> plates. As a result of experimental studies, it was determined that the different character of the dependency of total luminescence intensity of nanophotonic elements from the percentage of a pad is explained by the use of different types of offset <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> plates, where the size of raster points remains constant in one case and changes in the other case, while the depth of the printing elements accordingly changes or remains constant.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a process flow to allow the fabrication of organic field effect transistors with self-aligned source and drain electrodes, and sub-micron channel lengths on flexible plastic substrates. This was achieved using a combination of bilayer nanoimprint lithography, <b>gravure</b> <b>printed</b> or photolithographically patterned dielectric, and bilayer self-aligned lithography. Effective channel lengths over an order of magnitude could be defined from 375 - 3800 nm. Electrode overlaps between gate-drain and gate-source of 100 - 200 nm are demonstrated, yielding very low channel-length normalised overlap capacitances of 0. 1 - 0. 6 fF per ??m. The viability and behaviour of these architectures was investigated using zone-cast, <b>gravure</b> and inkjet <b>printed</b> semiconductors. State-of-the-art transition frequencies in the range 1 - 6 MHz were achieved at operating biases < 30 V. The molecular packing of a zone-cast small molecule p-type semiconductor (TIPS-pentacene) was observed to be influenced by the underlying architecture. Simple techniques were developed to quantify <b>gravure</b> <b>printed</b> film quality. Periodic modulation of printed films was observed to be a function of gravure clich?? cell geometry and ink formulation. Both <b>gravure</b> and inkjet <b>printed</b> p- and n-type semiconductors (DPPT-TT and P(NDI 2 OD-T 2)) were studied. Thin <b>gravure</b> <b>printed</b> dielectrics were observed to systematically increase effective mobilities, at the expense of an increase in leakage current.

The inhomogeneity of the <b>gravure</b> <b>printed</b> LEP layers was defined by two parameters, being the normalized standard deviation from the mean layer thickness, {{as well as the}} anisotropy or 'directionality' of the roughness features.

The prediction error for the three output parameters was of the order: anisotropy > roughness > mean layer thickness.

40|$|Graphical <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> {{is a very}} {{reliable}} {{process to}} transfer smallest amounts of fluid droplets to a substrate. Nevertheless, enabling this printing technique to produce large-area, ultra-thin layers for applications such as {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) is a challenging task. This application not only imposes strong requirements on the printing technology but also on large-area measurement methods. Characterizing the homogeneity of sub- 100 nm thin layers across the total printing area is one of the two central topics of the present investigation. Utilizing optical interference from the thin film samples I developed and evaluated a method which successfully determined the thickness of thin, organic semiconductor layers with an accuracy better than 5 nm. Sample sizes of up to 150 × 150 mm² could be characterized within seconds using two hardware setups. I enabled a microscope and a modified flatbed scanner to acquire conventional RGB-images of the thin film samples. These images were then compared to a corresponding physical model using MATLAB resulting in a laterally resolved thickness map. The method is predestinated for being part of an inline process control. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, I deduced a physical understanding of <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> to produce ultra-thin, homogeneous layers from low viscous ink solutions which are based on small molecules dissolved in toluene. To this purpose, I processed on two consecutively mounted 150 × 150 mm² ITO-coated glass substrates with varying process parameters, resulting in a total number of 128 different <b>gravure</b> <b>printed</b> fields, each 30 × 30 mm² in size. Applying the large-area characterization method developed in the first part, I measured the thicknesses of all sub- 100 nm printed layers (with a total area of ~ 1800 cm²). This thickness data was analyzed regarding several surface parameters, such as roughness, dominant lateral wavelength, skewness and kurtosis. These surface parameters were referred to the physical models of fluid and thin film dynamics with respect to the underlying process parameters. As a consequence, two distinct process windows for the <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> process to produce homogeneous, ultra-thin layers were identified. The process windows were defined by two types of ink transfer mechanisms, namely single cell transfer and film splitting transfer, as well as appropriate film leveling and drying times. The two process windows for producing homogeneous, ultra-thin layers using <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> have been reported in the literature and were demonstrated through the present experiments.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of this study}} supposes {{that it is possible}} to design a more accurate prepress, 2 ̆ 2 user friendly 2 ̆ 2 method of type selection for <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> than the system used today. The experimental methods chosen for this project were based on the suggestions made by the Gravure Association of America, the professors at Rochester Institute of Technology, and the technical staff at Areata Graphics, Buffalo, NY. The purpose of these methods was to gather technical information about how the <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> process generates type images. More specifically, this meant investigating the effects of the gravure screen on type. To accomplish this, line and circle patterns of various widths and a variety of typefaces, styles, and sizes were <b>printed</b> by <b>gravure</b> at Areata Graphics in four different engraving settings most commonly used for publication printing. The printed samples were measured and analyzed, both visually and with magnification equipment. The typeface samples of different styles and sizes were subjected to a panel review by five <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> professionals through the Gravure Association of America for their acceptablility or unacceptability for gravure reproduction. The results of the panel review were subjected to statistical analysis and correlations were drawn to the results of the visual observation and measurement of the samples. The results of this study suggest that a wider range of typefaces and typeface styles are suitable for <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> than those identified by the system of type selection used today. The existing guidelines discourage the use of several typefaces and typeface styles that registered favorable responses from the Gravure Association of America 2 ̆ 7 s panel review in this study. Garamond Light, a typeface characterized by fine serifs and thick and thin strokes, and traditionally thought as unsuitable for <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> was found to be acceptable at seven point size type. Statistical analysis of the Gravure Association of America 2 ̆ 7 s panel review revealed that only one of the four engraving settings tested (60 - 0), registered a high percentage of statistically significant responses. In engraving setting 60 - 0, it was possible to determine the cutoff point between acceptable and unacceptable type sizes for sixteen of the nineteen typeface styles tested. The majority of typeface styles were found to have lower acceptable type size limits at seven and eight point size type. The italic or oblique styles registered higher lower limits, at least one type size higher than the normal style of the same typeface. This can be attributed to the distortion of the line image caused by the gravure screen referred to as 2 ̆ 2 jaggies 2 ̆ 2 and observed to be more pronounced in italic and oblique styles as compared to normal styles. The visual observation of the 2 ̆ 2 jaggies 2 ̆ 2 in the line and circle patterns supports this conclusion. It appeared unusual that the statistical analysis of the GAA panel review recorded a high percentage of statistically significant findings for only one engraving setting. The GAA judges 2 ̆ 7 responses appeared to follow the same pattern for all the engraving settings except that the finer screen settings recorded more favorable responses in smaller type sizes. Statistical tests were run on the original experimental data assuming that if type sizes two and three had been included in the type sample review, the judges would have found them unacceptable for <b>gravure</b> <b>printing.</b> The results of these tests recorded one hundred percent statistically significant findings for all four engraving settings. The finer screen settings recorded lower type size preferences which can be attributed to the sharper and finer rendering of smaller type sizes in these settings. It is recommended that the Gravure Association of America examine these findings and decide on their significance. The primary conclusion of the study is that the hypothesis is true. It is possible to design a more accurate prepress, 2 ̆ 2 user-friendly 2 ̆ 2 system of type selection for <b>gravure</b> <b>printing</b> than the system used today. This study explores the possibility of using a mechanical means of measuring typefaces for suitability for <b>gravure</b> <b>printing.</b> The results show that it is not possible to predict the suitability of a particular typeface, type style, or type size by mechanical means alone. However, a tool to measure typefaces may be a very effective way to eliminate a large number of typefaces, styles, and sizes from consideration.
