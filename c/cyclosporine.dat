25|$|Elevated serum {{levels of}} <b>cyclosporine</b> have been {{reported}} with concomitant use of <b>cyclosporine</b> with norfloxacin. Therefore, <b>cyclosporine</b> serum levels should be monitored and appropriate <b>cyclosporine</b> dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly.|$|E
25|$|Refractory {{ulcerative}} colitis. Patients with toxic megacolon (colonic dilation > 6cm {{and toxic}} appearing) {{who do not}} respond to steroid therapy within 72 hours should be consulted for colectomy. Those with less severe disease but {{do not respond to}} IV steroids within 7–10 days should be considered for colectomy or IV <b>cyclosporine.</b> IV <b>cyclosporine</b> at a rate of 2mg/kg/day and if no response in 7–10 days, colectomy should be considered. If response is seen, oral <b>cyclosporine</b> at 8mg/kg/day should be continued for 3–4 months while 6-MP or azathioprine is introduced. Those already on 6-MP or azathioprine should continue with these medications. A cholesterol level should be checked in patients taking <b>cyclosporine</b> as low cholesterol may predispose to seizures. Also, prophylaxis against PCP (Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia is advised.|$|E
25|$|The {{immunosuppressant}} drug <b>cyclosporine,</b> used {{to suppress the}} rejection of transplanted organs, {{is derived from the}} mold Tolypocladium inflatum.|$|E
25|$|Initially, rapamycin was {{developed}} as an antifungal drug against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans. Few years later its immunosuppressive properties were detected. Later studies {{led to the}} establishment of rapamycin as a major immunosuppressant against transplant rejection, along with <b>cyclosporine</b> A. By using rapamycin in combination with cyclosporin A, it enhanced the rejection prevention in renal transplantation. Therefore, it was possible to use lower doses of <b>cyclosporine</b> which minimized toxicity of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin is the INN and British Approved Name (BAN) while <b>{{cyclosporin}}e</b> is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and cyclosporin is {{a former}} BAN.|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin, {{ketoconazole}} and <b>cyclosporine</b> are CYP3A4 inhibitors {{and therefore}} inhibit the metabolic pathway of docetaxel. When used with anticonvulsants, which induce CYP3A4, an increased dose of docetaxel may be required.|$|E
25|$|Ofloxacin, {{like some}} other fluoroquinolones, may inhibit drug {{metabolizing}} enzymes and thereby increase {{blood levels of}} other drugs such as <b>cyclosporine,</b> theophyline, and warfarin, among others. These increased blood levels {{may result in a}} greater risk of side effects.|$|E
25|$|Kidney {{transplant}}: There is {{one report}} of a kidney transplant rejection following the three-month use of a supplement that contained alfalfa and black cohosh. This outcome is more likely due to alfalfa than black cohosh. Alfalfa's immune system boost might make the anti-rejection drug <b>cyclosporine</b> less effective.|$|E
25|$|Products {{containing}} multivalent cations, such as aluminium- or magnesium-containing antacids, {{and products}} containing calcium, iron or zinc invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Other drugs that interact with fluoroquinolones include sucralfate, probenecid, cimetidine, theophylline, warfarin, antiviral agents, phenytoin, <b>cyclosporine,</b> rifampin, pyrazinamide, and cycloserine.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin, also spelled <b>cyclosporine</b> and cyclosporin, is an {{immunosuppressant}} {{medication and}} natural product. It {{is used by}} mouth and injection into a vein for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, nephrotic syndrome, and in organ transplants to prevent rejection. It is also used as eye drops for keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes).|$|E
25|$|Anal fistulae*, {{known as}} perianal fistulae in dogs, are {{most common in}} German Shepherd Dogs. They are {{characterized}} by draining tracts in the skin around the anus. The cause is unknown. Surgical treatment is common, but recently use of <b>cyclosporine</b> in combination with ketoconazole {{has been shown to}} be effective.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{norfloxacin}} concomitantly {{has also}} been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving <b>cyclosporine,</b> on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia with sulfonylurea. Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of norfloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might {{increase the risk of}} methotrexate toxic reactions.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{bioavailability}} {{has been}} found to be 8% ±6% on its own and, when co-administered with <b>cyclosporine,</b> bioavailability increased to 90% ± 44%. In practice, docetaxel is administered intravenously only to increase dose precision. Evaluation of docetaxel pharmacokinetics in phase II and III clinical studies were with 100mg/m² dosages given over one-hour infusions every three weeks.|$|E
25|$|The acute uveitis {{phase of}} VKH is usually {{responsive}} to high-dose oral corticosteroids; parenteral administration {{is usually not}} required. However, ocular complications may require an subtenon or intravitreous injection of corticosteroids or bevacizumab. In refractory situations, other immunosuppressives such as <b>cyclosporine,</b> or tacrolimus, antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate), or biological agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or infliximab may be needed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s Peter Medawar, {{working for the}} National Institute for Medical Research, {{improved}} the understanding of rejection. Identifying the immune reactions in 1951, Medawar suggested that immunosuppressive drugs could be used. Cortisone had been recently discovered and the more effective azathioprine was identified in 1959, {{but it was not}} until the discovery of <b>cyclosporine</b> in 1970 that transplant surgery found a sufficiently powerful immunosuppressive.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, <b>cyclosporine</b> (Restasis) is {{available}} by prescription to help treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. Prescription drugs {{are also available}} that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as cevimeline (Evoxac) and pilocarpine. Salagen, a manufactured form of pilocarpine, {{can be used to}} help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. It is derived from the jaborandi plant.|$|E
25|$|Markedly {{elevated}} CPK levels or if a myopathy {{is suspected}} or diagnosed after dosing of atorvastatin has begun. Very rarely, atorvastatin may cause rhabdomyolysis, {{and it may}} be very serious leading to acute renal failure due to myoglobinuria. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected or diagnosed, atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately. The likelihood of developing a myopathy is increased by the co-administration of <b>cyclosporine,</b> fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, and azole antifungals.|$|E
25|$|In solid-organ {{transplant}}ation, ischemia-reperfusion injury {{can occur}} when blood returns to tissue {{for the first}} time in the transplant recipient. A major contributor to tissue damage results from activation of regulated necroptosis, which could include contributions from both necroptosis and mitochondrial permeability transition. Treatment with the drug <b>cyclosporine,</b> which represses the mitochondrial permeability transition effector Cyclophilin D, improves tissue survival primarily by inhibiting necrotic cell death, rather than its additional function as an immunosuppressant.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of ACE inhibitor with other drugs may increase {{effects of these}} drugs, but also the risk of adverse effects. The commonly reported adverse effects of drug combination with ACE are acute renal failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The drugs interacting with ACE inhibitor should be prescribed with caution. Special attention {{should be given to}} combinations of ACE inhibitor with other RAAS blockers, diuretics (especially potassium-sparing diuretics), NSAIDs, anticoagulants, <b>cyclosporine,</b> DPP-4 inhibitors, and potassium supplements.|$|E
25|$|Many {{surgeons}} gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to {{rejection of}} the transplanted heart by the patient's immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of <b>cyclosporine,</b> an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted xenotransplantation in a human patient, while attempting {{to save the life}} of a girl who was unable to leave artificial life support after her second aortic valve replacement.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the advent}} of <b>cyclosporine</b> that altered transplants from {{research}} surgery to life-saving treatment. In 1968 surgical pioneer Denton Cooley performed 17 transplants, including the first heart-lung transplant. Fourteen of his patients were dead within six months. By 1984 two-thirds of all heart transplant patients survived for five years or more. With organ transplants becoming commonplace, limited only by donors, surgeons moved on to riskier fields, including multiple-organ transplants on humans and whole-body transplant research on animals. On 9 March 1981, the first successful heart-lung transplant took place at Stanford University Hospital. The head surgeon, Bruce Reitz, credited the patient's recovery to cyclosporine-A.|$|E
25|$|In psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA), inhibitors of TNF, such as infliximab, improve {{the signs and}} symptoms. Several therapies with modest efficacy have been studied in nail psoriasis. Among available agents, higher quality data are available to support the efficacy of <b>cyclosporine</b> and infliximab. Based on studies in AS, the results suggest infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab {{have the potential to}} reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severely active axial involvement in PsA in patients who have had an inadequate response to NSAID (level 1a, grade A). The anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept; level 1b, grade A) are more effective for the treatment of enthesitis than traditional agents. Results suggest infliximab is effective for the treatment of dactylitis in PsA.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{causes of}} {{hyperkalemia}} are discussed as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause hyperkalemia through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause hyperkalemia in infants due to leakage of potassium {{out of the}} red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine tn patients with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as <b>cyclosporine,</b> tacrolimus, diazoxide, and minoxidil can cause hyperkalemia. Box jellyfish venom can also cause hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, <b>cyclosporine,</b> protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
25|$|Globally, {{pioneering}} {{experimental studies}} in the surgical technique of human organ transplantation {{were made in the}} early 1900s by the French surgeon Alexis Carrel, and successful transplants starting spreading worldwide after the Second World War. China herself began organ transplantation in the 1960s, which grew to an annual peak of over 13,000 transplants in 2004; and, despite some deaths from infection and hepatitis, the transplant programme has been successful in saving many lives. Though the number of transplants fell to under 11,000 annually by 2005, China still has one of the largest transplant programmes in the world. China explores innovative surgery, such as the world's first flesh and bone face transplant, performed by Professor Guo Shuzhong. Organ donation, however, has met resistance, and involuntary organ donation is illegal under Chinese law, as it is against Chinese tradition and culture, which attach symbolic life affirming importance to the kidney and heart. China is not alone in encountering donation difficulties; demand outstrips supply in most countries. The world-wide shortage has encouraged some countries—such as India—to trade in human organs. Reports of organs being removed from executed prisoners in China for sale internationally had been circulating since the mid-1980s, when a 1984 regulation made it legal to harvest organs from convicted criminals with the consent of the family or if the body goes unclaimed. Development of an immunosuppressant drug, <b>cyclosporine</b> A, made transplants a more viable option for patients.|$|E
500|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation, {{and all other}} therapies {{can best be described}} as bridges to transplantation. [...] While liver transplantation is by far the best available management option for HRS, the mortality of individuals with HRS {{has been shown to be}} as high as 25% within the first month after transplantation. [...] Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction (quantified as MELD scores above 36) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation. [...] A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies; however, this is transient and thought to be due to the use of medications with toxicity to the kidneys, and specifically the introduction of immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and <b>cyclosporine</b> that are known to worsen kidney function. [...] Over the long-term, however, individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function, and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next big}} {{breakthrough}} came in 1983 when <b>cyclosporine</b> entered widespread usage. [...] This drug enabled much smaller amounts of corticosteroids {{to be used}} to prevent many cases of rejection (the [...] "corticosteroid-sparing" [...] effect of <b>cyclosporine).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>cyclosporine</b> trough levels {{reported}} to be reduced to 100–150ng/ml and tacrolimus levels reduced to 3–5ng/ml ...|$|E
2500|$|.....there are an {{astonishing}} number of coincidences between etoposide and <b>cyclosporine.</b> The first coincidence was that etoposide and <b>cyclosporine</b> were both found and developed on {{the chemical and}} biological side by the same groups, those of the present authors and their specific biological effects were discovered by one of us; second, both compounds were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration {{on the same day}} in November 1983, although they had been submitted by different companies; furthermore, both drugs act via an effect on an intranuclear isomerase, topoisomerase II, and peptide cis-trans-isomerase, respectively; both compounds are potent immunosuppressants; etoposide as well as <b>cyclosporine</b> are used in the treatment of leukemias or other malignancies; the latter after bone marrow transplantation to prevent graft-versus-host disease, the former also being used in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation; sometimes, the two compounds are used concomitantly, exploiting the capacity of <b>cyclosporine</b> to reduce certain types of multidrug resistance or to modify immunity against tumors cured by etoposide; in the development of both drugs, galenical problems arose, related to poor water solubility and absorption from intestinal tract, and experience gained with etoposide in this area was crucial for overcoming, several years later, difficulties of a similar type with <b>cyclosporine.</b> It is left to the reader to make assumptions about the heuristic aspects of these surprising coincidences..." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} these side effects are {{associated}} with the excipient used, Cremophor EL, a polyoxyethylated castor oil, and allergies to <b>cyclosporine,</b> teniposide, and other drugs containing polyoxyethylated castor oil [...] may indicate increased risk of adverse reactions to paclitaxel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{natural product}} was named {{cyclosporin}} by the German speaking scientists who first isolated it and <b>cyclosporine</b> when translated into English. Per International Nonproprietary Name (INN) guidelines for drugs, the [...] "y" [...] {{was replaced with}} [...] "i" [...] so that the INN for the drug is spelled ciclosporin.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most other}} allografts, a liver {{transplant}} will be rejected by the recipient unless immunosuppressive drugs are used. [...] The immunosuppressive regimens for all solid organ transplants are fairly similar, {{and a variety of}} agents are now available. [...] Most liver transplant recipients receive corticosteroids plus a calcineurin inhibitor such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin, (also spelled <b>cyclosporine</b> and cyclosporin) plus a purine antagonist such as mycophenolate mofetil. Clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin {{during the first year of}} liver transplantation. If the patient has a co-morbidity such as active hepatitis B, high doses of hepatitis B immunoglubins are administrated in liver transplant patients.|$|E
2500|$|... aHUS is not {{the only}} {{condition}} that causes systemic TMA, a fact that makes differential diagnosis essential. Historically, the clinical diagnosis of TMA-causing diseases was grouped into a broad category that (in addition to aHUS) included thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). However, it is now understood that although aHUS, STEC-HUS, and TTP have similar clinical presentations, they have distinct causes and specific tests can be conducted to differentiate these diseases. In addition, there are other conditions that can cause TMA as a secondary manifestation; these entities include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, also known as scleroderma), the pregnancy-associated HELLP (hemolysis, liver dysfunction, and low platelets) syndrome, and toxic drug reaction (e.g., to cocaine, <b>cyclosporine,</b> or tacrolimus). [...] Nevertheless, aHUS should be suspected in patients presenting with systemic TMA, and appropriate diagnostic work-up should be undertaken.|$|E
2500|$|Ketorolac can {{interact}} with other medications. Probenecid can increase the probability of having an adverse reaction or experiencing a side effect when taken with ketorolac. Pentoxifylline can {{increase the risk of}} bleeding. When aspirin is taken {{at the same time as}} ketorolac, the effectiveness is decreased. Problematic GI effects are additive and become more likely if potassium supplements, aspirin, other NSAIDS, corticosteroids, or alcohol is taken at the same time. The effectiveness of antihypertensives and diuretics can be lowered. [...] The use of ketorolac can increase serum lithium levels to the point of toxicity. Toxicity to methotrexate is more likely if ketorolac is taken at the same time. The risk of bleeding increases with the concurrent medications clopidogrel, cefoperazone, valproic acid, cefotetan, eptifibatide, tirofiban, and copidine. Anticoagulants and thrombolytic medications also increase the likelihood of bleeding. Medications used to treat cancer {{can interact}} with ketorolac along with radiation therapy. The risk of toxicity to the kidneys increases when ketorolac is taken with <b>cyclosporine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Elevated serum {{levels of}} <b>cyclosporine</b> have been {{reported}} with concomitant use of <b>cyclosporine</b> with norfloxacin.
