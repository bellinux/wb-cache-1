40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the optimal policy of CSP- 1 with inspection errors and return cost. Specifically, for given Type I and Type II errors, the optimal clearance number and sampling frequency are determined by minimizing the long run average unit <b>cost</b> including <b>the</b> inspection <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> rejection <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> opportunity <b>cost,</b> and <b>the</b> return <b>cost.</b> Overall, <b>the</b> analytical results indicate that depending on seven parameters (Type I error, Type II error, <b>the</b> unit inspection <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> unit opportunity <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> rejection <b>cost,</b> <b>the</b> unit return <b>cost,</b> and <b>the</b> process defective fraction), there are two main optimal inspection policies for CSP- 1 : No inspection and a 100 % inspection. Moreover, an interesting result is that the op-timal clearance number is independent of the inspection frequency which is the fraction of the units to be inspected during the partial inspection stage...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{amount of}} <b>costs</b> {{recoverable}} is often limited to an amount called [...] "cost stop". If <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> incurred by <b>the</b> company {{are bigger than}} <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> stop, <b>the</b> company is entitled to recover only <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> limited to <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> stop. When <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> incurred are smaller than <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> stop, <b>the</b> difference between <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> and <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> stop is called [...] "excess oil".

5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces <b>costs.</b> <b>The</b> airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit <b>costs.</b> <b>The</b> airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E
