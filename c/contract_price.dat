The original <b>contract</b> <b>price</b> was NOK 541 million. An average of 388 man-years were expended during construction, and the work involved the removal of 1.62 million tonnes of rock. There were three excavation points (headings), located at Bryn, Starveien on the Oslo–Lørenskog border, and at Stalsberg, outside Lillestrøm.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} ordered on 30 October 1935 from Hawthorn Leslie at Hebburn under the 1935 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 18 January 1936, {{launched}} on 30 December 1936, as the seventh Royal Navy ship {{to carry this}} name, and completed on 2 June 1937, at a <b>contract</b> <b>price</b> of £256,917, excluding items supplied by Admiralty such as armaments and communications equipment. Imogen {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning and was initially based in Malta. Transferred to Gibraltar, she patrolled Spanish waters enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee during 1938. The ship was given a brief refit in Malta from 17 October–28 November 1938 and another at Sheerness Dockyard in August 1939.|$|E
5|$|This decree allowed {{someone who}} {{purchased}} {{a contract to}} void the contract with a payment of only 3.5 percent of the <b>contract</b> <b>price</b> (or about 1/30 the contract). Thus, investors bought increasingly expensive contracts. A speculator could sign a contract to purchase a tulip for 100 guilders. If the price rose above 100 guilders, the speculator would pocket the difference as profit. If the price remained low, the speculator could void the contract for only 3½ guilders. Thus, a contract nominally for 100 guilders, would actually cost an investor no more than 3½ guilders. In early February, as contract prices reached a peak, Dutch authorities stepped in and halted the trading of these contracts.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy {{selected}} tenders from Germany's AG Vulcan for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to {{be completed}} in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The <b>contract</b> <b>price</b> was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|E

Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a <b>contract</b> <b>price</b> of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version would end up providing the source code for subsequent ports.|$|E

25|$|For most exchanges, forward {{contracts}} were standard at the time. However, most forward contracts {{were not}} honored {{by both the}} buyer and the seller. For instance, if the buyer of a corn forward contract made an agreement to buy corn, {{and at the time}} of delivery the price of corn differed dramatically from the original <b>contract</b> <b>price,</b> either the buyer or the seller would back out. Additionally, the forward contracts market was very illiquid and an exchange was needed that would bring together a market to find potential buyers and sellers of a commodity instead of making people bear the burden of finding a buyer or seller.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, 25,000 shield-shovels {{were ordered}} {{and shipped to}} Europe {{for use by the}} 1st Canadian Division. Preliminary tests, however, {{revealed}} that the shovel’s blade was incapable of stopping even small caliber bullets. Its value as a digging tool was also questioned as soldiers commented against the shovel’s weight, its inability to be easily carried, {{and the fact that the}} blade was poor for shoveling loose soil as it contained a large sight-hole. With such a reputation, several high-ranking Canadian and British military officials refused to press the instrument into service. With these developments, an executive order was eventually issued for the shovels to be reduced to scrap. A total sum of $1,400 was recovered in the salvage; a figure far less than the original <b>contract</b> <b>price,</b> which tagged each MacAdam shield-shovel at $1.35. Despite being condemned by the military, a small following of Canadian snipers continued to use the shovel. Aware of the tool’s limitations, they preferred to use them in a collective series for added protection.|$|E
40|$|Thi spaper is {{concerned}} with the risk-allocation effects of alternative types of contracts used to set the price of a good tobe delivered in the future. Under a fixed <b>price</b> <b>contract,</b> the <b>price</b> is specified in advance.

The paper derives and interprets a general condition determining which contract form would be preferred when the seller and/or the buyer is risk averse. In addition, an example is provided in which a spot <b>price</b> <b>contract</b> with a floor price is superior both to a "pure" spot <b>price</b> <b>contract</b> and a fixed <b>price</b> <b>contract.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of livestock futures markets continues to receive attention, {{particularly with regard}} to their forward pricing or forecasting ability. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a more general theory that encompasses the forward pricing concept. It is argued that futures <b>contract</b> <b>prices</b> for competitively produced nonstorable commodities, such as live cattle and live hogs, follow a rational formation process. Futures <b>contract</b> <b>prices</b> reflect expected market conditions when contracts are sufficiently close to the delivery month that the supply of the underlying commodity cannot be changed. However, prior to the period when future supplies are relatively fixed, futures <b>contract</b> <b>prices</b> should adjust to reflect the competitive equilibrium, where output price equals average costs of production. Presented evidence suggests that live cattle and live hog futures markets support the rational price formation hypothesis: <b>prices</b> for distant <b>contracts</b> reflect average costs of feeding.

500|$|An {{application}} for a light railway order for the Hatfield Moor Extension Light Railway was made in November 1904, and was granted on 5 August 1905. The contract to build {{it was given to}} John Moffat of Manchester on 27 September 1907, and the <b>contract</b> <b>price</b> was £14,649. Construction took one and a half years, and the branch opened on 1 March 1909. Because the area through which it ran is low-lying, and had been the subject of drainage schemes since [...] 1626, the railway had several bridges over rivers and drains. Between Epworth and Sandtoft goods station, it crossed the Folly Drain, the New Idle River and the River Torne. Beyond the station it crossed the North Idle Drain, and then ran along the bank of the Hatfield Waste Drain to reach its terminus at Hatfield Moor, close to the Hatfield Peat Works, then owned by the British Moss Litter Company (BMLC).|$|E
500|$|As {{the flowers}} grew in popularity, {{professional}} growers paid {{higher and higher}} prices for bulbs with the virus, and prices rose steadily. By 1634, in part {{as a result of}} demand from the French, speculators began to enter the market. The <b>contract</b> <b>price</b> of rare bulbs continued to rise throughout 1636, but by November, the price of common, [...] "unbroken" [...] bulbs also began to increase, so that soon any tulip bulb could fetch hundreds of guilders. That year the Dutch created a type of formal futures market where contracts to buy bulbs {{at the end of the}} season were bought and sold. Traders met in [...] "colleges" [...] at taverns and buyers were required to pay a 2.5% [...] "wine money" [...] fee, up to a maximum of three guilders per trade. Neither party paid an initial margin nor a mark-to-market margin, and all contracts were with the individual counter-parties rather than with the Exchange. The Dutch described tulip contract trading as windhandel (literally [...] "wind trade"), because no bulbs were actually changing hands. The entire business was accomplished on the margins of Dutch economic life, not in the Exchange itself.|$|E
500|$|The act forbade {{the company}} from issuing shares below £10 so, to make them easier for {{ordinary}} people to buy, they issued shilling coupons in books of ten {{so they could be}} paid for in instalments. [...] The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only £3 million had been raised. As a temporary solution Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept £500,000 of the <b>contract</b> <b>price</b> in shares, but raising the remainder required another Act of Parliament to allow the company's share capital to be restructured as £3 million of ordinary shares and £4million of preference shares. Adamson was convinced that the money should be raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, resigning as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1 February 1887. Barings and Rothschild jointly issued a prospectus for the sale of the preference shares on 15 July, and by 21 July the issue had been fully underwritten, allowing construction to begin. [...] The first sod was cut on 11 November 1887, by Lord Egerton of Tatton, who had taken over the chairmanship of the Manchester Ship Canal Company from Adamson.|$|E
