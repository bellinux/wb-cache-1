5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Additionally, her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of <b>Christian</b> <b>Dior</b> and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva {{began to appear in}} public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E

5000|$|Fashion in {{the years}} {{following}} World War II is characterized by the resurgence of haute couture after the austerity of the war years. Square shoulders and short skirts were replaced by the soft femininity of <b>Christian</b> <b>Dior's</b> [...] "New Look" [...] silhouette, with its sweeping longer skirts, fitted waist, and rounded shoulders, which in turn gave way to an unfitted, structural look in the later 1950s.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, {{there was a}} brief revival of the corset {{in the form of the}} waist cincher {{sometimes}} called a [...] "waspie".

25|$|Two covers {{were created}} for The Fame Monster, {{both of which}} were shot by French {{photographer}} Hedi Slimane. In the artwork of the standard edition, Gaga is seen sporting a blond wig and a sleek, angular black coat, the collar of which covers the lower half of her face. The image of the deluxe version sees the singer draped in thick brown hair, her face embellished with heavy, streamy black eyeliner. At first Gaga had a dispute with her record label over the artwork; Interscope found the brunette cover to be too dark and gothic for a mainstream release. However, Gaga explained to them that both would be suitable with the yin and yang concept of the album and ultimately they agreed. The font used on the cover is the sans-serif letterform used by <b>Christian</b> <b>Dior</b> in their campaigns.|$|E
25|$|In fashion, Félix {{was dressed}} by {{designers}} like <b>Christian</b> <b>Dior,</b> Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, and Balenciaga.

50|$|In the 1950s, men’s fashions {{followed}} {{the trend of}} women’s. With <b>Christian</b> <b>Dior’s</b> New Look for women, came the Bold Look and Continental Cut for men. The Bold Look was {{the continuation of the}} English drape cut with greater emphasis on the coordination of the suit with its accessories and shirt. It continued to have broad shoulders with a slightly nipped in waist and a double-breasted suit jacket. This cut was anchored in the WWII version, without the war restrictions.|$|R
