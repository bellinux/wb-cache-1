50|$|Because of {{the dangers}} of grain {{boundaries}} in certain materials such as superalloy turbine blades, great technological leaps were made to minimize as much as possible the effect of grain boundaries in the blades. The result was directional solidification processing in which grain boundaries were eliminated by producing <b>columnar</b> <b>grain</b> structures aligned parallel to the axis of the blade, since this is usually the direction of maximum tensile stress felt by a blade during its rotation in an airplane. The resulting turbine blades consisted of a single grain, improving reliability.|$|E

30|$|As the {{fracturing}} of <b>columnar</b> <b>grains</b> occurs under solid-state flow during metamorphism (e.g. Masuda et al. 2011), it {{is reasonable}} to use the elastic model to simulate the fracturing of <b>columnar</b> <b>grains.</b> Microboudinage of <b>columnar</b> <b>grains</b> into two segments can be considered to occur via the following three stages (Ferguson 1981; Lloyd et al. 1982; Masuda and Kuriyama 1988): (1) pre-fracturing; (2) fracturing; and (3) separation. The probability density function considers stages (1) and (2) and describes the proportion of microboudinaged grains as a function of aspect ratio (Fig.  7). By focussing on the duration of the fracturing and separation stages, we consider the applicability of the elastic matrix model to microboudinage.|$|R
40|$|A {{homogenous}} {{intensity distribution}} along the cube texture fibre {{is important to}} achieve an easy magnetization in non-oriented electrical steels. Several alternatives have been discussed in literature {{to achieve this goal}} namely, tertiary recrystallization (surface energy controlled), decarburization annealing, two step cold rolling (strain induced boundary migration), twin-roll thin strip casting (directional solidification), phase transformation (surface energy anisotropy) and <b>columnar</b> <b>grains</b> formation (selective grain growth). In the present study, a hypoeutectic Al-Si alloy was deposited on the surface of cold rolled Fe-Si steels with a hot dipping simulator and subsequently annealed at 1000 °C for different times. This procedure was developed previously in order to enrich the substrate with Al and/or Si and consequently improve their resistivity. Of specific interest was the formation of <b>columnar</b> <b>grains</b> in the low Fe-Si steel after annealing. These <b>columnar</b> <b>grains</b> were found to grow from the surface towards the centre of the substrate. The microstructure and texture in the <b>columnar</b> <b>grains</b> were significantly different than those {{in the middle of the}} material.

A multilayer with a periodicity of 10 nm was deposited and subjected to helium ion irradiation with two different fluences. He bubbles formed mostly in Cu layers and their distribution was affected by He concentration and radiation damage. According to SRIM calculations, in low He concentration regions bubbles formed mostly along interfaces, while more homogeneously distributed bubbles were found in Cu layers and along <b>columnar</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries in higher He concentration regions. We suggest that the capability of interfaces to annihilate point defects is weakened by the He bubbles shielding effect. Nanoindentation tests revealed a hardness decrease amounting to ? 0. 5 and ? 1 GPa for low and high fluences, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} columnar grains in as-deposited C-Mn-Ni(-Mo) low-carbon low-alloy weld metals {{and the influence of}} the alloying elements, particularly nickel. It was found that the austenite <b>columnar</b> <b>grain</b> size prior to the ?-? transformation of the weld metals was mainly controlled by the alloying contents rather than HAZ grains adjacent to the fusion boundaries, although the latter determined the size of the initial <b>columnar</b> <b>grain</b> size. The addition of nickel initially depressed the prior austenite grain size and subsequently dramatically coarsened it. This was related to the nickel equivalent (Nieq) of the weld metals and the peritectic reaction during the solidification process. Small columnar grains were associated with a Nieq between 3. 4 and 6. 2 % which resulted in a peritectic reaction when the weld melt solidified, whilst a Nieq higher than 6. 2 % produced very large columnar grains because the weld pool would directly solidify into austenite and have a subsequent continuous growth...|$|E

40|$|Nanocrystalline Cr 2 O 3 {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} on silicon wafers with (100) orientation by arc ion plating (AIP) technique at various negative bias voltages. By virtue of X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope, and high-resolution transmission electron microscope, {{the influence of}} substrate bias voltage on the film growth process, microstructure, and characteristics was investigated systematically, including the phase constituents, grain size, lattice constant, chemical compositions, as well as surface and cross-section morphologies. With increasing the bias voltage, the grain size and lattice constant of AIP Cr 2 O 3 films first decreased slightly, and then increased gradually again. Both reached the minimum (35 nm and 13. 57 angstrom) when the bias voltage was - 100 V. However, the bias voltage {{had little effect on}} the phase constituents and chemical compositions of AIP Cr 2 O 3 films.

40|$|In {{polycrystalline}} materials, such as columnar grained austenitic weld metal, grain scattering occurs. The {{extent of}} the scattering depends on the elastic anisotropy of the grains and the geometric features of the grains and grain boundaries. Therefore these properties have to be incorporated in any theoretical modelling. Some of these features (which have been measured on MMA austenitic weld metal X 6 CrNi 1811, which is equivalent to AISI 304 H ss) are as follows [6]: 1. Columnar grains {{are made up of}} dendrites and residual interdendritic melting areas. Both are characterized by the same crystallographic basis vectors. This feature can therefore be used to define a <b>columnar</b> <b>grain</b> as being an area of constant dendritic orientation. 2. Though the main dendritic growth orientation [001] depends on the temperature gradient during solidification, only a few grains within a bead are observed to have exactly equal orientation. Growth orientations of adjacent grains in a bead can differ by 30 ° and sometimes even more. However {{there seems to be no}} mechanism which controls the orientation of [100] and [OlD] axes of different grains in a certain direction. Rather it is more probable that during solidification the axes [100] and [010] of different grains distribute randomly. This enables the weld metal to be described (macroscopically) as transversely isotropic. 3. A verage values of <b>columnar</b> <b>grain</b> length up to 8 mm and <b>columnar</b> <b>grain</b> width up to 2 mm have been measured.

As-extruded material contained ultra-fine grains of 02 - 04 mu m. Such grains contained high dislocation densities, but mostly possessed high angle boundaries with the immediate neighbors. Depending on the annealing conditions, {{a combination of}} fine equiaxed and/or large <b>columnar</b> <b>grains</b> was observed. The fine equiaxed grains were at least 10 {{times larger than the}} as-extruded grain size and contained lower dislocation densities-which points towards primary recrystallization. Large <b>columnar</b> <b>grains</b> were observed in samples with fast heating and/or prolonged annealing at higher temperatures and were possibly formed by grain growth. Samples with predominantly equiaxed grain structure contained a similar texture as in the as-extruded material-a strong [110] fiber. Formation of the large <b>columnar</b> <b>grains</b> reduced the [110], but increased the [111] fiber. Possible selection of [111] grains for grain growth is not due to grain size advantage, as grain size distributions of all three fibers were similar, but can be understood from the consideration of grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) or mesotexture.
