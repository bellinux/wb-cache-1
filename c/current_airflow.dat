40|$|Bronzewing Mine {{is located}} in the centre of the Yandal Belt, 360 km north of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Discovered in 1992 by Great Central Mines, the Bronzewing Mine is now owned and {{operated}} by Normandy Mining Pty Ltd. Mining at Bronzewing is carried out by sublevel open stoping method recovering the ore from the underground operations concentrated in two major zones: Central and Discovery. Future production is expected to include ore zones away from the main orebody, Avocado, Winged Keel, Carrot and others. The future airflow requirement is estimated at approximately 450 m 3 /s, which falls only slightly short of the <b>current</b> <b>airflow</b> of 412 m 3 /s. This paper examines the ventilation requirements for the Life of the Bronzewing Mine by using ventilation software, VentSim. The current ventilation conditions are simulated and evaluated in terms of the future ventilation requirements. An optimisation process, based on the proposed mine production plans, is performed to arrive at the most efficient and cost effective use of the <b>current</b> <b>airflow</b> to supply sufficient air to working areas of the future stopes...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{outlines the}} development of empirically fitted and pseudo-physically derived compartment models of a flighted rotary dryer with counter <b>current</b> <b>airflow</b> processing solid material. Underloaded, overloaded and design-loaded dryers are considered. Four key parameters are estimated to fit the empirical model to industrial residence time distribution data and common empirical mean residence time/holdup correlations. Utilising the fundamental structure of the empirical model and physical and mechanical properties such as the dryer and flight geometry as well as solids material properties, the number of estimated parameters in the pseudo-physical model was reduced to 2. The experimental data required to characterise and validate the models is discussed. Optimisations to determine the model parameters were undertaken by comparison with an experimental residence time distribution curve for an industrial dryer processing sugar. Simulation of the model using gPROMS illustrates model performance. The potential to integrate the solids transport model and a full heat and mass transfer model is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the atmospheric boundary layer above the Agulhas Current using shipboard meteorological measurements and rawinsonde ascents. The juxtaposition {{of the warm}} Agulhas Current and cool shelf waters is shown to have far-reaching effects on the overlying atmosphere. Air-sea fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat and resultant boundary layer characteristics demonstrate high horizontal inhomogeneity. The results suggest that this inhomogeneity is permanent. The spatial heat flux gradient {{is reflected in the}} overlying atmosphere by a transition in stability of the boundary layer and potential cumulus formation from the cool shelf to the warm <b>current.</b> For <b>airflow</b> perpendicular to the Agulhas Current an internal boundary layer was observed to develop at the inshore sea surface temperature front. Onshore-moving air accumulated a significant quantity of moisture during its trajectory over the <b>current.</b> When <b>airflow</b> is parallel to the current an atmospheric moisture front exists along the axis of the inshore sea surface temperature front. The mean thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere was investigated. An inversion capped the boundary layer whilst a second, higher-level subsidence inversion was found which acts to limit the vertical development of cumulus clouds and therefore the redistribution of heat and moisture above the boundary layer. The results presented in this thesis are useful in two ways. The Agulhas Current has frequently been linked to South African climate. This is the first dedicated study which quantifies and characterizes the atmospheric boundary layer in this region. Secondly, maritime airmasses are dramatically modified above the Agulhas Current. The resultant large horizontal inhomogeneity, its vertical extent and permanence suggest that its inclusion is vital to any successful climate model. Atmospheric general circulation models have been criticized for not taking into account regions of strong horizontal inhomogeneity. The results of this thesis support this argument and highlight the need for similar studies. Bibliography: pages 116 - 123...|$|R
40|$|<b>Current</b> {{multizone}} <b>airflow</b> network models assume air momentum effects, contaminant concentrations and air {{temperatures are}} uniformly and homogeneously distributed in {{a zone of}} a building. These assumptions can cause errors for zones where air and/or contaminant are not well mixed. A coupled multizone-CFD program has been developed to improve the multizone model by applying a CFD model to those poorly-mixed zones and the multizone model to the rest zones. This paper validated the coupled multizone-CFD program by using experimental data obtained in a four-zone facility with non-uniform distributions of air momentum effects, contaminant concentrations, and air temperatures. The calculated results by the coupled program generally agreed with the experimental data although discrepancies exist in some cases. The coupled multizone and CFD simulations used less computing time than the CFD simulations for the whole flow domain...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis was, {{in the light of}} patients’ {{experiences}} of acquiring a deep SSI, to explore the air quality during orthopedic implant surgery and the application of intraoperative measures to reduce risk factors associated with SSI. Methods: In Paper I, 14 patients were interviewed using a qualitative approach. In Papers II and IV, during elective and fracture implant operations, 284 active air sam-ples were taken in displacement and laminar (unidirectional) airflow-ventilated operat-ing rooms. Door openings and other events occurring during surgery were recorded. In Paper III, to obtain data on the application of infection-prevention measures, structured and participant observations were carried out during 69 surgical procedures. Results: Paper I, revealed that developing a deep infection after surgery was seen as a life-changing event, negatively affecting all parts of life. Feelings of pain and not being taken seriously by the health-care providers dominated the experiences. Paper II found that the mean levels of CFU/m 3 in displacement-ventilated ORs exceeded the recom-mended levels for implant surgery (m= 15. 9). A strong correlation was found between door-opening rates (m= 17. 4) and CFU levels (r= 0. 74, p= 0. 001). Every door opening resulted in an increase in CFU/m 3 of 5. 3. Sixty-eight {{percent of the variance in}} CFU/m 3 could be explained by: length of surgery, door openings and the number of people present in the OR. Paper IV showed that the laminar airflow system observed in this study offered high air quality with very low levels of CFU/m 3 during surgery (md= 1. 0). No significant relationship between door openings and CFU/m 3 was ob-served, but the median door-opening rate was found to be low (md= 8). Paper III revealed that evidence-based measures, such as the correct timing of prophylactic antibiotics and normothermia to reduce the risk of postoperative infections, were not sufficiently implemented. The overall adherence to hand hygiene guidelines was 10. 3 %. Conclusions: Every unnecessary door opening and failure to implement protective measures during surgery potentially enables the development of an SSI that could result in serious consequences for the patient. Using patients’ narratives as a diagnostic tool could reduce the risk of delayed treatment. Finally, without a display in every OR that shows the <b>current</b> <b>airflow</b> and pressure gradient, the safety of patients cannot be guaranteed...|$|E
40|$|Falling film {{reactors}} are a {{very effective}} geometry in which to carry out fast exothermic gas-liquid reactions, because they allow easy removal of the heat produced. To optimise and improve falling film reactors, soundly based physical models are required. Existing models assume a flat liquid film combined with empirically-determined mass transfer coefficients, but there is growing evidence that this is unsatisfactory, since the interface is dominated by ripples and larger disturbance waves which {{have a significant effect}} on the mass and heat transfer rates through and into the film. The main objective of this study was the better understanding through experimental study of the interfacial characteristics of liquid falling films in the presence of a co-current down flow of air, with emphasis on the physical and hydrodynamic conditions encountered in current falling film reactor technology, so that the information obtained can be implemented in the enhancement of falling film reactor modelling. The liquids chosen were water, for validation of the measurement techniques through comparison with the literature, and two common falling film sulphonation reactor feedstocks; dodecylbenzene and ethoxylated alcohol. The experimental study consisted of film thickness and disturbance wave celerity measurements in a purpose built flow facility with a flat plate flow surface. A novel spatial film thickness measurement technique, the Light Absorption Imaging Technique (LAIT), was developed to give unparalleled spatial information on the interfacial characteristics of liquid films. A computer algorithm-based technique has been developed for categorisation of the spatial film data obtained by LAIT into substrate and disturbance wave regions, from which globally averaged characteristics of the interfacial structure have been obtained. Disturbance wave celerity measurements were obtained utilising the cross-correlated output signal from two light sources and a manual time-of-flight measurement technique using the images from a high-speed video camera. The study has provided a comprehensive set of data on the hydrodynamic structure of the interface, with and without the influence of a co-current down flow of air, for both water and actual sulphonation feed stocks as the liquid phase. The dramatic influence of both flow conditions and physical properties on interfacial characteristics has been demonstrated In particular, a transition has been observed of the disturbance wave structures in falling films due to the influence of a co- <b>current</b> <b>airflow.</b> Differences in the disturbance wave structure have been identified between the organic and water films after this transition...|$|E
40|$|The Breathing City {{project is}} an ongoing art and science trans-disciplinary {{research}} collaboration since 2005 between an urban meteorologist (Professor Dr Janet Barlow, University of Reading), a composer / sound artist (Holger Zschenderlein, University of Brighton), two designers (Patrick Letschka, University of Brighton; Christopher Rose, Rhode Island School of Design, USA) and a data programmer (Dr Thor Magnusson, University of Brighton). The Breathing City group is interested in developing a shared language in research, and in creating public spaces that promote exchange between different specialist areas of knowledge engaging experts and non-experts alike reaching beyond the usual peer group and boundaries of traditional science communication. The Royal Society of Science invited The Breathing City project to exhibit the large scale Ice - Traffic installation {{as one of the}} key exhibits for their 350 th Anniversary Special Event, opened by Her Majesty the Queen, and the subsequent Festival of Science + Arts in 25 th June – 4 th July 2010, which attracted more than 30, 000 visitors. Following several experimentation phases, this led to the conceptual development of the installation of Ice-Traffic, created by the interest in how to create a meaningful and evocative encounter space informed by scientific data stemming from complex dynamic systems within urban climate research. One of the key challenges was to overcome the dichotomy of intellectual investigation and intuitive experiential enquiry by developing conceptually a representation model that enables a sympathetic engagement of all faculties and to experience phenomena from many different angles within a knowledge building process. Further, {{it could be argued that}} the understanding of complex events or processes, involves a unique interaction of sensory, aesthetic, analytical and rational faculties. The conceptual design of Ice – Traffic involved experimentations with diverse and unusual combination of an ephemeral material like ‘ice’ with processed audio-visual media interacting with two different, however, related scientific data sets. The oldest long-range temperature record know as the Central England Temperature record, CET; 239 years from 1772, supplied by The Met Office, interacting with live data feeds of <b>current</b> <b>airflow</b> turbulences and temperatures from instruments mounted on the BT Tower in the City of London - supplied by Professor Dr. Janet Barlow who researches as lead investigator through the EPSRC funded Advanced Climate Technology Urban Atmospheric Laboratory (ACTUAL; www. actual. ac. uk) aspects of urban boundary-layer meteorology. Ice-Traffic dynamically combines moving images of urban traffic projected onto a two-ton and seven-foot high block of ice surrounded by a multi-channel soundscape, all influenced by the data through innovative computer coding in real time. Imbalances within the data sets triggered disturbances or ‘tipping’ points i. e. the sudden ‘flipping’ from one state to another in the visual displays and surrounding soundscape, reflecting the unpredictable and dynamic nature of interlocking climate data. Bombarded with the light of very fast moving time-lapsed images of urban traffic and the body-heat of the observers, the ice mass began its slow and inevitable accelerating meltdown. The installation of Ice-Traffic is intended to be an embodied representation of a dynamic urban climate model (energy transfer due to melting ice), which invites the observer to witness and question what is known, what can be calculated and what remains seemingly unpredictable. New perceptions and new questions arise, prompting further thinking around the language of scientific processes and the interfacing of arts and science, and how they can be explored through dialogue across disciplines. The installation becomes a kind of ‘knowledge negotiation' or ‘encounter space’ linking scientific data with artistic process to explore relationships between natural phenomena and urban environments. A human-scale experience, provoking intuitive, analytical or aesthetic responses to science relating to environmental issues like sustainability and climate (impact) and further, by taking the ubiquitous climate subject as the basis for exploring ideas about experience, mediation and representation.   Supporters: The Royal Society, University of Brighton, University of Reading, Lighthouse Brighton; Sponsors: IBM (UK), Halcrow (UK), The Met Office, QED Productions, Genelec (UK), Apple (UK) and The Southbank Centre...|$|E

40|$|Insight {{of thermal}} {{behaviour}} of lithium-ion batteries under various operating conditions {{is crucial for}} the development of battery management system (BMS). Although battery thermal behaviour has been studied by published models, the reported modelling normally addresses either normal operation or thermal runaway condition. A comprehensive electro-thermal model which can capture heat generation, voltage and current variation during the whole process from normal cycling to thermal runaway should be of benefit for BMS by evaluating critical factors influencing potential transition to thermal runaway and investigating the evolution process under different cooling and environment conditions. In this study, such a three-dimensional model has been developed within the frame of open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code OpenFOAM to study the electrical and thermal behaviour of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The equations governing the electric conduction are coupled with heat transfer and energy balance within the cell. Published and new laboratory data for LiNi 0. 33 Co 0. 33 Mn 0. 33 O 2 /Li 1. 33 Ti 1. 67 O 4 (LNCMO/LTO) cells from normal cycling to thermal runaway have been used to provide input parameters as well as model validation. The model has well captured the evolution process of a cell from normal cycling to abnormal behaviour until thermal runaway and achieved reasonably good agreement with the measurements. The validated model has then been used to conduct parametric studies of this particular type of LIB by evaluating the effects of discharging <b>current</b> rates, <b>airflow</b> quantities, ambient temperatures and thickness of airflow channel on the response of the cell. Faster function losses, earlier thermal runaway and higher extreme temperatures were found when cells were discharged under higher <b>current</b> rates. The <b>airflow</b> with specific velocity was found to provide effective mitigation against over-heating when the ambient temperature was below 370 K but less effective when the ambient temperature was higher than the critical value of 425 K. The thickness of airflow channel was also found to have critical influence on the cell tolerance to elevated temperatures. These parametric studies demonstrate that the model can be used to predict potential LIB transition to thermal runaway under various conditions and aid BMS...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{efficiency}} of random search processes based on Lévy flights with power-law distributed jump lengths {{in the presence of}} an external drift, for instance, an underwater <b>current,</b> an <b>airflow,</b> or simply the bias of the searcher based on prior experience. While Lévy flights turn out to be efficient search processes when relative to the starting point the target is upstream, in the downstream scenario regular Brownian motion turns out to be advantageous. This is caused by the occurrence of leapovers of Lévy flights, due to which Lévy flights typically overshoot a point or small interval. Extending our recent work on biased LF search [V. V. Palyulin, A. V. Chechkin, and R. Metzler, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, DOI: 10. 1073 /pnas. 1320424111] we establish criteria when the combination of the external stream and the initial distance between the starting point and the target favors Lévy flights over regular Brownian search. Contrary to the common belief that Lévy flights with a Lévy index α = 1 (i. e., Cauchy flights) are optimal for sparse targets, we find that the optimal value for α may range in the entire interval (1, 2) and include Brownian motion as the overall most efficient search strategy.

40|$|Fast indoor airflow {{simulations}} {{are necessary}} for building emergency management, preliminary design of sustainable buildings, and real-time indoor environment control. The simulation should also be informative since the airflow motion, temperature distribution, and contaminant concentration are important. Unfortunately, none of the <b>current</b> indoor <b>airflow</b> simulation techniques can satisfy both requirements at the same time. Our previous study proposed a Fast Fluid Dynamics (FFD) model for indoor flow simulation. The FFD is an intermediate method between the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and multizone/zonal models. It can efficiently solve Navier-Stokes equations and other transportation equations for energy and species at a speed of 50 {{times faster than the}} CFD. However, this speed is still not fast enough to do real-time simulation for a whole building. This paper reports our efforts on further accelerating FFD simulation by running it in parallel on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This study validated the FFD on the GPU by simulating the flow in a lid-driven cavity, channel flow, forced convective flow, and natural convective flow. The results show that the FFD on the GPU can produce reasonable results for those indoor flows. In addition, the FFD on the GPU is 10 - 30 times faster than that on a Central Processing Unit (CPU). As a whole, the FFD on a GPU can be 500 - 1500 time...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of the vaulted roofs for improving wind-induced natural ventilation, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) three-dimensional modelling. This has been carried out in a parametric study considering different climatic and geometrical parameters. Using Fluent 5. 5 program, natural ventilation performance has been modelled and assessed according to the value of airflow rate, and the quality of internal airflow distribution. It has been concluded that utilisation of vaulted roofs for natural ventilation increases inflow rate of the building, and re-distribute internal <b>airflow</b> <b>currents</b> by attracting some of the air to leave through roof openings instead of walls openings. This has improved ventilation conditions in the upstream and central zones of the building, but not in the downstream zone. Natural ventilation performance of two equivalent domed and vaulted roofs has also been compared.

40|$|Energy and {{indoor air}} quality {{concerns}} have motivated extensive research on air infiltration and ventilation in buildings. Airflow models {{have been developed to}} study the problem and to assist in the building design process. Existing research concentrates on measurements, modelling and predictions of steady-state airflow caused by wind-induced pressures, thermal buoyancy and mechanical ventilation systems. Wind-induced pressures on building envelopes have temporal variations due mainly to the wind gustiness. The resultant airflow has both mean and fluctuating components. Existing research shows discrepancies between the <b>current</b> steady-state <b>airflow</b> predictions and the actual air exchanges influenced by fluctuations. This thesis is devoted {{to the development of a}} comprehensive framework and methodology for airflow analysis and design assistance for buildings under both mean and fluctuating driving forces. A building airflow system is seen as two subsystems: steady-state and fluctuating. In the fluctuating airflow system, the temporal variations in wind pressures are taken as driving forces. The predictions of the resultants fluctuating airflow and internal pressures are based on the statistical linearization of flow relations, proper considerations of large openings, the system theoretic approach to governing equation formulations, and, frequency and spectral analyses for solutions. By combining both fluctuating and mean airflow solutions, the total air exchange in a building is obtained. Three types of validation strategies are employed. Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the effects of the statistical linearization on solutions. Laboratory experiments are designed, implemented and conducted to validate the fundamental relations. The theoretical predications are also compared to field experimental data. The fluctuating airflow model provides correct predictions for the simulation conditions and the experimental setups. In addition, modelling and sensitivity analysis procedures for steady-state airflow systems using a system theoretic approach are developed to calculate the influences on airflow results of the variations in building and climatic conditions, and to facilitate error analysis and building ventilation designs. Future research directions include: the incorporation into the existing research paradigm of the developed sensitivity analysis procedure and fluctuating airflow model, and the acquisition of more suitable data on characteristics of fluctuating driving forces...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{growth of}} {{mechanically}} generated small amplitude water waves below a laminar air stream was examined numerically and experimentally {{in order to}} explore the primary growth mechanism, that is, the interfacial instability of coupled laminar air and water flows. Measurements of the laminar velocity profile in the air over the water surface {{were found to be}} consistent with Lock’s [Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math. 4, 42 (1951) ] theory. This profile was then used to calculate the spatial growth rates by solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equations. The simulation shows that the growth of the boundary layer affects the exponential growth of water waves along the fetch. The sensitivity of the growth rate is observed to vary by a factor of 2 for changes in the laminar velocity profile as small as 2 % at the water surface. This indicates that the interfacial instability is strongly influenced by the wind-induced surface <b>current.</b> A laminar <b>airflow</b> was produced in the wind tunnel over mechanically generated monochromatic gravity-capillary water waves with the ka value in the order of 10 ? 3. The novel experiment was designed to measure the minute changes in the wave slope and phase velocity simultaneously using a highly sensitive reflected twin laser beam technique.

40|$|Rationale: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is characterized by}} progressive inflammation in the airways and lungs combined with disturbed homeostatic functions of pulmonary cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{have the ability to}} regulate these processes by interfering with gene transcription and translation. Objectives: We aimed to identify miRNA expression in induced sputum and examined whether the expression of miRNAs differed between patients with COPD and subjects without airflow limitation. Methods: Expression of 627 miRNAs was evaluated in induced sputum supernatant of 32 subjects by stem loop reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Differentially expressed miRNAs were validated in an independent replication cohort of 41 subjects. Enrichment of miRNA target genes was identified by in silico analysis. Protein expression of target genes was determined by ELISA. Measurements and Main Results: Thirty-four miRNAs were differentially expressed between never-smokers and <b>current</b> smokers without <b>airflow</b> limitation in the screening cohort. Eight miRNAs were expressed at a significantly lower level in current-smoking patients with COPD compared with never-smokers without airflow limitation. Reduced expression of let- 7 c and miR- 125 b in patients with COPD compared with healthy subjects was confirmed in the validation cohort. Target genes of let- 7 c were significantly enriched in the sputum of patients with severe COPD. The concentration of tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (TNFR-II, implicated in COPD pathogenesis and a predicted target gene of let- 7 c) was inversely correlated with the sputum levels of let- 7 c.

40|$|Objective: Chronic {{lung disease}} has been {{associated}} with greater impairment in self-reported physical function in HIV-infected patients. We sought to study this association using objective measures of physical function and pulmonary function. Design: Baseline data from the Examinations of HIV Associated Lung Emphysema study, a multicenter observational cohort of HIVinfected and uninfected veterans. Methods: We assessed the association between clinical, laboratory, and pulmonary function measures with 6 -minute walk test (6 -MWT). Multivariable linear regression models were generated to identify factors associated with 6 -MWT performance. Results: Three hundred forty participants completed 6 -MWT (mean age 55 years), with 68 % blacks, 94 % men, and 62 % current smokers. Overall, 180 (53 %) were HIV-infected and 63 (19 %) had spirometry-defined chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In a multivariable model, age, current smoking, and obesity (body mass index < 30) were independently associated with lower 6 -MWT performance, but HIV infection was not; there was a significant interaction between HIV and chronic cough, such that distance walked among HIV-infected participants with chronic cough was 51. 76 m less (P = 0. 04) compared with those without cough or HIV. Among HIV-infected participants, the forced expiratory volu me in 1 second (FEV 1, percent predicted), {{to a greater extent than}} total lung capacity or diffusing capacity, attenuated the association with chronic cough; decreased FEV 1 was independently associated with lower 6 -MWT performance in those with HIV. Conclusions: Older age, <b>current</b> smoking, and <b>airflow</b> limitation were important determinants of 6 -MWT performance in the HIVinfected participants. These findings suggest that potential interventions to improve physical function may include early management of respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that fires in the low-gravity {{environment}} of Earth-orbiting spacecraft are different from fires on Earth. The flames lack the familiar upward plume, which is the result of gravitational buoyancy. These flames, however, are strongly influenced by minor <b>airflow</b> <b>currents.</b> A recent study conducted in low gravity (microgravity) on the Russian orbital station Mir used burning plastic rods mounted in a small chamber with a controllable fan to expose the flame to airflows of different velocities. In this unique project, a Russian scientific agency, the Keldysh Research Center, furnished the apparatus and directed the Mir tests, while the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field provided the test materials and the project management. Reference testing and calibrations in ground laboratories were conducted jointly by researchers at Keldysh and at the NASA Johnson Space Center's White Sands Test Facility. Multiple samples of three different plastics were burned in the tests: Delrin, a common material for valve bodies; PMMA, a plastic "glass"; and polyethylene, a familiar material for containers and films. Each burned with a unique spherical or egg-shaped flame that spread over the rod. The effect of varying the airflow was dramatic. At the highest airflow attainable in the combustion chamber, nearly 10 cm/sec (a typical ventilation breeze), the flames were bright and strong. As airflow velocity decreased, the flames became shorter but wider. In addition, the flames became less bright, and for PMMA and polyethylene, they showed two colors, a bright part decreasing in volume and a nearly invisible remainder (see the photographs). Finally, at a very low velocity, the flames extinguished. For the plastics tested, this minimum velocity was very low, around 0. 3 to 0. 5 cm/sec. This finding confirms that at least a slight airflow is required to maintain a flame in microgravity for these types of materials...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} various methods for predicting the activation times for domestic ionisation and optical smoke detectors when detecting flaming fires. The prediction methods studied were the temperature correlation method where the detector is assumed to activate when the gas that surrounds it rises a certain temperature above ambient, the pseudo-heat detector method in which an RTI is assumed for the smoke detector, and Heskestad’s method {{which is based on}} optical density. The activation times predicted by these methods were then compared with those that were recorded during actual fire tests within a full size two-storey test house. The house was modelled on the field modelling software FDS. Two test fires were considered in this study. Both were lounge chair fires in a room {{on the ground floor of}} the house, and were flaming fires under vitiated conditions. The energy output reached by the two fires was between 600 and 1000 kW. Data collected during these tests included gas temperatures, optical density and the mass loss history of the chairs. There were also a number of radiators throughout the house that were left on for some time to heat the house before the fires were ignited. It was found that there was little difference between the temperature correlation and the pseudo-heat detector methods when a value for RTI of 1 m s was considered. It was also found that the use of an activation temperature of 20 °C above ambient within the temperature correlation method was the most appropriate method for predicting the activation times for the detectors. This value for activation temperature is high compared with other researchers, but it is likely that the radiators within the house created <b>airflow</b> <b>currents</b> that had an effect on the behaviour of the detectors. i...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Lower limb amputees {{are often}} {{dissatisfied}} with the comfort of their prosthesis. A literature review of 38 selected studies revealed that more than 53 % of people with amputation experienced heat and/or perspiration discomfort inside their prostheses. Current prosthetic liners are usually made from silicon, polyurethane or a combination polymer with a fabric outer layer and have thermally insulating properties. Lack of liner breathability and permeability also causes disproportionate amounts of moisture to pool against the skin. A novel new Dynamic Air Exchange (DAE) socket, being evaluated for this study, uses a small vacuum pump and pressure sensor to dynamically maintain a slight vacuum suction in the socket. Air is drawn in through four proximal liner ports, flows distally through a thin sock between the skin and liner, and forces perspiration and water vapor out a port in the prosthesis’ distal locking pin. Analysis includes a computational model to show how heat removal varies in different thermal environments, physical test results from a thermal manikin, and preliminary outcomes from human subject study results (n= 2) comparing adherence between the DAE socket and a standard of care (SoC) pin lock socket. The DAE system removes moisture from the socket effectively but has little effect on overall skin temperature. The computational model suggests that cooling rates for <b>current</b> DAE socket <b>airflow</b> are near 3 W for 20 °C ambient air and 10 % relative humidity. Cooling rates increase to 29 W when the flow velocity is increases from 0. 03 m/s (current DAE) to 0. 5 m/s under the same external conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{spirometry}} {{for early}} detection of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is still an issue of debate, particularly {{because of a lack of}} convincing evidence that spirometry has an added positive effect on smoking cessation. We hypothesise that {{early detection of}} COPD and confrontation with spirometry for smoking cessation may be effective when applying an approach we have termed "confrontational counselling"; a patient-centred approach which involves specific communication skills and elements of cognitive therapy. An important aspect is to confront the smoker with his/her airflow limitation during the counselling sessions. The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of confrontational counselling in comparison to regular health education and promotion for smoking cessation delivered by specialized respiratory nurses in current smokers with previously undiagnosed mild to moderate airflow limitation. Methods/Design The study design is a randomized controlled trial comparing confrontational counselling delivered by a respiratory nurse combined with nortriptyline for smoking cessation (experimental group), health education and promotion delivered by a respiratory nurse combined with nortriptyline for smoking cessation (control group 1), and "care as usual" delivered by the GP (control group 2). Early detection of smokers with mild to moderate airflow limitation is achieved by means of a telephone interview in combination with spirometry. Due to a comparable baseline risk of airflow limitation and motivation to quit smoking, and because of the standardization of number, duration, and scheduling of counselling sessions between the experimental group and control group 1, the study enables to assess the "net" effect of confrontational counselling. The study has been ethically approved and registered. Discussion Ethical as well as methodological considerations of the study are discussed in this protocol. A significant and relevant effect of confrontational counselling would provide an argument in favour of early detection of <b>current</b> smokers with <b>airflow</b> limitation. Successful treatment of tobacco dependence in respiratory patients requires repeated intensive interventions. The results of this study may also show that respiratory nurses are able to deliver this treatment and that intensive smoking cessation counselling is more feasible.
