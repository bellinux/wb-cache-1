Middle Eastern methods of cooking, which sometimes combined meats, fruits and spices, were popular at the time. Pies were created from such mixtures of sweet and savoury foods; in Tudor England, shrid pies (as they were known then) were formed from shredded meat, suet and dried fruit. The addition of spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg was, according to the English antiquary John Timbs, [...] "in token of the offerings of the Eastern Magi." [...] Several authors, including Timbs, viewed the pie as being derived from an old Roman custom practised during Saturnalia, where Roman fathers in the Vatican were presented with sweetmeats. [...] Early pies were much larger than those consumed today, and oblong shaped; the jurist John Selden presumed that [...] "the coffin of our Christmas-Pies, in shape long, is in Imitation of the <b>Cratch</b> crib", although writer T. F. Thistleton-Dyer thought Selden's explanation unlikely, as [...] "in old English cookery books the crust of a pie is generally called 'the coffin.|$|E

The French word for manger is crèche, and cattle feed racks are still known as <b>cratches.</b> The {{connection between the two}} words, <b>cratches</b> and cradle, may come from the Christian story of the birth of Jesus, in which a manger is used as a cradle. In Russia the whole game is called simply, the game of string, and the diamonds pattern is called carpet, with other pattern names such as field, fish, and sawhorse for the other figures—a cat isn't mentioned. The game may have originated in China In China the game is called kang sok (well rope), or catch cradle. In some regions of the U.S., this game also is known as Jack in the Pulpit.|$|R
