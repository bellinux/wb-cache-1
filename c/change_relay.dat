Once messages from the source nodes are received, relay nodes forward the messages to the destination.

Thus, a crowded relay degrades the end-to-end data rate for each customer user.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBacterial transmembrane receptors {{regulate}} an intracellular catalytic {{output in}} response to extracellular sensory input. To investigate the conformational <b>changes</b> that <b>relay</b> the regulatory signal, we have studied the HAMP domain, a ubiquitous intracellular module connecting input to output domains. HAMP forms a parallel, dimeric, four-helical coiled coil, and rational substitutions in our model domain (Af 1503 HAMP) induce a transition in its interhelical packing, characterized by axial rotation of all four helices (the gearbox signaling model). We now illustrate how these conformational changes are propagated to a downstream domain by fusing Af 1503 HAMP variants to the DHp domain of EnvZ, a bacterial histidine kinase. Structures of wild-type and mutant constructs are correlated with ligand response in vivo, clearly associating them with distinct signaling states. We propose that altered recognition of the catalytic domain by DHp, rather than a shift in position of the phospho-accepting histidine, forms the basis for regulation of kinase activity...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} relay {{selection}} under outdated channel state information (CSI) in a decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative system. Unlike previous researches on cooperative communication under outdated CSI, we {{consider that the}} channel varies continuously over time, i. e., the channel not only <b>changes</b> between <b>relay</b> selection and data transmission but also changes during data transmission. Thus the level of accuracy of the CSI used in relay selection degrades with data transmission. We first evaluate the packet error rate (PER) of the cooperative system under continuous time-varying fading channel, and find that the PER performance deteriorates more seriously under continuous time-varying fading channel than when the channel {{is assumed to be}} constant during data transmission. Then, we propose a repeated relay selection (RRS) strategy to improve the PER performance, in which the forwarded data is divided into multiple segments and relay is reselected before the transmission of each segment based on the updated CSI. Finally, we propose a combined relay selection (CRS) strategy which takes advantage of three different relay selection strategies to further mitigate the impact of outdated CSI...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{responses}} to mechanical stress require strain-sensing molecules, whose mechanically induced conformational <b>changes</b> are <b>relayed</b> to signaling cascades mediating changes in cell and tissue properties. In vertebrate muscle, the giant elastic protein titin {{is involved in}} strain sensing via its C-terminal kinase domain (TK) at the sarcomeric M-band and contributes to the adaptation of muscle in response to changes in mechanical strain. TK is regulated in a unique dual autoinhibition mechanism by a C-terminal regulatory tail, blocking the ATP binding site, and tyrosine autoinhibition of the catalytic base. For access to the ATP binding site and phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory tyrosine, the C-terminal autoinhibitory tail needs to be removed. Here, we use AFM-based single-molecule force spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and enzymatics to study the conformational changes during strain-induced activation of human TK. We show that mechanical strain activates ATP binding before unfolding of the structural titin domains, and that TK can thus act as a biological force sensor. Furthermore, we identify the steps in which the autoinhibition of TK is mechanically relieved at low forces, leading to binding of the cosubstrate ATP and priming the enzyme for subsequent autophosphorylation and substrate turnover...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} sense and react to {{different}} light conditions {{is of great}} importance for many organisms {{on the face of}} the earth. Specialized proteins known as photoreceptor proteins provide bacteria, plants and animals with this ability. To be able to sense the light the photoreceptor proteins have small molecules, known as chromophores, embedded within the protein matrix. Absorbed light triggers photochemical changes in the chromophore. These <b>changes</b> are <b>relayed</b> to the protein as structural changes and the biochemical activity of the protein is modified, thereby passing the signal on. In this thesis, time-resolved X-ray solution scattering has been used together with molecular dynamics simulations to probe the conformational dynamics of photoreceptor proteins. The investigations reveal both the sequence and nature of light-induced structural transitions. Diverse mechanisms of signal transduction on different length- and timescales were found, from the nanometer scale light-induced separation of domains in phytochromes, to the Ångström scale opening of the light-oxygenvoltage dimer and subsequent supercoiling of the linker region, to the sub Ångström changes in the radius of gyration of cryptochromes. The results provide a structural link between the early photochemical events and the interaction and regulation of downstream processes and proteins...|$|R
40|$|Due to a {{proliferation}} of renewable power sources and a rise in distributed generators, the transmission network is now able to split into smaller isolated sections. These sections are {{often referred to as}} microgrids as they function similar to larger networks with power production being sufficient to power the loads. Microgrids are hampered by the lack of fault current being sufficiently high to operate traditional overcurrent protection. The lack of fault current has resulted in a need to find newer methods to provide fault protection. One such method is the use of modern relays that allow for the trip settings to be changed as the network itself <b>changes.</b> <b>Relays</b> that allow for this adaption are known as adaptive relays and provide a method to deal with the lower fault current when the microgrid is isolated from the main network by reducing their pickup current as appropriate. The effectiveness of adaptive relays has been investigated by the use of DIgSILENT PowerFactory simulation software to model two differing networks under varying conditions. The networks chosen to be simulated, consist of a test network used in previous research and a modelling of a physical network on Hailuoto Island. The networks were simulated with the faults falling into one of the following four categories: 1. Faults occurring on the external grid 2. Faults occurring on the feeder connecting the external grid to the microgrid 3. Faults occurring on the feeders inside the microgrid 4. Faults occurring on the loads and connections inside the microgrid The adaptive relays were found to operate correctly having discrimination between relays, once the pickup currents were calculated correctly. Each microgrid requires that a microprocessor, being informed of the status of the grid and output of each power source, calculate the pickup currents for each relay, and notify the relay of its new pickup current. The microprocessor’s calculations were simulated in MathWorks MATLAB via a script which allows calculation of the current seen by a relay as the sum of the rated output from each distributed generator. Then multiplied by the status of the generator and its percentage contribution. This formula is an adaption from previous work by (Oudalov and Fidigatti n. d.). The current calculated by the MATLAB script is found when compared to the PowerFactory simulations as having a difference of less than 2. 8 per cent and 8 per cent on the test network and Hailuoto Island respectively. Providing proof that not only does the MATLAB script and its associated formula work, so do adaptive relays for protecting microgrids...|$|R
