5|$|While similar lifeforms {{have been}} known to exist in {{shallower}} oceanic trenches (>7,000m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the <b>Challenger</b> Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems. This preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at the <b>Challenger</b> Deep may be a result of selection pressure. Millions of years ago, the <b>Challenger</b> Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as the <b>Challenger</b> Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the <b>Challenger</b> Deep.|$|E
