5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (<b>CAPEX)</b> of the plant and the interest payments on that <b>CAPEX,</b> and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{section of a}} power plant, the turbine hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W. To reach the projected total <b>CAPEX</b> quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire nuclear island has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern nuclear plants, benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half {{of that in the}} nuclear island. LLNL's estimates require LIFE.3 to be built in 2040 for about half the cost of a fission plant today.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} stiff {{competition}} and production delays was apparent in early 2016. On 20 January, United Continental Holdings ordered 40 Boeing 737-700 aircraft instead. Aside from ready availability of aircraft already in full production, {{the purchase of}} Boeing vs. the Bombardier CSeries was financially prudent. Since United already flies 310 of the 737, there will be savings for pilot training and fewer spare parts {{will need to be}} stocked. Boeing also reportedly gave United a massive 73% discount on the 737 deal, dropping the price to $22 million per aircraft, well below the CS300 market value at $36 million. In November 2016, United deferred this order to save $1.6Bn in <b>CAPEX</b> or $26 million per 61 aircraft.|$|E
500|$|<b>CAPEX</b> for {{the plant}} is {{estimated}} to $6.4billion, so financing the plant over a 20-year period adds another $5billion assuming the 6.5% unsecured rate. Considering <b>CAPEX</b> and fuel alone, {{the total cost of}} the plant is 6.4 + 5 + 4 = $15.4billion. Dividing the total cost by the energy produced over the same period gives a rough estimate of the cost of electricity for a 20-year lifetime operation: $15.4billion / 160billion kWh = 9.6 cents/kWh. A 40-year operation lifetime would lead to a cost of electricity of 4.8 cents/kWh. LLNL calculated the LCoE of LIFE.2 at 9.1 cents using the discounted cash flow methodology described in the 2009 MIT report [...] "the Future of Nuclear Energy". Although details on their calculation are lacking, the LIFE.2 LCoE is comparable to conventional sources of power.|$|E
500|$|LLNL {{projected}} that further development after widespread commercial deployment {{might lead to}} further technology improvements and cost reductions, and proposed a LIFE.3 design of about $6.3billion <b>CAPEX</b> and 1.6GW nameplate for a price per watt of $4.2/W. This leads to a projected LCoE of 5.5 cents/kWh, which is competitive with onshore wind today, but unlikely to be so in 2040 when LIFE.3 designs would start construction. LIFE plants would be wholesale sellers, competing against a baseload rate of about 5.3 cents/kWh [...]|$|E
500|$|Pietermaritzburg re-commissioned as a {{dedicated}} training ship on 30 August 1962. While participating the training exercise <b>Capex</b> 63 with the Royal Navy, the ship accidentally rammed the British frigate [...] Although her bow was {{crushed by the}} collision, both ships were able to steam back to Simon's Town, South Africa for repairs. The subsequent inquiry found officers from both ships negligent. She was placed back in reserve in July 1964 and became an accommodation ship at Simon's Town for the navy's minesweeping flotilla on 17 June 1968. Pietermaritzburg was listed for disposal in 1991 and the navy {{made the decision to}} dispose of her as an artificial reef.|$|E
500|$|Three President-class frigates {{were ordered}} by the South African Navy in the late 1950s {{following}} the Simonstown Agreement with the Royal Navy (RN). The ship that became President Kruger was actually the second ship to be ordered of the three sisters and was ordered from Yarrow Shipbuilders on 18 September 1957 with the name President Steyn. The government wanted the first ship to be completed to receive the name of Paul Kruger, the first State President of the South African Republic, and a strike at the Alexander Stephens and Sons shipyard delayed the laying of that ship's keel. So she exchanged names with the first Yarrow-built ship which had already been laid down and became President Kruger. She was laid down at the Yarrow shipyard in Scotstoun, Glasgow on 6 April 1959. The ship was launched on 20 October 1960 by Margaret Biermann, wife of the Navy Chief of Staff, Rear-Admiral Hugo Biermann, and commissioned on 3 October 1962 with Captain M.R. Terry-Lloyd in command. During her working up period at HMNB Portsmouth, President Kruger went to {{the assistance of a}} disabled Norwegian freighter, [...] on 5 February 1963. The ship's captain refused the offer of a tow, preferring to wait for a tugboat already en route. The frigate stood by and illuminated the freighter with her searchlight as the crew was taken off by the Saint Peter Port lifeboat of the RNLI. President Kruger departed England on 27 February and arrived in Cape Town on 28 March to be welcomed by the Minister of Defence J. J. Fouché and other notables. A year later, the ship participated in a arrival ceremony for her sister, [...] on 26 September 1964. In the meantime, she participated in the training exercise <b>Capex</b> 63 with British and French warships in July–August 1963. In 1965 the British government decided to reduce <b>Capex</b> to a Weapons Training Period (Sanex) with only RN and SAN units participating, to minimise the appearance of cooperating with the apartheid government of South Africa.|$|E
500|$|President Steyn {{arrived in}} Simon's Town on 13 September {{and all three}} of the Presidents were {{assigned}} to the 10th Frigate Flotilla. They participated in Capex63 training exercise with British and French warships in July–August 1963, but only President Steyn and her sister [...] participated in Capex64 the following year. In 1965 the Royal Navy decided to reduce <b>Capex</b> to a weapons training period with only RN and SAN units participating, presumably to reduce the profile of cooperating with the apartheid government of South Africa. On 7 October 1968, the 10th Frigate Flotilla, now consisting of President Steyn, President Pretorius and the replenishment oiler , departed Simon's Town for Australia and arrived in Freemantle on the 23rd. They continued onwards to Sydney and then participated in the Remembrance Day ceremony in Melbourne on 11 November. The flotilla departed three days later, bound for home, but they were forced to put into Freemantle when a pump in President Pretorius burnt out en route. The ships finally reached home on 3 December. President Steyn began her modernisation the following year on 5 August 1969 and was recommissioned in May 1971.|$|E
