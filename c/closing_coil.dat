40|$|Introduction: Root {{resorption}} {{resulting from}} orthodontic treatment is an unpredictable adverse effect. Literature examining the potential protective influence of tooth cementum minerals against orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption has been sparse. Fluorine {{could have a}} role in minimizing the extent and severity of resorptive lesions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the elemental content of tooth cementum in orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption lesions and the effect of systemic fluoride. Methods: Twenty 7 -week-old Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups of 10 and exposed to systemic fluoride (100 ppm) or nonfluoridated drinking water for 2 weeks. Orthodontic tooth movement was implemented with a nickel-titanitum <b>closing</b> <b>coil</b> with a force of 100 g. The molars were then extracted, dissected, and prepared for cross-sectioning through the largest mesial midroot crater. The samples were mounted and scanned by using the Commo nwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Australian Research Council's National Key for Geochemical Evolution and Metallogeny of Continents Nuclear Microprobe (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical comparison of the elements and to determine the effect of fluoride, and unaffected tooth structure compared with root resorption craters. The Student t test was used to compare root crater lengths and depths of the fluoride vs no-fluoride groups. Results: Root resorption lesions of the group exposed to fluoride were significantly reduced in length and depth (P < 0. 01). The mineral content of the root resorption craters of the fluoride group had higher concentrations of fluorine and zinc (P < 0. 01). There was less calcium in the craters of the no-fluoride group compared with the fluoride group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Cementum quality (influenced by systemic fluoride exposure) might impact the extent of orthodontically induced resorptive defects. 10 page(s...|$|E

Anchorage loss with a minimal of 1. 40 mm is seen in HYCON device whereas in case of NiTi <b>closed</b> <b>coil</b> spring the anchorage loss was 3. 35 mm. The angular rotation of canines measured was found to be 2. 59 degrees in HYCON device and 10. 80 in NiTi <b>closed</b> <b>coil</b> spring.

The specimens were extended to twice their original length and stored in artificial saliva at 37 °C. Initial force was measured by means of an Instron universal testing machine and then at 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. The results revealed that the elastomeric chains delivered a mean initial force of 347 g for Morelli®, 351 g for American Orthodontics®, 402 g for Abzil®, and 404 g for TP Orthodontics®. The NiTi <b>closed</b> <b>coil</b> springs generated a mean initial force of 196 g for American Orthodontics®, 208 g for TP Orthodontics®, 216 g for Abzil®, and 223 g for Morelli®.

Materials and Method: Fourteen NiTi <b>closed</b> <b>coil</b> spring with the length of 9 mm were selected. Each coil was stretched to a peak extension of 12 mm. A universal testing machine was used to acquire load/deflection curve of the coil springs at 25 ± 2 °C. The influence of thermocycling (1000 cycles, 5 - 55 °C), autoclaving (134 °C, 32 PSI, 3 min) and mechanical strain (9 mm extension) which simulated the oral condition, were considered. Data were statistically analyzed by adopting Repeated Measures MANOVA Paired t-Test. Results: Autoclaving in the 1, 4, 6 steps increased the force levels of coil springs about 2 - 5 gf (p< 0. 01). Thermocycling reduced their force levels about 4 - 6 gf. Prolonged strain at 3, 5 steps decreased the magnitude of forces levels about 3 - 4 gf.

Aims and objectives : The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of wire diameter, lumen size and length of coil spring on the load produced as a function of displacement of SS and NiTi coil spring. Materials and methods : The study consisted of 60 samples of open and <b>closed</b> <b>coil</b> springs (30 each).

Discussion : The heaviest load value at 60 % compression was recorded in 0. 010 × 0. 030 spring with 20 cm initial length due to its large wire diameter and reduced lumen size among the coil springs tested. Straight line of load deflection curve bears clinical significance due to unpredictable behavior of spring beyond a certain limit. Permanent deformation exhibited by SS coil spring is due to high stiffness is low spring fact.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} laceback ligatures on canine distalization during the leveling and aligning stage and to compare the effectiveness of laceback ligatures with that of superelastic NiTi <b>closed</b> <b>coil</b> springs. Materials and Methods: Fifteen subjects were included in this study. Fixed orthodontic treatment was planned with the extraction of first premolars to solve crowding in upper and/or lower arches. Stainless steel direct-bonding Roth brackets (0. 022 -inch) were used. For canine distalization su-perelastic NiTi <b>closed</b> <b>coil</b> springs generating 150 g of force were used on one side. Lacebacks made from 0. 010 -inch ligature wire were applied on the contralateral side. Dental and skeletal changes were evaluated from predistalization and postdistalization lateral cephalometric and sub-mento vertical radiographs. A Wilcoxon test was applied to determine the differences between predistalization and postdistalization mean values and to determine the mean differences between the groups. Results: Upper incisor crowns moved posteriorly. Distal movement and tipping of the canines were significant for both groups. Likewise, mesial movement and tipping of the first molars were significant for both groups. Furthermore, distopalatinal rotation of the canines was significant in the coil group. Canine and molar movements were greater for the coil group than for the laceback group, and the differences were significant.

In this paper, the high-speed switch is based on electromagnetic repulsion mechanism, and its conceptual design is carried out to promote {{the application of the}} modified SFCL. Regarding that the switch which is consisting of a mobile copper disc, two fixed opening and <b>closing</b> <b>coils,</b> the computational method for the electromagnetic force is discussed, and also the dynamic mathematical model including circuit equation, magnetic field equation as well as mechanical motion equation is theoretically deduced. According to the mathematical modeling and calculation of characteristic parameters, a feasible design scheme is presented, and the high-speed switch’s response time can be less than 0.5  ms. For that the modified SFCL is equipped with this high-speed switch, the SFCL’s application in a 10  kV micro-grid system with multiple renewable energy sources are assessed in the MATLAB software. The simulations are well able to affirm the SFCL’s performance behaviors.|$|R
