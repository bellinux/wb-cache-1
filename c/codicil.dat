5|$|Druitt's {{father died}} {{suddenly}} {{from a heart}} attack in September 1885, leaving an estate valued at £16,579 (equivalent to £ today). In a <b>codicil,</b> Druitt senior instructed his executors to deduct the money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of £500. Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's personal possessions. Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith and Ethel), and eldest son William.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{marriage}} in 1583, Gebhard had written his Testament {{in which he}} left his estate to his brother, Karl, and a life-time annuity to Agnes, and charged Karl with her safety and protection. When Karl died on 18June 1593, and {{was buried in the}} Strasbourg cathedral, Gebhard wrote a <b>codicil</b> leaving Agnes to the care and protection of the Duke of Württemberg. He spent his last years diseased and crippled, and he died on 21May 1601. With great pomp and ceremony he was buried in a grave with Karl on 8June 1601.|$|E
5|$|In 1589, {{they could}} {{not return to the}} Electorate territories, which her husband had relinquished, nor could she, a married lady, return to the convent at Gerresheim. They sought refuge in Strassbourg, a stronghold of Calvinism. Gebhard {{had been a member of}} the Cathedral Chapter there since 1576. Three other canons from Cologne had also taken refuge in Strassbourg after 1583. Shortly after their {{marriage}} in 1583, Gebhard had written his Testament in which he left his estate to his brother, Karl, and a life-time annuity to Agnes, and charged Karl with her safety and protection. Karl died on 18June 1593, and was buried in the Strasbourg cathedral; Gebhard wrote a <b>codicil</b> leaving Agnes to the care and protection of the Dukes of Württemberg. Gebhard died on 21 May 1601. Until her death in 1637, she lived under the protection of the Dukes, first Friedrich I, later Johann Friedrich and then his son Eberhard. She was buried in Sulzbach.|$|E

5|$|Wright's career {{came to an}} end in 1688 {{with the}} {{expulsion}} of King James II during the Glorious Revolution. He seems to have accepted the inevitable end of his royal favour with the accession to the throne of the Protestant William of Orange. He lived on, in relative poverty, for a further six years until 1694. In March of that year, he made a will leaving his house in St Paul's parish to his niece Katherine Vaux. His collection of drawings, prints and books were left to his nephew, the painter Michael Wright; however a <b>codicil</b> to the will stated that the books were to be sold on behalf of his son Thomas, who was then abroad. The books were auctioned on 4 June and on 1 August 1694, John Michael Wright was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields.|$|E

25|$|There {{was a brief}} <b>codicil</b> to Packe's {{first-class}} cricket career. Following {{his appearance}} for the Army cricket team in 1932, he played four further first-class games for the Army between 1937 and 1939. In a rain-spoiled match against a weak Cambridge University side in May 1938, he hit 176 in 135 minutes, with 29 fours, to record his highest first-class score. His century came in 75 minutes and was the fastest of the season until beaten by Don Bradman, by two minutes, three weeks later. The following season, 1939, the same fixture saw a glut of runs and Packe was again the highest scorer, his 145 on that occasion taking 170 minutes with 20 fours. It was Packe's last first-class match.|$|E

25|$|Queen Beatrice {{executed}} three {{wills and}} one <b>codicil.</b> She died in Lisbon {{when she was}} 66 years old and was buried at Lisbon Cathedral next to her husband as she had stipulated in her will. While the definitive tombs were being built, the royal couple was originally buried at the choir {{of the church and}} {{it was not until the}} reign of King John I that their remains were transferred to the new sepulchers in the main chapel of the cathedral. These sepulchers were destroyed during the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and were replaced in the 18th century. The Livros do Cartóiro da Sé (Charters of the Cathedral) written between 1710 and 1716, describe the burial of Queen Beatrice, very similar to that of her husband, with an engraving that read: Beatriz Portugaliae Regina / Affonsi Quarti Uxor.(Beatrice Queen of Portugal, wife of Afonso IV).|$|E
25|$|Kaspar {{had been}} ill for some time, and Beethoven spent {{a small fortune}} in 1815 on his care. After Kaspar died on 15November 1815, Beethoven {{immediately}} became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Kaspar's wife Johanna over custody of their son , then nine years old. Beethoven, who considered Johanna an unfit parent because of her morals (she had an illegitimate child by a different father before marrying Kaspar and {{had been convicted of}} theft) and financial management, had successfully applied to Kaspar to have himself named sole guardian of the boy. A late <b>codicil</b> to Kaspar's will gave him and Johanna joint guardianship. While Beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in February 1816, the case was not fully resolved until 1820, and he was frequently preoccupied by the demands of the litigation and seeing to the welfare of Karl, whom he first placed in a private school.|$|E

Blackstone, who had died on May 26, 1900, was also the founding president of the Union Stock Yards. He had owned the property on which the Blackstone Library now stands, and he donated this tract for the construction of the library after his death. [...] The library was built on the tract through a <b>codicil</b> in his will, carried out by his wife, Isabella Norton Blackstone (1838–1928), after his death. Blackstone Library was his contribution to the city where he had made his fortune and stands as a monument to his generosity. Blackstone is [...] and its original cost was $250,000 ($ today).|$|E
500|$|Arnold {{wrote his}} will on 24 December 1677, {{during his last}} full term as governor. A <b>codicil</b> to the will was written the {{following}} February, and the governor died in June while still in office. [...] On 29 June, Samuel Hubbard of Newport wrote to Dr. Edward Stennett of London, [...] "Our Governor died the 19th day of June, 1678, buried 20th day, all this island was invited, many others was there, judged near a thousand people, brother Hiscox spoke there excellently led forth, I praise God." [...] In his will, Governor Arnold gave land to his wife with mansion house and [...] "stone built wind mill."

500|$|Just {{before his}} death, Delius {{prepared}} a <b>codicil</b> to his will whereby the royalties on future performances {{of his music}} {{would be used to}} support an annual concert of works by young composers. Delius died before this provision could be legally effected; [...] Fenby says that Beecham then persuaded Jelka in her own will to abandon the concerts idea and apply the royalties towards the editing and recording of Delius's main works. After Jelka's death in 1935 the Delius Trust was established, to supervise this task. As stipulated in Jelka's will, the Trust operated largely under Beecham's direction. After Beecham's death in 1961 advisers were appointed to assist the trustees, and in 1979 the administration of the Trust was taken over by the Musicians' Benevolent Fund. Over the years the Trust's objectives have been extended so that it can promote the music of other composers who were Delius's contemporaries. The Trust is a co-sponsor of the [...] Royal Philharmonic Society's Composition Prize for young composers.|$|E

500|$|By 1566, Nostradamus's gout, {{which had}} plagued him painfully {{for many years}} and made {{movement}} very difficult, turned into edema, or dropsy. In late June he summoned his lawyer to draw up an extensive will bequeathing his property plus 3,444 crowns (around $300,000 US today), minus a few debts, to his wife pending her remarriage, in trust for her sons pending their twenty-fifth birthdays and her daughters pending their marriages. This was followed by a much shorter <b>codicil.</b> On the evening of 1 July, he is alleged to have told his secretary Jean de Chavigny, [...] "You will not find me alive at sunrise." [...] The next morning he was reportedly found dead, lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed and a bench (Presage 141 [...] for November 1567, as posthumously edited by Chavigny to fit what happened).

500|$|The {{reception}} of Impressionist {{art at the}} Gallery got off to an exceptionally stormy start. In 1906, Sir Hugh Lane promised 39 paintings, including Renoir's Umbrellas, to the National Gallery on his death, unless a suitable building could be built in Dublin. Although eagerly accepted by the director Charles Holroyd, they were received with extreme hostility by the Trustees; Lord Redesdale wrote that [...] "I would as soon expect to hear of a Mormon service being conducted in St. Paul's Cathedral as to see the exhibition {{of the works of}} the modern French Art-rebels in the sacred precincts of Trafalgar Square". Perhaps as a result of such attitudes, Lane amended his will with a <b>codicil</b> that the works should only go to Ireland, but crucially this was never witnessed. Lane died on board the RMS Lusitania in 1915, and a dispute began which was not resolved until 1959. Part of the collection is now on permanent loan to Dublin City Gallery ("The Hugh Lane") and other works rotate between London and Dublin every few years.|$|E
500|$|Lennon seemed {{absolutely}} normal {{when she}} returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: [...] "It's you I love Cyn ... I love you {{now more than ever}} before". [...] Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas was waiting at the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and [...] "send her back to Hoylake". She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy" ... "to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad." [...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in [...] )., and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one <b>codicil,</b> which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E
