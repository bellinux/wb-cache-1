40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the proposal for reducing the withdrawal period from three days to one day and the setting of a final maximum residue limit (MRL) for the product Coxidin ® for chickens and turkeys for fattening. No data which would allow proposing a final MRL for monensin in poultry tissues was provided. A number of monensin metabolites (M 1, M 2, M 5, M 6) were isolated and tested for their biological activities. All monensin metabolites tested appeared to show lower ionophoric activity than the parent compound. These findings confirm the results of earlier studies. Comparable results on reduced ionophoric activity of metabolites from a related polyether antibiotic support the above findings on monensin.

40|$|Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl, {{provided}} as powder and as granulate, {{is intended for}} use as a copper source in animal nutrition. Tolerance studies with <b>chicken</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and weaned piglets, allowed the FEEDAP Panel to conclude that copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is a safe source of copper for all animal species, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The supplementation of feeds with copper from copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl up to the maximum authorised copper levels is not expected to result in a different copper deposition in edible tissues/products than the standard inorganic source cupric sulphate pentahydrate. No concerns for consumer safety will arise from the use of the additive in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum copper contents authorised in feed are respected. The powder form of copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl should be considered as a risk by inhalation; exposure by inhalation should be minimised. Neither form of the additive is a dermal irritant but the powder form is an eye irritant. In the absence of data, it is considered prudent to regard both forms as potential skin sensitisers. Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is intended to be a substitute for other authorised copper additives; it will therefore not further increase the environmental burden from copper. Copper chelate of L-lysinate-HCl is an efficacious source of copper in meeting animal requirements.

On this occasion, four groups of chickens were formed, with 100 chickens being treated in each group, as follows: K (classic mixture <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> broilers) and O-I (mixtures with triticale variety Kg 20), O-II (mixtures with triticale Favorit) and O-III group (mixtures with triticale Trijumf). The highest average body mass in the groups of chickens (male, female and chicks of both sexes), was scored by broiler chickens of O-II-group. The minimum food consumption for 42 -day-old chicks was achieved by group O-I (4. 275 kg), and the most by O-II group (4. 359 kg). Chickens of O-II- and III-O-group had the best feed conversion, while the chickens of O-I-group had a slightly poorer feed conversion.

40|$|The {{additive}} hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine {{consists of}} synthetic R,S- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA) and {{is intended to}} be used as a source of the essential trace element selenium for all animal species/categories. Based on data from tolerance studies in <b>chickens</b> and turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and piglets, the additive is considered as safe for all species/categories up to the maximum authorised total selenium level in complete feed. After being absorbed, HMSeBA is metabolised to selenomethionine; consequently, no residues of the compound itself occur in animal tissues and products. Compared with inorganic selenium sources, the use of HMSeBA in animal nutrition would result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from selenised yeast. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals supplemented with HMSeBA, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. The additive should be regarded as an eye irritant, but should not be classified as skin irritant or skin sensitiser. Inhalation exposure poses a hazard to users; the FEEDAP Panel concludes, therefore, that the formulation and conditions of use of the solid form of the additive should minimise user exposure by inhalation. The use of HMSeBA in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared to other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. Based on the response of plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and the plasma/liver concentration of selenium in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> the FEEDAP Panel considers that HMSeBA is an efficaceous source of selenium for all animal species/categories.

Data submitted by the applicant on Kokcisan 120 G were previously reviewed by the FEEDAP Panel in May 2004 and found to be insufficient for conclusions to be reached on efficacy and safety. In response to this review the applicant has conducted further studies to address the inadequacies previously identified and the additional studies are reviewed in the following opinion. From the supplementary metabolic studies, it has been concluded that unchanged salinomycin represents less than 10 % of the total radioactivity in the excreta regardless of gender. The results presented identify more than 20 metabolites in chicken excreta, each representing less than 10 % of the total radioactivity. The metabolic profiles in chicken and rat excreta and tissues {{are found to be}} qualitatively similar. Kinetics study of total residues and SAL-Na residues in chicken tissues from animals dosed at maximum dose proposed was provided and Salinomycin sodium could be considered as a marker residue...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed was asked to issue a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety of Kokcisan 120 G <b>for</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> based on the new data provided by the applicant in the supplementary dossier. The chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in rats demonstrates that salinomycin sodium (SAL-Na) from Kokcisan is not carcinogenic and a LOEL of 1. 5 mg SAL-Na kg- 1 bw day- 1 could be derived based on marginal, mostly pharmacological effects in haematology and blood biochemistry. This LOEL is three {{times higher than the}} lowest NOEL derived from previously submitted short-term studies (0. 5 mg SAL-Na kg- 1 bw day- 1). By applying an uncertainty factor of 100, this NOEL can be taken to deduce an ADI of 0. 005 mg SAL-Na from Kokcisan kg- 1 bw day- 1 (0. 3 mg per 60 kg person and day). The FEEDAP Panel considers that the whole metabolites represent a risk which in a worst case is equal to an equivalent quantity of SAL-Na. Regarding the similarity of the metabolic fate of SAL-Na in chicken and rat, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the ADI based on laboratory animals is a suitable basis for MRL calculation...|$|R
40|$|Kokcisan ® 120 G is a feed {{additive}} {{intended for the}} control of coccidiosis, a debilitating protozoal infection in poultry. In common {{with a number of}} other coccidiostats, the additive is due for evaluation to comply with statutory requirements agreed at EU-level. The European Commission asked the EFSA to evaluate the product Kokcisan ® 120 G and advise the Commission on its efficacy and safety. Within EFSA this task was allocated to the Scientific Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP Panel). The data provided in the dossier proved insufficient to give conclusive answers to the several of the questions raised by the European Commission. Kokcisan ® 120 G containing 12 % salinomycin sodium (SAL-Na) as active substance, added as coccidiostat at a level of 60 mg SAL-Na kg- 1 feed <b>for</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> is as effective as another SAL-Na as seen in field trials. However, a full assessment of the efficacy was not possible, as no up-to-date floor pen studies have been carried out.

40|$|Hostazym C is {{an enzyme}} {{preparation}} of endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase {{produced by a}} non-genetically modified strain of Trichoderma citrinoviride. The results of an in vitro chromosomal aberration test and of an in vivo comet assay indicate the presence of genotoxic activity in the product. The tolerance studies provided in target species did not indicate any adverse effect of the additive. However, due to the genotoxic hazard from the product, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on {{the safety of the}} additive for the target species. The results obtained in a repeated-dose oral toxicity study did not indicate any concern for consumer safety. However, the identity and fate of the substance causing the genotoxic effect is unknown; therefore, the source of the risk to the consumer cannot be established. Thus, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the additive for the consumer. The product should be considered a potential skin and eye irritant, and a potential skin and respiratory sensitiser. Due to the presence of genotoxic activity in the product, any level of exposure to the additive by any route is considered hazardous. No risks to the environment are expected to result from the use of the additive in feed, and, therefore, no further environmental risk assessment is required. Based on the results obtained in the efficacy studies, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at a dose of 500 CU/kg feed and in weaned piglets at 350 CU/kg. Conclusions on the efficacy can be extrapolated to minor poultry species <b>for</b> <b>fattening...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} physiological role {{of vitamin}} D in all vertebrates is in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. The classic clinical deficiency syndrome is rickets. The FEEDAP Panel notes that <b>for</b> turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> equines, bovines, ovines and pigs the maximum content for vitamin D 3 in feed {{does not provide}} any margin of safety, and that, except for pigs, the maximum content is above the upper safe level, according to National Research Council data when animals were fed a supplemented diet for more than 60 days. No safety concern was identified {{for the use of}} vitamin D 3 in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and fish. Not withstanding the long history of supplementing compound feed with vitamin D and the absence of publicly reported intolerances, the FEEDAP Panel is {{not in a position to}} draw final conclusions on the safety of vitamin D and considers the current maximum contents as temporarily acceptable. Any additional administration of vitamin D 3 via water for drinking represents a safety concern. Current nutritional surveys in 14 European countries showed that vitamin D intake is sufficiently below the upper safe limit. The FEEDAP Panel assumes that foodstuffs of animal origin were produced following current production practices, including vitamin D 3 supplementation of feed and concludes that the use of vitamin D in animal nutrition at the currently authorised maximum dietary content has not and will not cause the tolerable upper intake level to be exceeded. Vitamin D 3 is not an irritant to skin and eyes and is not a skin sensitiser. Inhaled vitamin D 3 is highly toxic; exposure to dust is harmful to persons handling the additive. No risk to the environment resulting from the use of vitamin D 3 in animal nutrition is expected. The vitamin D 3 under application is regarded as an effective dietary source of the vitamin in animal nutrition...|$|R

Evidence of {{positive effects of}} probiotics is rapidly expanding in gastroenterology. Probiotics find use in antibiotic-associated diarrhea, gastroenteritis and lactose intolerance. Many different strains of bacteria are considered as probiotic, including clostridia. The most used probiotics are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. But there are also suggestions that some Clostrium butyricum strains could be also probiotic. Aim {{of this study was}} therefore {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} Miya-Gold (a feed additive containing viable spores of probiotic Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 strain as an active substance) to the improvement of feed conversion, average daily gain and final body weight in the <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and also to observe the improvement of the stability of the gut and crop microbiota. We found statistically significantly higher (P < 0. 05) average weights of individuals in Miya-Gold group than in the control group at the day 7, 10, 20 and 49. By the analysis of microbiota we found at the day 42 statistically significantly lower (P < 0. 05) amounts of Escherichia coli in the caecum and Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria in the crop and also lower pH in the crop in the Miya-Gold group. The analysis of short-chain fatty acids was also performed and we found statistically significantly higher (P < 0. 05) amount of butyrate in the caecum of Miya-Gold group.

This product has previously been authorized at Community level <b>for</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> piglets and calves and for turkeys. The notifier is now seeking authorisation for an extension of use for dogs. EFSA has been requested by the European Commission to give an opinion on the safety of Oralin®, when used as a feed additive (109 - 1010 cfu kg- 1 feedingstuff) for dogs. In a 21 day tolerance study {{with a total of}} 16 beagle dogs (6 months of age) a control diet was compared to a diet containing ten times the highest recommended Oralin ® dose. All parameters tested support the conclusion that the additive is well tolerated by dogs. Two experiments to determine the influence of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 on the faecal microflora were reported. In one study Oralin ® significantly reduced numbers of E. coli. In the second Clostridium spp. counts were reduced but no differences were noted in the counts made on media selective for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. Thus, overall, the use of Oralin ® does not appear to adversely affect the microflora. The potential presence of virulence factors in the E. faecium NCIMB 10415 strain was also investigated. The cell adhesion efaAfm gene was found in the production strain but this is commonly found in other E. faecium strains, and is not a cause of concern. Thus, Oralin ® appears to be safe for dogs and for humans having contact with the dog...|$|R
40|$|Lactiferm ® is a feed {{additive}} containing {{viable cells of}} Enterococcus faecium. It is currently authorised for use in piglets and calves and provisionally authorised for its use in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> in powder and coated forms. The applicant is requesting the authorisation of a new water-miscible form of the product, and the renewal of the powder form and {{the withdrawal of the}} coated form. Lactiferm ® is intended for use at a range of 5 x 108 - 2 x 1010 CFU/kg feedstuffs. It is also intended to be used in water for drinking for piglets in the range of 2 x 108 to 8 x 109 CFU/L water. E. faecium NCIMB 11181 does not contain marker genes typical of hospital associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and does not harbour acquired genes coding for antibiotic resistance. Lactiferm ® is safe for weaned piglets and calves at the recommended dose range. Since neither the active agent nor the other components of the additive give rise to concerns, the FEEDAP Panel considers the use of the additive safe for consumers. Given the lack of specific information and its proteinaceous nature and the high dusting potential, in particular of the water soluble form, Lactiferm ® should be considered to have the potential to be an irritant to eye and skin and a skin/respiratory sensitiser. E. faecium is a natural component of gut microbiota and its use as Lactiferm ® in animal feeding would not be expected to pose any additional risk for the environment. Lactiferm ® is efficacious in improving zootechnical performance of piglets and calves. Th...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the work}} was to {{investigate}} the physical and chemical characteristics of the meat of broilers fed with mixtures in which fishmeal had been replaced with fresh earthworms and worm meal. The experiment was carried out on 100 day-old chickens of both sexes, Hybro provenance, divided into 4 groups, 25 broilers each. The experiment lasted for 42 days and had three phases: the first lasted for 3 weeks, the second 2 weeks and the third 1 week. The control group of broilers were fed with complete feed <b>for</b> <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> of standard fiber and chemical composition, while I and II experimental groups were fed with mixture in which fishmeal had been replaced by worm meal in an amount of 50 and 100 %, and III experimental group obtained a mixture with no fishmeal, but fresh, chopped earthworms ad libitum instead, from the 1 st day {{to the end of the}} experiment. At the end of the experiment, on the 42 nd day, the broilers were transported to a slaughterhouse. After individual weighing they were slaughtered, and primary processing and cooling of the carcasses were performed. Then the carcasses were cut up to the main parts and the breast samples were taken for examining the physical and sensory properties of the meat. The results of the investigation have shown that there was no difference in physical properties (colour, pH) of the breast meat (p> 0. 05) among the experimental groups. The breast meat sample ranking has shown that the E-II group samples were rated as the most acceptable while the least acceptable were the meat samples of the control group as well as of the group fed with food in which fishmeal was completely replaced with fresh earthworms...|$|R

40|$|N,N-{{dimethyl}}glycine (DMG), the dimethyl {{derivative of}} the amino acid glycine, is a naturally occurring intermediary metabolite in the choline to glycine metabolism. The molecule was first reported in 1943 {{and is currently}} used {{for a variety of}} applications, including the enhancement of athletic performances in both man and racing animals. With respect to its biological activities, DMG is for instance suggested to enhance oxygen utilisation and to posses non-enzymatic anti-oxidant properties. The studies described in this thesis aimed to evaluate DMG as a feed additive in <b>chickens</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b>   In a pilot study, broilers were challenged with both cold stress and a high energy feed in order to incite broiler ascites syndrome. This metabolic disease results from an imbalance between oxygen requirement and supply, and is an important cause of financial losses and a major welfare issue in the modern broiler industry. A low dosage of dietary DMG effectively attenuated progression towards ascites. We hypothesize that this effect results from reduction in endothelial damage and dysfunction caused by plasma free fatty acids, which were substantially lowered by DMG supplementation. Furthermore, DMG improved nutrient digestibility and reduced nitrogen emission, which can be attributed to an emulsifying effect of DMG at the gut level. A subsequent trial revealed dose-dependent effects of dietary DMG on technical performance, carcass yield, oxidative stress parameters and broiler ascites syndrome. However, the nature and magnitude of the effects depended on fatty acid profile of the basal ration. Herein, effects were most pronounced when fed a diet rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Generally, effects showed a linear relationship with dose, except for progression towards broiler ascites syndrome, which showed a quadratic relationship with dietary DMG content. Next, a series of efficacy trials were performed on farms at different European locations, using broiler strains and rearing conditions common to each region. Basal flock efficiency showed a wide range between trials; still, DMG systematically improved broiler performance. Finally, a safety and tolerance trial demonstrated a wide safety range of DMG in the target species. Moreover, DMG did not accumulate in consumer parts of broilers when included in diets at the recommended dosage, and bioaccumulation in meat at tenfold dosage did not exceed DMG content in for instance spinach.   In conclusion, current investigations clearly demonstrate a wide applicability of DMG as a new feed additive in broiler production, in which both economic efficiency and environmental load as well as animal welfare is enhanced without compromising consumer safety.  ...|$|R

It is authorised for use in feeds <b>for</b> <b>chickens,</b> turkeys and pigs <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> piglets, sows, calves and cats and dogs. The applicant is now seeking re-evaluation when used with calves and a new authorisation for use in feed for goat kids and lambs for rearing and <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at 1. 0 x 109 - 6. 6 x 109 CFU/kg feed. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe <b>for</b> calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and <b>for</b> rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and rearing. However, lambs <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> are not considered a minor species and require a separate demonstration of safety which was not provided. No additional concerns would arise for consumers, users and the environment from the proposed extension of use. Seven trials made with calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> or rearing were considered.
