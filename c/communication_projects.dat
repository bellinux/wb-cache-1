For most Competent Communication speeches, the limit is five to seven minutes. [...] The Icebreaker (CC Manual, Project 1) is between 46 minutes. While some Advanced <b>communication</b> <b>projects</b> are five to seven minutes, some are shorter and most are longer, generally ten to fifteen minutes, and some are a half an hour or more. After the member gives the presentation, another Toastmaster evaluates the presenter based on the criteria for each project. The distinctive feature of Toastmasters is this continual evaluation. Each activity at a club is evaluated: speeches are evaluated both orally at the meeting and in the member's manual. In some clubs, even the evaluators are themselves evaluated {{at the end of the}} meeting by a [...] "General Evaluator", also a club member. This near-immediate feedback provides the member with information on how he or she can improve his or her presentation skills for the next speech and is intended to provide a positive experience for the speaker.|$|E
