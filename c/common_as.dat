5|$|Any counterattack or {{relief effort}} {{contemplated}} by the South Vietnamese was doomed {{by the thousands}} of refugees that took to the roads in order to escape the fighting. Desertion among South Vietnamese units became <b>common,</b> <b>as</b> soldiers began disappearing from the ranks in search of family members. This pattern was to become too <b>common</b> <b>as</b> the offensive continued, not just among the territorial forces, but among the regular troops.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as <b>common</b> <b>as</b> bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Diverse life exists {{within the}} range, {{including}} endangered species like Larch Mountain Salamanders and spotted owls. Amphibians like salamanders and frogs are <b>common,</b> <b>as</b> are birds. Mammals {{in the area}} consist of elk, mountain lions, deer, and black bears. Eastern Cascades fish include Lost River suckers and short suckers, which are both endemic species.|$|E
5|$|Djungarian hamsters are <b>common</b> <b>as</b> pets in Europe and North America, {{and exhibit}} greater {{variance}} in their coats than {{those found in}} the wild. They reproduce often—more so than Syrian hamsters, and as they have no fixed breeding season, can continue to produce large numbers of offspring all year round. Young pups act aggressively to one another, while breeding females may show similar aggression to males.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were {{becoming}} more <b>common</b> <b>as</b> pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave a prelude to his record breaking of the following year when he hit 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower. Nor did he impress in the trial matches at Cambridge in his second year, resulting in him not appearing for the university that season.|$|E
5|$|Modern cottage gardens include countless {{regional}} and personal variations and embrace plant materials, such as ornamental grasses or native plants {{not seen in}} the rural gardens of cottagers.

Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids, are also <b>common,</b> <b>as</b> are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers' gardens.|$|E

5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both <b>common</b> (<b>as</b> frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome.

If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E

Variations of the term are used to describe stylistic variations for promotional purposes and industry classifications, including monokini, microkini, tankini, trikini, pubikini, and skirtini.

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as <b>common</b> <b>as</b> the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E
5|$|As it is {{separated}} from the mainland by 3miles (4.8km) of water, few large mammals inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. Rabbits, fox, raccoons, otters, mink, gray and red squirrels, and chipmunks are all <b>common</b> <b>as</b> is the occasional beaver and coyote. Bats are the most abundant migratory mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as homes for the bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats. Eagles and hawks are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as yellow warblers, American redstart, and indigo bunting are more common in early summer. Near the shoreline, gulls, herons, geese, and loons are common. Owls, including snowy owls and great grey owls, come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the warmer climate. Other birds, such as chickadees, cardinals, blue jays, and woodpeckers, live on the island year-round. Toads have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{widespread}} and often abundant in north and north-east Australia, especially north-east Queensland, and are <b>common</b> <b>as</b> {{far south as}} Victoria. They are also found in southern New Guinea and as rare vagrants in New Zealand and {{the northern part of}} Western Australia. The population in northern Australia is estimated at between 20,000 and 100,000 birds and in southern Australia, 1,000 birds. The numbers of individuals in New Guinea are unknown. Until 1961, Brolgas were thought to be the only species of crane in Australia, until the Sarus Crane showed up.|$|E
