40|$|Effluents are {{neutralized}} {{with lime}} forming a voluminous waste sludge which may slowly redissolve in groundwater. This sludge {{may also be}} a significant secondary metal source. The present research aims to develop a concept for metals removal and recovery using stabilized colloidal suspensions of activated silica sol, which acts as a neutralizing agent and an adsorption medium. Silica sol was prepared by firstly acidifying a sodium silicate solution to initiate polymerization, which would ultimately yield a gel. Polymerization was then arrested before gelation by water dilution giving a stabilized, negatively charged sol. Adsorption and precipitation were distinguished by comparing the coloured products from adding silica sol, lime or sodium hydroxide to cobaltous sulphate solution. Studies of dissolved copper/silica sol interactions showed copper adsorption/desorption to be a reversible pH-controlled process, which was monitored 'in-situ' using a cupric specific ion electrode. Dissolved copper values determined by the electrode were identical to those measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) for solutions at below pH 7. At above pH 7, the electrode showed zero dissolved cupric, but AAS reported some dissolved copper, attributed to desorbed colloidal cupric hydroxide. A copper/sol underflow sharply divided from a <b>clear</b> <b>overflow</b> were the adsorption products. Addition of concentrated sulphuric acid to centrifuged underflow produced a concentrated copper solution and regenerated sol. The separation of two metals (cupric and ferric) using pH control was also demonstrated. Adsorption/desorption cycles were used to remove iron from synthetic effluents producing concentrated iron products. Three consecutive cycles were required to produce 30 g/L dissolved iron, suitable for sewage treatment, from 0. 5 g/L iron effluent. Final pH control with lime precipitated desorbed colloidal hydroxides. Good settling characteristics following adsorption/precipitation from synthetic and actual mine effluents were observed. Problems included gypsum build-up, while excess silica addition gave dispersion, high silica losses and no phase separation. Nickel was selectively recovered over iron and magnesium from a tailings pond sludge by acid leaching then solution treatment with activated silica/lime. One adsorption/desorption cycle produced up to a 17 g/L Ni product from 2 g/L Ni leach solution...|$|E

40|$|Thickening is {{the most}} widely applied {{dewatering}} technique in mineral processing. Thickeners are used to increase the concentration of suspensions by sedimentation, accompanied by {{the release of a}} clear liquid. As the particles get finer the thickening process encounters difficulty due to a significant change in the particles settling behavior. The batch settling tests of coal refuse of a coal washing plant that contained 91 % particles smaller than 38 µm and 0. 6 % coarser than 75 µm showed that the optimum feed percent solids that provided highest flux (solids handling capacity) was 4 %. The flux of the pulp with the plant solids concentration (i. e., 10 % by weight) was 60 % lower than that of the pulp with 4 % solids. A thickener with a diameter of 22 m based on the dilution of feed from solids concentration of 10 % to 4 % was designed. Monitoring of the thickener performance for a period of one month in the plant indicated that an average feed rate of 25 t/h (dry solids) with solids concentration of 10 % could be thickened to an underflow concentration of 26. 5 % with a <b>clear</b> water <b>overflow.</b> It was found that the key component of the successful operation of the thickener is the dilution of the feed, without dilution the overflow loses its clarity and the system ceases to operate under predetermined conditions. Based on the results of established CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) studies, a feeding system that efficiently dissipated the energy of the incoming flow and a staged flocculant addition regime were utilized in the design and operation of the thickener...|$|R

40|$|Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrudes {{from the}} mid-layers of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current onto the shelf {{of the western}} Antarctic Peninsula, {{providing}} a source of heat and nutrients to the regional ocean. It {{is well known that}} CDW is modified as it flows across the shelf, but the mechanisms responsible for this are not fully known. Here, data from underwater gliders with high spatial resolution are used to demonstrate the importance of detailed bathymetry in inducing multiple local mixing events. <b>Clear</b> evidence for <b>overflows</b> is observed in the glider data as water flows along a deep channel with multiple transverse ridges. The ridges block the densest waters, with overflowing water descending several hundred metres to fill subsequent basins. This vertical flow leads to entrainment of overlying colder and fresher water in localised mixing events. Initially this process leads to an increase in bottom temperatures due to the temperature maximum waters descending to greater depths. After several ridges, however, the mixing is sufficient to remove the temperature maximum completely and the entrainment of colder thermocline waters to depth reduces the bottom temperature, to approximately the same as in the source region of Marguerite Trough. Similarly, it is shown that deep waters of Palmer Deep are warmer than at the same depth at the shelf break. The exact details of the transformations observed are heavily dependent on the local bathymetry and water column structure, but glacially-carved troughs and shallow sills are a common feature of the bathymetry of polar shelves, and these types of processes may be a factor in determining the hydrographic conditions close to the coast across a wider area...|$|R

5000|$|Two Huainanzi {{chapters}} metaphorically use [...] "sun {{and moon}} mirrors" [...] to exemplify yang and yin categories and elucidate the Chinese notion of ganying [...] "cosmic resonance" [...] through which categorically identical things mutually resonate and influence each other. The yángsuì 陽燧 [...] "burning-mirror" [...] is yang, round, and sun-like; the fāngzhū 方諸 [...] "square receptacle" [...] is yin, square, and moon-like. The first context describes yangsui and fangzhu mirrors jiàn 見 [...] "seeing" [...] {{the sun and}} moon. The Way of Heaven is called the Round; the Way of Earth is called the Square. The square governs the obscure; the circular governs the bright. The bright emits qi, {{and for this reason}} fire is the external brilliance of the sun. The obscure sucks in qi, and for this reason water is the internal luminosity of the moon. Emitted qi endows; retained qi transforms. Thus yang endows and yin transforms. The unbalanced qi of Heaven and Earth, becoming perturbed, causes wind; the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, becoming calm, causes rain. When yin and yang rub against each other, their interaction 感 produces thunder. Aroused, they produce thunderclaps; disordered they produce mist. When the yang qi prevails, it scatters to make rain and dew; when the yin qi prevails, it freezes to make frost and snow. Hairy and feather creatures make up the class of flying and walking things and are subject to yang. Creatures with scales and shells make up the class of creeping and hiding things and are subject to yin. The sun is the ruler of yang. Therefore, in spring and summer animals shed their fur; at the summer solstice, stags' antlers drop off. The moon is the fundament of yin. Therefore when the moon wanes, the brains of fish shrink; when the moon dies, wasps and crabs shrivel up. Fire flies upward; water flows downward. Thus, the flight of birds is aloft; the movement of fishes is downward. Things within the same class mutually move one another; root and twig mutually respond to each other 相應. Therefore, when the burning mirror sees the sun, it ignites tinder and produces fire 故陽燧見日則燃而為火. When the square receptacle sees the moon, it moistens and produces water 方諸見月則津而為水. When the tiger roars, the valley winds rush; when the dragon arises, the bright clouds accumulate. When qilins wrangle, the sun or moon is eclipsed; when the leviathan dies, comets appear. When silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the shang string a stringed instrument snaps. When meteors fall, the Bohai surges upward. (3.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 115-116) The second mentions some of the same yinyang and ganying folk-beliefs. That things in their various categories are mutually responsive 相應 is something dark, mysterious, deep, and subtle. Knowledge is not capable of assessing it; argument is not capable of explaining it. Thus, when the east wind arrives, wine turns <b>clear</b> and <b>overflows</b> vessels; when silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the shang string a stringed instrument snaps. Something has stimulated 感 them. When a picture is traced out with the ashes of reeds, the moon's halo has a corresponding gap. When the leviathan dies, comets appear. Something has moved them. Thus, when a sage occupies the throne, he embraces the Way and does not speak, and his nurturance reaches to the myriad people. But when ruler and ministers harbor distrust in their hearts, back-to-back arcs appear in the sky. The mutual responses 相應 of spirit qi are subtle indeed! Thus, mountain clouds are like grassy hummocks; river clouds are like fish scales; dryland clouds are like smoky fire; cataract clouds are like billowing water. All resemble their forms and evoke responses 感 according to their class. The burning mirror takes fire from the sun; the square receptacle takes dew from the moon 夫陽燧取火於日方諸取露於月. Of the things between Heaven and Earth, even a skilled astrologer cannot master all their techniques. Even a hand can hold minutely tiny and indistinct things cannot grasp a beam of light. However, from what is within the palm of one's hand, one can trace correlative categories to beyond the extreme end point the cosmos. Thus that one can set up implements and produce water and fire is function of the mutually responsive movement of yin and yang of the same qi. (6.2, tr. Major et al. 2010:216-217) The Huainanzi commentary of Gao You (fl. 210 CE) says,The burning mirror is of metal. One takes a metal cup untarnished with verdigris and polishes it strongly, then it is heated by being made to face the sun at noon time; in this position cause it to play upon mugwort tinder and this will take fire. The fangzhu is the Yin mirror 陰燧; it is like a large clam(-shell) 大蛤. It is also polished and held under the moonlight at full moon; water collects upon it, which can be received in drops upon the bronze plate. So the statements of our ancient teacher are really true. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 88) According to Needham and Wang (1962: 90), this comparison between a fangzhu mirror that drew water from the moon and a bivalve shell reflects an ancient Chinese confusion between beliefs about moon-mirrors and beliefs that certain marine animals waxed and waned in correspondence with the moon. For example, the (c. 3rd century BCE) Guanzi says,The virtue of a ruler is what all the people obey, just as the moon is the root and fount of all Yin things. So at full moon, shellfish 蚌蛤 are fleshy, and all that is Yin abounds. When the moon has waned, the shellfish are empty and Yin things weak. When the moon appears in the heavens all Yin things are influenced right down to the depths of the sea. So the sage lets virtue flow forth from himself, and the four outer wildernesses rejoice in his benevolent love. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 31) The authors compare Aristotle's (c. 350 BCE) Parts of Animals recording that some kinds of sea urchins were fat and good to eat at the full moon, {{which was one of the}} oldest biological observations about the lunar periodicity of the reproductive system of echinoderms, especially sea urchins.|$|R
