40|$|This {{research}} investigates how {{the amount}} of trust a consumer has in an electronic <b>commerce</b> <b>intermediary</b> <b>and</b> {{the amount of}} expertise that consumer needs to acquire {{in order to be}} able to use the intermediary affect the intention to adopt the electronic commerce intermediary. The paper analyzes both the direct effects of trust and expertise on adoption intention, as well as the indirect effects through two mediating variables widely used in adoption studies, usefulness and ease of use. These effects are hypothesized to be further moderated by the level of transaction complexity. The results partially support both the direct effects and the indirect effects model, pointing out that trust and expertise are, as hypothesized by academicians and practitioners alike, important in establishing relationships with customers in electronic commerce. In addition, the results show that trust and expertise become more important in determining the adoption intention as transaction complexity increases...|$|R

In this paper we propose a scenario based research approach to predict the effects of these new technologies on electronic markets and business models of traders <b>and</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> We develop a concrete scenario for the domain of business to consumer electronic <b>commerce</b> <b>and</b> explain its technical realization. Furthermore, we analyse the potential impacts on market participants and highlight a range of technical and organizational obstacles which have to be solved before semantic technologies can be deployed in an e-business context. ...|$|R

40|$|Electronic <b>commerce</b> <b>and</b> {{trading of}} {{information}} goods significantly impact {{the role of}} intermediaries: consumers can bypass intermediating agents by forming direct links to producers. One reason that traditional intermediaries can still make a profit, {{is that they have}} more knowledge of the market, so trading via an intermediary saves on search costs [1], allowing the intermediary to charge a markup and make a profit. Another reason is trust and loyalty between consumers <b>and</b> <b>intermediaries</b> (cf. [6]). In this paper we investigate whether trust-based intermediating agents will also {{be able to make a}} profit in electronic markets, where other advantages of intermediaries (i. e., advantages of location or scale) disappear, but where trust and reputation mechanisms are becoming popular for helping consumers make purchasing decisions in the face of information overload on the world wide web [2]. We model an electronic market where agents trade an information goo...|$|R
