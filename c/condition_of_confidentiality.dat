50|$|Rich Behm and Joe DeCamillis, the {{two most}} seriously injured members of the Cowboys staff in the May 2009 {{practice}} facility collapse, filed suit August 25, 2009 against several companies involved in building or renovating the massive tent-like structure. Behm and DeCamillis accuse all the defendants of negligence and two of conspiracy - of knowing {{at least two years}} before the collapse that the facility was unsafe and covering it up. Their lawsuits, filed in Dallas County courts, are the first stemming from the Irving facility’s collapse. The suits are based on documents that some companies gave to Branson on the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> The conspiracy allegations target: the steel-framed facility’s designer and manufacturer, Canada-based Cover-All Building Systems, its U.S. sales and construction affiliate, Summit Structures, the Las Vegas consulting firm JCI. As previously reported in The Dallas Morning News, JCI helped Cover-All and Summit design reinforcements for the tent after a building-collapse expert discovered engineering problems. The facility underwent repairs in summer 2007 that the Cowboys believed were “a temporary fix,” the lawsuits say. They allege that Cover-All, Summit and JCI “were to design and install a permanent fix after the 2007 football season was over” but did not. Instead, they “agreed to hide and conceal the practice facility’s shortcomings,” the suits say. The suit was settled for $19.5 million.|$|E

40|$|Central to {{reaching}} peace and settlement in Northern Ireland was {{a sequence of}} British [...] Irish intergovernmental discussions and negotiations, dating {{from the beginning of}} the 1980 s. British and Irish state cooperation and intervention has remained central to the stability of the settlement reached in 1998. The motives of state actors, however, have been unclear, and the role of the state in the political process has been the subject of some scholarly controversy. This paper looks at the types of evidence that can help to resolve such questions. It focuses on the value of elite interviews, arguing that they can constitute an important and irreplaceable body of evidence when used critically, but it also highlights the risks of excessive reliance on this type of source. It goes on to describe a major research project in University College Dublin whose aim was to record the experiences and interpretations of the actors who engaged in British–Irish negotiations over the last four decades.

40|$|The {{existing}} literature linking political {{institutions and the}} investments of multinational corporations has focused on how high levels of political risk deter investors from entering into some emerging markets. In this paper I argue that multinationals have multiple tools to manage risks rather than avoid them. Specifically, I focus how multinationals tailor their operations to both minimize political risks and to maximize political influence. Drawing on a confidential data set covering the complete universe of U. S. foreign direct investments abroad, I find that U. S. multinationals restrict {{the size of their}} operations in authoritarian regimes relative to democratic regimes in order to minimize the amount of assets at risk. I also find preliminary evidence for firms attempting to increase their influence by aligning their operations with the preferences of incumbent governments. More specifically, firms increase the number of workers they employ when left-of-center governments come to power.

40|$|On January 1, 2016, new {{regulations}} took effect in Switzerland that impact the country 2 ̆ 7 s art market. The laws aim to close channels for laundering money and illicit antiquities within the art trade. Because {{the art market}} 2 ̆ 7 s opacity provides attractive conditions for launderers, Switzerland 2 ̆ 7 s {{new regulations}} introduce greater transparency in transactions for high-value works of art and in duty-free art-storage facilities, such as the Geneva freeport. The Geneva warehouse serves an international clientele of art collectors, who have traditionally stored works {{of art in the}} facility anonymously and indefinitely, without adverse tax consequences. The freeport provides essential services for honest collectors who wish to protect their holdings secretly and securely. In addition, the freeports offer an ideal climate for an emerging class of art investors, who buy and store works until they appreciate in value. By requiring greater transparency within the Swiss art market in an effort to curb illicit activity, the new regulations threaten to undermine the conditions that support the interests of legitimate art traders. Because Switzerland introduced its regulations unilaterally, Swiss art traders should advocate for self-regulation within the international art market in order to level the competitive playing field and preserve the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> that honest traders depend on...|$|R

In the following, we attempt to distil what we know about Burma’s banks into a series of sketches of each. We begin with an examination of the state-owned institutions that once more dominate, before investigating each of the surviving private banks that once seemed to have much promise.

40|$|NASA’s PHOENIX {{spacecraft}} {{has successfully}} landed on Mars on 25 May 2008. ESA supported the event by recording signals from PHOENIX by the Mars EXPRESS spacecraft using its lander communication subsystem. Following numerical simulations of the probe entry plume emission, two Mars EXPRESS instruments, namely the High Resolution and Stereo Camera (HRSC) and the Ultraviolet and Infrared Spectrometer (SPICAM), were switched on in {{to observe the}} emission associated with the atmospheric entry. No positive detection was reported unfortunately. This article reports on the simulations, the planning, and the results. The non-detection by the UV spectrometer was due to a wrong instrument setting. Result for the camera is tentatively explained by the level of emission in the visible range. Lessons learned are given in the conclusions: the entry probe trajectory should be communicated {{as soon as possible}} to all interested parties, within the boundary <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidentiality</b> obviously. It is important to plan some redundancy to prevent incorrect instrument operations. A multi instrument multi-spacecraft campaign should be encouraged by all means. Since detection of such faint signal is challenging, the integration time must be properly matched to the event duration. Payload operational (exclusion) rules should be discussed in an open way, to check whether the prudence of such measures is procedural or physical. The numerical simulations discussed in this paper have been focused on IR radiation in the lower density flow wake, using a DSMC/line-by-line method. These could be complemented with other numerical approaches more focused in the VUV–visible region in the high-pressure bow-shock region, using continuum Navier–Stokes fluid methods, which would yield information on the contribution to the emission spectrum from minor flow species such as CN, C 2 and C...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The rate of {{unwanted}} pregnancies in {{adolescents in the}} United Kingdom (UK) {{is one of the}} highest in Europe and is a major reason for the RCGP's concern at the under-use of general practitioners' (GPs') contraceptive services by young people. AIM: To discover the attitudes of 15 - to 16 -year-olds to the GP consultation and contraceptive services. METHOD: Questionnaires were completed as part of an evaluation of a novel sex education programme in 30 schools in 1994, and provided the data for this study. A total of 4481 teenagers (51. 6 % male and 48. 4 % female completed the questionnaires in their classrooms under <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> complete <b>confidentiality.</b> RESULTS: The median consulting rate per year was two for males and three for females. Over 60 % of adolescents attended the consultation with a parent. Of the males, 27. 5 % 'felt that the discussion with their GP could be relayed to their parents against their wishes', as did 25. 1 % of the females. Other difficulties with GP appointments were identified as embarrassment (63 % of females and 46 % of males), difficulty getting a quick appointment (44 % of both males and females), and an unsympathetic GP (32 % of females and 20. 5 % of males). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents identify significant factors blocking them from easy access to consultation with their GP. These included lack <b>of</b> trust in <b>confidentiality,</b> lack <b>of</b> staff friendliness, and delay in appointment. Consideration of how these blocks can be removed will assist in providing improved contraceptive services in primary care.
