More specifically, medium <b>run</b> <b>aggregate</b> supply is like this for three theoretical reasons, namely the Sticky-Wage Theory, the Sticky-Price Theory and the Misperception Theory.

50|$|High {{levels of}} {{aggregate}} demand {{tend to be}} the cause of overheating. If short <b>run</b> <b>aggregate</b> demand exceeds long <b>run</b> <b>aggregate</b> supply, then the excess demand for goods must be met via the over-employment of resources. This may be achieved by employing workers for extra shifts or using machinery beyond their recommended working hours. This type of production is considered unsustainable because the over-employment cannot be supported indefinitely. Overheating can be prevented by means of constant infrastructure expansion to eliminate bottlenecks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of the reclaim asphalt pavement (RAP) mixes prepared with the foamed bitumen. Four different percentages of foamed bitumen namely 1 %, 2 %, 3 % and 4 % were used in preparation of the mixes. Mixes prepared with 50 % RAP and 50 % <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> (Mix B) were compared with mixes prepared with 100 % <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> (Mix A) which performed as a control sample. Performance of the mixes based on indirect tensile strength test (ITS) in different conditions namely cured at 40 oC for 72 hours and soaked for 24 hours at 25 oC was evaluated. The test results indicated that incorporating RAP to the mixes shows insignificant difference in ITS value but also increase the resistance to moisture damage. However ITS value is significantly affected by the foamed bitumen content which 2 % of foamed bitumen results in optimum ITS.

40|$|With recent {{focus on}} {{sustainable}} construction practices and the ever-increasing transportation cost and scarcity of natural resources, use of unconventional aggregate materials, such as primary <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> and concrete demolition waste, have become viable {{for the construction}} of pavement working platforms over very weak and often wet subgrade soils. To this end, a research study was undertaken at the Illinois Center for Transportation to evaluate the adequacy and field performances of such large-sized aggregate materials and validate new material specifications. A state-of-the-art image analysis technique was utilized to characterize the size and morphological properties, e. g. shape, texture and angularity of two large-sized aggregates, referred to herein as primary <b>crusher</b> <b>run</b> and <b>crushed</b> concrete. For the field evaluation, full-scale test sections were constructed with these large-sized aggregate materials over a very weak engineered subgrade and subjected to accelerated pavement testing. Construction quality control was achieved through in-place density and modulus measurements on conventional aggregate capping surface layers using nuclear gauge, lightweight deflectometer and soil stiffness gauge type devices. Periodic rut measurements were carried out on the pavement surface throughout the accelerated loading process using an Accelerated Transportation Loading Assembly (ATLAS). Contributions of the underlying pavement layers to the total rut accumulation was evaluated through innovative applications of ground penetrating radar (GPR), a light weight penetrometer device, known as the French Panda, as well as a geo-endoscopy probe. Layer intermixing and material migration at the aggregate subgrade and subgrade interface was found to improve the layer stiffness and pavement performance results significantly...|$|R
