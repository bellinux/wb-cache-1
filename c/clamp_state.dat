40|$|To avoid {{mutations}} in the genome, DNA replication is generally followed by DNA mismatch repair (MMR). MMR starts when a MutS homolog recognizes a mismatch and undergoes an ATP-dependent transformation to an elusive sliding <b>clamp</b> <b>state.</b> How this transient state promotes MutL homolog recruitment and activation of repair is unclear. Here {{we present a}} crystal structure of the MutS/MutL complex using a site-specifically crosslinked complex and examine how large conformational changes lead to activation of MutL. The structure captures MutS in the sliding clamp conformation, where tilting of the MutS subunits across each other pushes DNA into a new channel, and reorientation of the connector domain creates an interface for MutL with both MutS subunits. Our work explains how the sliding clamp promotes loading of MutL onto DNA, to activate downstream effectors. We thus elucidate a crucial mechanism that ensures that MMR is initiated only after detection of a DNA mismatch...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Sandwich {{structures}} {{consisting of}} high-modulus thin skins and a low-modulus thick core {{are sensitive to}} local loading, which causes local indentation. Classical approaches deter-mine the deflection of sandwich structures by a superposition method where the local compres-sion of the core for a panel on a rigid foundation is added to global sandwich bending without core compression. In this article, a sandwich plate is analyzed using a higher-order sandwich panel theory (HOSPT) where the faces are modelled by classical laminate theory and the core by a three-dimensional elasticity solution. The results are obtained from 14 partial differential equa-tions for displacements of the faces and core. HOSPT determines core compression with a second-order distribution of displacement through the core thickness. The force versus core compression relations in the fully backed and <b>clamped</b> <b>states</b> are compared and it is shown that the core compression assumed in the classical approach differs from the core compression in a <b>clamped</b> <b>state.</b> Results are verified by ANSYS FEM software and experimental data. A few sandwich panel specimens were made with glass reinforced plastic (GRP) skins and a polyure-thane foam core.

Here, we use a novel Nanodisc-based system, {{designed to be a}} soluble mimetic of the clamped synaptic vesicle-bilayer junction, combined with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy to monitor the structural relationships among SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor), Synaptotagmin C 2 domains, and the lipid bilayer in real time during the Ca 2 +-activation process. We report that Synaptotagmin remains rigidly fixed on the partially assembled SNARE complex with no detectable internal rearrangement of its C 2 domains, even as it rapidly inserts into the bilayer. We hypothesize that this straightforward, one-step physical mechanism could explain how this Ca 2 +- sensor rapidly activates neurotransmitter release from the <b>clamped</b> <b>state...</b>|$|R

In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The reasons for linking these two series was because Clamp wanted to have two protagonists from two different manga with different personalities, design, yet during the ending they would be stated to be same person, and {{had to go on}} different paths. Because Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle was more focused in action scenes, Clamp sometimes took breaks from xxxHolic or create autoconclusive stories so that the storyline between the two series would always be linked.

In mice {{placed on a}} 3 -day high fat diet, we find augmented eIF 2 α signaling, together with hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. To clarify {{the role of the}} liver ER stress-dependent phospho-eIF 2 α (eIF 2 α-P) pathway in response to acute caloric excess on liver and muscle glucose and lipid metabolism, we studied transgenic mice in which the hepatic ER stress-dependent eIF 2 α-P pathway was inhibited by overexpressing a constitutively active C-terminal fragment of GADD 34 /PPP 1 R 15 a, a regulatory subunit of phosphatase that terminates ER stress signaling by phospho-eIF 2 α. Inhibition of the eIF 2 α-P signaling in liver led to a decrease in hepatic glucose production in the basal and <b>clamped</b> <b>state,</b> which could be attributed to reduced gluconeogenic gene expression, resulting in reduced basal plasma glucose concentrations. Surprisingly, hepatic eIF 2 α inhibition also impaired insulin-stimulated muscle and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. This latter effect could be attributed at least in part by an increase in circulating IGFBP- 3 levels in the transgenic animals. In addition, infusion of insulin during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp induced conspicuous ER stress in the 3 -day high fat diet-fed mice, which was aggravated through continuous dephosphorylation of eIF 2 α. Together, these data imply that the hepatic ER stress eIF 2 α signaling pathway affects hepatic glucose production without altering hepatic insulin sensitivity. Moreover, hepatic ER stress-dependent eIF 2 α-P signaling is implicated in an unanticipated cross-talk between the liver and peripheral organs to influence insulin sensitivity, probably via IGFBP- 3. Finally, eIF 2 α is crucial for proper resolution of insulin-induced ER stress...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the radially symmetric nonlinear von Kármán plate equations for circular or annular plates in {{the limit of}} small thickness. The loads on the plate consist of a radially symmetric pressure load and a uniform edge load. The dependence of the steady states on the edge load and thickness is studied using asymptotics as well as numerical calculations. The von Kármán plate equations are a singular perturbation of the Fӧppl membrane equation in the asymptotic limit of small thickness. We study the role of compressive membrane solutions in the small thickness asymptotic behavior of the plate solutions. We give evidence for the existence of a singular compressive solution for the circular membrane and show by a singular perturbation expansion that the nonsingular compressive solution approach this singular solution as the radial stress {{at the center of the}} plate vanishes. In this limit, an infinite number of folds occur with respect to the edge load. Similar behavior is observed for the annular membrane with zero edge load at the inner radius in the limit as the circumferential stress vanishes. We develop multiscale expansions, which are asymptotic to members of this family for plates with edges that are elastically supported against rotation. At some thicknesses this approximation breaks down and a boundary layer appears at the center of the plate. In the limit of small normal load, the points of breakdown approach the bifurcation points corresponding to buckling of the nondeflected state. A uniform asymptotic expansion for small thickness combining the boundary layer with a multiscale approximation of the outer solution is developed for this case. These approximations complement the well known boundary layer expansions based on tensile membrane solutions in describing the bending and stretching of thin plates. The approximation becomes inconsistent as the <b>clamped</b> <b>state</b> is approached by increasing the resistance against rotation at the edge. We prove that such an expansion for the clamped circular plate cannot exist unless the pressure load is self-equilibrating. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) is activated in vivo by insulin administration in humans, and whether impaired activation of Akt could {{play a role in}} insulin resistance, we measured the activity and phosphorylation of Akt isoforms in skeletal muscle from 3 groups of subjects: lean, obese nondiabetic, and obese type 2 diabetic. Vastus lateralis biopsies were taken in the basal (overnight fast) and insulin-stimulated (euglycemic <b>clamp)</b> <b>states.</b> Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was reduced 31 % in obese subjects and 63 % in diabetic subjects, compared with lean subjects. Glycogen synthase (GS) activity in the basal state was reduced 28 % in obese subjects and 49 % in diabetic subjects, compared with lean subjects. Insulin-stimulated GS activity was reduced 30 % in diabetic subjects. Insulin treatment activated the insulin receptor substrate- 1 –associated (IRS- 1 –associated) phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) 6. 1 -fold in lean, 3. 7 -fold in obese, and 2. 4 -fold in diabetic subjects. Insulin also stimulated IRS- 2 –associated PI 3 -kinase activity 2. 2 -fold in lean subjects, but only 1. 4 -fold in diabetic subjects. Basal activity of Akt 1 /Akt 2 (Akt 1 / 2) and Akt 3 was similar in all groups. Insulin increased Akt 1 / 2 activity 1. 7 - to 2. 0 -fold, and tended to activate Akt 3, in all groups. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt 1 / 2 was normal in obese and diabetic subjects. In lean subjects only, insulin-stimulated Akt 1 / 2 activity correlated with glucose disposal rate. Thus, insulin activation of Akt isoforms is normal in muscle of obese nondiabetic and obese diabetic subjects, despite decreases of approximately 50 % and 39 % in IRS- 1 – and IRS- 2 –associated PI 3 -kinase activity, respectively, in obese diabetic subjects. It is therefore unlikely that Akt {{plays a major role in}} the resistance to insulin action on glucose disposal or GS activation that is observed in muscle of obese type 2 diabetic subjects...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the deformation and adhesion of thin elastic sheets that come into contact with an underlying substrate. The focus of this work is on the interplay between material and geometric properties of a system and how this interplay determines the equilibrium states of sheet and substrate, particularly in the regime of geometrically nonlinear deformations. We first consider the form of an elastic sheet that is partially adhered to a rigid substrate, accounting for deflections with large slope: the Sticky Elastica. Starting from the classical Euler Elastica we provide numerical results for the profiles of such blisters and present asymptotic expressions that go beyond the previously known, linear, approximations. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by desktop experiments and suggest a new method for the measurement of material properties for systems undergoing large deformations. With the aim to gain better understanding of the initial appearance of blisters we next investigate the deformation of a thin elastic sheet floating on a liquid surface. We show that, after the appearance of initial wrinkles, the sheet delaminates from the liquid over a finite region at a critical compression, forming a delamination blister. We determine the initial blister size and the evolution of blister size with continuing compression before verifying our theoretical results with experiments at a macroscopic scale. We next study theoretically the deposition of thin sheets onto a grooved substrate, in the context of graphene adhesion. We develop a model to understand the equilibrium of the sheet allowing for partial conformation of sheet to substrate. This model gives phys- ical insight into recent observations of ‘snap-through’ from flat to conforming states and emphasises the crucial role of substrate shape in determining the nature of this transition. We finally present a theoretical investigation of stiction in nanoscale electromechanical contact switches. Our model captures the elastic bending of the switch in response to both electrostatic and van der Waals forces and accounts for geometrically nonlinear deflections. We solve the resulting equations numerically to study how a cantilever beam adheres to a fixed bottom electrode: transitions between free, pinned and <b>clamped</b> <b>states</b> are shown to be discontinuous and to exhibit significant hysteresis.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdWe measured insulin’s microvascular and metabolic effects in 14 healthy young adults during a 2 -h euglycemic insulin clamp. Plasma free fatty acid concentrations were raised (Intralipid and heparin infusion) for 3 h before the clamp and maintained at postprandial concentrations during the clamp. Microvascular blood volume (MBV) was measured by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) continuously from baseline through the first 30 min of the insulin clamp.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether insulin resistance is present in lean patients with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes mellitus on long-term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), compared with matched healthy controls. We studied eight patients (four men and four women) with type 1 diabetes mellitus on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and eight healthy controls, matched for age, gender and body mass index. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies with infusion of [6, 6 -(2) H(2) ] glucose. Endogenous glucose production did not differ in the basal state between patients and controls. However, endogenous glucose production was less suppressed during clamp conditions in patients compared with controls (64 % vs 79 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 01), indicating decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity. During the clamp study, glucose disposal rate was ~ 38 % lower in patients compared with controls (24. 4 [*]±[*] 2. 5 vs 39. 7 [*]±[*] 5. 6 [*]µmol/kgLBM/min, p[*]=[*] 0. 04). Accordingly, the rate of infusion of glucose was ~ 51 % lower in patients (17. 7 [*]±[*] 2. 8 vs 39. 7 [*]±[*] 5. 7 [*]µmol/kgLBM/min, p[*]=[*] 0. 02). Finally, non-esterified fatty acids levels were ~ 2. 5 times higher in patients during steady <b>state</b> <b>clamp</b> conditions (150 [*]±[*] 26 vs 58 [*]±[*] 4 [*]pmol/L, p[*]=[*] 0. 01), reflecting decreased insulin sensitivity of lipolysis. Insulin resistance is a prominent feature of lean patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, despite long term and stable treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes involves both lipolysis, hepatic and peripheral glucose metabolis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Low {{birth weight}} (LBW) is {{associated}} with increased future risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We have previously shown that young LBW men have reduced skeletal muscle expression of PI 3 K p 85 a regulatory subunit and p 110 b catalytic subunit, PKCf and GLUT 4 in the fasting state. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether insulin activation of the PI 3 K/Akt and MAPK signalling pathways is altered in skeletal muscle of young adult men with LBW. Methods: Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from 20 healthy 19 -yr old men with BW,/= 10 th percentile for gestational age (LBW) and 20 normal birth weight controls (NBW), matched for physical fitness and whole-body glucose disposal, prior to (fasting state) and following a 4 -hr hyperinsulinemic euglycemic <b>clamp</b> (insulin stimulated <b>state).</b> Expression and phosphorylation of selected proteins was determined by Western blotting. Principal Findings: Insulin stimulated expression of aPKCf (p, 0. 001) and Akt 1 (p, 0. 001) was decreased in muscle of LBW men when compared to insulin stimulated controls. LBW was associated with increased insulin stimulated levels of IRS 1 (p, 0. 05), PI 3 K p 85 a (p, 0. 001) and p 110 b (p, 0. 05) subunits, while there was no significant change in these proteins in insulin stimulated control muscle. In addition LBW had reduced insulin stimulated phospho-Akt (Ser 473) (p, 0. 01), indicative of reduced Akt signalling.

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} (IR) is a {{major risk}} factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A simple, high resolution assessment of IR would enable earlier diagnosis and more frequent monitoring of intervention effects. Current assessments are either too intensive for clinical settings (Euglycemic Clamp, IVGTT) or have too low resolution (HOMA). A model-based insulin sensitivity metric (SI) is validated on N= 146 Euglycemic- Hyperinsulinemic <b>Clamps</b> during transient <b>state.</b> A novel, clinically useful test protocol is designed with: physiological dosing, short duration (< 1 hour), simple protocol, low cost, repeatability and high correlation to the clamp. Model-based SI is assessed from low dose IV injections (10 g glucose, 1 U insulin) using glucose, insulin and C-peptide measurements in a < 60 minute test. Accuracy and repeatability are assessed with Monte Carlo analysis on the virtual clamp cohort (N= 146) and in pilot clinical trials on type 2, obese and lean subjects. Correlation between SI and clamp ISI is r= 0. 97 in transient state. Insulin sensitivity from Monte Carlo analysis has a coefficient of variation (CV) of CVSI= 4. 5 % (90 %CI: 3. 8 % - 5. 7 %), slightly higher than clamp ISI (CVISI= 3. 3 % (90 %CI: 3. 0 % - 4. 0 %)) and significantly lower than HOMA (CVHOMA= 10. 0 % (90 %CI: 9. 1 % - 10. 8 %)). Pilot clinical trials show a high-resolution, 7 x range in SI between type 2 and healthy subjects, and provide initial confirmation of the simulated test repeatability. The proposed protocol is simple, cost effective, repeatable and highly correlated to the gold-standard clamp. Early clinical results match simulated accuracy and performance and provide high resolution. The protocol can be readily computationally engineered to a less intense, equally high resolution sub- 30 minute version...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether insulin activation of the PI 3 K/Akt and MAPK signalling pathways is altered in skeletal muscle of young adult men with LBW. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from 20 healthy 19 -yr old men with BW< or = 10 th percentile for gestational age (LBW) and 20 normal birth weight controls (NBW), matched for physical fitness and whole-body glucose disposal, prior to (fasting state) and following a 4 -hr hyperinsulinemic euglycemic <b>clamp</b> (insulin stimulated <b>state).</b> Expression and phosphorylation of selected proteins was determined by Western blotting.

40|$|The {{present study}} used {{fluorescent}} microspheres {{to examine the}} circulation in Haliotis iris. Fluorescent microspheres have not been used previously to study the circulatory system of invertebrates, despite their extensive application {{in the field of}} vertebrate circulatory physiology. A method of recovery and quantification of injected microspheres from the organs of H. iris was employed and refined. Satisfactory recoveries of the injected labels using the modified recovery method were achieved (> 90 %), and the relative distribution of the blood flow to the organs in resting animals was able to be determined. Circulatory changes associated with the physiological <b>states</b> of <b>clamping</b> and long-term (24 hrs) emersion were investigated by sequentially injecting differently labelled microspheres under control and treatment states. The relative entrapment of the injected labels in the organs under the different physiological states reflected circulatory changes which these states produce. During emersion, increases in the relative perfusion of peripheral tissues which facilitate auxiliary gas exchange in other gastropods were not observed in H. iris. A decrease in relative perfusion of the foot suggested that this muscle may be isolated from the main circulation during emersion, and the simultaneous increase in microsphere entrapment observed in the gills but not other predominantly venous tissues, suggested arterial blood is, at least in part, bypassing the conventionally defined routes of flow during this physiological <b>state.</b> <b>Clamping</b> was associated with a decrease in relative perfusion of the foot muscle and more noticeably the adductor muscle, both of which appeared to be isolated {{from the rest of the}} circulation, and a simultaneous increase in microsphere entrapment in the gills strongly supports the existence of a hypothesised arterio-venous shunt. A protocol for measurement of cardiac output and stroke volume in H. iris using a modified reference sampling method was developed. Cardiac output and stroke volume (CSV) was estimated in resting animals and changes in the cardiac output associated with clamping were investigated Cardiac output was estimated at around 120 ml kg- 1 min- 1, and CSV was around 1. 2 ml in the resting animals examined. A considerable decrease in cardiac output to around 40 ml kg- 1 min- 1 was observed when the animals were forced to clamp. This decrease was due to reductions in both heart rate and cardiac stroke volume. The method for using fluorescent microspheres to measure regional perfusion in H. iris was validated by comparison of control and treatment data and histological method...|$|R
40|$|ESD, the {{discharge}} of electrostatically generated charges into an IC, {{is one of the}} most important reliability problems for ultra-scaled devices. This electrostatic charge can generate voltages of up to tens of kilovolts. These very high voltages can generate very high electric fields and currents across semiconductor devices, which may result in dielectric damage or melting of semiconductors and contacts. It has been reported that up to 70 % of IC failures are caused by ESD. Therefore, it’s necessary to design a protection circuit for each pin that discharges the ESD energy to the ground. As the devices are continuously scaling down, while ESD energy remains the same, they become more vulnerable to ESD stress. This higher susceptibility to ESD damage is due to thinner gate oxides and shallower junctions. Furthermore, higher operating frequency of the scaled technologies enforces lower parasitic capacitance of the ESD protection circuits. As a result, increasing the robustness of the ESD protection circuits with minimum additional parasitic capacitance is the main challenge in state of the art CMOS processes. Providing a complete ESD immunity for any circuit involves the design of proper protection circuits for I/O pins in addition to an ESD clamp between power supply pins. In this research both of these aspects are investigated and optimized solutions for them are reported. As Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) has the highest ESD protection level per unit area, ESD protection for I/O pins is provided by optimizing the first breakdown voltage and latch-up immunity of SCR family devices. The triggering voltage of SCR is reduced by a new implementation of gate-substrate triggering technique. Furthermore, a new device based on SCR with internal darlington pair is introduced that can provide ESD protection with very small parasitic capacitance. Besides reducing triggering voltage, latch-up immunity of SCR devices is improved using two novel techniques to increase the holding voltage and the holding current. ESD protection between power rails is provided with transient clamps in which the triggering circuit keeps the clamp “on” during the ESD event. In this research, two new clamps are reported that enhance the triggering circuit of the clamp. The first method uses a CMOS thyristor element to provide enough delay time while the second method uses a flip flop to latch the <b>clamp</b> into “on” <b>state</b> at the ESD event. Moreover, the stability of transient clamps is analyzed and it’s been shown that the two proposed clamps have the highest stability compared to other state of the art ESD clamps. Finally, in order to investigate the impact of ESD protection circuits on high speed applications a current mode logic (CML) driver is designed in 0. 13 μm CMOS technology. The protection for this driver is provided using both MOS-based and SCR-based protection methods. Measurement results show that, compared to MOS-based protection, SCR-based protection has less impact on the driver performance due to its lower parasitic capacitance...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROJECT CONTEXT ESCO Incorporated {{manufactures}} {{a variety}} of steel parts using a sand mold casting process. In this process a clamping device is used to prevent the sand mold from leaking during the pouring process. The current clamp design has several deficiencies including an uneven distribution of the clamping force, mold damage caused by the engagement of the clamping device, and the manual disengagement of the clamp. These factors result in defective parts and time delays in part manufacturing. The MIME capstone design team 46. 1 was tasked with creating an improved clamping device that would eliminate these issues and increase profits for ESCO. DESIGN PROCESS The team began the design process by analyzing the customer needs and developing corresponding engineering requirements. The second {{step in the process}} consisted of researching {{a variety of}} clamping designs and design components used both within and outside of the casting industry and evaluating them according to how well they satisfied the required functions. Based on this information the team created four different clamp designs. The four designs were then evaluated against the engineering requirements and ranked in a decision matrix. The concept with the highest ranking was selected as the final design. SELECTED DESIGN The clamp design selected for implementation, shown in Figure 1, is based on two main components: a rack and pinion jack and an adjustable steel footprint. The rack and pinion jack reduces set-up time by combining the clamp height adjustment and clamping force application with handle rotation. The force is applied smoothly, thus avoiding damage to the mold. The adjustable footprint uses steel angle irons that can withstand the high temperatures of the casting process and a slotted connection to accommodate a variety of mold layouts. It also distributes the required clamping force evenly. Finally, the design utilizes two pinned connections that allow the clamping device to disengage automatically from the sand mold. IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING The team purchased the Rack and Pinion jack from a company in Germany and purchased the remaining parts from local hardware stores. Next, the team performed all of the welding and fabrication for each of the components of the <b>clamp</b> at Oregon <b>State</b> University. The <b>clamp</b> was then assembled and tested on a simulated sand mold. Load cells were used to demonstrate the ability of the clamp to provide the necessary clamping force as well as the force distribution. Additional tests on the clamp were performed including: durability, setup time, maintenance, sand mold clearance, and the ability of the clamp to auto disengage. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The clamp design passed all of the tests. Based on the implementation and testing, modifications were made to improve the functionality of the clamp. First, the team replaced the plastic handle on the jack with an aluminum handle for increased durability. Second, the team added a sheet metal guard around the bottom portion of the rack to prevent damage due to liquid metal splashing onto the rack. In the future, the team recommends replacing the manually operated handle with an attachment that allows for a pneumatic drill to reduce setup time. Additionally, the team recommends adding a torque wrench attachment to the handle to provide a more consistent clamping force each time the clamp is engaged...|$|R
