40|$|Abstract: A person’s heart {{forces the}} blood to {{flow through the}} arteries. As a result the arteries throb {{in sync with the}} beating of the heart. This {{throbbing}} can be felt at the person’s wrist and other places over the body. Electronically this throbbing can be sensed using LDR and LED sensor. The LDR resistance changes with the intensity of the light falling on its surface. The variations in the light intensity due to blood flow are exploited in this project. The <b>counter</b> <b>is</b> <b>configured</b> such that it counts the pulses for 1 minute. The process is initiated by a start condition and the count terminates at the end of 60 seconds. The result is displayed on the LCD. Although the pulse rate can be manually measured by us, an electronic digital heart beat counter gives the opportunity to measure tit automatically and continuously. Our heart beat monitor has the following salient features like Light dependent resistor is used as transducer, blinking LED for visual indication of heat beats,counts are automatic and are displayed on LCD, Continuous monitoring can be done, the processed signal can be fed to data logger for future reference, Works on AC mains or batteries. Description: Design of model bio-telemetric system is embedded system of distributed nature aimed at monitoring of patient's vital functions, among others heart rate and Carbon dioxide saturation. Model bio-telemetric system can be partitioned into two basic parts. Inner part located in patient's home and outer part located in monitorin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDynamic Thermal and Power Management methods highly {{depend on}} the quality of the monitoring, which needs to provide estimations of the system's state. This can be {{achieved}} with a set of performance <b>counters</b> that can <b>be</b> <b>configured</b> to track logical events at different levels. Although this problem has been addressed in the literature, recently developed highly reactive adaptation techniques require faster, more accurate and more robust estimations methods. A systematic approach (PESel) is proposed for the selection of the relevant performance events from the local, shared and system resources. We investigate an implementation of a neural network based estimation technique which provides better results compared to related works. Our approach is robust to external temperature variations and takes into account dynamic scaling of the operating frequency. It achieves 96 % accuracy with a temporal resolution of 100 ms, with negligible performance/energy overheads (less than 1 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{monitoring}} <b>counters</b> <b>are</b> {{implemented in}} most recent microprocessors. In this thesis, we describe various performance measurement experiments {{for a program}} and a system that we conducted on a Linux operating system using the Pentium performance counters. We carried out our performance measurements on a Pentium II microprocessor. The Pentium II performance <b>counters</b> can <b>be</b> <b>configured</b> to count events such as cache misses, TLB misses, instructions executed etc. We used a low intrusive overhead technique to access these performance counters. We used these performance counters to measure the cache miss overheads due to context switches in Linux system. Our methodology involves sampling the hardware counters every 50 ps. The sampling was set up using signals related to interval timers. We describe an analytical cache performance model under multiprogrammed condition from the literature and validate it using the performance monitoring counters. We next explores the long term performance of a system under different workload conditions. Various performance monitoring events - data cache h, data TLB misses, data cache reads or writes, branches etc. - are monitored over a 24 hour period. This is useful in identifying activities which cause loss of system performance. We used timer interrupts for sampling the performance counters. We develop a profiling methodology to give a perspective of performance of the different functions of a program, {{not only on the}} basis of execution-time but also on the data cache misses. Available tools like prof on Unix can be used to pinpoint the regions of performance loss of programs, but they mainly rely on an execution-time profiles. This does not give insight into problems in cache performance for that program. So we develop this methodology to get the performance of each function of the program not only {{on the basis of its}} execution time but also on the basis of its cache behavior...|$|R
40|$|Most prior {{field studies}} of new {{particle}} formation (NPF) {{have been performed}} at or near ground level, leaving many unanswered questions regarding the vertical extent of NPF. To address this, we measured concentrations of 11 – 16  nm diameter particles from ground level to 1000  m during the 2013 New Particle Formation Study at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site in Lamont, Oklahoma. The measurements were performed using a tethered balloon carrying two condensation particle <b>counters</b> that <b>were</b> <b>configured</b> for two different particle cut-off diameters. These observations were compared to data from three scanning mobility particle sizers at the ground level. We observed that 11 – 16  nm diameter particles were generated at the top region of the boundary layer, and were then rapidly mixed throughout the boundary layer. We also estimate liquid water content of nanoparticles using ground-based measurements of particle hygroscopicity obtained with a Humidified Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer and vertically resolved relative humidity (RH) and temperature measured with a Raman lidar. Our analyses of these observations lead to the following conclusions regarding nanoparticles formed during NPF events at this site: (1)  ground-based observations may not always accurately represent the timing, distribution, and meteorological conditions associated {{with the onset of}} NPF; (2)  nanoparticles are highly hygroscopic and typically contain up to 50  % water by volume, and during conditions of high RH combined with high particle hygroscopicity, particles can be up to 95  % water by volume; (3)  increased liquid water content of nanoparticles at high RH greatly enhances the partitioning of water-soluble species like organic acids into ambient nanoparticles...|$|R

Use of cosmic-ray muons at ground-level confirmed 50 ps timing resolution for each layer, giving an overall time-of-flight resolution of 70 ps rms using a pure Gaussian resolution function. Comparison with previous measurements on a similar scintillator hodoscope indicates good agreement with the scaling law that timing resolution is proportional to 1 / √ Npe, where Npe is the effective number of photoelectrons...|$|R
