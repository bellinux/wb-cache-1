50|$|Between late {{model year}} 1961 and early model year 1963, {{approximately}} 52,000 die-cast aluminum RG blocks were produced and installed in passenger cars. These open-deck blocks used integrally cast high-nickel iron cylinder liners, and bolt-in iron {{upper and lower}} main bearing caps. Internal components (crank, rods, pistons, etc.) {{were the same as}} used in the iron engine, and an iron cylinder head was used with a special <b>copper-asbestos</b> gasket. The aluminum block weighs about 80 lb less than the iron RG block.|$|E
