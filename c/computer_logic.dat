500|$|This {{definition}} has {{the conceptual}} advantage of relying {{only on the}} minimal foundations of the natural numbers: the existence of 0 and of successors. As such, it is useful for <b>computer</b> <b>logic</b> systems such as LF and the Isabelle theorem prover. With this definition, the evenness of zero is not a theorem but an axiom. Indeed, [...] "zero is an even number" [...] may be interpreted {{as one of the}} Peano axioms, of which the even natural numbers are a model. A similar construction extends the definition of parity to transfinite ordinal numbers: every limit ordinal is even, including zero, and successors of even ordinals are odd.|$|E

40|$|As {{revealed}} by discussions of principle on energy dissipation by <b>computers,</b> <b>logic</b> imposes constraints on physical systems {{designed for a}} logical function. We define a notion of logical dissipation for a finite automaton.

As a result, practical computers, which are necessarily modular, dissipate proportionally to computation time. Comment: 12 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
500|$|Nathan Spring is a 41-year-old Chief Superintendent [...] in the British {{police force}} who reluctantly accepts {{promotion}} to Commander of the International Space Police Force with the brief of {{turning them into}} a full-time professional police force. Spring is a career policeman who has become disenchanted with the prevailing methods of policing which, he feels, are too dependent on <b>computer</b> <b>logic</b> and not on human instinct. His first job as a young detective was to arrest his own father, a computer salesman, for industrial espionage. Spring {{is a man who}} is driven but lonely, a man who doesn't make friends easily and whose ability to do so is not easy on account of his choice of career and work environment. His constant companion is Box, a prototype handheld computer (also voiced by Calder), bequeathed to him by his father. The conversations between Box and Spring provide insight into Spring's emotional state and thought processes as Spring engages in [...] "almost Jacobean-style soliloquies" [...] with the device.|$|E

When compared to the writings of contemporary theorists and designers of computer-mediated architecture, {{we see that the}} Archigram Group has been able to forecast much of the current concerns of the architecture that deal with digital and virtual spaces. Without literally digitalizing their projects or spaces, {{they have been able to}} achieve information-based architectural design. [Full paper in Portuguese...|$|R
