60|$|Mark, on this occasion, for {{the first}} time, noted a change that was {{gradually}} taking place {{on the surface of}} the Reef, without the crater. Most of its cavities were <b>collecting</b> <b>deposits,</b> that were derived from various sources. Sea-weed, offals, refuse stuff of all kinds, the remains of the deluge of fish that occurred the past year, and all the indescribable atoms that ever contribute to form soil in the neighbourhood of man. There were many spots on the Reef, of acres in extent, that formed shallow basins, in which the surface might be two or three inches lower than the surrounding rocks, and, in these spots in particular, the accumulations of an incipient earthy matter were plainly visible. As these cavities collected and retained the moisture, usually from rain to rain, Mark had some of Friend Abraham White's grass-seed sown over them, in order to aid nature in working out her own benevolent designs. In less than a month, patches of green began to appear on the dusky rocks, and there was good reason to hope that a few years would convert the whole Reef into a smiling, verdant plain. It was true, the soil could not soon obtain any useful depth, except in limited spots; but, in that climate, where warmth and moisture united to push vegetation to the utmost, it was an easy thing to obtain a bottom for grasses of almost all kinds.|$|E

This contradicts the standard mixed oligopoly results in the literature...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{development of}} Ethiopian banking {{from the beginning}} of XX century to 1936. In fact, the history of banking in Ethiopia dates back to the turn of the century, when, in 1905, the Bank of Abyssinia was established in Addis Ababa, under the reign of Menelek II. This event marked the introduction of banking in the country. National Bank of Egypt having been entrusted of the project, the new institution was chartered in Cairo and its shares were subscribed in a number of countries besides Ethiopia The Bank of Abyssinia was given a 50 years concession and was engaged in issuing notes, <b>collecting</b> <b>deposits</b> and granting loans, but its clients were mostly foreign businessmen and wealthy Ethiopians. A few years later, disappointed by the behaviour of this bank, mainly devoted to profit-making rather than promoting economic development, the Emperor supported the establishment of a wholly Ethiopian bank, the Société Nationale d’Ethiopie pour le Dévéloppement de l’Agriculture et du Commerce. Haile Sellassie, after acceding to the throne in 1930, could not accept that the country’s issuing bank was foreign-owned and, in agreement with National Bank of Egypt, decided liquidation of the Bank of Abyssinia. A new bank, the Bank of Ethiopia, under Government control, was established in 1931 and retained management, staff, premises and clients of the old bank. Italian occupation in 1936 brought the liquidation of the Bank. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|Issues ssues {{relating}} to financial stability {{have always been}} part of the macroeco-nomics curriculum, but they have often been presented as mainly of historical interest, or primarily of relevance to emerging markets. However, the recent financial crisis has made it plain that even in economies like the United States, significant disruptions of financial intermediation remain a possibility. Under-standing such phenomena and the possible policy responses requires the use of a macroeconomic framework in which financial intermediation matters for the allocation of resources. In this paper, I first discuss why neither standard macroeconomic models that abstract from financial intermediation nor traditional models of the “bank lending channel ” are adequate as a basis for understanding the recent crisis. I argue that instead we need models in which intermediation plays a crucial role, but in which intermediation is modeled in a way that better conforms to current institutional realities. In particular, we need models that recognize that a market-based finan-cial system—one in which intermediaries fund themselves by selling securities in competitive markets, rather than <b>collecting</b> <b>deposits</b> subject to reserve require-ments—is not the same as a frictionless system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first empirical {{evidence in the}} history of banking {{on the question of whether}} banks can create money out of nothing. The banking crisis has revived interest in this issue, but it had remained unsettled. Three hypotheses are recognised in the literature. According to the financial intermediation theory of banking, banks are merely intermediaries like other non-bank financial institutions, <b>collecting</b> <b>deposits</b> that are then lent out. According to the fractional reserve theory of banking, individual banks are mere financial intermediaries that cannot create money, but collectively they end up creating money through systemic interaction. A third theory maintains that each individual bank has the power to create money ‘out of nothing’ and does so when it extends credit (the credit creation theory of banking). The question which of the theories is correct has far-reaching implications for research and policy. Surprisingly, despite the longstanding controversy, until now no empirical study has tested the theories. This is the contribution of the present paper. An empirical test is conducted,whereby money is borrowed from a cooperating bank, while its internal records are being monitored, to establish whether in the process of making the loan available to the borrower, the bank transfers these funds from other accounts within or outside the bank, or whether they are newly created. This study establishes for the first time empirically that banks individually create money out of nothing. The money supply is created as ‘fairy dust’ produced by the banks individually, "out of thin air"...|$|E
