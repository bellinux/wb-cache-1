50|$|A calcicole, <b>calciphyte</b> or {{calciphile}} is a {{plant that}} thrives in lime rich soil. The word {{is derived from the}} Latin 'to dwell on chalk'. Under acidic conditions, aluminium becomes more soluble and phosphate less. As a consequence, calcicoles grown on acidic soils often develop the symptoms of aluminium toxicity, i.e. necrosis, and phosphate deficiency, i.e. anthocyanosis (reddening of the leaves) and stunting.|$|E
40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} was to analyze the calcium absorption and distribution characteristics of pteridophyte species, and to determine their adaptation to high calcium. Methods Eleven pteridophytes were collected from Maolan National Nature Reserve and the surrounding area. We analyzed their calcium absorption and distribution behavior by comparing the calcium content in each organ and the rhizosphere. Important findings In acidic soil, calcium availability in the rhizosphere of Nephrolepis auriculata was much {{higher than that of}} other species. Because of low calcium content in acidic soil, the calcium content of calcifuge was significantly lower than that of exclusive <b>calciphytes.</b> Except for N. auriculata and Parathelypteris glanduligera, the calcium content in various organs of plants that lived in acidic soil were mature leaf > roots > young leaf, and the calcium content in various organs of plants that lived in calcareous soil were roots > mature leaf > young leaf. In addition, calcium content in various organs of Pteris cretica var. nervosa had differences between calcareous and acidic soils. Calcium content of exclusive <b>calciphytes</b> had significant interspecific differences. Results suggested that N. auriculata could meet its calcium needs by enriching and activating calcium in the rhizosphere. The calcium content in plants could be reflected by the calcium supply in the soil. In different soils, the calcium-content differences in various organs might be related to their adaptive behavior towards changes ofsoil calcium content. The demands for calcium of the five exclusive <b>calciphytes</b> species were disparate. When they encountered high calcium stress, their primary adaptation behaviors differed. Cyrtogonellum fraxinellum, Cyrtomium fortune and Pteris vittata had calciphilious features, but Adiantum capillus-veneris was a low calcium species...|$|R
40|$|Hemerobe {{assessment}} of Artemisia L. species growing in Ukraine showed that 22 species (75, 9 %) were hemerophytes and 7 species (24, 1 %) were hemerophobes; 55, 2 % {{did not give}} preference to any of ecosystem types, but they distributed in different of them. 24 species belong to synanthropic complex of the genus, 9 of them (31 % of the whole species number) are adventive. From 15 apophytes 6 (40 %) are euapophytes, 7 (46, 7 %) are hemiapophytes, and 2 (13, 3 %) are spontaneophytes. Obligatory <b>calciphytes</b> formed non-synanthropic group – 5 species (17, 2 %). Semblance of “successfull synanthrope” for Ukrainian species of Artemisia is revealed: xerophyte, glycaphyte, herbaceous with descending axis mono- or polycarpic...|$|R
