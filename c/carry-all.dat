5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912, {{debentures}} were sold to Wood and Gandy Co. for $17,700, so five new, steel road graders were purchased from Hamilton Machinery Co....World War II ended...Victory bonds were cashed and a Crawler tractor with a <b>carry-all</b> scraper was purchased. The first motor patrol operator was hired at $125 per month. Snow removal became necessary so a V-plow attachment {{and a set of}} chains were added... Highway #14 had been reconstructed so the R.M. posted new signs for the towns at junctions..|$|E
60|$|In the {{contagion}} {{of their}} perfunctory gaiety Annie began to scream and laugh too, as she followed {{them to the}} door, and stood talking to them while they got into Mrs. Wilmington's extension-top <b>carry-all.</b> She answered with deafening promises, when they put their bonnets out of the <b>carry-all</b> and called back to her {{to be sure to}} come soon to see them soon.|$|E
6000|$|When Mrs. Bhaer {{returned}} from her drive that afternoon, {{before she could}} unpack the load of little boys, without whom she seldom moved, a small girl of ten skipped out {{at the back of}} the <b>carry-all</b> and ran into the house, shouting, ...|$|E
60|$|At last, {{at about}} half past seven the train {{from the island}} arrived, and the people surged out in a mass. We stood hanging over {{the end of the}} upper deck, looking down. On they poured, in a thick mass, up the gangway, with all {{conceivable}} sorts of luggage: bundles, embroidered <b>carry-alls,</b> bags, saddle-bags--the q-b lamenting she had not bought one--a sudden surging mass of people and goods. There are soldiers too--but these are lined upon the bit of a quay, to wait.|$|R
50|$|The Museum has a {{large number}} of {{armoured}} vehicles in its collection ranging from a motorcycle to jeeps, <b>carry-alls,</b> carriers and tanks. Aside from fully restored Bren Gun Carrier and M24 Chaffee, a pair of M4A2(76)W HVSS, and one unrestored Centurion, there are also a number of foreign-operated vehicles including a Scania HLVW prototype that went unprocured by the Canadian Forces in the 1980s. Several Ferrets are still in operation, along with an FV433 Abbot SPG self-propelled gun provided by the British Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS) detachment at Suffield, Alberta.|$|R
60|$|Now {{that his}} {{mistress}} was safe, Ben enjoyed that wild ride mightily, {{and so did}} the bay mare; for Lita had good blood in her, and proved it that day by doing her three miles in a wonderfully short time. People jogging along in wagons and country <b>carry-alls</b> stared amazed as the reckless pair went by. Women, placidly doing their afternoon sewing at the front windows, dropped their needles to run out with exclamations of alarm, sure some one was being run away with; children playing by the roadside scattered like chickens before a hawk, as Ben passed with a warning whoop, and baby-carriages were scrambled into door-yards with perilous rapidity at his approach.|$|R
6000|$|The doctor {{ran out of}} the house, and {{she heard}} his buggy whirl away, {{followed}} by the fainter sound of Savor's feet as he followed running, after he had stopped to repeat his story to the Boltons. Annie turned to the farmer. [...] "Mr. Bolton, get the <b>carry-all.</b> I must go." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Celia {{had been}} laid comfortably in bed by the farmer's wife and daughter; and, when the doctor arrived, bore the setting of her arm bravely. No other serious damage appeared, and bruises soon heal, so Ben was sent home to comfort Thorny with a good report, and ask the Squire to drive up in his big <b>carry-all</b> for her the next day, if {{she was able to}} be moved.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I can't {{wait till}} I {{get back to}} the hotel. I want to know now. I want you should stop at the very fust house we come to. Dea'! The'e don't seem to be any houses, any moa." [...] She peered out {{around the side of the}} <b>carry-all</b> and {{scrutinized}} the landscape. [...] "Hold on! No, yes it is, too! Whoa! Whoa! The'e's a man in that hay-field, now!" ...|$|E
60|$|The farmers' <b>carry-alls</b> {{filled the}} long shed beside the church, and their leathern faces looked up, with their wives' and children's, at Mr. Peck {{where he sat}} high behind the pulpit; a patient expectance {{suggested}} itself in the men's bald or grizzled crowns, and in the fantastic hats and bonnets of their women folks. The village ladies {{were all in the}} perfection of their street costumes, and they compared well with three or four of the ladies from South Hatboro', but the men with them spoiled all by the inadequacy of their fashion. Mrs. Gates, the second of her name, was very stylish, but the provision-man had honestly the effect of having got for the day only into the black coat which he had bought ready-made for his first wife's funeral. Mr. Wilmington, who appeared much shorter than his wife as he sat beside her, was as much inferior to her in dress; he wore, with the carelessness of a rich man who could afford simplicity, a loose alpaca coat and a cambric neckcloth, over which he twisted his shrivelled neck to catch sight of Annie, as she rustled up the aisle. Mrs. Gerrish--so much as could be seen of her--was a mound of bugled velvet, topped by a small bonnet, which seemed to have gone much to a fat black pompon; she sat far within her pew, and their children stretched in a row from her side to that of Mr. Gerrish, next the door. He did not look round at Annie, but kept an attitude of fixed self-concentration, in harmony with the severe old-school respectability of his dress; his wife leaned well forward to see, and let all her censure appear in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{caught up}} the child, limp with sleep, from its crib, {{and began to}} dress it. Idella cried, and fought away the hands that tormented her, and made herself now very stiff and now very lax; but Annie and Mrs. Bolton {{together}} prevailed against her, and she was dressed, and had fallen asleep again in her clothes while the women were putting on their hats and sacks, and Bolton was driving {{up to the door}} with the <b>carry-all.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was their}} first summer at Middlemount and the Landers {{did not know the}} roads. When they came to a place where they had a choice of two, she said that now he must get out of the <b>carry-all</b> and ask at the house {{standing}} a little back in the edge of the pine woods, which road they ought to take for South Middlemount. She alleged many cases in which they had met trouble through his perverse reluctance to find out where they were before he pushed rashly forward in their drives. Whilst she urged the facts she reached forward from the back seat where she sat, and held her hand upon the reins to prevent his starting the horse, which was impartially cropping first the sweet fern on one side and then the blueberry bushes {{on the other side of}} the narrow wheel-track. She declared at last that if he would not get out and ask she would do it herself, and at this the dry little man jerked the reins in spite of her, and the horse suddenly pulled the <b>carry-all</b> to the right, and seemed about to overset it.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys had}} hardly arrived when a <b>carry-all</b> {{came in from}} Clearwater Hall {{containing}} Mary and Martha, as well as Ruth and May {{and a dozen other}} girl students. There was a general handshaking, and then all took a stand on the station platform to wait for the coming of two trains which were to bear the various students in opposite directions. Everybody had already procured a ticket, and the trains which were expected were extras, for it would have been impossible for the ordinary locals to have taken care of such heavy traffic.|$|E
60|$|Then it {{occurred}} to Weston that his offer had, perhaps, not been altogether tactful, and he was sensible of a certain confusion, at which he was slightly astonished. He did not remember having been readily subject to fits of embarrassment when in England, though there he had never served as porter to people of his own walk in life. Turning away, he collected a waterproof <b>carry-all,</b> a big rubber ground sheet, another parasol, a sketching stool, and a collapsible easel, which also appeared to be damaged. Then as he knelt down and roped them and the valise together {{he looked at the}} girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "I d'know {{but what}} he can," [...] said Mrs. Bolton, dryly, and {{whatever}} her feeling really was {{in regard to the}} matter, her manner gave no hint of it. Annie did not know whether Bolton was going on her errand or not, from Mrs. Bolton, but in ten or twelve minutes she saw him emerge from the avenue into the street, in the <b>carry-all,</b> tightly curtained against the storm. Half an hour later he returned, and his wife set down in the library a shabbily dressed little girl, with her cheeks bright and her hair curling from the weather, and staring at Annie, and rather disposed to cry. She said hastily, [...] "Bring in the cat, Mrs. Bolton; we're going to have the cat to dinner with us." ...|$|E
60|$|The boy proudly escorted his {{parent to}} the old <b>carry-all,</b> and, tucking himself in behind with Mrs. Allen, had the {{satisfaction}} of seeing the slouched felt hat {{side by side with}} the Squire's Sunday beaver in front, as they drove off at such an unusually smart pace, it was evident that Duke knew there was a critical eye upon him. The interest taken in the father was owing to the son at first; but, by the time the story was told, old Ben had won friends for himself not only because of the misfortunes which he had evidently borne in a manly way, but because of his delight in the boy's improvement, and the desire he felt to turn his hand to any honest work, that he might keep Ben happy and contented in this good home.|$|E
60|$|What {{it was no}} {{one found}} out that day, but Aunt Jo's eyes twinkled so when she told Daisy she had thought of a new play, {{and was going to}} buy it, that Daisy was much excited and asked {{questions}} all the way into town, without getting answers that told her anything. She was left at home to play with the new baby, and delight her mother's eyes, while Aunt Jo went off shopping. When she came back with all sorts of queer parcels in corners of the <b>carry-all,</b> Daisy was so full of curiosity that she {{wanted to go back to}} Plumfield at once. But her aunt would not be hurried, and made a long call in mamma's room, sitting on the floor with baby in her lap, making Mrs. Brooke laugh at the pranks of the boys, and all sorts of droll nonsense.|$|E
60|$|For {{the rest}} of the journey Miss Winchelsea talked little, and what she said was as {{pleasant}} and as stamped with refinement as she could make it. Her voice was always low and clear and pleasant, and she took care that on this occasion it was particularly low and clear and pleasant. As they came under the white cliffs the young man put his book of poetry away, and when at last the train stopped beside the boat, he displayed a graceful alacrity with the impedimenta of Miss Winchelsea and her friends. Miss Winchelsea hated nonsense, but she was pleased to see the young man perceived at once that they were ladies, and helped them without any violent geniality; and how nicely he showed that his civilities were to be no excuse for further intrusions. None of her little party had been out of England before, and they were all excited and a little nervous at the Channel passage. They stood in a little group in a good place near the middle of the boat--the young man had taken Miss Winchelsea's <b>carry-all</b> there and had told her it was a good place--and they watched the white shores of Albion recede and quoted Shakespeare and made quiet fun of their fellow travellers in the English way.|$|E
6000|$|The August {{night had}} {{gathered}} by the time Basil Ransom, having finished his supper, stepped out upon the piazza of the little hotel. It was a very little hotel and of a very slight and loose construction; the tread of a tall Mississippian made the staircase groan and the windows rattle in their frames. He was very hungry when he arrived, having not had a moment, in Boston, on his way through, to eat even the frugal morsel with which he was accustomed to sustain nature between a breakfast that consisted of {{a cup of coffee}} and a dinner that consisted of a cup of tea. He had had his cup of tea now, and very bad it was, brought him by a pale, round-backed young lady, with auburn ringlets, a fancy belt, and an expression of limited tolerance for a gentleman who could not choose quickly between fried fish, fried steak, and baked beans. The train for Marmion left Boston at four o'clock in the afternoon, and rambled fitfully toward the southern cape, while the shadows grew long in the stony pastures and the slanting light gilded the straggling, shabby woods, and painted the ponds and marshes with yellow gleams. The ripeness of summer lay upon the land, and yet there was nothing in the country Basil Ransom traversed that seemed susceptible of maturity; nothing but the apples in the little tough, dense orchards, which gave a suggestion of sour fruition here and there, and the tall, bright goldenrod at the bottom of the bare stone dykes. There were no fields of yellow grain; only here and there a crop of brown hay. But there was a kind of soft scrubbiness in the landscape, and a sweetness begotten of low horizons, of mild air, with a possibility of summer haze, of unregarded inlets where on August mornings the water must be brightly blue. Ransom had heard that the Cape was the Italy, so to speak, of Massachusetts; it had been described to him as the drowsy Cape, the languid Cape, the Cape not of storms, but of eternal peace. He knew that the Bostonians had been drawn thither, for the hot weeks, by its sedative influence, by the conviction that its toneless air would minister to perfect rest. In a career in which there was so much nervous excitement as in theirs they had no wish to be wound up when they went out of town; they were sufficiently wound up at all times by the sense of all their sex had been through. They wanted to live idly, to unbend and lie in hammocks, and also to keep out of the crowd, the rush of the watering-place. Ransom could see there was no crowd at Marmion, as soon as he got there, though indeed there was a rush, which directed itself to the only vehicle in waiting outside of the small, lonely, hut-like station, so distant from the village that, as far as one looked along the sandy, sketchy road which was supposed to lead to it, one saw only an empty land on either side. Six or eight men in [...] "dusters," [...] carrying parcels and handbags, projected themselves upon the solitary, rickety <b>carry-all,</b> so that Ransom could read his own fate, while the ruminating conductor of the vehicle, a lean, shambling citizen, with a long neck and a tuft on his chin, guessed that if he wanted to get to the hotel before dusk he would have to strike out. His valise was attached in a precarious manner to the rear of the <b>carry-all.</b> [...] "Well, I'll chance it," [...] the driver remarked sadly, when Ransom protested against its insecure position. He recognised the southern quality of that picturesque fatalism--judged that Miss Chancellor and Verena Tarrant must be pretty thoroughly relaxed if they had given themselves up to the genius of the place. This was what he hoped for and counted on, as he took his way, the sole pedestrian in the group that had quitted the train, in the wake of the overladen <b>carry-all.</b> It helped him to enjoy the first country walk he had had for many months, for more than months, for years, that the reflexion was forced upon him as he went (the mild, vague scenery, just beginning to be dim with twilight, suggested it at every step) that the two young women who constituted, at Marmion, his whole prefigurement of a social circle, must, in such a locality as that, be taking a regular holiday. The sense of all the wrongs they had still to redress must be lighter there than it was in Boston; the ardent young man had, for the hour, an ingenuous hope that they had left their opinions in the city. He liked the very smell of the soil as he wandered along; cool, soft whiffs of evening met him at bends of the road which disclosed very little more--unless it might be a band of straight-stemmed woodland, keeping, a little, the red glow from the west, or (as he went further) an old house, shingled all over, grey and slightly collapsing, which looked down at him from a steep bank, at the top of wooden steps. He was already refreshed; he had tasted the breath of nature, measured his long grind in New York, without a vacation, with the repetition of the daily movement up and down the long, straight, maddening city, like a bucket in a well or a shuttle in a loom.|$|E
5000|$|Royal-T - Along with <b>Carry-All,</b> Royal-T {{attempted}} to intercept Zod over London, but was shot down. Badly wounded, he was helped to safety by <b>Carry-All,</b> but presumably expired when his comrade was killed {{before he could}} return with a fresh fuel supply.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Carry-All</b> - A capable fighter, <b>Carry-All</b> was {{dispatched}} with Royal-T to {{fend off}} Zod when the Command Centre was attacked. He accidentally came across Cy-Kill and Zod while trying to re-establish contact with the Command Centre, and was mortally wounded by Zod. However, {{he was able to}} signal the Security Forces before dying. Transforms into a CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{characters}} {{know each}} other’s names without any possible reason - for example, Cy-Kill recognises <b>Carry-All</b> in the junkyard, {{even though the}} script implies that <b>Carry-All</b> was only recently built on the Command Centre. However, it is also implied that the Robo Machines’ robot modes looked the same on Robotron even before they were modified to transform (however illogical that may seem), as Cy-Kill and Leader-One also recognise each other.|$|E
50|$|The garment {{was to be}} worn at {{the front}} like a long apron, or {{alternatively}} draped across the shoulders as a cloak. It was also frequently used as a <b>carry-all.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Several colour schemes were {{different}} from the American releases - figures such as Slicks, Herr Fiend and Night Ranger were issued in their Japanese schemes, while several others, such as Gunnyr and <b>Carry-All</b> were given brand new schemes.|$|E
50|$|The comic {{was set in}} a {{different}} continuity to the Gobots cartoon, with the characters hailing from the planet Robotron, and some character names reflecting the European line (for example, the Renegade Twin Spin appeared as the Guardian <b>Carry-All,</b> and the Renegade Vamp was named Casmodon).|$|E
5000|$|Zod - In the {{shooting}} down Royal-T, and later killing <b>Carry-All.</b> Zod still possessed the intellect of Stron-Domez, {{and was able}} to design the Devil Invaders, and oversee construction of the first, Casmodon. However, soon after his stabilisers were disabled after being attacked by the Security Forces, and Cy-Kill abandoned him.|$|E
50|$|Locking side panniers are {{supplied}} {{as standard}} in most markets and some markets include cloth 'liners' {{which can be}} used a <b>carry-all</b> for the contents of the cases. Each case will take a full face helmet. Factory options include foot protectors, hand guards, fairing protectors, larger wind screen, and a color-coordinated top box to name but a few.|$|E
5000|$|Rapid built a 10-passenger <b>carry-all</b> by 1906 {{which was}} priced at US$2,200(in current {{inflation}} $ [...] ). Every car was guaranteed for one year. The company also built {{a model that}} carried 13 passengers {{as well as a}} [...] "full line" [...] of passenger cars and trucks. The company advertised in a national trade magazine and noted; [...] "Here is a car that is needed at every club, hotel or country place." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Reverse Peephole" [...] is the 12th {{episode of}} the ninth season of the {{television}} comedy series (the 168th overall), Seinfeld. It was written by Spike Feresten and directed by Andy Ackerman. In this episode, Kramer and Newman reverse the peepholes on their apartment doors, {{which could lead to}} the landlord kicking them out. Meanwhile, Elaine hates that her boyfriend, David Puddy, wears [...] "man-fur," [...] George gets sore from carrying a fat wallet and Jerry replaces his wallet with a European <b>carry-all.</b>|$|E

50|$|Hinge and Bracket {{were never}} seen on stage without their handbags, {{and with each}} {{successive}} concert, their bags appeared to grow in size. The clasp of Hilda's vintage 1950s metal-framed <b>carry-all</b> closed with the snap of a crocodile's jaws, and in later years she would claim this action as an attention-getter learned from Mrs Thatcher ("...and she got it from Harold Wilson"). The handbags' contents reflected the personalities of their owners: Hilda's held little beyond her reading glasses, a chiffon hankie and the obligatory powder compact, whereas Evadne's accoutrements were {{a cross between a}} portable pharmacy and the contents of Just William's trouser-pocket. Hilda's favourite humiliation tactic was to ridicule the contents of Evadne's handbag in front of the audience.|$|E
50|$|Dick Barstow owns a horse ranch. When {{he comes}} upon a {{traveling}} salesman, <b>Carry-All</b> Roach, and his grandson, Bud, being harassed by Chet Jarvis, he intervenes, {{breaking up the}} incident. He invites the salesman to stay at his ranch {{to recover from the}} incident. Over dinner, Barstow and Roach become friendly, and when Roach learns that Barstow needs $1,500 to get himself out of a financial jam, he loans him the money. The next day Barstow goes to pay off his debt, which is to the father of Jean Morgan, his girlfriend. Returning to his ranch, he finds Roach by the road, dead. When he reports the murder to the local sheriff, he falls under immediate suspicion of having robbed and murdered Roach, since there is no proof that Roach loaned him the money with which he paid off Mr. Morgan. Intending to prove his innocence, Barstow evades incarceration. He returns {{to the site of the}} murder, where he finds a distinctive piece of a boot, which he recognizes as having belonged to Jarvis. Now suspecting Jarvis of the murder, Barstow heads to Jarvis' motel room to search for evidence. There, he uncovers Roach's empty wallet.|$|E
50|$|Cy-Kill then coerced {{a variety}} of human tramps and vagrants to work in Zod's new factory, {{situated}} {{on the outskirts of}} London. However, he began to dislike Zod after the monster stole the pleasure of killing the SF Robo Machine <b>Carry-All</b> from him. Cy-Kill also grew more ambitious, and modified the brain of the Devil Invader Casmodon so it would obey him over Zod. He was briefly disabled by Leader One at the scrapyard. He showed his contempt for Zod by abandoning his damaged ersatz creator in the scrapyard, intending to observe and support Casmodon's attack on London. However, he was detained fighting the SF robot Scooter outside the city. Scooter, with the aid of human Charlie Brampton, managed to trick him into being hit by a train, delaying him while Casmodon was defeated. He attempted to shoo them down once he extricated himself, but was driven off by Leader One. Frustrated at the Devil Invader's damage, he set off after the remaining SF forces by himself, and his attack was enough to cause the depleted Guardians to withdraw from Earth. At the end of the series, Cy-Kill was left on Earth, seemingly with Casmodon at his disposal.|$|E
50|$|With {{most of his}} Robo Machines {{deactivated}} by the Security Forces, Stron-Domez experiments upon himself, and is able {{to modify}} his body so he becomes the massive robot Zod. This attracts the Security Forces, but Zod is able to attack the Command Centre, and force it into retreat. However, the Security Forces robot <b>Carry-All</b> accidentally tracks them to their junkyard base, only to be mortally wounded by Zod. At the junkyard, Zod and Cy-Kill have recruited a group of destitute humans to build them more Robo Machines — Zod’s planned Devil Invaders. Carry-All's signals attract the Security Forces with just one Devil Invader, Casmodon, built. The Security Forces leave one of their number, Scooter, with Charlie on board the Command Centre, but the human has a premonition of great danger, and persuades Scooter to follow them. The premonition is correct — the massive Casmodon is incredibly powerful, and in a pitched battle on the edge of London easily holds off the Security Forces attack, inflicting heavy losses on both them and the human population. Casmodon also captures Charlie, but while inside the Robo Machine he is able to destroy vital circuitry, temporarily disabling his captor. The Security Forces then retreat to the Command Centre, and withdraw to Robotron to regroup, taking Charlie (whose parents were the only family he had, and thus has nothing to stay on Earth for) with them. Cy-Kill swears to build an army and invade the planet himself.|$|E
5000|$|Elaine, Jerry and George {{decide to}} buy a massage chair for Joe Mayo, when George offers to pay a cheaper price and save money. At a party for Joe, George admits {{it would have been}} too {{expensive}} for the chair to be delivered overnight, so they are without the gift. Elaine is not happy with David Puddy wearing a fur coat, so at the party, Elaine throws out what she thinks is Puddy's coat, but is actually Joe's. Kramer and Newman reverse the peepholes on their doors and convince Jerry that wallets are a thing of the past.The building landlord, Silvio (Jon Polito), threatens to evict Newman for his reverse peephole (thinking that he was behind the idea). Kramer intervenes with their landlord, unaware that Newman is having an affair with his wife, Svetlana. As Elaine is reluctant {{to buy a}} new fur coat for Joe, George gets back problems from his ridiculously over-stuffed wallet, making him keep the massage-chair before giving it to Joe. Elaine suggests that Jerry carry a European <b>carry-all</b> (purse), while Newman finds the thrown-out fur coat in a tree. Elaine tries to ask for the coat back, but Newman has already given it to Svetlana (which Silvio discovers), so Jerry has to pretend it is his coat to keep their suspicious landlord from finding out.Realizing that Joe Mayo does not like his taste in music ("I was getting jiggy with it!"), Jerry attempts to get the order for the chair canceled for revenge, forcing George to admit he has been using the chair lately. Kramer asks Jerry to put on the fur to make things look good for Silvio. Meanwhile, George's wallet overflows, scattering everything that was inside.Later when Elaine tries to claim the coat, Kramer covers saying that Svetlana is having an affair with Joe Mayo. In the end, Silvio plots revenge against Joe by attacking him with a sock full of pennies (after the massage chair wears out, unaware of George constantly using it). Puddy, after seeing Jerry wear the fur coat ("He looked like a bit of a dandy."), gets a new coat that is colorful and features an 8-Ball on the sleeves and back, making Elaine upset again. [...] "You got a question, you ask the Eight Ball!" ...|$|E
40|$|A face seen, {{a thought}} {{returned}} Distinguishing dance from movement {{may be a}} matter of state of mind, of invested meaning. Dance in English seems easy to define but when we get to phrases like 'the dance of desire ' or 'we were lead on a merry dance ' and when we try and untangle dance from stance or, in some cases, trance and the dance of an eyebrow or a look we need to carefully describe what is going on. Maori dance might be translated as kanikani Maori. Kanikani means to move back and forth and it is a general term for dance. Haka, taki, waiata a ringa and various other forms of dance, strut and movement of the hands {{and other parts of the}} body while singing are considered below on their own terms as much as possible. Some terms have changed remarkably over time. Haka itself may have, at an earlier time, meant to crouch (Shennan 1975). Kapa means team or group.
