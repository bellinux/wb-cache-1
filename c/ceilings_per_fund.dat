40|$|The {{distribution}} of direct public funding to political parties {{is based on}} two criteria: (1) performance at the election (<b>funding</b> <b>per</b> vote), or (2) representation in the parliament (<b>funding</b> <b>per</b> seat). Using a two-party group turnout model, we compare {{the effect of the}} two funding systems on parties’ mobilization effort and the equilibrium turnout. Allowing one party to have a larger support than the other, we uncover interesting differences regarding the equilibrium structure: while in the unique equilibrium of <b>per</b> seat <b>funding</b> systems both parties exert the same amount of effort, a <b>per</b> vote <b>funding</b> system results in an asymmetric equilibrium in which the advantaged party exerts higher effort than its opponent. We furthermore show that, at the same cost, a <b>per</b> vote <b>funding</b> system always yields higher turnout than a <b>per</b> seat <b>funding</b> system, sacrificing the representativity of the electoral outcome...|$|R

40|$|This study empirically {{investigates the}} {{hypothesis}} that a higher real ceiling on federal deposit insurance leads to an increased failure rate for savings and loans (S&Ls). After providing a history of federal deposit insurance, a formal model is developed. The empirical analysis thereof examines both the percentage of federally insured S&Ls that failed and the number thereof that failed. The results were consistent for both sets of estimates. Among other things, the time-series estimates reveal that the S&L failure rate over the 1965 - 1989 study period were a decreasing function of the real price of imported crude oil, the mortgage portfolio yield, and the average capital-asset ratio. In addition, the S&L failure rate {{was found to be}} an increasing function of the cost of deposits, the volatility of the mortgage portfolio yield, recession, and, finally, the real <b>ceiling</b> <b>per</b> account on federal deposit insurance. ...|$|R

Additionally, we find a highly statistically significant negative relationship between states that were traditionally Republican but voted for President Obama in the 2008 election (Blue states) and traditionally Red states. Furthermore, our findings suggest that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between union representation for a state and <b>per</b> capita <b>funding</b> and between <b>per</b> capita electoral votes and <b>per</b> capita <b>funding.</b> With regard to economic variables, we find that a state's unemployment rate has a positive and statistically significant influence with regard to funding, but a state's poverty rate has no statistically significant impact on funding. ...|$|R

The abatement cost functions have been constructed on the base of firm specific information provided by firms and instruments have been compared in scenarios which look forward to the year 2010. The paper discusses the major results. Cost savings in 2010 by introducing tradeable permits vary from 3 to 44 percent depending on the form of direct regulation (strict or more flexible) that is chosen for comparison. The distributional consequences of auctioning permits, respectively grandfathering permits are calculated, the scope for abuse of a dominant market position is assessed and the role of this study in the political discussion on economic environmental policy instruments in The Netherlands is discussed...|$|R

30|$|Starting in the mid- 2000 s, the Chinese {{government}} began to increase spending on healthcare, mostly to expand insurance coverage {{but also for}} biomedical infrastructure of hospitals and research facilities (Barber and Yao 2011). A series of pilot projects begun in 300 rural counties in 2003 subsequently evolved into the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) {{on the national level}} (Zhang et al. 2010). Restricted to rural participants, NCMS offers very basic subsidized insurance to households. At its origin, a typical insured member paid an annual contribution of 10 RMB ($ 1.60)b, with additional contributions by the central and local governments of 20 RMB each; premiums and coverage subsequently rose, though only modestly. Administration of NCMS and coverage decisions are the responsibility of local governments, who manage budgets by setting reimbursement limits. At present, coverage is limited to inpatient care and annual <b>ceilings</b> <b>per</b> patient are used to control expenditures. In 2012, the government set a common formula for coverage limits of eight times average annual farm income, but not less than 60, 000 RMB ($ 9, 600). NCMS operates on a local basis, and deductibles and copayments typically increase for treatment away from home (Brown and Theoharides 2009).|$|R
