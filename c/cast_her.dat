5|$|Crawford {{continued}} her reign {{as a popular}} movie actress well into the mid-1930s. No More Ladies (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in the sophisticated comedy-drama I Live My Life (1935), directed by W.S. Van Dyke. It was well received by critics and made a larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E
5|$|Born in Hong Kong, Kaif and {{her family}} lived in several {{countries}} before she moved to London. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued {{a career as a}} fashion model. At a fashion show in London, filmmaker Kaizad Gustad spotted Kaif and decided to <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in Boom (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While filming in India, Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career. However, filmmakers were hesitant to <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film, Malliswari (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles and inclination to male-dominated films.|$|E
5|$|Not all of {{the cast}} came from the Mercury Players. Welles cast Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander Kane. Comingore had never {{appeared}} in a film and was a discovery of Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin recommended Comingore to Welles, who then met Comingore {{at a party in}} Los Angeles and immediately <b>cast</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1879, after Stone {{organized}} a petition by suffragists across the state, Massachusetts women were given strictly delimited voting rights: {{a woman who}} could prove the same qualifications as a male voter was allowed to <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> vote for members of the school board. Stone applied to the voting board in Boston but was required to sign her husband's surname as her own. She refused, and never participated in that vote.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Martin Scorsese <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> as {{the dead}} wife who haunts marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) in Shutter Island, a {{psychological}} thriller based on Dennis Lehane's 2003 best-selling {{novel of the}} same name. It was released on February 19, 2010. With $41.1million in ticket sales at over 2,900 locations, Shutter Island gave Williams her widest release and best opening weekend stats. In December 2010 she appeared with Ryan Gosling as a struggling married couple in the romantic drama Blue Valentine.|$|E

5|$|Padukone {{soon began}} to receive offers for film roles. Believing herself to be too inexperienced as an actor, she instead {{enrolled}} for a course at Anupam Kher's film academy. Following much media speculation, the director Farah Khan, who had noticed her in Reshammiya's music video, {{made the decision to}} <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> for a role in Happy New Year.|$|E
5|$|When Mansfield {{returned}} to Hollywood in mid-1960, 20th Century-Fox <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in It Happened in Athens (1962). She received first billing above the title, but only {{appeared in a}} supporting role. It Happened in Athens starred Trax Colton, a handsome newcomer and an unknown whom Fox was trying to mold into a heartthrob. This Olympic Games-based film was shot in Greece in fall 1960, but was unreleased until June 1962. It was a box office failure, and Mansfield's 20th Century-Fox contract was dropped.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the characters, Nomura had wanted {{at least one}} female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was surprised when the writers <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> as a teacher, despite being around {{the same age as}} the rest of the group.|$|E

5|$|After graduating with distinction, Radner {{performed}} Schumann's Faust scenes under Jesús López-Cobos at the Teatro Real Madrid. She sang in Beethoven's Symphony No.9 {{conducted by}} Gianandrea Noseda at the Teatro Regio Torino. She performed a recital at Wahnfried on 16 August 2009 with works by Schubert, Brahms, Liszt and Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder. In December 2009 she sang the third lady in Mozart's Die Zauberflöte under Tomáš Netopil at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich in five performances. The conductor Sir Simon Rattle <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> as First Norn and Flosshilde in Götterdämmerung at the 2009 Festival d’Aix-en-Provence {{and again at}} the Salzburger Osterfestspiele in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Bryce Dallas Howard (born March 2, 1981) is an American film actress, director, producer, and writer. Howard {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, {{but left}} before graduating {{to take on}} roles on Broadway. During a performance of As You Like It where Howard portrayed Rosalind, she {{caught the attention of}} director M. Night Shyamalan, and he <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in what would be her breakout film, the psychological thriller The Village (2004) and then in the fantasy thriller Lady in the Water (2006). Her performance in Kenneth Branagh’s film adaptation of As You Like It (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. In 2006 she co-wrote and directed the short film Orchids.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{took over}} as {{production}} head after Selznick's departure and oversaw two hits starring Hepburn: Morning Glory (1933), for which she won her first Oscar, and Little Women (1933), director Cukor's second collaboration with the actress. Among the studio's in-house productions, the latter was the biggest box-office success of the decade. Ginger Rogers had already made several minor films for RKO when Cooper signed her to a seven-year contract and <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in the big-budget musical Flying Down to Rio (1933). Rogers was paired with Astaire, making his movie debut. Billed fourth and fifth respectively, the picture turned them into stars. Hermes Pan, assistant to the film's dance director, {{would become one of}} Hollywood's leading choreographers through his subsequent work with Astaire.|$|E

5|$|However, Rainbow Dash {{is still}} {{apart from the}} group and without her, the Elements will not activate. They find Rainbow Dash {{protecting}} a cloud, believing it to be her home of Cloudsdale. They start to give chase, but Rainbow flies away. They quickly use a hot-air balloon, pulled along by Fluttershy, {{to catch up to}} Rainbow. At first, it seems that Rainbow has the upper hand, but as soon as Twilight reminds Fluttershy that if she gets away Discord will win, Fluttershy puts on an enormous burst of speed and the ponies eventually catch Rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for Twilight to <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> memory spell. The ponies share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord's influence.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Fox <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in two {{independent}} gangster films filmed in the United Kingdom: The Challenge and Too Hot to Handle. Both films were low-budget, and their American releases were delayed. Too Hot to Handle was not {{released in the}} United States until 1961 (as Playgirl After Dark), and The Challenge in 1963 (as It Takes a Thief). In the United States, censors objected to a scene in Too Hot to Handle where Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins painted over her nipples, appeared nearly nude.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Love {{went through}} {{rehabilitation}} and quit using heroin at {{the insistence of}} director Miloš Forman, who <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in a leading role in The People vs. Larry Flynt. She was ordered to take multiple urine tests under the supervision of Columbia Pictures while filming the movie, and passed all of them. During this period, and after the release of Hole's Celebrity Skin, Love maintained a more polished public image, though she attracted public attention after punching Los Angeles Times journalist Belissa Cohen in the face at a party; the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, as a {{contract}} player for Paramount Pictures, Baker became a sex symbol after appearing as a hedonistic widow in The Carpetbaggers (1964). The film's producer, Joseph E. Levine, <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in the potboiler Sylvia before {{giving her the}} role of Jean Harlow in the biopic Harlow (1965). Despite significant prepublicity, Harlow was a critical failure, and Baker relocated to Italy in 1966 amid a legal dispute over her contract with Paramount and Levine's overseeing of her career. In Europe, she spent the next 10 years starring in hard-edged Italian thriller and horror films, including Umberto Lenzi's Paranoia (1969) and Knife of Ice (1972), before re-emerging for American audiences as a character actress in the Andy Warhol-produced dark comedy Bad (1977).|$|E
5|$|Stephen Boyd {{was cast}} as the antagonist, Messala, on April 13, 1958. William Wyler {{originally}} wanted Heston for the role, but sought another actor after he moved Heston {{into the role of}} Judah Ben-Hur. Because both Boyd and Heston had blue eyes, Wyler had Boyd outfitted with brown contact lenses as a way of contrasting the two men. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired after two days of work because she could not cry on cue. Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott as Miriam, and she was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline, Wyler <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> as Tirzah.|$|E
5|$|When Genelia {{was offered}} a role in Tujhe Meri Kasam, {{initially}} she turned it down, as she was not keen {{to pursue a career}} in acting. But the crew insisted and kept contacting her for two months, and she agreed when she saw the Telugu version of the movie. Tamil director, S. Shankar, was impressed with her performance in the Parker Pen commercial and decided to <b>cast</b> <b>her</b> in a leading role in his 2003 Tamil film Boys. Genelia was selected among 300 girls, who had auditioned for the movie. She signed three movies simultaneously in three different languages, Tujhe Meri Kasam (Hindi), Boys (Tamil), and Satyam (Telugu).|$|E
