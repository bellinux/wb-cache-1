2500|$|This is {{the current}} {{business}} structure utilized almost universally in the broiler, or chicken bred for meat, industry. [...] This also began in the 1940s when antibiotics began to be utilized in livestock feed. [...] Perdue is credited as the pioneer of this structure. [...] The basis is centralization of production. [...] ‘Integrators’ <b>control</b> <b>cost,</b> policy, and are the decision makers of production. [...] They decide feed formulations, choice of antibiotic administration, and cover those costs in addition to veterinary services. They also own the poultry that is grown. Farmers are labeled as ‘Growers’ or ‘Operators’. [...] They own the land and buildings where the poultry is grown, and are essentially caretakers for the poultry growth to the Integrators. [...] The benefit for Growers in this business structure is they are guaranteed payment from the Integrators, which is compensated in weight gained by each flock. [...] Due to this structure, about 90% of broilers are raised within 60 miles of the processing plant. [...] Integrators are large poultry companies such as Perdue, Tyson, Pilgrim’s Pride, Koch Foods, etc. [...] There are about 20 of these companies in the U.S. that control 96% of all broilers produced in 2011.|$|E

40|$|The perfectness and the properness concept are two {{refinements}} of the Nash equilibrium concept. Both {{are based}} on the idea that with a small probability a player will make mistakes. In this paper, we elaborate the idea that a player can control his mistake probability. However, the more a player wants to reduce this probability, the harder he has to work for it, and hence, the more costs he incurs. We formalize this idea by introducing bimatrix games with <b>control</b> <b>costs.</b> We investigate which equilibrium points of an ordinary bimatrix game are approximated by equilibrium points of bimatrix games with <b>control</b> <b>costs</b> as the <b>control</b> <b>costs</b> go to zero. We prove that, if the <b>control</b> <b>costs</b> satisfy certain conditions, then the set of approximable equilibria is a (possibly proper) subset of the set of the perfect equilibria, which may be disjoint with the set of the proper equilibria. Furthermore, we show that the basic assumption underlying the properness concept, viz. that more costly mistakes are made with an infinitely less probability, cannot be justified by our approach. In general, the set of approachable equilibria may depend on the <b>control</b> <b>costs.</b> However, we show that regular equilibria are approximated for all choices of the <b>control</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R
