5|$|Diefenbaker's {{successful}} leadership race {{had been}} run by Allister Grosart, an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd. Soon {{after taking the}} leadership, Diefenbaker got Grosart to help out at Tory headquarters, and soon appointed him national director {{of the party and}} national campaign manager. Grosart appointed a national <b>campaign</b> <b>committee,</b> something which had not been done previously by the Tories, but which, according to Grosart, provided the organizational key to success in 1957. The party was ill-financed, having only $1,000,000 to wage the campaign—half what it had in 1953. Grosart divided most of that money equally by constituency, to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories, who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party's financing.|$|E

He had been elected as the Minority Whip of the Ohio House of Representatives, replacing Dale Miller for the beginning of the 2005 session, in a November 2004 vote after being reelected to his third term.

Emanuel won the first of three terms representing Illinois's 5th congressional district, a seat he held from 2003 to 2009. During his tenure in the House, Emanuel held two Democratic leadership positions, serving as the chair of the Democratic Congressional <b>Campaign</b> <b>Committee</b> from 2005 to 2007 and as the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, from 2007 to 2009. After the 2008 presidential election, President Barack Obama appointed Emanuel to serve as White House chief of staff.|$|E

Isenhour assisted with Bob Casey, Jr.'s successful 2006 campaign against Republican incumbent Rick Santorum, served as political adviser to state House Democratic Leader Frank Dermody, and ran Governor Ed Rendell's successful 2006 re-election campaign against challenger Lynn Swann, after which she helped plan Rendell's 2007 inauguration. Rendell appointed her to the Pennsylvania Community Service Advisory Board.|$|E
5|$|Beshear {{did little}} in the {{political}} arena for almost a decade after his 1987 primary defeat, but in late 1995, he was encouraged by Democratic leaders – including former governor Ned Breathitt, Senator Wendell H. Ford, and Democratic Senatorial <b>Campaign</b> <b>Committee</b> chair Bob Kerrey – to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell. Beshear entered the primary as a heavy favorite against Tom Barlow, a former one-term Congressman from Kentucky's First District, and Shelby Lanier, a retired Louisville police officer. During the primary campaign, Beshear virtually ignored Barlow and Lanier and focused his rhetoric on McConnell. Despite Barlow's tour of all 120 Kentucky counties, Beshear cruised to victory in the primary, garnering 177,859 votes (66.38%) to Barlow's 64,235 (23.97%) and Lanier's 25,856 (9.65%).|$|E

40|$|The {{individual}} reelection {{interests of}} House incum-bents {{have been known}} to clash with the collectiveelectoral interests of the congressional parties. Ana-lyzing the 1982 elections, Jacobson (1985 - 1986) observed that Democratic incumbents hoarded their excess campaign funds and ignored the Democratic Congressional <b>Campaign</b> <b>Committee’s</b> (DCCC) appeals to assist the party’s strapped challengers—preventing the party from capitalizing on favorable national partisan trends.

Studying itemized contributions by individuals to <b>campaign</b> <b>committees,</b> he writes that competitive districts generate more contributions to local candidates running in those districts, but there are fewer predicted contributions to many other kinds of committee. He also finds that the contributions made can be greatly affected by the district’s levels of income, education and urbanization...|$|R
5|$|Clements {{never again}} sought an elected office after his defeat by Morton, though he {{remained}} active in state politics {{and continued to}} lead the anti-Chandler faction of his party. From 1957 to 1959, {{at the insistence of}} Lyndon Johnson, he served {{as executive director of the}} United States Senate Democratic <b>Campaign</b> <b>Committee</b> and helped ensure the election of a fourteen-seat Democratic majority in the Senate. He considered running for governor again in 1959, but ultimately decided against it. Without Clements in the race, the anti-Chandler faction was unable to unite behind either former candidate Bert T. Combs or former Louisville mayor Wilson Wyatt. Clements united the faction behind Combs, making Wilson Wyatt their candidate for lieutenant governor and promising him support for later races. Combs defeated the Chandler candidate, Harry Lee Waterfield in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 to 1983, Ford was {{a member}} of the Democratic Senatorial <b>Campaign</b> <b>Committee.</b> He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to California's Alan Cranston, who had held the post since 1977. Ford got a late start in the race, and a New York Times writer opined that he {{overestimated}} his chances of unseating Cranston. Immediately after conceding his loss, he announced he would be a candidate for the position in the next election in 1990. He again faced Cranston in the election, but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with prostate cancer. Ford maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston's withdrawal. When majority leader George J. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post. Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues. He supported Christopher Dodd for majority leader.|$|E
5|$|In April 1985, Wilkinson {{formed a}} <b>campaign</b> <b>committee</b> {{in advance of}} the 1987 gubernatorial election. Relatively unknown statewide, Wilkinson was the first {{candidate}} to enter the race. The Democratic primary field eventually grew to include two previous Kentucky governors, John Y. Brown, Jr. and Julian Carroll; sitting Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, who would later win two terms as governor in 2007 and 2011; and Grady Stumbo, cabinet secretary for Governor Martha Layne Collins. Early in the race, Brown was the clear-cut favorite, while Wilkinson was picked to finish fifth. Wilkinson financed his own campaign and campaign manager Danny Briscoe suggested that he hire a campaign consultant {{to reach out to the}} state's large concentration of undecided voters. After a few interviews, Wilkinson hired a then-unknown political consultant named James Carville; Carville later went on to chair Bill Clinton's successful presidential campaign in 1992.|$|E
