25|$|Fly ash is {{also used}} as a {{component}} {{in the production of}} flowable fill (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water.

The present research was based on these findings and on the hyphothesis that: attack of the amorphous phase of high calcium <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> could be initiated with trace additives, thus making calcium available for formation of useful calcium-silicate cements. Phase I research was devoted to finding potential additives through a screening process; the likely chemicals were tested with <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> representative of the cementitious and non-cementitious ashes available in the state. Ammonium phosphate, a fertilizer, was found to produce 3, 600 psi cement with cementitious Neal # 4 fly ash; this strength is roughly equivalent to that of portland cement, but at about one-third the cost. Neal # 2 <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> a slightly cementitious <b>Class</b> <b>C,</b> was found to respond best with ammonium nitrate; through the additive, a near-zero strength material was transformed into a 1, 200 psi cement.

Although the amount of ettringite formed varied with the individual cement, only a modest correlation with cement sulfate content and no correlation with cement C 3 A content was observed.

40|$|In this paper, two {{different}} ASTM <b>C</b> 618 <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> (FA) {{were used for}} the production of aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs) using powder metallurgy (PM) technology. Calcareous FAs were sampled from the electrostatic precipitators of {{two different}} lignite-fired power stations: from Megalopolis, Southern Greece (MFA) and from Kardia, Northen Greece (KFA), under maximum electricity load. FAs were milled {{in order to reduce the}} mean particle diameter and Aluminum-FA composites containing 10 % and 20 % of FA were then prepared and compacted. The green products were sintered for 2 h at 600 °C. Sintered Al-FA MMCs showed increased hardness and wear resistance suggesting their possible use in industrial applications for example in covers, casings, brake rotors or engine blocks. As most possible industrial applications of MMCs not only require wear resistance, but also corrosion resistance in different mild aggressive medias, this paper aims to study the electrochemical behavior of FA MMCs in order to evaluate their corrosion resistance. The morphology and chemical composition of the phases in the Aluminum-FA composite samples were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS). Moreover, topographic and Volta potential maps were acquired by Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKP-FM). Volta potential maps provide information about the electrochemical behavior of the different phases in absence of electrolyte. The electrochemical behavior was investigated by Open Circuit Potential measurements and potentiodynamic polarization, while the corrosion mechanisms were studied by SEM observations after different times of immersion in a mild corrosive medium. In all cases it could be stated that the addition of the FA particles into the Al matrix might cause an increase of the hardness and mechanical properties of the pure aluminum but deteriorates the corrosion resistance. The degradation phenomena occurring on the FA containing samples might be related to the following mechanisms: 1) Partial detachment or dissolution of the FA soluble phases, in particular based on Si, Fe and Ca; 2) dissolution of the Al matrix surrounding the FA particles due to crevice corrosion; 3) Al localized dissolution due to galvanic coupling between the Fe-rich intermetallics and the matrix. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The material exhibits engineering properties similar to those of soft limestone or sandstone and a lightweight aggregate.

This is especially true in the southern quarter of the state and for many areas of eastern and western Iowa. Many of the soil types encountered for highway projects are unsuitable soils under the current Iowa DOT specifications. The bulk of the remaining soils are Class 10 soils. Select soils for use directly under the pavement are often difficult to find on a project, and in many instances are economically unavailable. This was the case for a 4. 43 -mile grading (STP-S- 90 (22) -SE- 90) and paving project in Wapello County. The project begins at the Alliant Utilities generating station in Chillicothe, Iowa, and runs west to the Monroe-Wapello county line. This road carries a significant amount of truck traffic hauling coal from the generating station to the Cargill corn processing plant in Eddyville, Iowa. The proposed 10 -inch Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement was for construction directly on a Class 10 soil subgrade, which is not a desirable condition if other alternatives are available.

Out of all the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) priority and non-priority pollutants, Se has the narrowest range between what is considered beneficial and detrimental for aquatic and terrestrial organisms. The effects of ash type (i. e., fresh and weathered), water-extractant type (i. e., deionized water, rainwater, and groundwater), and extraction time (i. e., 2 - and 6 -hours) on Se, arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr) concentrations were investigated from <b>Class</b> <b>C,</b> subbituminous coal <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> produced at the Flint Creek Power Plant located in Benton County, AR. Water-extractable Se concentrations differed (P = 0. 03) between ash types across water-extractants, but were unaffected by extraction times. Unexpectedly, fresh ash water-extractable Se concentrations were below minimum detection limits (i. e., 2. 0 µg L- 1) for all treatments. In contrast, averaged over extraction times, the weathered ash water-extractable Se concentration was greatest (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with groundwater and rainwater, which did not differ and averaged 60. 0 µg L- 1, compared to extraction with deionized water (57. 6 µg L- 1). Selenite (Se 4 +) was greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) in the fresh (3. 85 mg kg- 1) than in the weathered ash (0. 70 mg kg- 1), while selenate (Se 6 +) concentration was greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) in the weathered (0. 67 mg kg- 1) than in fresh ash (0. 48 mg kg- 1). Results from {{this study indicate that}} environmental weathering of <b>Class</b> <b>C,</b> subbituminous <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> promotes oxidation of selenite (Se 4 +), to the less toxic, but highly mobile selenate (Se 6 +). The formation of hydrated ettringite [Ca 6 Al 2 (SO 4) 3 (OH) 12 - 26 H 2 O] and calcium selenite (CaSeO 3) likely acted as a sink for weathered ash selenite (Se 4 +). Implications of this research include {{a better understanding of the}} past, present, and future environmental and health risk potential associated with the release of water-soluble Se, As, and Cr to aid in the development of sustainable <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> management strategies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> {{is a waste}} {{material}} from thermal power plants that occupies large extents of precious land and causes land, water, and air pollution. Hence attempts are made to use <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> effectively instead of dumping it. Among the various possible uses, bulk utilization is possible only in geotechnical applications. Research work is being carried out on the addition of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> to improve the soil in road construction. But a thorough mixing of bulk quantities of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> and soil is not possible in the field. Hence, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) behavior of soil and <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> (<b>class</b> <b>C)</b> in layers (<b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> on top) and the same is compared with the CBR of soil-fly ash mixes. The present paper deals with the experimental study of the CBR behavior of black cotton soil-Neyveli <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> systems (layers and mixes). The study concludes that black cotton soil can be improved by layering with Neyveli <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> solving the strength problem of black cotton soil as well as the disposal problem of <b>fly</b> <b>ash...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study uses {{lime and}} <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> an {{industrial}} byproduct of electric power production produced from burning lignite and subbituminous coal, {{to study the}} plasticity reduction in highly expansive natural clays from Idabel, Oklahoma. This study is important, especially in Oklahoma, {{because most of the}} native soils are highly expansive and cause seasonal damage to roadways and structures. The addition of lime or fly ash helps to arrest the shrinkage and swelling behavior of soil. Four soil samples with the same AASHTO classification (A- 7 - 6) were used in this study to show shrinkage variability within a soil group with the addition of lime and <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> The plasticity reduction in this study was quantified using the linear shrinkage test. It was found that soils classified within the same AASHTO group had varying shrinkage characteristics. It was also found that both lime and fly ash reduced the linear shrinkage, however, the addition of lime reduced the linear shrinkage to a greater degree than the same percentage of <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> Even though it takes much less lime than fly ash to reduce the plasticity of a highly expansive soil, it may be less expensive to utilize fly ash, which is a waste product of electric power production. Lime also has a lower unit weight than fly ash so weight percentage results may be misleading...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSoft {{soils are}} not {{suitable}} for use in runway and highway construction due to their undesirable characteristics such as poor grading, low strength, and excessive plasticity, tendency to shrink or swell. By stabilizing such soils with appropriate agents, their engineering properties can be improved. One of the stabilizing agents is <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> The paper aimed to study the bearing capacity improvement of a soft soil (from Elmadağ area) by using <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> (from Soma Thermal Power Plant). In the experimental study, index properties of soft soil and fly ash stabilized samples are determined. Then modified Proctor compaction, soaked California Bearing Ratio, and Unconfined Compressive Strength characteristics of the samples are investigated. During the study, the stabilized soil samples are prepared at different fly ash contents, i. e., 0 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 %, and 10 %. The samples are subjected to soaked California Bearing Ratio tests after 0, 7, and 28 days of curing. In addition to California Bearing Ratio tests, Unconfined Compressive Strength tests with 0, 7, and 28 days of curing are performed. In order to observe microstructures of samples, Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis are performed. The {{results of the study}} show that bearing capacity of Elmadağ soft soil can be improved substantially and swell can be reduced significantly by using <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fly</b> <b>ash...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of a selected self-cementing, <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> to blow sand soils improves their compacted strength greatly {{as opposed to the}} minimal strength improvement when fly ash is mixed with loess soil. By varying the percentage of fly ash added, the resulting blow sand-fly ash mixture can function as a low strength stabilized material or as a higher strength sub-base. Low strength stabilized material can also be obtained by mixing loess soils with a selected <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> <b>fly</b> <b>ash.</b> The development of the higher strength values required for subbase materials is very dependent upon compaction delay time and moisture condition of the material. Results at this time indicate that, when compaction delays are involved, excess moisture in the material has the greatest positive effect in achieving minimum strengths. Other added retarding agents, such as borax and gypsum, have less effect...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, two <b>Class</b> <b>C,</b> lignite <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> (FAs) were {{utilized}} for the fabrication of Al/fly ash metal matrix composites (MMCs) using the powder metallurgy (PM) technique. Aluminum-fly ash and aluminum/silicon alloy (Al- 12 % Si) -fly ash mixtures, containing 5, 10 and 15 wt. % of - both pozzolanic and hydraulic - FAs were prepared and compacted. The green products were tested for their thermal behavior {{in order for}} the sintering temperature to be determined. Then, they were sintered for 2 and 6 h. The density of composites was decreasing with the increase of the percentage participation of <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> particles into them. Apart from that. although FA clusters had been developing in the metal matrix, there was a significant enhancement in the hardness of MMCs when increasing FA content, which is mainly attributed to the intense calcareous nature of the reinforcement material. Volume and mass changes throughout calcination were also estimated as a function of increasing FA weight percent and it seems that CaO (%) of FAs plays a crucial role regarding the post-sintering raise in the mass and volume of composites. Microscopic studies of green and sintered compacts clearly indicated the effectiveness of the sintering process. Additionally, the composites were characterized in terms of their chemical composition and mineralogical structure. The rise of Ca-Si- and Si-mineral phases is intense, particularly for the composites with the highest percentage presence of CaO in FAs (15 wt. %) and does not differentiate {{as a function of the}} sintering time.

40|$|Portland cement, {{hydrated}} lime, slag, <b>class</b> <b>C</b> and F <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> {{and a few}} nontraditional chemical stabilizers {{were evaluated}} in the laboratory for their effectiveness in improving strength and reducing swell potential of high-plasticity clay materials sampled at the proposed SH 130 project site in Texas. In addition to high plasticity index values, soils in the proposed construction area reportedly contain variable amounts of sulfate content {{that may lead to}} deleterious expansion due to secondary mineral growth. Over 900 test specimens from the project site were prepared and tested. The goal of the laboratory phase of this project was to provide recommendations for conducting field test strip evaluations of the select portland cement stabilizers or combinations of Portland cement and other stabilizers. Unconfined compressive strength, volume change, pH, soil classification, X-ray analysis, and scanning electron microscopy methods were used in this analysis. An unconfined compressive strength of 100 psi, a maximum volume change of 2 %, and a decrease in the plasticity index were used as evaluation criteria for determining suitable stabilizers for field trials. The following cement-based stabilization mixtures would meet the laboratory-established criteria: 6 % Cement Type I/II or Type V, 4 % Cement Type I/II + 4 % <b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> <b>Class</b> <b>C,</b> 4 % Cement Type I/II + 4 % <b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> Class F, and 3 % Cement Type I/II + 3 % <b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> <b>Class</b> <b>C</b> or F. Further evaluation by field testing, with several months of evaluation including in-situ testing, sampling, and in-ground instrumentation monitoring, is recommended for Phase II. A testing plan for evaluation is presented in this report. The outcome of the field investigation would be conclusive performance results for the recommended stabilizers in terms of strength, stiffness, and volume change. It is further recommended that the stabilization construction methods be evaluated as part of the field evaluation. This would specifically include variable mixing rates and use of intelligent compaction technology with GPS mapping capabilities...|$|R
