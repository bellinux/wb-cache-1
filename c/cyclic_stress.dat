30|$|Brackets are {{subjected}} to <b>cyclic</b> <b>stresses</b> caused by mastication, occlusion, and orthodontic appliances [19 – 21]. Although these <b>cyclic</b> <b>stresses</b> could be of lower magnitude than the static bond strength of the bonded bracket, the repeated <b>cyclic</b> <b>stresses</b> occurring throughout the treatment period could lead to failure of the bracket, a condition referred as fatigue. Fatigue is the phenomenon through which failure is induced by subjecting the material or structure to repeated subcritical loads [22, 23]. Since {{it is very important}} to simulate the oral environment condition in the in vitro bond strength studies, it is advantageous to evaluate the effects of cyclic loading on bond strength. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate and compare the cyclic shear bond strengths (CSBSs) and static shear bond strengths (SSBSs) of metallic orthodontic brackets bonded to resin laminate veneer surfaces (nanocomposite) using different conditioning protocols.|$|R

5000|$|Design {{stresses}} {{that have been}} determined from the ultimate or yield point values of the materials give safe and reliable results only for the case of static loading. Many machine parts fail when subjected to a non steady and continuously varying loads even though the developed stresses are below the yield point. Such failures are called fatigue failure. The failure is by a fracture {{that appears to be}} brittle with little or no visible evidence of yielding. However, when the stress is kept below [...] "fatigue stress" [...] or [...] "endurance limit stress", the part will endure indefinitely. A purely reversing or <b>cyclic</b> <b>stress</b> is one that alternates between equal positive and negative peak stresses during each cycle of operation. In a purely <b>cyclic</b> <b>stress,</b> the average stress is zero. When a part is subjected to a <b>cyclic</b> <b>stress,</b> also known as stress range (Sr), it has been observed that the failure of the part occurs after a number of stress reversals (N) even if the magnitude of the stress range is below the material’s yield strength. Generally, higher the range stress, the fewer the number of reversals needed for failure.|$|E

Due to the high temperatures when working with molten metals such as aluminium, iron and brass, the requirements on the tools are very high.

5000|$|Cavitation is a {{significant}} cause of wear in some engineering contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause <b>cyclic</b> <b>stress</b> through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called [...] "cavitation". The most common examples {{of this kind of}} wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is to clarify the {{behaviour}} of sand under various combination of initial static and <b>cyclic</b> shear <b>stresses</b> and develop a model for evaluating not only cyclic shear strength but also cyclic residual strain during cyclic loading. As the results of cyclic triaxial compression tests, at first, {{it was found that}} the tendencies of pore pressure and axial strain were greatly affected by the reversal of <b>cyclic</b> shear <b>stresses.</b> In second, it was found there was a unique relationship between the residual shear strain and effective stress ratio at the end of each stress cycle. In third, a unique relationship was found between effective <b>stress</b> ratio and <b>cyclic</b> strength ratio which was defined by the ratio of the amplitude of <b>cyclic</b> shear <b>stress</b> and <b>cyclic</b> shear strength for a given number of stress cycles.

50|$|Fatigue limit, {{endurance}} limit, {{and fatigue}} strength are all expressions {{used to describe}} a property of materials: the amplitude (or range) of <b>cyclic</b> <b>stress</b> {{that can be applied}} to the material without causing fatigue failure. Ferrous alloys and titanium alloys have a distinct limit, an amplitude below which there appears to be no number of cycles that will cause failure. Other structural metals such as aluminium and copper do not have a distinct limit and will eventually fail even from small stress amplitudes. In these cases, a number of cycles (usually 107) is chosen to represent the fatigue life of the material.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclic</b> <b>stress</b> is the {{distribution}} of forces (aka stresses) that change over time in a repetitive fashion. As an example, consider {{one of the large}} wheels used to drive an aerial lift such as a ski lift. The wire cable wrapped around the wheel exerts a downward force on the wheel and the drive shaft supporting the wheel. Although the shaft, wheel, and cable move, the force remains nearly vertical relative to the ground. Thus a point {{on the surface of the}} drive shaft will undergo tension when it is pointing towards the ground and compression when it is pointing to the sky.|$|E
50|$|When cyclic {{stresses}} {{are applied}} to a material, even though the stresses do not cause plastic deformation, the material may fail due to fatigue. Fatigue failure is typically modeled by decomposing cyclic stresses into mean and alternating components. Mean stress is the time average of the principal stress. The definition of alternating stress varies between different sources. It is either defined as {{the difference between the}} minimum and the maximum stress, or the difference between the mean and maximum stress. Engineers try to design mechanisms whose parts are subjected to a single type (bending, axial, or torsional) of <b>cyclic</b> <b>stress</b> because this more closely matches experiments used to characterize fatigue failure in different materials.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that not all}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>stresses</b> below the fatigue limit are non-damaging. Particularly in spectrum loading, the inclusion of some <b>cyclic</b> <b>stresses</b> below the fatigue limi can reduce the fatigue life of a component. It is believed that the boundary between damaging and non-damaging stresses is the so-called micro-plastic limit (MPL) defined as a macro-stress at which dislocation pile-up stresses begin to obstruct the magnetic domains in rotation to {{the direction of the}} tensile stress. This paper shows that MPL can be determined from changes in magnetic permeability during tensile loading. In our work, changes in magnetic permeability were measured indirectly - by measuring changes in electrical impedance (a. c. resistence and induktance).

40|$|Change in {{the stress}} state {{is one of}} the factors that {{determined}} the transition of retained austenite to martensite. It has been proved that in products made from wires of a TRIP structure, which is characterized by a high retained austenite content, loading them with varying in sign <b>cyclic</b> <b>stresses</b> of magnitudes lower than yield strength (R 0. 2) results in intensive transition of the retained austenite to martensite.

50|$|All {{accelerations}} {{of a mass}} can {{be divided}} into two components in opposite directions. For example, in order for a piston in a single cylinder engine to be accelerated upward, something must receive (support) the downward force, and it is usually the mass of the entire engine that moves downward a bit as there is no counter-moving piston. This means one cause of engine vibration usually appears in two opposing directions. Often the movement or deflection in one direction appears on a moving mass, and the other direction appears on the entire engine, but sometimes both sides appear on moving parts, e.g. a torsional vibration in a crankshaft, or a push-pull <b>cyclic</b> <b>stress</b> in a chain or connecting rod. In other cases, one side is a deflection of a static part, the energy of which is converted into heat and dissipated into the coolant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclic</b> <b>stress</b> is {{frequently}} encountered in rotating machinery where a bending moment {{is applied to}} a rotating part. This is called a cyclic bending stress and the aerial lift above is a good example. However, cyclic axial stresses and cyclic torsional stresses also exist. An example of cyclic axial stress would be a bungee cord (see bungee jumping), which must support the mass of people as they jump off structures such as bridges. When a person reaches {{the end of a}} cord, the cord deflects elastically and stops the person's descent. This creates a large axial stress in the cord. A fraction of the elastic potential energy stored in the cord is typically transferred back to the person, throwing the person upwards some fraction of the distance he or she fell. The person then falls on the cord again, inducing stress in the cord. This happens multiple times per jump. The same cord is used for several jumps, creating cyclical stresses in the cord that could eventually cause failure if not replaced.|$|E

The results indicate that for a given <b>cyclic</b> <b>stress</b> level, the soil properties under various loading frequencies are slightly different if an identical number of loading cycles is considered, whereas they do not deviate from each other if an identical time is considered. In addition, failure occurs when the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stress</b> level exceeds a critical value irrespective of the loading frequency.
