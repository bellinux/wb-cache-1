40|$|The colour-matching {{functions}} of standard observers {{proposed by the}} CIE represent the normal colour vision for the worldwide population. But there are deviations in the colourmatching functions for real observers with a normal colour vision, so the observer metamerism index was defined by CIE to evaluate the mismatch between them in colour appearance. In this work, we present an alternative form to evaluate {{the differences between the}} CIE standard observer and real observers (Stiles-Burch database) according to the number of distinguishable colours in the <b>colour</b> <b>solid</b> associated to each observer. Unlike the metamerism index defined by CIE, we evaluate globally the colour appearance for a real observer taking into account its colour gamut volume. After analyzing the results, we have seen that the gamut volume of the realobservers is lower than to that associated to the CIE standard observer, even to that associated to the CIE modified observer. Therefore, this work and its methodology could be used to know the ability of the CMF’s of different observers to get the maximum colour gamut under the same illuminant. Furthermore, this methodology could be applicable to study the gamut volume variability of the real observers regarding to age, race, etc, or even with abnormalities in colour vision (dichromacy, pathologies, etc).

The proposed new method is the first to characterize precisely the metamer mismatch volume for any possible reflectance.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{evaluating}} the colour rendering properties of lights. The proposed method uses the degree of metamer mismatching for flat grey (constant reflectance of 0. 5) quantified {{in terms of the}} metamer mismatch volume index proposed by Logvinenko et al. [2]. The standard CIE color rendering index (CRI) [1] has been widely criticized, especially when evaluating LEDs. One of the key problems with it is that it is based on measuring the colour differences that arise across a small sample of 8 (sometimes 14) coloured papers. Not only may such a sample not represent what the colour differences for all other possible surface reflectances may be, it also gives manufacturers the opportunity to tune the spectra of their lights to perform well on the standard sample. The background for the proposed measure of colour rendering is the concept of metamer mismatching. Consider a colour signal XYZ (in CIE standard coordinates) observed under a first light. Metamer mismatching refers {{to the fact that the}} possible XYZ that might be observed under a second light are only constrained to lie within a convex volume of possible XYZ values. The size of the volume depends on the XYZ and the lights involved; however, the volume for flat grey is the largest. The metamer mismatch volume represents the range of possible XYZ that can arise under the second light and so provides a measure of how different the XYZ under the second light can be. As such, it provides a measure of the colour rendering properties of the second light relative to the first. Since the metamer mismatch volume scales with the intensity of the illuminant, it is helpful to normalize the mismatch volume by the volume of the object <b>colour</b> <b>solid</b> for that illuminant, since it scales correspondingly with intensity. The result is the metamer mismatch volume index (MMVI) [2]. In terms of colour rendering, the larger the MMVI, the poorer the colour rendering is likely to be. Since the MMVI is volume based, it is more intuitive to consider MMVI^(1 / 3). The Metamer Mismatchin...|$|E
