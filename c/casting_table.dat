Using the ARPE- 19 cell line, we have previously demonstrated the feasibility of growing RPE-derived cells on membranes prepared from the silk protein fibroin. The present study was aimed at developing a porous, ultra-thin fibroin membrane that might better support development of apical-basal polarity in culture, and to extend this work to primary cultures of human RPE cells.

40|$|Direct chill (DC) casting {{is widely}} used to produce {{aluminium}} ingots and billets. One of the issues with such castings is the oxide generated especially during the filling of the <b>casting</b> <b>table</b> in the start-up phase. This oxide can affect {{the performance of the}} product during subsequent extrusion. While the very first material is cut off and discarded the distribution of oxides along the cast length is not known. It is therefore highly desirable to have an ability to predict the amount and distribution of the oxide generated during the process start-up. In this paper, we use the mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method to model the mould filling phase of DC casting. The free surface nature of the flow during this phase is especially amenable to the mesh-free SPH modelling technique. Additionally this method is very suitable for predicting surface driven and history dependent properties such as oxides. The paper presents preliminary predictions of cumulative interior and exterior oxide levels with time in a typical DC casting operation. The amount of interior oxide will indicate the effect of oxide on the final metal microstructure. The amount of exterior oxide determines the surface quality of the billet...|$|E

40|$|Modelling of Flow Phenomena during DC Casting Jan Zuidema The {{production}} of aluminium ingots, by semi-continuous casting, {{is a complex}} process. DC Casting stands for direct chill casting. During this process liquid aluminium transforms to solid aluminium while cooling down. This is not an instantaneous transformation, but occurs in temperature interval. In the casting process the latent heat is moved away by convection and conduction. A number of problems may occur during solidification, because the solidification rate is rather high. The difference in density between liquid and solid aluminium is 7 % {{and because of that}} solidification porosities may form during solidification when transport of liquid metal is insufficient. If besides this also high enough thermal stresses are present, cracks may be induced from these pores. The cracks, that originate during the solidification of the metal are called hot cracks. This in contradiction with cold cracks. These are formed due to high stress levels in the already solidified aluminium. What happens from the moment that the casting process is started? This is {{one of the questions that}} is treated in this thesis. To be able to describe the DC Casting process, it is necessary to have a good model that describes the phenomena at hand adequately and that also enables to do predictions on process changes. The model, that is used, is based on the differential equations that describe the heat- and fluid dynamics transport. In chapter 2 a description of the model is given. Numerical methods for solving these equations are also given there. Without validation, a model is of little use. Model validation can be performed using various methods during DC Casting experiments. Temperature recordings enable to follow the evolution of the temperature during the casting- and solidification process in some important positions. Because part of the heat transport in the DC Casting process is convection driven, it is also important to find information on the flow pattern and velocities in the liquid aluminium. Various methods to evaluate velocities in liquid metals are described in chapter 2. Based on their use for measuring the molten aluminium velocity during DC Casting, a ranking of the methods is made. Good boundary conditions are essential for reliable predictions of the behaviour of aluminium during the mould filling and subsequent solidification. In chapter 3 the determination of the most important boundary conditions is described. Those boundary conditions determine the amount of heat transport in that area of the system, where the heat transfer to the surroundings is the largest. Through sophisticated experiments the heat transfer from a plate of aluminium to (boiling) water could be predicted. This heat transfer model enables the prediction of temperatures close to the surface of the solidifying aluminium. By instrumentation of the experimental casting facility with thermocouples, the temperature close to the surface of the ingot could be measured as function of time. Calculations using the casting- and solidification model with the constant heat transfer coefficients, and calculations with the new model for water cooling were performed. This showed, that in the first centimetres from the surface of the ingot the new model gives a better description of the experiment. Further away from the surface towards the centre of the billet, the constant heat transfer coefficient model is just as good as the new model. The best method to measure liquid metal velocities during DC Casting is a method that is based on magnetic induction. The sensor to measure velocities is based on a ferro magnet, surrounded by a conduction tube with spot-welded thermocouples. Between two opposing thermocouples an inductive voltage is measured, which is proportional with the velocity of the surrounding medium. To test this method, a prototype of this sensor was constructed. In chapter 4 this sensor is described. The sensor was firstly tested in a water setup. Because the electrical conductivity of the water was several orders of magnitude less than that of liquid metals, this gave an unsatisfactory result. It was decided to perform fluid flow experiments in liquid tin. From these experiments results were obtained which gave a velocity dependent signal for the probe output. Unfortunately, electro-magnetical shielding from the surroundings was not good enough. This prevented to quantitatively test the sensor. In chapter 5 the start-up phase of the casting is covered. In the first part of this chapter, a calculation described in the literature was repeated, using the casting- and solidification model. This showed that, due to lack of published data, more validation was necessary to fully validate the model. With the aid of the experimental casting facility, a number of casting experiments were conducted. The experiments were recorded with a video camera and the temperature during casting was recorded by thermocouples at a number of locations in the ingot. The experiments served as the basis for a number of calculations with the casting- and solidification model. A conclusion, that could be drawn from the combination of the results of the casting experiments and the calculations, was that the description of the inlet of the mould in the model as an jet of aluminium was a good description of reality during the first tenths of seconds of the process. From the moment that the aluminium melt level is overflowing the inlet level, the jet description is not accurate anymore and should be replaced with a filling over the complete width of the mould. During casting, unwanted inclusions are filtered from the liquid aluminium by degassers and filters, before the <b>casting</b> <b>table</b> is reached. In order to comply with the increasing demands for the quality of cast products, an additional method to filter out particles from the launder system was evaluated. This is the subject of chapter 6. Manipulation of the flow pattern enables to create wakes, where particles can settle. Two dimensional calculations of the flow pattern in the mould with special flow modifiers, show that this settling is possible in theory. However, it is more likely, that transient velocity fluctuations prevent the settling of particles. To create a better method for settling of unwanted inclusions, a cyclone was designed, which enables the separation of particles 20 micrometers in diameter from a stream of liquid aluminium. The cyclone was used in a series of calculations with the fluid-flow and solidification model. The outcome of these calculations has resulted in a patent for this type of cyclone. Validation measurements using a water model of the cyclone have confirmed the working of the cyclone in separation of denser particles out of a slow flowing medium. The velocity of the particles was therefore tracked using a laser and camera set-up. The laser exposed a two-dimensional area of the water model. By auto-correlation of two subsequent images, it was possible to extract the particulate rate in this area. Velocity patterns indicated, that particles had a tendency of settling down in the lower part of the cyclone. Because there was no possibility to count all particles going in and out of the system, no quantitative comparison with the model was possible. Design, Engineering and Productio...|$|E
40|$|The {{epithelium}} of the corneolimbus contains {{stem cells}} for regenerating the corneal epithelium. Diseases and injuries affecting the limbus {{can lead to}} a condition known as limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), which results in loss of the corneal epithelium, and subsequent chronic inflammation and scarring of the ocular surface. Advances in the treatment of LSCD have been achieved through use of cultured human limbal epithelial (HLE) grafts to restore epithelial stem cells of the ocular surface. These epithelial grafts are usually produced by the ex vivo expansion of HLE cells on human donor amniotic membrane (AM), but this is not without limitations. Although AM is the most widely accepted substratum for HLE transplantation, donor variation, risk of disease transfer, and rising costs have led to the search for alternative biomaterials to improve the surgical outcome of LSCD. Recent studies have demonstrated that Bombyx mori silk fibroin (hereafter referred to as fibroin) membranes support the growth of primary HLE cells, and thus this thesis aims to explore the possibility of using fibroin as a biomaterial for ocular surface reconstruction. Optimistically, the grafted sheets of cultured epithelium would provide a replenishing source of epithelial progenitor cells for maintaining the corneal epithelium, however, the HLE cells lose their progenitor cell characteristics once removed from their niche. More severe ocular surface injuries, which result in stromal scarring, damage the epithelial stem cell niche, which subsequently leads to poor corneal re-epithelialisation post-grafting. An ideal solution to repairing the corneal limbus would therefore be to grow and transplant HLE cells on a biomaterial that also provides a means for replacing underlying stromal cells required to better simulate the normal stem cell niche. The recent discovery of limbal mesenchymal stromal cells (L-MSC) provides a possibility for stromal repair and regeneration, and therefore, this thesis presents the use of fibroin as a possible biomaterial to support a three dimensional tissue engineered corneolimbus with both an HLE and underlying L-MSC layer. Investigation into optimal scaffold design is necessary, including adequate separation of epithelial and stromal layers, as well as direct cell-cell contact. Firstly, the attachment, morphology and phenotype of HLE cells grown on fibroin were directly compared to that observed on donor AM, the current clinical standard substrate for HLE transplantation. The production, transparency, and permeability of fibroin membranes were also evaluated {{in this part of the}} study. Results revealed that fibroin membranes could be routinely produced using a custom-made film <b>casting</b> <b>table</b> and were found to be transparent and permeable. Attachment of HLE cells to fibroin after 4 hours in serum-free medium was similar to that supported by tissue culture plastic but approximately 6 -fold less than that observed on AM. While HLE cultured on AM displayed superior stratification, epithelia constructed from HLE on fibroin maintained evidence of corneal phenotype (cytokeratin pair 3 / 12 expression; CK 3 / 12) and displayed a comparable number and distribution of ÄNp 63 + progenitor cells to that seen in cultures grown on AM. These results confirm the suitability of membranes constructed from silk fibroin as a possible substrate for HLE cultivation. One of the most important aspects in corneolimbal tissue engineering is to consider the reconstruction of the limbal stem cell niche to help form the natural limbus in situ. MSC with similar properties to bone marrow derived-MSC (BM-MSC) have recently been grown from the limbus of the human cornea. This thesis evaluated methods for culturing L-MSC and limbal keratocytes using various serum-free media. The phenotype of resulting cultures was examined using photography, flow cytometry for CD 34 (keratocyte marker), CD 45 (bone marrow-derived cell marker), CD 73, CD 90, CD 105 (collectively MSC markers), CD 141 (epithelial/vascular endothelial marker), and CD 271 (neuronal marker), immunocytochemistry (alpha-smooth muscle actin; á-sma), differentiation assays (osteogenesis, adipogenesis and chrondrogenesis), and co-culture experiments with HLE cells. While all techniques supported to varying degrees establishment of keratocyte and L-MSC cultures, sustained growth and serial propagation was only achieved in serum-supplemented medium or the MesenCult-XF„¥ culture system (Stem Cell Technologies). Cultures established in MesenCult-XF„¥ grew faster than those grown in serum-supplemented medium and retained a more optimal MSC phenotype. L-MSC cultivated in MesenCult-XFR were also positive for CD 141, rarely expressed £sma, and displayed multi-potency. L-MSC supported growth of HLE cells, with the largest epithelial islands being observed in the presence of L-MSC established in MesenCult-XF„¥ medium. All HLE cultures supported by L-MSC widely expressed the progenitor cell marker £GNp 63, along with the corneal differentiation marker CK 3 / 12. Our findings conclude that MesenCult-XFR is a superior culture system for L-MSC, but further studies are required to explore the significance of CD 141 expression in these cells. Following on from the findings of the previous two parts, silk fibroin was tested as a novel dual-layer construct containing both an epithelium and underlying stroma for corneolimbal reconstruction. In this section, the growth and phenotype of HLE cells on non-porous versus porous fibroin membranes was compared. Furthermore, the growth of L-MSC in either serum-supplemented medium or the MesenCult-XFR culture system within fibroin fibrous mats was investigated. Lastly, the co-culture of HLE and L-MSC in serum-supplemented medium on and within fibroin dual-layer constructs was also examined. HLE on porous membranes displayed a flattened and squamous monolayer; in contrast, HLE on non-porous fibroin appeared cuboidal and stratified closer in appearance to a normal corneal epithelium. Both constructs maintained CK 3 / 12 expression and distribution of £GNp 63 + progenitor cells. Dual-layer fibroin scaffolds consisting of HLE cells and L-MSC maintained a similar phenotype as on the single layers alone. Overall, the present study proposed to create a three dimensional limbal tissue substitute of HLE cells and L-MSC together, ultimately for safe and beneficial transplantation back into the human eye. The results show that HLE and L-MSC can be cultivated separately and together whilst maintaining a clinically feasible phenotype containing a majority of progenitor cells. In addition, L-MSC were able to be cultivated routinely in the MesenCult-XF® culture system while maintaining a high purity for the MSC characteristic phenotype. However, as a serum-free culture medium was not found to sustain growth of both HLE and L-MSC, the combination scaffold was created in serum-supplemented medium, indicating that further refinement of this cultured limbal scaffold is required. This thesis has also demonstrated a potential novel marker for L-MSC, and has generated knowledge which may impact on the understanding of stromal-epithelial interactions. These results support the feasibility of a dual-layer tissue engineered corneolimbus constructed from silk fibroin, and warrant further studies into the potential benefits it offers to corneolimbal tissue regeneration. Further refinement of this technology should explore the potential benefits of using epithelial-stromal co-cultures with MesenCult-XF® derived L-MSC. Subsequent investigations into the effects of long-term culture on the phenotype and behaviour of the cells in the dual-layer scaffolds are also required. While this project demonstrated the feasibility in vitro for the production of a dual-layer tissue engineered corneolimbus, further studies are required to test the efficacy of the limbal scaffold in vivo. Future in vivo studies are essential to fully understand the integration and degradation of silk fibroin biomaterials in the cornea over time. Subsequent experiments should also investigate the use of both AM and silk fibroin with epithelial and stromal cell co-cultures in an animal model of LSCD. The outcomes of this project have provided a foundation for research into corneolimbal reconstruction using biomaterials and offer a stepping stone for future studies into corneolimbal tissue engineering...|$|E
