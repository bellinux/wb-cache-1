5|$|The four {{lanes of}} I-35E pass through {{downtown}} Saint Paul {{in the center}} of the six lanes of I-94, with a short overlap occupying the blocks between 11th and 12th streets. Despite this short overlap, there is no weaving between the two highways, since an exit in each direction of I-35E—exit107A from I-35E north to I-94 east, and exit107B from I-35E south to I-94 west—takes traffic that would move to the right in the overlap instead to the right of the entire roadway. There are no interchanges on the <b>common</b> <b>segment,</b> and no direct access from I-35E northbound to I-94 west or I-94 eastbound to I-35E south. Kellogg Boulevard provides an indirect connection; Ayd Mill Road, further west, nears I-94 but does not connect without several turns and traffic lights. Unlike the west split of I-35E and I-94, all ramps are present at the east split; among other uses, the I-35E southbound to I-94 east and I-94 westbound to I-35E north ramps carry traffic following US Highway10 (US10), which overlaps I-35E north of downtown, and truck traffic using the nearby Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid the parkway through the West Seventh neighborhood.|$|E

40|$|LNCS v. 6124 is Proceedings of the 6 th International Conference, AAIM 2010 To {{study the}} genetic {{variations}} of a species, one basic operation is {{to search for}} occurrences of patterns in {{a large number of}} very similar genomic sequences. To build an indexing data structure on the concatenation of all sequences may require a lot of memory. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to index highly similar sequences by taking advantage of the similarity among the sequences. To store r sequences with k <b>common</b> <b>segments,</b> our index requires only O(n + N logN) bits of memory, where n is the total length of the <b>common</b> <b>segments</b> and N is the total length of the distinct regions in all texts. The total length of all sequences is rn + N, and any scheme to store these sequences requires Ω(n + N) bits. Searching for a pattern P of length m takes O(m+mlogN +mlog(rk) psc(P) +occ log n), where psc(P) is the number of prefixes of P that appear as a suffix of some <b>common</b> <b>segments</b> and occ is the number of occurrences of P in all sequences. In practice, rk ≤ N, and psc(P) is usually a small constant. We have implemented our solution 1 and evaluated our solution using real DNA sequences. The experiments show that the memory requirement of our solution is much less than that required by BWT built on the concatenation of all sequences. When compared to the other existing solution (RLCSA), we use less memory with faster searching time. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010. link_to_subscribed_fulltextThe 6 th International Conference on Algorithmic Aspects in Information and Management (AAIM 2010), Shandong, China, 19 - 21 July 2010.
