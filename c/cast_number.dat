40|$|The {{effect of}} recasting, {{up to two}} times, Ni-Cr (DUCINOX) {{prosthetic}} alloy on its corrosion properties was carried out. The corrosion measurements were done in deoxygenated Fusayama Meyer artificial saliva solution at temperature of 37 °C. In the study following electrochemical methods were used: measurement of free corrosion potential Ecor in open circuit, measurement of polarization resistance according to Stern-Geary's method and measurement of potentiodynamic characteristic in wide range of anodic polarization. In general, it can be stated that <b>casting</b> <b>number</b> weakly influence on corrosion properties of investigated alloy. At free corrosion potential there is no monotonic dependence of corrosion parameters versus <b>casting</b> <b>number.</b> However, at extreme anodic potentials monotonic changes of corrosion parameters with increasing <b>casting</b> <b>number</b> is observed. Obtained results and drawn conclusions are partially compatible with literature data...|$|R

5000|$|As {{built the}} {{locomotives}} would have carried the lined dark olive green livery of the Great Southern & Western Railway until around {{the start of}} the 20th Century. After that, they were black with red lining until the late 1910s, when they were painted all over unlined grey. This dull but all-encompassing livery included motion, wheels, inside frames, cabs, smoke boxes and chimneys. The only relieving feature was the red buffer beam. Standard <b>cast</b> <b>number</b> plates were also painted over grey, with rim and numerals picked out in cream or very pale grey, or occasionally not at all. This livery persisted post-1925 into Great Southern Railways days, and was extended to locomotives of other constituent companies after the GSR amalgamation of that date. On the formation of CIÉ in 1945, the only change was that the <b>cast</b> <b>number</b> plates were gradually removed and pale yellow numerals were painted on instead. In addition, most tenders received a lined pale green [...] "flying snail" [...] logo. Both locomotives are out of service awaiting overhauls, with No. 186 last operating in late 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Production of chassis was {{authorised}} by the Board of Directors of BCV in tranches by type, {{known as}} [...] "sanctions". Each vehicle received a <b>cast</b> <b>number</b> plate which was {{bolted to the}} chassis in the form [...] "135.001" [...] being the first vehicle of the 135 sanction. This number was not always {{the same as the}} [...] "build number" [...] allocated by production control and not used after the chassis left the factory.|$|E
50|$|Originally lined black, until around 1918 {{when the}} Great Southern and Western Railway {{introduced}} its long-lived standard all-over unlined battleship-grey livery. This lasted past the Great Southern Railways amalgamation, {{and into the}} CIÉ era. In latter CIÉ days, the only change was that pale yellow painted numerals on cabsides replaced earlier GSWR style <b>cast</b> <b>number</b> plates. A few older CIÉ 4-4-0s were treated to the 1950s lined green livery — but no locomotives of this class were among them.|$|E

After a brief spell in the CIÉ workshops at Inchicore No. 90 was removed to the workshops of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland at Whitehead in 2005, to undergo restoration. The locomotive was back in steam by November 2006 and can now be seen on static display in the Carriage Gallery at the Downpatrick Railway Museum.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{designated}} Class 52 {{under the}} TOPS scheme, no Western ever carried its [...] "52 0xx" [...] TOPS number. As withdrawal was already planned when the TOPS numbering scheme was introduced {{and because of}} the <b>cast</b> <b>number</b> plates, it was not considered cost effective to renumber the locomotives. Some class members did run with the [...] "D" [...] of their number painted over - TOPS classification removed the need for locomotives to indicate their energy type in the running number (D = Diesel, E = Electric), rather grouping locomotives into relevant class number ranges based on power output and energy type combined (this convention has become somewhat blurred in recent years), 01 to 69 being diesel, 70 to 97 electric, and 98 all steam types.|$|E
5000|$|The Class 52s {{were never}} renumbered into their TOPS number series (52 xxx) {{and they became}} the last class of {{locomotives}} on BR not to carry a TOPS number.

The D1000 series locomotives were to be named after famous West of England place names; the illustration from the portfolio shows D1000 bearing the name Cheddar Gorge.
