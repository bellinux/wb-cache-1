40|$|Abstract — It {{has been}} shown that the global cost of the task {{allocations}} obtained with fast greedy algorithms can be improved upon by using a class of auction methods called Stochastic Clustering Auctions (SCAs). SCAs use stochastic transfers or swaps between the task clusters assigned to each team member, allow both uphill and downhill cost movements, and rely on simulated annealing. The choice of a key annealing parameter and turning the uphill movements on and off enables the converged solution of a SCA to slide in the region between the global optimal performance and the performance associated with a random allocation. The first SCA, called here GSSCA, was based on a Gibbs sampler, which constrained the stochastic cluster reallocations to simple single transfers or swaps. This paper presents a new and more efficient SCA, called SWSCA, based on the generalized Swendsen-Wang method that enables more complex and efficient movements between clusters by <b>connecting</b> <b>tasks</b> that appear to be synergistic and then stochastically reassigning these <b>connected</b> <b>tasks.</b> For centralized auctioning, extensive numerical experiments are used to compare the performance of SWSCA with GSSCA in terms of costs and computational and communication requirements.

40|$|Many {{applications}} for robots {{require them to}} work alongside people as capable members of human-robot teams and to collaborate in order to perform tasks and achieve common goals. These tasks can induce strain on the human due to time constraints. Additionally, humans can become highly stressed due to fatigue, resulting in decreased efficiency. The contribution {{of this paper is}} in the introduction of a human fatigue model and the application of this model to a mixed team coordination framework in order to predict team performance given the constraints of human fatigue. The human fatigue model - namely a FAtigue Prediction (FAP) model - is used to conduct numerical simulations that predict mixed team performances. Specifically, extensive simulations are performed to determine how human fatigue influences the choice of the number of agents for a given number of tasks. The novel mixed team coordination framework is a Stochastic Clustering Auction (SCA), which is based on a modification of the Swendsen-Wang method, called SW 2 SCA. It enables complex and efficient movement between clusters by <b>connecting</b> <b>tasks</b> that appear to be synergistic and then stochastically reassigning these <b>connected</b> <b>tasks.</b> In SW 2 SCA, the auctioneer makes stochastic movements with homogeneous or heterogeneous agents.

40|$|Stochastic Clustering Auctions (SCAs) {{constitute}} {{a class of}} cooperative auction methods that enable improvement of the global cost of the task allocations obtained with fast greedy algorithms. Prior research had developed Contracts Sequencing Algorithms (CSAs) that are deterministic and enable transfers, swaps, {{and other types of}} contracts between team members. In contrast to CSAs, SCAs use stochastic transfers or swaps between the task clusters assigned to each team member and have algorithm parameters that can enable tradeoffs between optimality and computational and communication requirements. The first SCA was based on a “Gibbs Sampler ” and constrained the stochastic cluster reallocations to simple single transfers or swaps; it is applicable to heterogeneous teams. Subsequently, a more efficient SCA was developed, based on the generalized Swendsen-Wang method; it achieves the increased efficiency by <b>connecting</b> <b>tasks</b> that appear to be synergistic and then stochastically reassigning these <b>connected</b> <b>tasks,</b> hence enabling more complex and efficient movements between clusters than the first SCA. However, its application was limited to homogeneous teams. The contribution of this work is to present an efficient SCA for heterogeneous teams; it is based on a modified Swendsen-Wang method. For centralized auctioning and homogeneous teams, extensive numerical experiments were used to provide a comparison in terms of costs and computational and communication requirements of the three SCAs and a baseline CSA. It was seen that the new SCA maintains the efficiency of the second SCA and can yield similar performance to the baseline CSA in far fewer iterations. Th...|$|R

40|$|Integration {{of process}} design and control (IPDC) {{has been the}} holy grail of process systems {{engineering}} since the introduction of heat and mass integration. A proper combination of these separate yet <b>connected</b> <b>tasks</b> carries the promise of achieving superior designs that cannot be realized with conventional procedures. In this work, a bi-level dynamic optimization approach is introduced for achieving IPDC in its true sense. The principal idea proposed here is to utilize an optimal controller (a modified linear quadratic regulator) to practically evaluate the best achievable control performance for each candidate design during process design. The evaluation of complete, closed-loop system dynamics can then be meshed with a superstructure-based process design algorithm, thus enabling considering both cost and controllability in design of a process. The practicality of the introduced approach enables a solution of this complex dynamic optimization problem within reasonable computational requirements, as demonstrated in an evaporator case study. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: Naming {{accuracy}} for nouns and verbs in aphasia {{can vary}} across different elicitation contexts, for example, simple picture naming, composite picture description, narratives, and conversation. For {{some people with}} aphasia, naming may be more accurate to simple pictures as opposed to naming in spontaneous, connected speech; for others, the opposite pattern may be evident. These differences have, in some instances, been related to word class (for example, noun or verb) as well as aphasia subtype. Given that the aim of picture-naming therapies is to improve word-finding in general, these differences in naming accuracy across contexts may {{have important implications for}} the potential functional benefits of picture-naming therapies. Aims: This study aimed to explore single-word therapy for both nouns and verbs, and to answer the following questions. (1) To what extent does an increase in naming accuracy after picture-naming therapy (for both nouns and verbs) predict accurate naming of the same items in less constrained spontaneous <b>connected</b> speech <b>tasks</b> such as composite picture description and retelling of a narrative? (2) Does the word class targeted in therapy (verb or noun) dictate whether there is ‘carry-over’ of the therapy item to <b>connected</b> speech <b>tasks?</b> (3) Does the speed at which the picture is named after therapy predict whether it will also be used appropriately in <b>connected</b> speech <b>tasks?</b> Methods & Procedures: Seven participants with aphasia of varying degrees of severity and subtype took part in ten therapy sessions over five weeks. A set of potentially useful items was collected from control participant accounts of the Cookie Theft Picture Description and the Cinderella Story from the Quantitative Production Analysis. Twenty-four of these words (twelve verbs and twelve nouns) were collated for each participant, on the basis that they had failed to name them in either simple picture naming or <b>connected</b> speech <b>tasks</b> (picture-supported narrative and unsupported retelling of a narrative). These were placed in a larger cohort of verb and noun sets for therapy. Post-therapy assessments examined naming accuracy and speed of target items in single-word picture-naming and naming accuracy in connected speech contexts. Outcomes & Results: There was a step-wise decrement in naming accuracy over the three naming contexts following targeted therapy. Simple pictures elicited the most correct names, followed by picture-supported narratives and lastly unsupported narratives. Picture-naming accuracy significantly predicted naming in the connected speech contexts for the group as a whole. The speed of picture naming after therapy did not predict the extent to which items were named in composite picture description and narrative tasks. Conclusions & Implications: The findings suggest that gains in naming accuracy obtained through picture-naming therapy may generalize to naming of the same items in more linguistically and cognitively demanding <b>connected</b> speech <b>tasks.</b> Demonstrating this generalization is methodologically challenging and the method utilized in this study may serve as one starting point for gathering a larger database in order to answer the question posed by this paper more robust...|$|R
