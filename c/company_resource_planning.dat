The implications to operational work and operations management are also discussed. The theoretical part of the thesis discusses the theory behind Activity-Based Costing, Cost Management, and the technologies used in the empirical part. A WWW-based ABC system was planned and implemented in the implementation part to help the case company in cost management and finance issues. The tool was integrated {{as a part of}} <b>company’s</b> Enterprise <b>Resource</b> <b>Planning</b> and Manufacturing Execution systems. Compared to traditional data collection models, the input to the application comes in real-time as a part of larger system integration. The thesis attempts to establish a relationship between Activity-Based Costing requirements and database systems. The company can benefit from Activity-Based Costing for example in product pricing by seeing the product costs from different perspectives. Decisions can be made based on actual cost information rather than managerial instinct. Based on the output data, it is also possible to examine whether it is profitable or not to start a project, a customer relationship or a product development process. ii TIIVISTELMÄ Lappeenrannan teknillinen yliopist...|$|R

40|$|Production {{management}} and control of job shops is an important and complex problem. This dissertation proposes a two-level hierarchical method for tactical production planning in such environments. We first develop a scheme to design the planning hierarchy by aggregating parts into families and resources into manufacturing cells; a priori aggregation of elementary time periods into aggregate time periods is assumed. Based {{on the results of}} the design stage, the medium- and short- term production planning problems are formulated. The objective of the production planning problems consists of minimizing the holding costs for the work-in-process and finished goods inventory and the backlogging costs for unfulfilled demand. The formulations are complemented by capacity constraints, inventory state equations, and constraints that ensure feasibility of the aggregate production plan. We decompose the global production planning problem such that the short-term planning sub-problems can be computed in parallel. An efficient solution algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problems of the hierarchy. The algorithm has been shown to converge to near-optimal solutions in a finite number of iterations. Furthermore, the algorithm provides optimal solutions for a special case of the planning problem. The hierarchical approach is evaluated with respect to computational complexity, memory requirements, {{and the quality of the}} resulting production plans. The hierarchical approach is also tested on an industrial case and the resulting plan is compared with the one obtained from the <b>company's</b> Manufacturing <b>Resource</b> <b>Planning</b> system...|$|R

The literature review concentrated on the internal communication of companies, with weight on the strengths and weaknesses of different communication methods. A framework was build based on the literature review and it was used to review the selected warranty cases for the empirical research. Two methods were utilized in the data collection: a limited survey and an in-depth study into individual warranty cases. The material consisted of email correspondence acquired from the warranty handling customer service team.
