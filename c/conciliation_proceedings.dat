40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of wage theft, where employers fail to compensate their employees with the wages due them, is {{widespread in the}} United States. The National Employment Law Project (NELP) has estimated the amount of wages stolen in the United States to be {{tens of millions of}} dollars per year (Winning Wage Justice, 2011), and a 2008 survey of workers in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York found that 68 % of those surveyed had experienced at least one pay-related violation during the past week of work (RISEP, 2013). While it is technically illegal to deprive an employee of the wages due her, retrieving stolen wages can be a long and convoluted process in many jurisdictions. Traditional <b>conciliation</b> court <b>proceedings</b> sometimes do little to deter the perpetrating employer from offending again. This report provides an outline of how current wage theft policies operate, and in doing so explored the pros and cons of different local (municipal and county-level) approaches to the problem. In recent years, state and municipal governments have passed legislation to strengthen wage theft laws. These laws operate in different ways. Some place heavy fines or permit sanctions on businesses found in violation, and some create a simpler process for victims to recoup stolen wages. Others institute new requirements during the hiring process, and still others legislate new reporting requirements for businesses. In some municipalities more than one of these approaches is used at once. The political viability of each of these approaches varies from state to state and city to city.

40|$|L'auteur commente la décision du Comite de la liberté syndicale touchant divers aspects du cadre {{juridique}} des relations du travail dans le secteur public au Québec: le niveau de la négociation collective, les restrictions apportées à l'exercice du droit de grève et la détermination des services essentiels. The Freedom of Association Committee of the International Labour Organization (ILO) rendered a decision, in February 1987, {{concerning the}} legal framework of collective bargaining in Quebec's public sector set forth by An Act Respect ing the Process of Negociation of the Collective Agreements in the Public and Parapublic Sectors, S. Q. 1985, c. 12 (referred to as the Act). This case will {{be known as the}} Case no. 1356. The ILO Constitution establishes freedom of association as one of the fundamental principles on which the Organisation is based. Consequently, membership in ILO entails that a State Member such as Canada has the obligation to implement that constitutional principle. In 1951, the Organisation set up a special machinery to insure the protection of this principle. The machinery involves the examination of complaints by the Committee of Freedom of Association. This Committee is a 9 -member Committee of ILO Governing Body and, like the Governing Body itself, its composition is tripartite: government, workers' and employers' appointees. Complaints are generally submetted by workers organisations of a national or an international level. These complaints may concern States which have not ratified ILO conventions on freedom of association. Since its establishment, the Committee has built up a corpus of decisions and principles covering most aspects of freedom of association and the protection of trade unions rights. The Committee has dealt with more than 1 400 cases. The decision of the Committee deals basically with three issues: level of collective bargaining, determination of salaries for the second and third years of a collective agreement and limitations of the right to strike in the social affairs sector. In the framework of the Act, the collective negociation must take place at the provincial level except those matters defined as being subject to a negociation at the local or regional level. Those matters are defined by the Act in respect to some classes of workers or by the parties in the course of negociation at the national level. Strikes are prohibited in respect to a matter defined as being subject to a negociation at the local or regional level. The Committee doesn't see any violation of the freedom of association when matters subject to negociation at the local or regional level are defined by parties {{in the course of the}} negociation at the national level. In this case, workers' organisations have therefore agreed not to strike on those matters. For the Committee, the situation is not the same when the Act lays down matters subject to negociation at local or regional level. The Committee recommends the modification of the Act to allow parties to decide by mutuel agreement the level at which bargaining should take place. The Act prohibits striking in the course of collective negociation related to the determination of the salaries for the second and third years of a collective agreement. In this respect, the Committee makes a distinction between the education sector and the other sector included in the scope of the Act. In the education sector, the Committee reaffirms that workers must enjoy the right to strike. It means that the Act is not in agreement with the well known principle in accordance to which the prohibition to strike should be limited to public servants and essential services in the strict sense of the term. The Committee considers that workers of the education sector does not fall within the definition of essential services. As regards to civil service and essential services sectors, the Committee acknowledged that the right to strike can be restricted or even prohibited if the said limitations are accompanied by adequate impartial and speedy <b>conciliation</b> and arbitration <b>proceedings</b> in which the parties concerned can take part at every stage and in which the awards, once made, are fully and promptly implemented. In the present case, in respect to public servants and social affairs sectors, the Committee recommends the establishment of such guarantees. This recommendation means that prohibition of strikes is possible. It also means that the procedure for determining salaries set forth by the Act (that is the regulation adopted by Government) didn't offer any «appropriate guarantees» to workers deprived of a legitimate means of defending their economic and social interest. In the social affairs sector, the Act lays down percentages of workers to be maintained at work in the event of a strike. These percentages vary between 55 % to 90 % depending on the nature of the establishment. According to the complaining organisation, these percentages nullify the exercise of the right to strike. The Committee does not express a specific opinion on that point but it handles the case exactly as if the act prohibited any strike in the social affairs sector therefore endorsing the point of view of the complaining organisation. Consequently, the Committee recommends the establishment of arbitration proceedings with awards binding on both parties. From this recommandation, it should be understood that ail the social affairs sector as defined by the Act is an essential service in the strict sense of the term. It has therefore always been possible for government to restrict or prohibit striking in so far as «appropriate garanties» compensate workers for the limitation thereby placed on their freedom of action...|$|R

40|$|Résumé The {{presented}} thesis {{deals with}} the new legal institute of criminal procedural law, the "agreement on guilt and punishment". The aim of the Czech legislator, when constructing the Czech version of the otherwise traditionally Anglo-Saxon concept of <b>conciliation</b> <b>proceedings,</b> was mainly to simplify and speed up the criminal trial, because according to his/her conclusion the present legislation does not use every opportunity to ensure the accused the full right to a speedy and fair trial. Despite the certainly legitimate need to ensure criminal proceedings in a way so as to ensure "quick" justice, the question is, considering the still ongoing debate of not only professionals, whether an agreement on guilt and punishment is the right tool to deliver this. The agreement on guilt and punishment is generally an Anglo- Saxon concept, it is thus a product of legal culture different in principle from the domestic one, and {{for it to be}} able to work effectively in such different conditions, it was necessary to somewhat overlook the traditional idea of a criminal trial as we know it in the standard form. Before its codification the proponents of this legal institute argued that the <b>conciliation</b> <b>proceedings</b> will support the activity of procedural parties, simplify the proceedings, in particular regarding the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Settlement of International Investment Disputes The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to {{introduce}} the basic types of settlement of international investment disputes while focusing especially on arbitration proceedings conducted by tribunals of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, {{hereinafter referred to as}} ICSID. The main purpose of the thesis in this respect is to critically evaluate the situation that currently exists in international investment arbitration due to the absence of an appellate review mechanism in ICSID system and to suggest solutions to this problem. The evaluation includes both a description of current possibilities of review and a proposal of an appellate body along with alternatives thereto. The thesis is composed of three chapters. The first chapter is introductory and concerns the basic terminology of international investment law. It focuses on defining the terms investment and investor, i. e. terms that are essential for comprehension of the nature of international investment disputes. It defines the terms using mainly the ICSID case law. The second chapter deals with the individual methods of settlement of investment disputes. First it mentions diplomatic protection as a method used especially in past. It also mentions <b>conciliation</b> <b>proceedings</b> and describes the role [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A bone of {{contention}} always arises in labour relations and ADR {{systems have been}} established so as to rectify labour disputes. Zimbabwe has a dual juncture labour system whereby the labour laws are not harmonized as {{both private and public}} sector are governed by different labour statutes. The Public Service Regulations Act governs the Public service employees excluding the security forces whereas the Labour Act governs private sector employees, metropolitan councils and parastatals. The study addressed how labour disputes are resolved through conciliation and arbitration procedures in Zimbabwe. The underlying principles of conciliation and arbitration practice in the country which involves a number of factors namely accessibility, speed, privacy and costs which provides for parties concerned to seek justice. It can be noted that there are major drawbacks to conciliation and arbitration practice in Zimbabwe due to a number of challenges that are encountered which include the lack of competence amongst conciliators and arbitrators as there are no clear specific guidelines on how <b>conciliation</b> <b>proceedings</b> are conducted with each conciliator conducts proceedings {{in his or her own}} way deemed necessary as there are no training services offered by the Ministry of Labour on how disputes should be rectified. The study found out that the ADR conciliation and arbitration practice in Zimbabwe is ineffective as it lacks enforceable mechanisms for its determinations and awards and as a result disputes take a longer period to be finalized as they spill into local courts for registration and enforcement. The regulatory environment on labour relations is shallow in the sense that it lacks clear indications on the resolution of industrial conflicts in the provision of the time frame labour disputes are to be administered and finalized. The conflicting legislation which is often confusing thereby limiting effective operations in the resolution of disputes. The Labour Amendment Act distinguished disputes of rights and of interests whereby disputes of right upon failure of conciliation, the labour officer may issue a ruling or refer the dispute to compulsory arbitration. The legislation has no proper indications on the classifications of the distinguished disputes affecting the resolution of disputes in ADR. Various reforms of the labour legislation needs to be put forward so that ADR can be effective...|$|E
40|$|The {{right to}} legal {{representation}} at labour proceedings of an administrative or quasi-judicial nature {{is not clear}} in our law, and {{has been the subject}} of contradictory debate in the South African courts since the 1920 ’s. Despite the ambiguities and uncertainty in the South African common law, the statutory regulation of legal representation was not comprehensively captured in labour legislation resulting in even more debate, especially as to the right to be represented by a person of choice at these proceedings in terms of the relevant entrenched protections contained in the Bill of Rights. The Labour Relations Act 12 of 2002 (prior to amendment) is silent on the right to representation at in-house disciplinary proceedings. Section 135 (4) of Act 12 of 2002 allows for a party at <b>conciliation</b> <b>proceedings</b> to appear in person or to be represented by a director or co employee or a member or office bearer or official of that party’s registered trade union. Section 138 (4) of the same Act allows for legal representation at arbitration proceedings, but subject to section 140 (1) which excludes legal representation involving dismissals for reasons related to conduct or capacity, unless all parties and the commissioner consent, or if the commissioner allows it per guided discretion to achieve or promote reasonableness and fairness. The abovementioned three sections were however repealed by the amendments of the Labour Relations Act 12 of 2002. Despite the repealing provision, Item 27 of Schedule 7 of the Amendment reads that the repealed provisions should remain in force pending promulgation of specific rules in terms of section 115 (2 A) (m) by the CCMA. These rules have not been promulgated to date. The common law’s view on legal representation as a compulsory consideration in terms of section 39 of the Constitution 108 of 1996 and further a guidance to the entitlement to legal representation where legislation is silent. The common law seems to be clear that there is no general right to legal representation at administrative and quasi judicial proceedings. If the contractual relationship is silent on representation it may be permitted if exceptional circumstances exist, vouching such inclusion. Such circumstances may include the complex nature of the issues in dispute and the seriousness of the imposable penalty (for example dismissal or criminal sanction). Some authority ruled that the principles of natural justice supercede a contractual condition to the contrary which may exist between employer and employee. The courts did however emphasize the importance and weight of the contractual relationship between the parties in governing the extent of representation at these proceedings. Since 1994 the entrenched Bill of Rights added another dimension to the interpretation of rights as the supreme law of the country. On the topic of legal representation and within the ambit of the limitation clause, three constitutionally entrenched rights had to be considered. The first is the right to a fair trial, including the right to be represented by a practitioner of your choice. Authority reached consensus that this right, contained in section 35 of the Constitution Act 108 of 1996 is restricted to accused persons charged in a criminal trial. The second protection is the entitlement to administrative procedure which is justifiable and fair (This extent of this right is governed y the provisions of the Promotion of Access to Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000) and thirdly the right to equality before the law and equal protection by the law. In conclusion, the Constitution Act 108 of 1996 upholds the law of general application, if free and justifiable. Within this context, the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 allows for specific representation at selected fora, and the common law governs legal representation post 1994 within the framework of the Constitution. The ultimate test in considering the entitlement to legal representation at administrative and quasi judicial proceedings will be in balancing the protection of the principle that these tribunals are masters of their own procedure, and that they may unilaterally dictate the inclusion or exclusion of representation at these proceedings and the extent of same, as well as the view of over judicialation of process by the technical and delaying tactics of legal practitioners, against the wide protections of natural justice and entrenched constitutional protections...|$|E
