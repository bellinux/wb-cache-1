We carried out the study to assess the effects of chicken manure on soil chemical properties and the response of application rate on the yield of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) {{as well as the}} uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. To quantify these effects, we added chicken manure to samples of Calcisols, Arenosols and Luvisols at application rates: 5, 10, 20 and 40 % chicken manure. The addition of chicken manure irrespective of application rate did not change the acidity or pH of <b>Calcisol,</b> suggesting its hypo-buffering capacity. While the results reveal increases of EC with increasing rate, at rate above 40 %, the ECs were above the critical salinity level of 4 mS/cm indicating potential threat to soil productivity. The exchangeable bases increased with application rate, suggesting the positive effects of chicken manure in enhancing soil fertility. Similarly significant increase of nitrogen and phosphorus were observed following the addition of chicken manure. Initially the spinach yield increases up to optimum rate of 0. 06, 0. 07 and 0. 16 g/plant for Luvisol, Arenosol and <b>Calcisol,</b> respectively and subsequently drops after critical threshold values; 15, 5 and 1 % for <b>Calcisol,</b> Arenosol and Luvisol, respectively.

Four treatments, defined by soil type (lixisol and <b>calcisol)</b> and distance from villages (near 4 km), were tested. The growth rings, assumed to be annual, of the shrub trunk with the largest diameter, presumed to be the oldest specimen on each 4 x 4 m(2) plot, were counted to estimate the duration of biomass production on the plot. Above ground biomass productivity was estimated by the ratio between above ground biomass and growth rings number. The mean above ground biomass productivity varied between 038 and 0. 99 t ha(- 1) year(- 1) of dry mass according to the four treatments. It did not vary significantly with soil type and increased with distance from villages on lixisol where woody charcoal is produced.

In the present study, we assessed the influence of strategic tillage on the microbial properties of a seven years’ NT <b>Calcisol</b> in Moonie, Queensland, Australia. We tested the hypothesis that the application of one-time strategic tillage with chisel or offset disc does not cause major impacts on soil biological health in a NT system. Strategic tillage was applied once and soil samples were collected 13 months after tillage from the depths 0 – 10 and 10 – 20 cm. The measured biological indicators included soil microbial biomass carbon, catabolic activity (MicroResp™ assay) and total microbial activity (fluorescein diacetate method). The structure of bacterial communities was profiled by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and terminal reaction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Principal components analyses based on qPCR and T-RFLP data did not show tillage effects on soil bacterial communities. However, relative to the NT, chisel tillage led to significant increases in microbial biomass carbon (+ 34. 4 %), abundances of Alphaproteobacteria (+ 74. 6 %), Bacteroidetes (+ 113. 7 %) and Firmicutes (+ 36. 5 %), and the utilisation of D+ cellubiose (+ 178. 4 %) as well as mannitol (+ 167. 2 %) at 0 – 10 cm depth. In contrast, the influence of offset disc tillage was restricted to an increased abundance of Alphaproteobacteria (+ 64. 6 %) at 0 – 10 cm depth.

The objective of this work is to widen the knowledge about the main characteristics and formation processes of some benchmark soils developed on fluvio-glacial, alluvial-fan and terrace materials of Pleistocene and Holocene age related to the Segre river, either siliceous or carbonatic. This knowledge will allow us to identify soil forming processes, commonly found in Mediterranean environments such as carbonate redistribution, clay formation and mobilization and rubefaction, all as functions of parent material and age. Five profiles, ranging from the Lower Pleistocene to the Holocene were classified according to Soil Taxonomy /WRB. The Montferrer profile (Calcic Palexeralf /Calcic Cutanic Luvisol (Chromic) is a deep, partly decarbonated soil, with calcium carbonate accumulation in depth covering glacial features. The Torre del Remei profile (Typic Paleustalf /Cutanic Luvisol) developed on silicic moraines and shows an extreme clay formation and illuviation. The Alp (Typic Haplustalf /Cutanic Luvisol) and Tartera (Petric Calciustept /Petric <b>Calcisol)</b> soils are developed on alluvial fans with calcium carbonate sources. The former is partly decarbonated, whilst the latter is rubefacted on top and shows speleothem-like carbonate pendants with superposition of clay illuviation.

Special morphologies of carbonate pendants are indicators of environmental conditions. The coexistence of clay coatings and secondary calcite can be explained by recarbonatation or by spatial differentiation of soil environments in the profile.

Very little amounts of Fe and Mn were retrieved from the exchangeable phase, the ready available for biogeochemistry cycles in the ecosystems. Therefore, low quantities of Fe and Mn can be taken up by plants in these alkaline soils.

40|$|The lower Permian (Wolfcampian) Sangre de Cristo Formation of {{northern}} New Mexico consists of silty mudstones and laterally discontinuous sandstones deposited on an aggrading alluvial plain. Locally, mudstones display {{a variety of}} pedogenic features. Common mudstone fabrics vary from platy to prismatic; some beds display prominent pedogenic slickensides. Drab-colored root traces are common throughout the section, as are calcareous nodules, which vary from small bodies with diffuse boundaries to vertically stacked, discrete, cm-scale nodules (rhizocretions), and less commonly form coalescing horizons. Vertisols occur only in the lower portion of the ca. 90 -m measured section. Most of the mudstone beds contain calcretes that are immature (calcic Protosols to calcic Argillisols), but the lower to middle portion of the section also contains mature calcrete horizons (argillic <b>Calcisols</b> and <b>Calcisols).</b> Intercalated micritic limestone beds with sharp contacts containing root traces, are of laterally variable thickness and grade to nodular calcretes. These are interpreted as floodplain pond carbonates that have undergone pedogenic alteration (palustrine limestones), indicating long periods of exposure under strongly seasonal climatic conditions.

Therefore, after previously identifying the most tillage-sensitive SQ indicators under long-term rainfed conditions, conversion of a research site on a Haplic <b>Calcisol</b> in Navarre, in northeast Spain provided an ideal location to reevaluate those SQ indicators after three years of irrigated management. The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) was used to test our hypothesis that adopting irrigation could change the sensitivity and importance of non-irrigated SQ indicators.

The selected study area (13. 4 km 2), located {{in the region of}} Oltrepò Pavese in Northern Italy, is characterized by a high shallow landslides density and is constituted by vineyards in steep slopes. The tested soils are Haplic <b>Calcisols,</b> Petric <b>Calcisols</b> and Calcic Gleysols, with silt loamy or silty clay loamy textures, from high to very high carbonate content and low organic carbon and nitrogen contents. The rootstock of the grapevine is a combination of Vitis berlandieri and Vitis riparia with root systems, which reach average depths of up to 1. 5 m. The grapevine root density (number of roots and Root Area Ratio) is rather variable and is strongly correlated to soil permeability. In fact, the results show that low permeable soils have small number of roots and occur near recent shallow slides. Despite the differences of soil features, type of bedrock, grapevine plants age, vineyards row orientation and season collection, a unique relationship between root diameter and root tensile strength has been identified. Root reinforcement, related to the grapevine root system and evaluated using Fiber Bundle Model, shows the lowest values in correspondence of sites characterized by the lowest soil permeability, as in the study case Calcic Gleysols. The sites with these soil features, actually, are also those most affected by shallow instability in the past, indicating that their great susceptibility to shallow landslides.

The number of ammonifying bacteria, oligonitrophilic bacteria, oligotrophic bacteria and nitrogenase activity in <b>Calcisol</b> soil under different agricultural crops in Surhandarya region Uzbekistan were compared. Soil samples were collected from the soil under cotton, melon, tomato, wheat in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. We measured the microbial population after tillage at depth intervals of 0 - 10 cm, 10 - 20 cm, and 20 - 30 cm. The results revealed that the number and enzymatic activity of microorganisms depended upon plant type, depth and date of sampling. The total number of ammonifying bacteria, and oligotrophic bacteria tended to be highest under tomato and wheat. The number of ammonifying and oligotrophic bacteria were higher at the 20 - 30 cm soil depth of soil than at the 0 - 10 cm depth regardless of plant type. Seasonal changes in the numbers of soil microorganisms were marked in all agricultural crops, with the lower numbers in winter and higher numbers in spring and summer. This experiment indicated that different agricultural crops ad tillage practice affected the microbial characteristics of soil...|$|E
40|$|In Niger Republic, the {{regional}} development of irrigation {{along the river}} Niger is confronted with a large extent of alkali soils. For a sound management of the irrigated area, it appears necessary to understand the present evolution of these alkali soils. The study {{of one of these}} areas, located on the Liptako bedrock, reveals a concentric soil distribution : within a zone of brown soil with abrupt textural change and alkaline in depth (stagnic Solonetz), appears a ring of brown steppe soils (cambic <b>Calcisol),</b> around zones of alkali soils (Solonetz). These alkali soils are not saline but their soil solution is more concentrated than in brown steppe soils. The abrupt boundary between the brown steppe soils and the alkali soils is related with morphological and geochemical changes, resulting from calcite and fluorite precipitation in the soil solution. The detailed study of this contact demonstrates the current transformation of alkali soils into brown steppe soils. Therefore, it appears that soil alkalization is no longer in process on the terraces of the river Niger. The formation of brown steppe soils and alkali soils may be explained by the juxtaposition of two contrasted hydrological regimes in a former pond. This hypothesis is supported by aerial pictures and microscopic observations. It is also consistent with a recent study of the hydrology of Sahelian ponds and with considerations on the chemical quality of the runoff. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{numerous}} studies reporting a decrease in soil nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions after biochar amendment, {{there is still a}} lack of understanding of the processes involved. Hence the subject remains controversial, with a number of studies showing no changes or even an increase in N 2 O emissions after biochar soil application. Unraveling the exact causes of these changes, and in which circumstances biochar decreases or increases emissions, is vital to developing and applying successful mitigation strategies. With this objective, we studied two soils (Haplic Phaeozem (HP) and Haplic <b>Calcisol</b> (HC)), which showed opposed responses to biochar amendment. Under the same experimental conditions, the addition of biochar to soil HP decreased N 2 O emissions by 76 %; whereas it increased emissions by 54 % in soil HC. We combined microcosm experiments adding different nitrogen fertilizers, stable isotope techniques and the use of a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide) with the aim of improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation of N 2 O in these two soils. Evidence suggests that denitrification is the main pathway leading to N 2 O emissions in soil HP, and ammonia oxidation and nitrifier-denitrification being the major processes generating N 2 O in soil HC. Biochar systematically stimulated nitrification in soil HC, which was probably the cause of the increased N 2 O emissions. Here we demonstrate that the effectiveness of using biochar for reducing N 2 O emissions from a particular soil is linked to its dominant N 2 O formation pathway.

40|$|Soil {{phenolic}} matter (SPM) {{constitutes an}} important compartment {{of the soil}} organic matter (SOM). However, a very few studies on their different forms and on their distribution in soil is available. The present paper deals with an investigation of experimental pedology aimed at evaluating the distribution of phenolic matter as a possible indicator of soil use impact. The investigation was carried out on 7 soil profiles (Andosols, <b>Calcisols,</b> Cambisols, Fluvisols, Lixisols, Podzols) with different land use: mountain pasture, grass, cereal, oak, chestnut, pine and eucalyptus wood. Three main SPM fractions were categorized: 1) the “total” (SPMt, extracted by 0. 1 M NaOH), 2) the “soluble” (SPMs, extracted by deionized water) and 3) that with “high” (SPMh, as SPMt-SPMs) affinity with soil body. The content of all SPM fractions, {{as well as the}} phenolic parameters values, are usually larger in surface A horizons than in the deep B and C ones. Both SPM fractions and phenolic parameters appear to vary along soil profiles according to the different pedoclimatic environments and soil use. Our data suggest that the amount and the distribution of soil phenolic matter could be regarded as indicators of anthropic impact as well as of peculiar pedogenetic processes...|$|R

40|$|Micro-basins are slope {{management}} structures {{built out}} of earth and stones on hillslopes around cultivated trees (e. g., olive trees) for the harvesting of rainfall and runoff water, and for the rehabilitation of land degraded by water erosion. In this study, {{the results of an}} experimental survey for the comparison of soil water content for {{both inside and outside the}} micro-basins are analyzed. Measurements are taken after some rainfall events from January to December 2003 in a hilly region of Central Tunisia. The time domain reflectometry technique is used to measure soil moisture in 15 sets of soil profiles (inside and outside) at three different depths. Four different soils are evaluated, i. e., Cambisols, Kastanozems, Arenosols, and <b>Calcisols.</b> The data analysis shows a significant improvement on the water stock obtained by this type of management. The differences in water storage with respect to soil type, depths, and tillage are evident, but strongly connected to farm management. For optimal management conditions an important increase of average water stock is observed; however, for bad or no farm management the amelioration is zero or is even deteriorating the state of vegetation.
