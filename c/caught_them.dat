5|$|At this {{juncture}} Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had <b>caught</b> <b>them</b> off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that <b>caught</b> <b>them.</b> He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E

5|$|The Great Raid of 1840 was {{the largest}} Indian raid on white cities {{in the history of}} what is now the United States—though {{technically}} when it occurred it was in the Republic of Texas and not in the United States. The war party literally burned one city to the ground. They took over 3,000 horses and mules, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} dollars of other plunder, ranging from silver to cloth and mirrors. Unfortunately for the war party, the sheer volume of loot slowed them down, and made them vulnerable to attack from a militia that otherwise would never have <b>caught</b> <b>them.</b> Equally, the militia missed an opportunity to destroy the bulk of the raiding party when they concentrated on recovering and dividing the recovered bullion and other plunder.|$|E
5|$|Late on Monday 4November, Catesby, John Wright and Bates {{left for}} the Midlands, ready for the planned uprising. That night Fawkes was {{discovered}} guarding the gunpowder in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords. As news of his arrest spread, the next day most of the conspirators still in London fled. Catesby's party, ignorant {{of what was happening}} in London, paused at Dunstable when his horse lost a shoe. When Rookwood <b>caught</b> <b>them</b> up and broke to them the news of Fawkes's arrest, the group, which now included Rookwood, Catesby, Bates, the Wright brothers and Percy, rode toward Dunchurch. At about 6:00pm that evening they reached Catesby's family home at Ashby St Ledgers, where his mother and Robert Wintour were staying. To keep his mother ignorant of their situation, Catesby sent a message asking Wintour to meet him {{at the edge of the}} town. The group continued to Dunchurch, where they met Digby and his hunting party and informed them that the king and Salisbury were dead, thus persuading them to continue with the plan.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the great white shark's mating habits. It is {{possible}} that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating. Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer. The Northern Pacific population of great whites is suspected to breed off of the Sea of Cortez, as evidenced by local fisherman who have said to have <b>caught</b> <b>them</b> and evidenced by teeth found at dump sites for discarded parts from their catches.|$|E

5|$|Voting {{was carried}} out between 23 and 28 May 1993 and FUNCINPEC secured 45.47% of all valid votes cast, which {{entitled}} them to take up 58 out of 120 seats in the constituent assembly FUNCINPEC obtained the most seats in Kampong Cham, Kandal and Phnom Penh. The CPP came in second place and secured 38.23% of valid votes, and were unhappy with {{the outcome of the}} elections. On 3 June 1993, CPP leaders Chea Sim and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk to propose that he should lead a new interim government, and also demanding power-sharing for the CPP with FUNCINPEC on a fifty-fifty basis. Sihanouk agreed to the CPP's proposal and announced the formation of an interim government that evening. Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC leaders were not consulted over Sihanouk's proposal, and the announcement <b>caught</b> <b>them</b> by surprise. Ranariddh sent a fax to his father to disapprove of the CPP's proposal, and the United States expressed a similar stance. Sihanouk publicly rescinded his earlier announcement of the interim government's formation the following day.|$|E
5|$|Zur's {{maneuver}} sent Israel's {{forces into}} unknown territory, and they encountered an Egyptian entrenchment that <b>caught</b> <b>them</b> unawares. His original {{plan was to}} send Yosef Harpaz and the 3rd Company and then Dromi's company, but when fire was opened on Harpaz's men (at approximately 04:00), Zur ordered him to execute a frontal assault. Harpaz decided {{to do this in}} three single-platoon waves: the first two would attack the Egyptians, while the third would provide cover for the forces. The first platoon was inexperienced and had never fought against Egypt's army. After advancing, they encountered what were probably Bren carriers, which their commander reported were tanks. Harpaz then sent the second, more experienced, platoon of 15 men, who were also able to better utilize the cover fire. Eventually, the first platoon fled from the battlefield without being ordered to do so and the attack was only two platoons strong. However, this still assisted Aryeh Kotzer {{on the other side of}} the Egyptian positions to evacuate his injured troops.|$|E
5|$|Frank {{tires of}} Roo being mean to Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn) and they split up. Alf sends Roo to {{boarding}} school in the city. Frank decides that he misses her and tracks her down. He gets into a fight with Roo's new boyfriend, Brett. Roo returns to Summer Bay, hiding {{the fact that she}} is pregnant. Roo schemes to get Frank to sleep with her and Alf to catch them in bed together. Alf sacks Frank, but Ailsa employs him instead. Roo later announces that she is pregnant by Frank, and Alf believes her as he <b>caught</b> <b>them</b> having sex. Frank then agrees to marry Roo. Floss McPhee (Sheila Kennelly) has a vision that Bobby causes a car crash which kills Frank. When he buys a car with a similar registration number, Bobby vandalises it. Tom then buys him a new vehicle with another similar registration. Bobby warns Frank that Roo is using him but he refuses to listen. On his wedding day, Pippa convinces Frank not to drive his car because of Floss' vision. When he turns up to the ceremony, Roo changes her mind about marrying Frank and reveals that the baby is not his. Frank speeds off in his car and crashes off the road to avoid knocking Bobby down. He survives the accident and Bobby tells Frank that she loves him. He tells her that while he has no intention of reconciling with Roo, he still loves her.|$|E

5|$|In 1097, {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Nicaea to the Byzantines, Alexios named John as commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army in Anatolia, and tasked with recovering the Aegean littoral from the Turks. To avoid conflict and facilitate negotiations, he was given custody of {{the wife of the}} sultan of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum Kilij Arslan I (r. 1092–1107) and the daughter of Tzachas, who had been captured at Nicaea. John gave command of the fleet to Kaspax, and marched against Smyrna. After a short siege, Tzachas agreed to surrender the city in exchange for his safe departure and guarantees of the inhabitants' safety. The megas doux readily accepted and took possession of the city, naming Kaspax as its governor. Even before Kaspax could assume his duties however, he was murdered by a Muslim, and the enraged sailors of the fleet massacred the people of the city. John Doukas was unable to restrain them, and restored order only after the massacre had run its course. He then left the experienced general Hyaleas behind as doux of the city along with the entire fleet to secure the city, and continued his campaign. From Smyrna, John marched south to Ephesus. There, he defeated the Turkish garrison after a long battle, and took 2,000 captives, who were resettled in the Aegean islands. Petzeas was installed as doux of Ephesus, and John with his army turned inland. He took the cities of Sardeis and Philadelphia, which he entrusted to Michael Kekaumenos, and reached Laodicea, which opened its gates to him. From there, he marched to the fortresses of Choma and Lampe, installing Eustathios Kamytzes as governor, and reached Polybotos, where most of the Turks who had survived at Ephesus had fled. Having <b>caught</b> <b>them</b> by surprise, Doukas's army defeated them and took much booty.|$|E

The Tornadoes batted first in this match and, despite an early hat-trick, by Corey Collymore, came up with only 157 runs. Texas dominated the match in batting, though. Marlon Samuels hit the Chicago bowlers in every direction and scored a century in only 40 balls. In spite of a strong bowling effort from Franklyn Rose, the Arrowheads reached the target in 15 only overs. On 7 August, the Tornadoes again played San Francisco, this time at Alexian.

25|$|Anticipating {{the need}} for cavalry, line {{producer}} Nikolai Ivanov and General Osilkovsky began seeking appropriate horses. While the cavalry formations of the Army were long abolished, several units in the Transcaucasian Military District and the Turkestan Military District retained horse drawn mountain artillery. In addition to those, the Ministry of Agriculture gave away nine hundred horses and the Moscow City Police organized a detachment from its mounted regiment. The producers also needed to arrange hounds for the wolf hunting at the Rostov estate. At first, it was planned to use Borzois, as depicted in the novel. Sixteen such were obtained from individual private owners, but the dogs had no experience in hunting and were hard to handle. Eventually, scent hounds supplied by the Ministry of Defense chased down the wolves – provided by the zoological department of the State Studio for Popular Science Films – while the Borzoi <b>caught</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
