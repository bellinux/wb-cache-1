50|$|When {{speaking}} about complementary currencies, {{a number of}} overlapping and often interchangeable terms are in use:local or community <b>currencies</b> <b>are</b> complementary <b>currencies</b> used within a locality or other form of community (such as business-based or online communities); regional <b>currencies</b> <b>are</b> similar to local currencies but used within a larger geographical region; and sectoral <b>currencies</b> <b>are</b> complementary <b>currencies</b> used within a single economic sector, such as education or health care. Many private <b>currencies</b> <b>are</b> complementary <b>currencies</b> issued by private businesses or organizations. Other terms include alternative currency, auxiliary currency, and microcurrency.|$|R

5|$|The {{most obvious}} benefit of {{adopting}} a single <b>currency</b> <b>is</b> {{to remove the}} cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).|$|E
5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European <b>currency</b> <b>is</b> that {{differences}} in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon has had {{a decade}} of strong {{economic}} performance, with GDP growing {{at an average of}} 4% per year. During the 2004–2008 period, public debt was reduced from over 60% of GDP to 10% and official reserves quadrupled to over USD 3billion. Cameroon is part of the Bank of Central African States (of which it is the dominant economy), the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC) and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). Its <b>currency</b> <b>is</b> the CFA franc.|$|E

25|$|The {{outcome of}} leaving the euro would vary {{depending}} on the situation. If the country's own replacement <b>currency</b> <b>was</b> expected to devalue against the euro, the state might experience a large-scale exodus of money, whereas if the <b>currency</b> <b>were</b> expected to appreciate then more money would flow into the economy. A rapidly appreciating <b>currency</b> would <b>be</b> detrimental to the country's exports.|$|R
50|$|The {{first issue}} in the new Colón <b>currency</b> <b>was</b> dated 1900 and put into {{circulation}} in 1901. It consists of ten stamps with values ranging from 1 Céntimo up to 10 Colones. The Colón <b>currency</b> had <b>been</b> introduced in 1896, but stamps with the old <b>currency</b> <b>were</b> still in use, and continued to be used after 1901 for several years.|$|R
5|$|Chad's <b>currency</b> <b>is</b> the CFA franc. In the 1960s, the Mining {{industry}} of Chad produced sodium carbonate, or natron. There {{have also been}} reports of gold-bearing quartz in the Biltine Prefecture. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.|$|E

Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items {{can be used for}} a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of {{intervention}} in the foreign exchange market by national government authorities, the exchange rate of a country's <b>currency</b> <b>is</b> determined, in general, by market forces {{of supply and demand}} at a point in time.

5|$|Tourist {{accommodation}} {{ranges from}} luxury lodges to apartments and villa units. The <b>currency</b> <b>is</b> the Australian dollar, {{and there are}} two banks. There are no camping facilities on the island and remote-area camping is not permitted.

No pets are allowed without permission from the Board. Islanders use tanked rainwater, supplemented by bore water for showers and washing clothes.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Macedonia (which had pegged their currencies against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo), all of these non-EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major <b>currency</b> <b>is</b> regarded as a safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro {{is seen as a}} stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.|$|E

5|$|Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players take {{the role of}} story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes {{the role of an}} unseen tactician directing the player army. The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use of scenes animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress. In-game <b>currency</b> <b>is</b> gained either through battles in the game's Link Arena or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to buy new items and weapons at merchants in between battles and at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.|$|E
5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have been recovered in the store rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as <b>currency</b> <b>is</b> supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have been recovered at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that a {{decline in the number of}} beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects a decline in their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E
