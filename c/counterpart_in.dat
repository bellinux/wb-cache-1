5|$|After the crown, {{the most}} {{important}} government institution in the late Middle Ages was the king's council, composed of the king's closest advisers. Unlike its <b>counterpart</b> <b>in</b> England, the king's council in Scotland retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, {{some of whom were}} nominated by parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a <b>counterpart</b> <b>in</b> a {{neighbouring}} ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a by-election. However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

Next came palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. There is little evidence about the pay differentials between grades.

5|$|In 2010, the Royal Opera House {{received}} a government subsidy {{of just over}} £27m, compared with a subsidy of £15m in 1998.

The superior colliculus, which {{plays a major role}} in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex.

5|$|An HDF <b>counterpart</b> <b>in</b> the {{southern}} celestial hemisphere {{was created in}} 1998: the HDF-South. Created using a similar observing strategy, the HDF-S was very similar in appearance to the original HDF. This supports the cosmological principle that at its largest scale the Universe is homogeneous. The HDF-S survey used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the Hubble Deep Field has since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, {{as well as by}} the NICMOS and STIS instruments. Several supernova events were detected by comparing the first and second epoch observations of the HDF-N.|$|E

Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so named because she {{excludes}} men from her life), to determine if Bond is telling the truth. Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.|$|E
5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external sheath on the plug makes contact with its <b>counterpart</b> <b>in</b> the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the trunk, limbs, head and face was made in 114 normal healthy adults (male), {{ranging in age from}} 25 to 55, indigenous to Anchu-mura, Inashiki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture. The results are summarized as follows : (1) The stature being 160. 14 ± 0. 45, the men under investigation ranked low among the lower medium height group. According to the standards of classification of stature, the largest number of them, or 40. 4 per cent of the total, were of short stature.

5|$|Nellie Forbush, in {{her journey}} from Little Rock, Arkansas, to {{serving as a}} Navy nurse {{and on to the}} domesticity of the final scene of South Pacific, {{parallels}} the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up their jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her <b>counterpart</b> <b>in</b> the Michener work– that character had a 4-F boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.|$|E
5|$|Several {{television}} translators transmit their {{signals from}} two small towers {{located in the}} center of Wilkins Peak. Additionally, the religious television network TBN has a translator known locally as K35CN, broadcasting from the mountain. Prior to 2009, K22BK, the local PBS television translator, carried its signal from Wilkins Peak. K22BK was moved across the interstate to White Mountain to the same tower as its digital <b>counterpart.</b> <b>In</b> late 2009, a new television station signed on the air from the peak. It is known as K33IX-D on channel 33 (UHF) and carries programming from EICB TV, a Christian religious broadcast and production company, based in Cedar Hill, Texas. K35CN and K22BK have been off the air since the digital television transition in the year 2009.|$|E
