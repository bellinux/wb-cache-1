5|$|Robert Patrick Modell (Robert Wisden) {{walks through}} a supermarket, buying a large {{supply of energy}} drinks. Before he <b>can</b> <b>leave,</b> Modell is {{surrounded}} and arrested by FBI agents led by Frank Burst (Vic Polizos). While being escorted away in a police car, he repeatedly talks about the color cerulean blue. Modell's talking seemingly causes the driver to not see an approaching big rig of that color, causing a collision. Modell escapes after the driver unlocks his handcuffs before dying.|$|E
5|$|She finally narrates {{the story}} of her {{abandonment}} to Jug, who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before they <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> her. He convinces her that she does not need to forgive her parents for abandoning her, but she can, as an adult, see them as two regular people who made a mistake. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.|$|E
5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E

5|$|Ben starts {{drinking}} {{and plans to}} commit suicide, but Vivien appears to stop him. He then reconciles with Vivien and Violet's ghosts, who encourage {{him to take the}} child and start a new life away from the house. Before he <b>can</b> <b>leave,</b> Hayden (Kate Mara), with the help of Dallas and Fiona, hangs him from a chandelier, killing him and making it appear like a suicide. Hayden takes the baby, but Constance reclaims the baby with Travis' (Michael Graziadei) assistance. Later, she tells the police that she found Ben after he hanged himself and that Violet must have run off with the baby.|$|E
5|$|Cain orders Nemesis {{to return}} to the {{helicopter}} so they <b>can</b> <b>leave,</b> but Nemesis turns on Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops. Nemesis is finally killed protecting Alice from an explosion, {{and the rest of the}} survivors seize the helicopter. They throw Cain from the helicopter to the ground to be eaten by zombies, including the now-turned Dr. Ashford. The survivors escape in the chopper as the nuclear bomb detonates over the City Hall, catching the chopper in the blast wave and forcing it to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela during the crash and is impaled on a metal pole, killing her.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E

5|$|Collisions of solitary stars {{within the}} Milky Way occur {{only once every}} -; far less {{frequently}} than the appearance of novae. Collisions occur with greater frequency in the dense core regions of globular clusters (cf. blue stragglers). A likely scenario is a collision with a binary star system, or between two binary systems containing white dwarfs. This collision <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> behind a close binary system of two white dwarfs. Their orbit decays and they merge through their shared envelope. However, a study based on SDSS spectra found 15 double systems of the 4,000 white dwarfs tested, implying a double white dwarf merger every 100 years in the Milky Way. Conveniently, this rate matches the number of Type Ia supernovae detected in our neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, {{especially}} when she finds a stuffed cat on the sofa. She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does not look disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she <b>can</b> <b>leave,</b> but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|E
5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E

50|$|This is an {{implementation}} of the composite pattern, which {{is a collection of}} nodes. The node is an abstract base class, and derivatives <b>can</b> either be <b>leaves</b> (singular), or collections of other nodes (which in turn <b>can</b> contain <b>leaves</b> or collection-nodes). When an operation is performed on the parent, that operation is recursively passed down the hierarchy.|$|R
5|$|Kitsune are {{associated}} with Inari, the Shinto deity of rice. This association has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. Originally, kitsune were Inari's messengers, but {{the line between the}} two is now blurred so that Inari Ōkami may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune, where devotees <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> offerings. Fox spirits are said to be particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called aburage, which is accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune udon and kitsune soba. Similarly, Inari-zushi is a type of sushi named for Inari Ōkami that consists of rice-filled pouches of fried tofu. There is speculation among folklorists as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long been worshipped as kami.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack's Valentine's dinner {{plans with}} his girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek) are {{postponed}} {{when they have to}} attend church. Jack calls his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy), telling him to hold his dinner reservations. Before they <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> church, Elisa tells Jack that they need to go to confession. After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, Elisa becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes it is a sign from God because both she and Jack love the McDonald's dessert. The two reconcile their relationship as a result, and spend Valentine's Day together at a McDonald's.|$|E
5|$|Michael kidnaps Laurie {{and takes}} {{her back to}} their old home. He tries to show Laurie that she is his sister, {{presenting}} a picture of them with their mother. Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael with his own knife before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a balcony and charges her head-on, knocking both of them over the railing. Laurie finds herself {{on top of an}} unconscious Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she fires just as Michael awakens.|$|E

50|$|On a Brooklyn sidewalk, a man {{walks over}} to a trash <b>can,</b> <b>leaves</b> a 1980s-era {{television}} by it, and walks away. After a few seconds, the TV suddenly powers on and an 8-bit picture of a bomb appears. When its fuse runs out, the TV screen shatters, releasing a cloud of pixels (illustrated as voxels because of the three-dimensionality of the scene). The pixels fly over to Manhattan, where it releases various characters from 1980s arcade video games.|$|R
5|$|The House of Foryx is {{a magical}} house {{situated}} somewhere deep in another forest, surrounded by perpetual winter. It is an octagonal building flanked by four octagonal pillars. Here all times meet, and characters {{can go from}} one time to another. Characters can come into the building from any time, but <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> it in their own time only if another from that time stands outside the main door; otherwise they are lost in time, and may even {{end up in a}} time when the House of Foryx did not exist, giving them no chance of ever returning. The house is named after Foryx, a huge elephantine creature in the Septimus Heap universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Mr. Gold asks Emma {{to track}} down Ashley. He claims that she has {{something}} that belongs to him and that Ashley is unstable and troubled. Emma reluctantly agrees, and learns from Ruby (Meghan Ory) that she should stop by the home of her ex-boyfriend Sean (Phillipps). Emma goes there and speaks to Sean and his father, finding {{out that it is}} the latter that has told him not to get involved with the pregnant teenager. Emma discovers that Ruby has given her car to Ashley so that she <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> Storybrooke and head to Boston. Emma and Henry (Jared S.
