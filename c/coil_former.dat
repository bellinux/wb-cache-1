50|$|Mean Length Turn, {{sometimes}} Mean Length per Turn is {{the mean}} length of winding {{turn in a}} coil. Usually an acronym MLT is used. The dimensions of a <b>coil</b> <b>former</b> or bobbin define the MLT of a full wound coil. In some cases the coil is not made of a single wire with multiple turns, and a <b>coil</b> <b>former</b> is not always necessary, but may be constructed in a stack of printed circuit layers. The MLT is an important measure {{in the design of}} inductors, transformers and other wound electromagnetic components.|$|E
5000|$|Units are {{not usually}} given for this parameter, {{but it is in}} {{mechanical}} 'ohms'. Rms is a measurement of the losses, or damping, in a driver's suspension and moving system.

50|$|Usually ferrite or similar. This is {{used for}} {{inductors}} and transformers. The shape of a pot core is round with an internal hollow that almost completely encloses the coil.

With a sufficiently large electrical input, the excursion will cause damage to the voice coil or another moving part {{of the driver}}.

5000|$|A unitless measurement, {{characterizing the}} {{mechanical}} damping of the driver, that is, the {{losses in the}} suspension (surround and spider.) It varies roughly between 0.5 and 10, with a typical value around 3. High Qms indicates lower mechanical losses, and low Qms indicates higher losses. The main effect of Qms is on the impedance of the driver, with high Qms drivers displaying a higher impedance peak. One predictor for low Qms is a metallic voice <b>coil</b> <b>former.</b> These act as eddy-current brakes and increase damping, reducing Qms. They must be designed with an electrical break in the cylinder (so no conducting loop). Some speaker manufacturers have placed shorted turns {{at the top and}} bottom of the voice coil to prevent it leaving the gap, but the sharp noise created by this device when the driver is overdriven is alarming and was perceived as a problem by owners. High Qms drivers are often built with nonconductive formers made from paper or various plastics.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} types of power {{handling}} in loudspeaker drivers, including woofers: thermal (heat), electrical (both covered above), and mechanical. The mechanical power handling limit is reached when cone excursion extends to its maximum limit. Thermal power handling limits may be reached when fairly high power levels are fed to a woofer for too long, even if not exceeding mechanical limits at any time. Most of the energy applied to the voice coil is converted to heat, not sound; all of the heat is ultimately passed to the pole piece, {{the rest of the}} magnet structure, and the frame. From the woofer structure, the heat is eventually dissipated into the surrounding air. Some drivers include provisions for better cooling (e.g., vented magnet pole pieces, dedicated heat conduction structures) to reduce increased coil/magnet/frame temperatures during operation, especially high power level conditions. If too much power is applied to the voice coil as compared to its ability to shed heat, it will eventually exceed a maximum safe temperature. Adhesives can melt, the voice <b>coil</b> <b>former</b> can melt or distort, or the insulation separating the voice coil windings can fail. Each of these events will damage the woofer, perhaps beyond usability.|$|E
50|$|Various {{materials}} {{are used in}} the construction of compression driver diaphragms including titanium, aluminium, phenolic impregnated fabric, polyimide and PET film, each having its own characteristics. The diaphragm is glued to a voice <b>coil</b> <b>former,</b> typically made from a different material from the dome, since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change. Polyimide film, Nomex, and glassfibre are popular for this application. The suspension may be a continuation of the diaphragm and is glued to a mounting ring, which may fit into a groove, over locating pins, or be fastened with machine screws. The diaphragm is generally shaped like an inverted dome and loads into a series of tapered channels in a central structure called a phase plug, which equalizes the path length between various areas of the diaphragm and the horn throat, preventing acoustic cancellations between different points on the diaphragm surface. The phase plug exits into a tapered tube, which forms the start of the horn itself. This slowly expanding throat within the driver is continued in the horn flare. The horn flare controls the coverage pattern, or directivity, and as an acoustic transformer, adds gain. A professional horn and compression driver combination has an output sensitivity of between 105 and 112 dB/watt/meter. This is substantially more efficient (and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former) than other tweeter construction.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} alignment uncertainties in the NRC watt balance. We show that, due {{to the use of}} a beam balance in both phases of the experiment, some of the alignment errors of the weighing phase are correlated with errors in the moving phase, which makes our watt balance insensitive to some forms of misalignment. These correlations become inexact in the presence of parasitic forces acting on the <b>coil</b> <b>former.</b> We present evidence of such forces and estimate their effect and contribution to the various uncertainty components.

40|$|Recent {{success in}} NMR {{structure}} determination of oriented membrane protein samples has {{focused attention on}} the need for better RF probes and better sample handling practices. This breaks down to four specific areas in which we are developing improved techniques and hardware: sensitivity, RF field homogeneity, probe power handling capability and sample preparation. Oriented membrane samples consist of stacks of rectangular glass plates between thin layers of hydrated membranes, oriented perpendicular to main magnetic field. The samples must be kept in a sealed cell to ensure that they remain hydrated. We have developed sample cells that facilitate easy preparation and that will seal well enough to keep the samples hydrated for months We show that for rectangular sample cells, rectangular coils offer not only better efficiency, but also better RF homogeneity than circular coils. To further improve sensitivity we have eliminated the <b>coil</b> <b>former</b> and now wind the RF coil right on the sample tube. This step further improves the RF homogeneity. The new coil has a smaller cross section, which reduces the end effect of the solenoid. The coil is constructed from thin, wide foil to better control the RF inhomogeneity that results from proximity to the wall of the solenoid...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research in}} the area of solenoid modelling and design. It is anticipated that the model described will contribute to the design of solenoids for operation in an intrinsically safe environment Firstly, the requirements for intrinsic safety are described including an overview of the complete system. The relevant standards to be applied are highlighted and the optimum power rating for a solenoid working in an intrinsically safe system is derived. The mathematical model is then described together with the assumptions made. The model is able to determine the most efficient gauge of wire to use for a given solenoid resistance from the dimensions of a solenoid <b>coil</b> <b>former,</b> and from this data calculate the expected force generated by the solenoid. The basis of the model is the probable flux path method of solenoid analysis. The method for verifying the model are then discussed as well as a complete analysis of an existing intrinsically safe solenoids. The purpose for the analysis of an existing solenoid was undertaken so that a set of solenoid design rules may be established. The design rules will enable the user to design for the exact requirements for the pneumatic comppnents based on the solenoid operating pressure. Finally, methods for reducing the manufacturing time and improving the assembly time of the solenoid are presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} procedure utilizing ferrous ammonium sulfate-thiourea as the reductant for {{the determination of}} inorganic phosphate in serum and urine by the AutoAnalyzer is described. Elimination of the heating bath usually required for many phosphorus methods for color development yields an improved S. D. of ± 0. 25 and facilitates troubleshooting during any apparatus malfunction. Comparison of results between the proposed method and that of Fiske and SubbaRow (1) is presented. Recoveries of added phosphorous in serum or urine are quantitative. N UMEROUS REDUCING AGENTS {{for the formation of}} molybdenum blue from the phosphomolybdate complex have been successfully used for the determination of inorganic phosphate. Perhaps the most widely used is the compound 1 -amino- 2 -naphthol- 4 -sulfonic acid which was intro-duced by Fiske and SubbaRow (1). Other reducing agents employed in various methodologies are stanilous chloride (. 2), ferrous sulfate (3, 4), p-semidine (5), and more recently citrate-arsenite (6) and ferrous ammonium sulfate (7). Experience has shown many of the reductants used for the analysis of inorganic phosphate have disadvantages, e. g., a short shelf life, a high blank, yielding unstable molybdenum blue colors, and requiring heat for color development. The AutoAnalyzer utilizes the method of Fiske and SubbaRow (i) as the choice. In practice this method works quite well, but has two minor shortcomings: (1) the use of a tempera-ture of 95 #{ 176 }for color development causes a frequent deterioration of tile bubble pattern, and (2) over a period of time, a deposition of molybdenum blue may occur within the heating <b>coil.</b> The <b>former</b> problem can be minimized by using a slightly lower temperature, 80 - 85 #{ 176 },for color development, and tile iatter problem by washing the system after analysis with 1 N NaOII via tile molybdale reagent line...|$|R

40|$|Multi-coil arrays {{applied in}} {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TMS) are proposed to accurately stimulate brain tissues and modulate neural activities by an induced electric field (EF). Composed of numerous independently driven coils, a multi-coil array has alternative energizing strategies to evoke EFs targeting at different cerebral regions. To improve the locating resolution and the stimulating focality, we need to fully understand the variation properties of induced EFs and the quantitative control method of the spatial arrangement of activating coils, both of which unfortunately are still unclear. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of EF properties was performed based on multi-coil arrays. Four types of planar multi-coil arrays were used to study {{the relationship between the}} spatial distribution of EFs and the structure of stimuli coils. By changing coil-driven strategies in a basic 16 -coil array, we find that an EF induced by compactly distributed coils decays faster than that induced by dispersedly distributed <b>coils,</b> but the <b>former</b> has an advantage over the latter in terms of the activated brain volume. Simulation results also indicate that the attenuation rate of an EF induced by the 36 -coil dense array is 3 times and 1. 5 times greater than those induced by the 9 -coil array and the 16 -coil array, respectively. The EF evoked by the 36 -coil dispense array has the slowest decay rate. This result demonstrates that larger multi-coil arrays, compared to smaller ones, activate deeper brain tissues at the expense of decreased focality. A further study on activating a specific field of a prescribed shape and size was conducted based on EF variation. Accurate target location was achieved with a 64 -coil array 18 mm in diameter. A comparison between the figure- 8 coil, the planar array, and the cap-formed array was made and demonstrates an improvement of multi-coil configurations in the penetration depth and the focality. These findings suggest that there is a tradeoff between attenuation rate and focality in the application of multi-coil arrays. Coil-energizing strategies and array dimensions should be based on an adequate evaluation of these two important demands and the topological structure of target tissues...|$|R
