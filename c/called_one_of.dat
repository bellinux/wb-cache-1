5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead.

Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was <b>called</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the deadliest roads {{in the world at}} the time) along with awareness of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E

They arrested Brand in Aleppo (then under British control), where {{he had gone to}} propose Eichmann's offer to the Jewish Agency, {{and put an end to}} it by leaking details to the media.|$|E

Parkinson, on his part, edited and presented in Theatrum Botanicum the papers of de Lobel, who had spent {{the final years of}} his life in Highgate supervising the gardens of Edward la Zouche, the 11th Baron Zouche.|$|E
