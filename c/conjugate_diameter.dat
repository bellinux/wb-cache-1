40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} pelvic arch interference and the depth of the pelvic cavity, as shown on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), on the performance of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (ELRP). Materials and Methods: In 115 patients, pelvic bone images were obtained at the time of prostate MRI before ELRP. In the reconstructed sagittal plane, we measured the true <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameter,</b> the obstetric <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameter,</b> the difference between the true and obstetric diameters, and the distance between the true conjugate and the prostate apex (pelvic depth). We analyzed which factors were associated with operative time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), and positive surgical margins (PSMs). Results: The difference between the true and obstetric conjugate diameters was 12. 7 ± 3. 7 mm, and the pelvic depth was 59. 9 ± 6. 0 mm. The OT, EBL, and the rate of PSMs were 260. 1 ± 91. 1 minutes, 633. 3 ± 524. 7 ml, and 19 % (22 / 115), respectively. According to multiple linear regression analysis, predictors of a higher EBL included pelvic depth (3. 0 % higher per 1 mm increase in diameter difference, p= 0. 01) and prostate volume (1. 5 % higher per 1 cc increase in prostate volume, p= 0. 002). Factors associated with a longer OT were pelvic depth (p= 0. 04), serum prostate-specific antigen (p= 0. 04), prostate volume (p= 0. 02), and Gleason score (p= 0. 001). For PSMs, only pT 2 was an independent factor. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the depth of the pelvic cavity and prostate volume may increase surgical difficulty in patients undergoing ELRP.

40|$|Introduction: Normal {{morphological}} {{features of}} the maternal pelvis are an important prerequisite for vaginal delivery. Clinical evaluation and radiopelvimetry are the accepted methods {{for the evaluation of}} the maternal pelvis. But while the clinical method is associated with a subjective error, radiopelvimetry is cumbersome and associated with radiation hazard to the fetus, the ultrasonic measurement of obstetric conjugate is stated to be simple, cost effective,and clinically useful in women with suspected inlet obstruction. This study aimed at evaluating the relationship of ultrasonic measurement of the obstetric conjugate with the type of delivery. "nMaterials and Methods: In a diagnostic value study, 200 primigravidae with a cephalic presentation referred to 2 ultrasonography centers were recruited during a 14 -months period. The obstetric <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameter</b> was measured twice by the means of transabdominal gray-scale ultrasonography at weeks 25 - 30 and 30 - 35 of pregnancy and the mean was employed as the main reading. The optimal cut-off point for predicting vaginal or cesarean delivery was calculated by the ROC curve. "nResults: Two hundred pregnant women with the mean age of 24. 12 &plusmn; 4. 94 (15 - 40) years were enrolled. Finally, the cesarean section (CS) was indicated in 65 (32. 5 %) patients. There {{was no significant difference between}} the first and the second measurements (p= 0. 065). According to the ROC curve analysis,the optimal cut-off point for the obstetric <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameter</b> was &gt; 119. 75 mm in prediction of vaginal delivery with a sensitivity and specificity of 80 % and 78. 5 %, respectively. "nConclusion: According to this study the ultrasonic measurement of obstetric conjugate is an accurate method which almost remains constant during the end of pregnancy; it's easy to be measured and might be confidentially employed for predicting the CS. Almost 80 % of women with a reading of &gt; 120 mm could be expected to end up with the vaginal delivery. Below 100 mm C/S is inevitably expected...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for reconstructing solids with planar, quadric and toroidal surfaces from three-view engineering drawings. By applying geometric theory to 3 -D reconstruction, our method is able to remove restrictions placed on the axes of curved surfaces by existing methods. The main feature of our algorithm is that it combines the geometric properties of conics with af®ne properties to recover {{a wider range of}} 3 -D edges. First, the algorithm determines the type of each 3 -D candidate conic edge based on its projections in three orthographic views, and then generates that candidate edge using the <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameter</b> method.

Next, a maximum turning angle method is developed to ®nd all the candidate faces in the wire-frame model.

Materials and methodsA prospective study comparing the results of the pelvimetry of 18  dry pelvises carried out on the EOS imaging system to measurements taken manually and using the two current gold standard CT methods. Pelvimetric measurements of each pelvic bone were obtained using four methods and compared: direct manual measurements, spiral and sequential CT pelvimetry, and 2 D- 3 D low-dose biplanar X-rays. The various obstetric diameters were measured to the millimetre and compared. ResultsThere {{was no significant difference in}} the different diameters assessed, with the exception of the interspinous diameter. There was a highly significant correlation (P< 0. 001) between the values measured manually and by EOS for the Magnin index (Pearson= 0. 98), the obstetric <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameter</b> (Pearson= 0. 99), and the median transverse diameter (Pearson= 0. 87). ConclusionThe EOS imaging system allows for an ex vivo determination of the obstetrical diameters that is reliable enough to estimate obstetric prognosis, producing comparable measurements to CT. In view of concerns about protection from radiation, this low-dose imaging technique could become, after in vivo prospective validation, the new gold standard for pelvimetry and therefore a good alternative to CT...|$|E

METHODS: We followed-up 12 439 people born in Helsinki during 1934 to 1944. Their body size was measured at birth and, on average, 9 times between birth and age 2 years; 507 of them were hospitalized with stroke or died from the disease. RESULTS: Hazard ratios for stroke declined progressively with increasing gain in weight between birth and age 2 years. The hazard ratio was 0. 85 (95 % CI, 0. 78 to 0. 93; P= 0. 0004) per standard deviation increase in the difference between the weight attained at age 2 years and that predicted from birth weight. A 1 -standard deviation increase in body mass index at 2 years of age was associated with a hazard ratio for stroke of 0. 84 (95 % CI, 0. 77 to 0. 92; P= 0. 0002). This association was little changed by adjustment for measures of socio-economic status. Change in body size after the age of 2 years had little effect on the risk of later stroke. People whose mothers had a small external <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameter</b> of the pelvis had an increased risk of stroke. The hazard ratio associated with a diameter of < or = 18 cm was 1. 62 (95 % CI, 1. 30 to 2. 02; P< 0. 0001).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{technique}} {{to solve the}} CVP based on dual HKZ-bases by J. Bloemer. The technique {{is based on the}} transference theorems given by Banaszczyk which imply some necessary conditions on the coefficients of the closest vectors with respect to a basis whose dual is HKZ reduced. Recursively, starting with the last coefficient, intervals of length i can be derived for the i-th coefficient of any closest vector. This leads to n! candidates for closest vectors. In this paper we refine the necessary conditions derived from the transference theorems, giving an exponential reduction of the number of candidates. The improvement {{is due to the fact}} that the lengths of the intervals are not independent. In the original algorithm the candidates for a coefficient pair (a_i,a_{i+ 1 }) correspond to the integer points in a rectangle of volume i(i+ 1). In our analysis we show that the candidates for (a_i,a_{i+ 1 }) in fact lie in an ellipse with transverse and <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameter</b> i+ 1, respectively i. This reduces the overall number of points to be enumerated by an exponential factor of about 0. 886 ^n. We further show how a choice of the coefficients (a_n, [...] .,a_{i+ 1 }) influences the interval from which a_i can be chosen. Numerical computations show that these considerations allow to bound the number of points to be enumerated by n^{ 0. 75 n} for 10 <= n <= 2000.
