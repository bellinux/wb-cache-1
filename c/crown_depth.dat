40|$|Background and Aims: Morphological {{variation}} in light-foraging strategies potentially plays {{important roles in}} efficient light utilization and carbon assimilation in spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments such as tropical moist forest understorey. By considering a suite of morphological traits at various hierarchical scales, we examined the functional significance of crown shape diversity and plasticity in response to canopy openness. Methods: We conducted a field comparative study in French Guiana among tree saplings of 14 co-occurring species differing in light-niche optimum and breadth. Each leaf, axis or crown functional trait was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes. Key Results: We found divergent patterns between shade-tolerant and heliophilic species {{on the one hand}} and between shade and sun plants on the other. Across species, multiple regression analysis showed that relative <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> was positively correlated with leaf lifespan and not correlated with crown vertical growth rate. Within species displaying a reduction in <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> in the shade, we observed that <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> was limited by reduced crown vertical growth rate and not by accelerated leaf or branch shedding. In addition, the study provides contrasting examples of morphological multilevel plastic responses, which allow the maintenance of efficient foliage and enable effective whole-plant light capture in shaded conditions under a moderate vertical light gradient. Conclusions: This result suggests that plastic adjustment of relative <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> does not reflect a strategy maximizing light capture efficiency. Integrating and scaling-up leaf-level dynamics to shoot- and crown-level helps to interpret in functional and adaptive terms inter- and intraspecific patterns of crown traits and to better understand the mechanism of shade tolerance.

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop regression prediction models for tree age, tree height, crown diameter, crown ratio and <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> for A. senegal growing in Ferlo, in the northern Senegal. F our plantations of different years old (ISRA, 10 years old plant ations, Ndodj, 8 years old plantations, Boulal, 5 years old plantations and Déali, 4 years old plantations) were selected. The following dendometric variables : crown height, crown diameter, stem diameter at the breast height, stem basal diameter (at 0. 30 m) and the height from the tree base to first branch were measured on a total of 489 trees. The results suggested that the ecological structure of the different year old A. Senegal plantation revealed a bell-shaped form with left dissymmetric distribution indicating a predominance of individuals with small diameter at breast height. Allometry study of A. Senegal showed highly significant positive correlations (p = 0. 00) between stem diameter at breast height, stem basal diameter, tree height, crown diameter and <b>crown</b> <b>depth.</b> Positive correlations were also found between crown diameter, tree height and crown height.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a 3 D model-based tree interpreter, a semi-automatic method for tree measurement from highresolution aerial images. It emphasizes {{the extraction of}} the 3 D geometric information such as tree location, tree height, <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> (or crown height), crown radius, and surface curvature. First, trees are modeled as 30 hemi-ellipsoids with the following parameters: tree-top coordinates, trunk base height, <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> crown radius, and crown surface curvature. This model-based approach turns a tree interpretation task into a problem of optimal tree model determination. Multi-angular images are {{used to determine the}} optimal tree model for each tree. Tree tops in each image of a stereo pair are identified interactively with the epipolar constraint, and the 30 geometry of trees can be determined automatically. With such a semi-automatic scheme, efficiency and reliability of 3 ~ tree measurements are achieved by taking advantages of both the operator's interpretation skills and the machine's computation.

40|$|Extensive {{research}} shows temperature {{to be the}} primary environmental factor controlling the phyllochron, or rate of leaf appearance, of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Experimental results suggest that soil temperature at <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> rather than air temperature above the canopy, would better predict wheat leaf appearance rates. To test this hypothesis, leaf appearance in spring wheat (2 ̆ 7 Nordic 2 ̆ 7) was measured in a 2 -year field experiment (Nunn clay loam soil; fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic, Argiustoll) with three planting dates and two soil temperature treatments. One temperature treatment (denoted + 3 C) consisted of heating the soil at <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> to 3 °C above the ambient soil temperature (denoted +OC). Main stem cumulative leaf number was measured at least weekly until flag leaf emergence. Leaf appearance was essentially linear with both air and soil growing degree-days (GDD), although there was a stronger linear relationship with soil GDD in the +OC plants than in + 3 C plants. A weak positive relationship between planting date and the phyllochron was observed. Unexpectedly, we found that heating the soil did not increase the rate of leaf appearance, as the paradigm would predict. To explain these results, we propose extending the paradigm in two ways. First, three processes are involved in leaf appearance: (1) cell division at the shoot apex forms the primordium; (2) cell division in the intercalary meristem forms the cells that then (3) expand to produce the leaf. Cell division is predominately controlled by temperature, but cell expansion is considerably more affected by factors other than temperature, explaining the influence of other factors on the phyllochron. Secondly, the vertical distribution of the two meristems and region of cell expansion occur over a significant distance, where temperature varies considerably, and temperature at a specific point (e. g. <b>crown</b> <b>depth)</b> does not account for the entire temperature regime under which leaves are developing...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) {{can be a}} new {{promising}} {{remote sensing}} tool in the ocean, snow/ice and land surfaces, e. g., vegetation biomass monitoring. Although GNSS-R provides a potentially special L-band multi-angular and multi-polarization measurement, the theoretical vegetation scattering properties and mechanisms for GNSS-R are not understood clearly. In this paper, the GNSS-R vegetation polarization scattering properties are studied and modeled at different incidence angles (specular direction). The bistatic scattering model Bi-mimics is employed, which is the first-order radiative transfer equation. As a kind of forest stand, the Aspen's crown layer is composed of entire leaves, and its parameters in Mimics handbook are used as model input. The specular circular polarizations (co-polarization RR and cross-polarization LR) are simulated. For cross-polarization, the received polarization is assumed as a linear (horizontal and vertical) polarizations and +/- 45 degrees linear polarizations. Therefore, the HR VR, + 45 R and - 45 R polarizations are simulated here. Contributions from different scattering components at RR, LR and VR polarization are also presented. For co-polarization, it is large in the whole specular angles (10 - 80 degrees). The scattering trends of the other cross polarization (HR, LR, + 45 R and - 45 R) are a little similar {{when compared to the}} RR and RV. Therefore, the RHCP and V polarizations are more favorable to collect the reflected signals. The trunk heights and <b>crown</b> <b>depths</b> do not affect the scattering trends of RR, RV and RL, while the trunk height has some effect on the scattering amplitude of different polarizations. The azimuth angle has more effects on RR, RL and RV scattering, especially in lower than 50 degrees.

The woodland is ancient, semi-natural broadleaf and has a heterogeneous structure with a mostly closed canopy overstorey and a patchy understorey layer.

The hypothesis that light demand and adult stature of tree species within a community, independently of each other, determine species' architectural traits was tested by comparing 53 Liberian rain forest tree species. We evaluated-whether species differed in their tree height, <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and crown diameter, when compared at a standardized size of 15 -cm diameter at breast height, and how their architecture changed early during ontogeny. Tree height {{was positively correlated with}} adult stature and light demand. By producing a relatively slender stem, large-stature species are able to rapidly reach their reproductive size, at a low cost for construction and support. Light-demanding species need a slender stem to be able to attain or maintain a position in the canopy. Both <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> and crown diameter were negatively correlated with adult stature, but not with light demand. This is in contrast with the hypothesis that shade-tolerant species should have a shallow crown to reduce self-shading in a light-limited environment. Investing energy in height growth rather than lateral crown growth allows a rapid vertical stem extension, but crown diameter has to be sufficiently small {{to reduce the risk of}} mechanical failure. All architectural patterns were maintained during ontogeny. The key factors driving interspecific differences in tree architecture are the costs of height extension and mechanical stability.

40|$|The {{cerebral}} cortex changes throughout the lifespan, and the cortical grey matter in many brain regions becomes thinner with advancing age. Effects of aging on cortical thickness {{have been observed}} in many brain regions, including areas involved in basic perceptual functions such as processing visual inputs. An important property of early visual cortices is their topographic organization – the cortical structure of early visual areas forms a topographic map of retinal inputs. Primary visual cortex (V 1) {{is considered to be}} the most basic cortical area in the visual processing hierarchy, and is topographically organized from posterior (central visual representation) to anterior (peripheral visual representation) along the calcarine sulcus. Some studies have reported strong age-dependent cortical thinning in portions of V 1 that likely correspond to peripheral visual representations, while there is less evidence of substantial cortical thinning in central V 1. However, the effect of aging on cortical thickness in V 1 as a function of its topography has not been directly investigated. To address this gap in the literature, we estimated the cortical thickness of different eccentricity sectors in V 1 using T 1 -weighted MRI scans acquired from groups of healthy younger and older adults, and then assessed whether between-group differences in V 1 cortical thickness depended on cortical eccentricity. These analyses revealed age-dependent cortical thinning specific to peripheral visual field representations in anterior portions of V 1, but did not provide evidence for age-dependent cortical thinning in other portions of V 1. Additional analyses found similar effects when analyses were restricted to the gyral <b>crown,</b> sulcul <b>depth,</b> and sulcul wall, indicating that these effects are not likely due to differences in gyral/sulcul contributions to our regions of interest. Importantly, this finding indicates that age-dependent changes in cortical structure may differ among functionally distinct zones within larger canonical cortical areas. Likely relationships to known age-related declines in visual performance are discussed to provide direction for future research in this area...|$|R

This thesis studies the influence of the geometry and topology of arch bridges on both their structural performance relayed by the maximum deflection and their structural weight. Various materials are also considered to calculate the embodied carbon emission and investigate the environmental impact of arch bridges. Gustave Eiffel's Garabit Viaduct is used as a design precedent for this study. 2 -D and 3 -D parametric models of the arch bridge are realized using Grasshopper [8]. Changing the geometric parameters in addition to the topology enables the investigation of the bridge's performance. The cross sections are automatically optimized in each case. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization process was run on the bridge to examine the tradeoffs between the deflection and the self-weight. The weight-oriented optimization allows saving more than 60 % of the weight compared to the original structure. Analyzing the different resulting designs proves that increasing the depth at the arch's <b>crown</b> and the <b>depth</b> {{at the base of the}} arch leads to better deflection results. It also demonstrates that using a denser truss structure leads to a lighter structure. by Khaoula Msaaf. Thesis: M.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} studies of non-elongating subcrown internode (NE) in spring barley {{and its role}} in plant performance under reduced water use. Chapter 1 covers the inheritance study of NE. Chapter 2 reports a two year study of seeding depth and subcrown internode length (SIL) effects in performance of barley, wheat and durum genotypes. Chapter 3 reports on genetic and environmental factors that affect <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> and crown root development under a one-irrigation cultural regime. The research was conducted between 1990 and 1993 under field and greenhouse conditions. The NE character appears to be controlled by a major recessive gene. Selecting the NE trait is relatively easy by conventional plant breeding. SIL variation is continuous and seems regulated by several modifiers that interact strongly with the environment. Expression of genes for SIL require deep seeding. Under field conditions and regardless of genotype, shallow seeding inhibited SIL but produced shallow crowns while deep seeding stimulated SIL but produced deeper crowns. Deep seeding increased yield, 100 -seed weight, seeds/spike, an days to anthesis, but reduced tillers/m² and plant height in most genotypes. Short SIL genotypes (≤ 2. 6 mm) were more favored by deep seeding than long SIL genotypes (≥ 8. 2 mm). The correlations of SIL and <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> with yield and yield components increased with deep seeding. The time of crown root initiation varied tremendously among barley plants of CC XXXIX. Crown roots/plant could be predicted by leaves/plant (r = 0. 92; P ≤ 0. 01). Most plants in CC XXXIX had crown root initiation around the 3 -leaf stage. The rate of soil moisture decreased with soil depth. Soil moisture between day 7 and day 21 after the planting irrigation was depleted by 77 % at 0 - 2. 5 cm and by 40 % at 12. 5 - 15 cm depth. The construction of specific soil water tension curves based on soil moisture distribution over a dry period after the planting irrigation could be of great value in determining optimal seeding depth, choice of variety, and establishment of selection criteria for <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and time of crown root initiation in a breeding program for reduced water use. Line P 4 had no-SIL regardless of light and population density. Light deficiency increased SIL of Seco and the Yemen line more than high population density. The internodes below the crown in P 4 are insensitive to light and population density, but internodes above the crown in the same line are as sensitive as Seco and the Yemen line.

Fertilization enhanced needle size and leaf area ill the upper crown, but had no effect on leaf area and other variables at the shoot, branch and crown levcl.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Canopy structure, {{which can}} be defined as the sum of the sizes, shapes and {{relative}} placements of the tree crowns in a forest stand, is central to all aspects of forest ecology. But there is no accepted method for deriving canopy structure from the sizes, species and biomechanical properties of the individual trees in a stand. Any such method must capture the fact that trees are highly plastic in their growth, forming tessellating crown shapes that fill all or most of the canopy space. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We introduce a new, simple and rapidly-implemented model [...] the Ideal Tree Distribution, ITD [...] with tree form (height allometry and crown shape), growth plasticity, and space-filling, at its core. The ITD predicts the canopy status (in or out of canopy), <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and total and exposed crown area of the trees in a stand, given their species, sizes and potential crown shapes. We use maximum likelihood methods, in conjunction with data from over 100, 000 trees taken from forests across the coterminous US, to estimate ITD model parameters for 250 North American tree species. With only two free parameters per species [...] one aggregate parameter to describe crown shape, and one parameter to set the so-called depth bias [...] the model captures between-species patterns in average canopy status, crown radius, and <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and within-species means of these metrics vs stem diameter. The model also predicts much of the variation in these metrics for a tree of a given species and size, resulting solely from deterministic responses to variation in stand structure. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This new model, with parameters for US tree species, opens up new possibilities for understanding and modeling forest dynamics at local and regional scales, and may provide a new way to interpret remote sensing data of forest canopies, including LIDAR and aerial photography...|$|E
40|$|Gyrencephalic brains exhibit {{deformations}} {{of the six}} neocortical laminae at gyral <b>crowns</b> and sulcal <b>depths,</b> {{where the}} deeper layers are, respectively, expanded and compressed. The present study addresses: (1) {{the degree to which}} the underlying white matter neurons (WMNs) observe the same changes at gyral crowns and sulcal depths; and (2) whether these changes are consistent or variable across different cortical regions. WMNs were visualized by immunohistochemistry using the pan-neuronal label NeuN, and their density was quantified in eight rhesus monkey brains for four regions; namely, frontal (FR), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), parietal (Par) and temporal (TE). In all four regions, there were about 50 % fewer WMNs in the sulcal depth, but there was also distinct variability from region to region. For the gyral crown, we observed an average density per 0. 21 mm 2 of 82 WMNs for the FR, 51 WMNs for SFG, 80 WMNs for Par and 93 WMNs for TE regions. By contrast, for the sulcal depth, the average number of WMNs per 0. 21 mm 2 was 41 for FR, 31 for cingulate sulcus (underlying the SFG), 54 for Par and 63 for TE cortical regions. Since at least some WMNs participate in cortical circuitry, these results raise the possibility of their differential influence on cortical circuitry in the overlying gyral and sulcal locations. The results also point to a possible role of WMNs in the differential vulnerability of gyral vs. sulcal regions in disease processes, and reinforce the increasing awareness of the WMNs as part of a complex, heterogeneous and structured microenvironment...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} is already {{impacting}} native vegetation world-wide. Thus accurate mapping of current vegetation condition is necessary for benchmarking and conservation planning. We examine {{the potential for the}} mapping of native vegetation of forested ecosystems in south-western Australia using LiDAR data. Airborne LiDAR (distance between data points 1. 2 m) and RGB imagery was acquired with a discrete 4 -return Leica ALS 50 -II system in April 2011 and vertical canopy profiles determined in Boyagin Nature Reserve. Elevation, slope and geomorphological descriptions of the terrain in combination with vertical canopy profiles based on presence/absence of returns within voxels were derived from the LiDAR data and processed at a spatial resolution of 4. 0 meters. Based on these profiles, <b>crown</b> height and <b>depth,</b> ground cover, mean intensity of crown returns, presence of understory and number of vegetation layers were determined for each grid cell. Unsupervised classification revealed distinctive canopy profiles. Vegetation is strongly linked to geomorphology in this old landscape. Thus Kwongan shrubland occurs on the plateaus, Allocasuarina heugeliana woodland on the fringes of rock outcrops, Eucalyptus astringens and E. accedens woodland on breakaways and E. wandoo and Corymbia calophylla woodland in more fertile valley systems. The vegetation types present within distinctive spatial clusters were determined in two field visits. Vegetation types were mapped with an object-based image analysis approach at geomorphological, vegetation and tree scales using the geomorphology of the terrain and structural, textural and reflective characteristics of the canopy. All vertical profiles identified were present on each geomorphological unit. Tree species with a distinctive vertical profile such as Eucalyptus astringens and Allocasuarina heugeliana were defined and distinguished i...|$|R
40|$|Strontium {{was used}} as a tracer to detect root {{activity}} of yam (Dioscorea alata) at distances from 0. 5 to 5. 5 m from the plant 2 ̆ 7 s <b>crown,</b> and at <b>depths</b> of 7, 15, 25 and 40 cm, in field plantings separated by plastic root barriers. Tracer bands were installed at planting, and leaves were sampled at intervals throughout the growing season. Background Sr concentrations in leaves were found to be closely related to leaf Ca concentrations, allowing the expected background Sr to be calculated from the Ca concentration in each sample. The ratio of observed to expected Sr did not alter significantly with time of sampling or leaf age for control plants providing a robust parameter for comparison across harvests. Plants at all horizontal distances from the Sr placement up to 5. 5 m showed significant elevation of leaf Sr by 13 weeks after planting (WAP). The depth placement at 15 cm showed earliest Sr elevation, followed by the 7 cm placement. However, both 25 cm and 40 cm placements resulted in significant leaf Sr elevation by 13 WAP, and their final Sr concentrations at 27 WAP did not differ significantly from those of shallower placements. Three fertilizer placement options were compared with respect to Sr uptake by the treated plants and by those in adjacent rows. Placement in a ring around the crown of the seed sett resulted in high leaf Sr concentration at 5 WAP, declining considerably at subsequent samplings. Placement underneath the seed sett produced a similar pattern but at lower concentrations. Banding midway between the plant rows, 0. 5 m from plants, yielded a small increase at 5 WAP increasing to 13 WAP, and ultimately attaining similar concentrations to the other two placements. Plants in adjacent rows significantly accessed all three placements by 13 WAP. The results indicate greater reach of yam roots, both horizontally and vertically, than has been previously reported, and raise concerns about the adequacy of treatment separation in previously published fertilizer experiments with yams...|$|R
