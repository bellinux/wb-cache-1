5|$|On 10 January 1870, Rockefeller {{abolished}} the partnership of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, forming Standard Oil of Ohio. Continuing to apply {{his work ethic}} and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company {{to be the most}} profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of <b>competing</b> <b>products.</b>|$|E
5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories for the sale of goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell <b>competing</b> <b>products</b> in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} where Topolsky was editor-in-chief, Engadget was {{routinely}} {{accused of being}} biased towards Apple Inc. and the company's products. Engadget seemed to be giving higher ratings to Apple products, de-emphasizing their disadvantages. <b>Competing</b> <b>products</b> were allegedly given the opposite treatment.|$|E
25|$|During its lifetime, several <b>competing</b> <b>products</b> were {{released}} for the x86 platform, and MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000. Initially MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access {{not only the}} operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Ultimately it was the key product in Microsoft's growth from a programming languages company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. It is a flexible operating system, and consumes negligible installation space.|$|E
25|$|In June 1870, Flagler and Rockefeller formed Standard Oil of Ohio, which rapidly {{became the}} most {{profitable}} refiner in Ohio. Standard Oil grew {{to become one of}} the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads were fighting fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company in collusion with Standard and other oil men outside the main oil centers. The cartel received preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep rebates of up to 50% for their product but also rebates for the shipment of <b>competing</b> <b>products.</b> Part of this scheme was the announcement of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, which eventually led to the discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel’s charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being.|$|E

500|$|Ventana Research said Paxata {{was in a}} [...] "noisy marketplace". According to Gartner, while Paxata is {{an early}} entrant into the market, many {{startups}} and large corporations are making investments in developing similar <b>competing</b> <b>products.</b> According to Gigaom and IT Business Edge, one way Paxata differs is that it automatically merges multiple data-sets into a single table, {{so it can be}} easily imported into a visualization or analysis tool.|$|E
500|$|Computer Notes {{featured}} {{a wide variety}} of authors. Bill Gates and Paul Allen were regular contributors to the early issues. They wrote about Altair Basic and general software topics. Ed Roberts wrote a monthly [...] "Letter from the President" [...] column where he would answer customer questions and even review <b>competing</b> <b>products.</b> MITS engineers, such as Tom Durston and Steve Pollini, would give technical descriptions of new products. Altair owners would contribute software and hardware suggestions and occasionally a complete article.|$|E
500|$|In September 2004, Juniper {{entered the}} market for {{enterprise}} access routers with three routers that were {{the first of the}} J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market. Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches. According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was [...] "the first serious threat" [...] to <b>competing</b> <b>products</b> from Cisco. Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, Sun Microsystems {{bought a}} <b>competing</b> <b>product,</b> StarOffice, {{and turned it}} into the open source OpenOffice.org {{software}} suite. That destroyed the market for competing software, and Applixware sales declined.|$|R
2500|$|Vaporware {{is often}} {{announced}} {{months or years}} before its purported release, with few details about its development being released. Developers {{have been accused of}} intentionally promoting vaporware to keep customers from switching to <b>competing</b> <b>products</b> that offer more features. Network World magazine called vaporware an [...] "epidemic" [...] in 1989, and blamed the press for not investigating whether developers' claims were true. Seven major companies issued a report in 1990 saying they felt vaporware had hurt the industry's credibility. The United States accused several companies of announcing vaporware early enough to violate antitrust laws, but few have been found guilty. InfoWorld magazine wrote that the word is overused, and places an unfair stigma on developers.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{corporations}} {{all over}} the world are either undertaking LCA in house or commissioning studies, while governments support the development of national databases to support LCA. Of particular note is the growing use of LCA for ISO Type III labels called Environmental Product Declarations, defined as [...] "quantified environmental data for a product with pre-set categories of parameters based on the ISO 14040 series of standards, but not excluding additional environmental information". These third-party certified LCA-based labels provide an increasingly important basis for assessing the relative environmental merits of <b>competing</b> <b>products.</b> Third-party certification plays a major role in today's industry. Independent certification can show a company's dedication to safer and environmental friendlier products to customers and NGOs.|$|E
