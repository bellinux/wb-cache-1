An automated liftering procedure is used which zeros out a block portion of the cepstrum including the echo information.

50|$|During the day, {{the lights}} may not {{easily be seen}} and {{therefore}} leading lights are often fitted with secondary visual aids, e.g. large red flags with wide black lines running down them.

50|$|Two {{lights are}} {{positioned}} near one another. One, called the front light, {{is lower than}} the one behind, which is called the rear light.

5000|$|Distances {{were always}} {{measured}} in chains and links, based on Edmund Gunter’s 66 foot measuring chain. The chain--an actual metal chain--was {{made up of}} 100 links, each being 7.92 in long. Eighty chains constitute one U.S. Survey Mile (which differs from the International Mile by a few millimeters). There were two chainmen, one at each end, who physically made the measurements, one of them typically also acting as [...] "compassman" [...] to establish the <b>correct</b> <b>bearing</b> at each chain placement. In forested areas, it was essential for rapid progress and accuracy that the lead chainman follow the <b>correct</b> <b>bearing</b> at all times, since no straightening of the chain was possible without backtracking around trees and re-measuring. It was also necessary to keep the chain level, since all surveying distances {{are based on the}} horizontal, not slope, distance. In steep terrain, this meant either shortening the chain, or raising one end of the chain relative to the other, or both. In areas where measuring by chain was not possible, such as extremely steep terrain or that with water obstructions, distances were calculated by triangulation.|$|R

50|$|The {{weapon is}} {{essentially}} a glider-delivered version of the L4 torpedo. The launcher is a circular mount, which allows the weapon to be slewed to the <b>correct</b> <b>bearing,</b> whereupon it is fired at a fixed elevation of +15°. Two solid booster rockets accelerate it to 830 km/h within 4 seconds before falling away. The unpowered glider continues {{at an altitude of}} 100 meters, altering course in mid-flight under radio control of the launch platform. Effective range was 13 km. As it reaches the target, the glider drops the torpedo, which splashes into the sea and commences a circular search pattern. The flight time of the Malafon meant that it was expected to hit the water up to 800 m from the submarine's location. The L4 torpedo had a speed of 30 kt over a range of 5 km.|$|R
50|$|Later, RDF {{sets were}} {{equipped}} with rotatable ferrite loopstick antennas, {{which made the}} sets more portable and less bulky. Some were later partially automated {{by means of a}} motorized antenna (ADF). A key breakthrough was the introduction of a secondary vertical whip or 'sense' antenna that substantiated the <b>correct</b> <b>bearing</b> and allowed the navigator to avoid plotting a bearing 180 degrees opposite the actual heading. The U.S. Navy RDF model SE 995 which used a sense antenna was in use during World War I. After World War II, there were many small and large firms making direction finding equipment for mariners, including Apelco, Aqua Guide, Bendix, Gladding (and its marine division, Pearce-Simpson), Ray Jefferson, Raytheon, and Sperry. By the 1960s, many of these radios were actually made by Japanese electronics manufacturers, such as Panasonic, Fuji Onkyo, and Koden Electronics Co., Ltd. In aircraft equipment, Bendix and Sperry-Rand were two of the larger manufacturers of RDF radios and navigation instruments.|$|R

50|$|Social {{learning}} {{combined the}} theory of adaptive management with a pragmatic approach to politics. The theory of adaptive management views public policy experimentally: any policy has to be constructed to obtain knowledge through trial and error. If a policy works, it would be left alone. Conversely, if a policy didn’t work, it would be easily reversible. Lee described the process as similar to using a compass: if the compass gave the right bearing, the user could continue to follow the path, and if the compass gave the wrong bearing, the user could easily retrace his steps and obtain another, more <b>correct</b> <b>bearing.</b> Adaptive management would be supplemented by politics, which Lee described as “bounded conflict.” The process of adaptive management would inevitably create conflict; it was {{the role of the}} political process to discuss and criticize a policy that was not working in order to create better policy. This would be similar to a gyroscope, which charts a ship’s course independent of external influences. Social learning would essentially be a feedback loop between adaptive management and the political process.|$|R
5000|$|The initial Fire-control system (FCS) was the Marconi FV/GCE Mk 4. A [...]50-inch (12.7 mm) ranging gun {{was mounted}} above the main gun (with 300 rounds available).

50|$|The radio {{technology}} behind direction finding was simple and well understood by both sides, but the technology commonly used {{before the war}} used a manually-rotated aerial to fix {{the direction of the}} transmitter. This was delicate work, took quite a time to accomplish to any degree of accuracy, and since it only revealed the line along which the transmission originated a single set could not determine if the transmission was from the true direction or its reciprocal 180 degrees in the opposite direction. Two sets were required to fix the position. Believing this to still be the case, German U-boat radio operators considered themselves fairly safe if they kept messages short. The British, however, developed an oscilloscope-based indicator which instantly fixed the direction and its reciprocal the moment a radio operator touched his Morse key. It worked simply with a crossed pair of conventional and fixed directional aerials, the oscilloscope display showing the relative received strength from each aerial as an elongated ellipse showing the line relative to the ship. The innovation was a 'sense' aerial which when switched in, suppressed the ellipse in the 'wrong' direction leaving only the <b>correct</b> <b>bearing.</b> With this there was hardly any need to triangulate—the escort could just run down the precise bearing provided and use radar for final positioning. Many U-boat attacks were suppressed and submarines sunk in this way—a good example of the great difference apparently minor aspects of technology could make to the battle.|$|R

2500|$|The Principal Triangulation of Great Britain was {{initiated}} by the Board of Ordnance in 1791 and carried out {{under the direction of}} William Mudge and Thomas Frederick Colby. The field work was completed in 1853, just as Clark joined the Board. The methods of analysis had been planned in outline by William Yolland, his predecessor {{at the head of the}} Trigonometric Section, but it fell to Clarke to finalize the methods and carry them through to completion. This he achieved in the four years from 1854 to 1858: the report was published as [...] but it is entirely Clarke's work. The basic data was the collection of angle bearings taken from each of the 289 stations towards a number of other stations, typically from three to ten in number. The multiple observations were first subjected to a least squares error analysis to extract the most likely angles and then the triangles formed by the <b>corrected</b> <b>bearings</b> were adjusted simultaneously, again by least squares methods, to find the most likely geometry for the whole mesh. This was an immense undertaking which involved the solution of 920 equations without the aid of matrix methods or digital computers. The only available computers were the living personnel of the Trigonometric Section, twenty one of them. Once the triangles had been fixed it was then possible to calculate all the sides of the mesh in terms of the length of either of the bases, one by Lough Foyle in Ireland and the other on Salisbury plain. The accuracy of the survey was such that when the length of the Lough Foyle base was calculated through the triangulation mesh from the Salisbury base the error was only 5 inches when compared with its measured length (of 41,640.887 feet or about 8 miles). The final step was to use the distances and angles to work out the latitude and longitude of each triangulation point on the Airy ellipsoid.|$|R

To overcome the RPP problem, we utilized nanofiber scaffolds as templates on which modified cells were allowed to recover, grow, and expand after gene editing. Here, we present evidence that some HCT 116 - 19, bearing an integrated, mutated enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene and corrected by gene editing, proliferate on polylysine or fibronectin-coated polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber scaffolds. In contrast, no cells from the same reaction protocol plated on both regular dish surfaces and polylysine (or fibronectin) -coated dish surfaces proliferate.

40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} {{issues can}} be dealt with using several approaches. Using the source - transfer path - receiver approach, a vibration issue could be solved by attenuating the source, modifying the transfer path or by influencing the receiver. Applying this approach on a wind turbine gearbox would respectively correspond with lowering the gear excitation levels, modifying the gearbox housing or by trying to isolate the gearbox {{from the rest of the}} wind turbine. This paper uses a combination of multi-body modelling and typical transfer path analysis (TPA) to investigate the impact of bearings on the total transfer path and the resulting vibration levels. Structural vibrations are calculated using a flexible multi-body model of a 3 stage wind turbine gearbox. Because the high speed mesh is often the main source of vibrations, focus is put on the 4 bearings of this gear stage. The TPA method using structural vibration simulation results shows which bearing position is responsible for transmitting the highest excitation levels from the gears to the gearbox housing structure. Influences of bearing stiffness values and bearing damping values on the resulting vibration levels are investigated by means of a parameter sensitivity study and are confirmed with the results from the TPA. Because both the TPA and the parameter sensitivity analysis revealed a big influence on radial stiffness for a certain bearing this was investigated in more detail and showed the big importance of <b>correct</b> axial <b>bearing</b> position.

40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings used on oil-free centrifugal refrigeration compressors {{have lower}} stiffness than conventional oil-lubricated journal or rolling element bearings. The lower stiffness of these bearings makes them sensitive to internal flow instabilities that are precursors of rotating stall or compressor surge. At operating conditions {{far away from}} surge the internal flow is very stable and the magnetic bearings keep the shaft centered, resulting in a minimal bearing orbit. The internal flow instabilities that arise when the compressor approaches the surge limit result in some radially fluctuating forces on the shaft. The active magnetic <b>bearings</b> <b>correct</b> for these fluctuating radial forces on the shaft. The bearing orbit increases {{with the size of}} these radial forces. Optimum compressor efficiency occurs close to surge at incipient stall conditions when maximum internal flow pressure recovery occurs. The positional feedback system of the active magnetic bearing control loop system indicates the bearing orbit which relates to compressor efficiency. At high flow conditions capacity is controlled by compressor speed for the imposed pressure ratio. At low flow conditions a combination of variable speed and a means of range extension (e. g. inlet guide vanes, variable geometry diffuser, or flow recirculation) are required to control capacity at the imposed pressure ratio and guarantee stable compressor operation. The bearing orbit signal can be used to determine which speed/geometry combination gives the highest compressor efficiency. If the bearing orbit is below a minimum value the compressor runs too close to choke and a reduction in speed combined with an opening of the diffuser throat area would increase compressor efficiency. If, on the other hand, the bearing orbit is above a maximum value the compressor runs too close to surge and an increase in speed combined with a closing of the diffuser throat area is required to increase compressor efficiency and guarantee surge-free compressor. Experience with this control scheme will be illustrated for a newly developed 350 ton two-stage centrifugal compressor where the variable geometry hardware is replaced with a controlled internal flow recirculation...|$|R
