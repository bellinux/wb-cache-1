5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E

500|$|To all the praise, Youngblood responded, [...] "I don't <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> tough, I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> a nut {{for some}} of the things I did". Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, I {{certainly}} wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either. [...] But I think one of my biggest assets was that I had an undeniable determination to be the best that has ever {{put his hand on the}} ground, I had a genuine desire to be great." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't {{want you}} to go," [...] Paula urged. [...] "I don't know what I want. You must bear with me. I am not <b>{{consider}}ing</b> <b>myself.</b> I am past <b>considering</b> <b>myself.</b> But I must consider Dick. I must consider you. I... I am so unused to such a situation," [...] she concluded with a wan smile.|$|R

[...] In a December 2013 {{interview}} with Verdens Gang, he clarified that the response was a joke and he had meant [...] "obviously not," [...] also stating: [...] "I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> to have normal social skills and to be functioning normally." ...|$|E
50|$|I've always <b>considered</b> <b>myself</b> an experimentalist. My {{subject matter}} is often {{whimsical}} or mysteriously off-beat. I've been told that my work reflects my personality pretty accurately.|$|R
5000|$|Despite these efforts, Campbell later claimed, [...] "I never <b>{{considered}}</b> <b>myself</b> ... {{an activist}} {{in the civil}} rights movement, though {{a lot of other people}} considered me an activist." ...|$|R

500|$|A {{few minutes}} later, just after 10:00, an {{armoured}} personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building.

500|$|After the election, the House Ethics Committee {{found that}} Ferraro had {{technically}} violated the Ethics in Government Act {{by failing to}} report, or reporting incorrectly, details of her family's finances, and {{that she should have}} reported her husband's holdings on her Congressional disclosure forms. However, the committee concluded that she had acted without [...] "deceptive intent", and since she was leaving Congress anyway, no action against her was taken. Ferraro said, [...] "I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> completely vindicated." [...] The scrutiny of her husband and his business dealings presaged a trend that women candidates would face in American electoral politics.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{said in an}} interview: [...] "Homophobia {{is still}} shockingly {{prevalent}} in film and TV. I know I've lost work because of being gay, and it is always an issue. Even on a serious BBC Two drama, {{there will be some}} suit in some office going, [...] "Hmmm, isn't he a poof?" [...] I don't <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> politically gay, but whenever I catch a whiff of that now, I'm on it like a ton of bricks." [...] In 2007, Daniels was ranked number 79 in the annual Pink List of 100 influential gay and lesbian people in Britain published by The Independent on Sunday, down from number 47 in 2006.|$|E

500|$|Irwin was {{a passionate}} {{conservationist}} and believed in promoting environmentalism by sharing his excitement about {{the natural world}} rather than preaching to people. He was concerned with conservation of endangered animals and land clearing leading to loss of habitat. He considered conservation {{to be the most}} important part of his work: [...] "I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> a wildlife warrior. My mission is to save the world's endangered species." [...] Irwin bought [...] "large tracts of land" [...] in Australia, Vanuatu, Fiji and the United States, which he described as [...] "like national parks" [...] and stressed the importance of people realising that they could each make a difference.|$|E

500|$|Morrison {{returned}} to the A studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: [...] "Elliot {{thought he was going}} to be the co-producer, but then again I never saw him calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn't <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E
5000|$|... "It's {{malentendu}} {{to consider}} me Abstract Expressionist. I {{was invited to}} participate in many things, but I never <b>considered</b> <b>myself</b> part of that group, or any group, and it shows in my work." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{suppose that}} {{something}} of what I was feeling {{was reflected in}} my face. I had always <b>considered</b> <b>myself</b> {{a man of the}} world and I was interested enough in my fellows to enjoy mixing with all classes.|$|R

500|$|In early 2010, {{a primary}} {{challenge}} from {{radio talk show}} host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement. With Hayworth using the campaign slogan [...] "The Consistent Conservative", McCain said – despite his own past use of the term {{on a number of occasions}} – [...] "I never considered myself a maverick. I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities." [...] The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, campaign finance restrictions, and gays in the military.|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim at Tinker Creek {{is a work}} of {{creative}} nonfiction that uses poetic devices such as metaphor, repetition, and inversion to convey the importance of recurrent themes. [...] Although it is often described as a series of essays, Dillard has insisted it is a continuous work, as evidenced by references to events from previous chapters. [...] Although the chapters are separately named—several have also been published separately in magazines and anthologies—she referred to the book in a 1989 interview as a [...] "single sustained nonfiction narrative". [...] Dillard has also resisted the label of [...] "nature writer", especially in regard to Pilgrim. She stated, [...] "There's usually a bit of nature in what I write, but I don't <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> a nature writer." ...|$|E
500|$|Stoddart himself outspoken about Modernism, and its {{contemporary}} {{failures and}} historical misunderstandings, without hesitation, {{makes clear that}} his work stems from a Modernism born in neo-classicism, [...] "And yet, after having said all this about Modernism, I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> a Modernist – but {{in the context of}} a vast application of the term extending miles beyond the pokey wee official area to which usually it is confined. For in truth there are really two kinds of Modernism to be uncovered in the space of the last two and a half centuries, and it is to the first and largest of these that I belong and to which, in my small way, I contribute. This is the Modernism that was born in neo-classicism and has, as its great central titan, the mighty Richard Wagner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{can you be}} so unfeeling?--but you may {{pay your}} debts in your own way. You won't ever listen to what I have to say! I should have thought that, as your father, I might have <b>considered</b> <b>myself</b> {{entitled}} to more respect from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With pleasure, Roland. I have an {{outstanding}} engagement with you, you know, and I have been hoping {{that you would}} call and remind me of it; in fact I made so sure you would, that I <b>considered</b> <b>myself</b> engaged and refused two invitations yesterday." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I’ve never <b>considered</b> <b>myself</b> to be {{a runaway}} success at {{anything}} I’ve done, including parenthood," [...] Pollard wrote in 2005. [...] "But I’ve at least allowed {{my children to}} pursue their own interests without too much interference, and I think they both turned out pretty good." ...|$|R
500|$|Upon its release, it {{received}} positive reviews from music critics. A staff member at CD Journal was positive, complimenting the songwriting {{on how it}} holds a [...] "sharp message" [...] for listeners to understand. The review concluded with the reviewer labeling it [...] "exhilarating". In a similar review, The News Hub's Can Hoang Tran said that [...] "There are times {{that you may have}} rewound the anime to the very beginning just to listen to the theme song. I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> part of that group of anime let alone Gate fans." [...] He called it one of 2015's [...] "catchy and [...] " [...] anime theme songs. Josh Piedra from The Outerhaven enjoyed the song as a [...] "Kyoudan fan", but stated that [...] "The opening song is a catchy one... but it still sounds like your typical mainstream J-Rock with female lead vocals." ...|$|E
500|$|Homer's chants and his {{nickname}} [...] "Dancin' Homer" [...] is {{a reference to}} American baseball fan Wild Bill Hagy, who earned the nickname [...] "The Roar from Thirty-Four" [...] for his chants during the 1970s in section thirty-four at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. Homer spells out Springfield just like Hagy spelled O-R-I-O-L-E-S with his arms. A drunk Homer performs his first dance to the 1961 tune [...] "Baby Elephant Walk" [...] written by Henry Mancini. Bleeding Gums Murphy makes a 26-minute-long performance of the [...] "Star-Spangled Banner" [...] at the game where Homer performs his first dance. Homer's line, [...] "Today, as I leave for Capital City, I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> the luckiest mascot {{on the face of}} the earth" [...] that he says in his farewell speech to the Springfield fans, is a reference to Lou Gehrig's farewell speech in the 1942 baseball film The Pride of the Yankees. The song [...] "Capital City" [...] that Bennett sings over the closing credits is a parody of the 1980 song [...] "New York, New York".|$|E
500|$|Discussing his beliefs, in 2009 Ebert {{wrote that}} he did not [...] "want to provide a {{category}} for people to apply to [...] " [...] because he [...] "would not want [...] convictions reduced to a word", and stated, [...] "I have never said, although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist, an agnostic, {{or at the very least}} a secular humanist– which I am". In the same blog entry, he also said [...] "I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking how? I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer." [...] In March 2013, he wrote: [...] "I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born." [...] He also stated: [...] "I <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> Catholic, lock, stock and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God. I refuse to call myself an atheist however, because that indicates too great a certainty about the unknowable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The first I {{have often}} told you. <b>Considering</b> <b>myself</b> {{sufficiently}} incongruous on my legal eminence, I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny. You know M. R. F., {{but not as}} well as I do. If you knew him as well as I do, he would amuse you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Furnished {{with such}} {{additional}} evidence as these documents afforded, I <b>considered</b> <b>myself</b> to be sufficiently {{prepared for a}} consultation with Mr. Kyrle, and Marian wrote accordingly to mention my name to him, and to specify the day and hour at which I requested to see him on private business.|$|R
5000|$|I {{went there}} {{in search of}} marvels; I saw the forest and the land and looked for marvels, but found none. I came back as a fool and went as a fool. I went as a fool and came back as a fool. I sought foolishness and <b>considered</b> <b>myself</b> a fool.|$|R
