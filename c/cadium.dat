40|$|The {{thin film}} CdTe based solar cells have the {{potential}} for high efficiency and have been investigated for 40 years due to their variations in flexibility in manufacturing technology, rapid deposition, and an excellent match to the solar spectrum. Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) is a promising thin film photovoltaic (PV) material due to its near ideal bandgap of ? 1. 5 eV and its high optical absorption coefficient. The typical CdTe thin film solar cell was a substrate configured with a window layer (CdS). The gold (Au) was used as an absorber (CdTe) and a back contact. Both semiconductor films, CdS and CdTe, were deposited by high vacuum evaporation at room temperature, and deposited on glass substrates with fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) front contact. The back contact was made to enhance carriers flow from CdTe layer to the electrode. The structure and morphology of the prepared cells were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) top views and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) cross-section. The XRD of the prepared films showed a polycrystalline of <b>cadium</b> sulphide and <b>cadium</b> telluride structure with peaks at 2 ? = 26. 54 o and 23. 71 o, respectively.

Commercially available silver 110 m Ag was used to study silver uptake and depuration in rainbow trout and European eel. Quality control by means of comparative � and � counting brought our attention to a contamination of the 110 m Ag stock with 109 Cd, which could be seen only because the 109 Cd was markedly bioconcentrated by trout gills. The contamination could not be detected in eel gills or in other tissues of both species. The difference between trout and eel gill structure and function is the probable explanation for the marked difference in 109 Cd accumulation. This contamination was identified as 109 Cd by � spectroscopy and its origin by transmutation of natural silver as a result of neutron activation is described. Failure to recognize this contamination problem would have resulted in serious misinterpretation of the data set. Guidance for avoiding this problem is given.

40|$|The media {{used for}} {{dispersion}} {{have a significant}} effect on the photoluminescent (PL) efficiency of colloidal CdSe nanocrystals, in addition to synthetic parameters. The investigated dispersion media were water-insoluble hexanes (Hex), toluene (Tol), chloroform (CHCl 3), and water-miscible tetrahydrofuran (THF); in addition, a water-THF mixture (25 %, weight), a tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) -Hex mixture (25 %, weight), and a TOP-THF mixture (25 %, weight) were also explored as dispersion media. Solvent-dependent equilibriums affect the number of surface-adsorbed molecules available for surface passivation and the removal of surface ligands, with both concentration and additives (such as TOP) and time playing a role, so that PL intensities can either be enhanced or diminished depending on the detailed conditions. Moreover, an enhancement is not possible at low concentrations of nanocrystals after days of storage, as dissociation of the surface ligands plays a major role and leads to the formation of the other fluorescent species causing baseline uprising.

The element which caused the greatest soil pollution was copper. A strong variation in pH values was observed in the analysed soils (ranging from acid to alkaline reactions). The pH of most of the soils was ≥ 5. 6. The conducted studies formed the basis for determining the initial isoline of the areas which exceeded the legal standards for soil quality in the discussed area.

40|$|Although {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} solely with nuclear magnetic resonance, {{it may be}} divided into two parts. One part deals with a series of measurements on the NMR parameters of several pure metal powders, namely aluminium, cadmium, niobium and vanadium, and in particular the effect on their resonance spectra of rapid macroscopic sample rotation at the 'magic angle'. The other part relates measurements of spin-lattice relaxation time as a function of temperature for the three solid cuprous halides. By spinning at high speeds a significant narrowing of the resonance lineshape has been achieved in the case of <b>cadium</b> and aluminium. This has enabled precise determinations of their isotropic Knight shifts to be made. For cadmium the width of the residual symmetric central spectrum has been used to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of the indirect electron coupled exchange interaction. Complete narrowing of the aluminium resonance line requires rotation rates in excess of 8 kHz. To this end it has been necessary to develop a new rotor system capable of carrying small metal samples at extremely high spinning rates. In connection with the work on aluminium, pure powder specimens have been prepared which exhibit values of second moment and dipolar relaxation time that agree well with theory. This is in contradiction to the results obtained from filed powders and those recorded by all other workers. Below room temperature the form of the T 1 results obtained from the cuprous halides is in accord with the theory of Raman quadrupole relaxation. However theoretical T 1 values, as derived from the simple Raman two-phonon mechanism in an ionic crystal lattice, fail to give quantitative agreement with experiment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The ionic {{conductance}} mechanisms underlying {{action potential}} behavior in GH 3 and GH 4 /C 1 rat pituitary tumor cell lines {{were identified and}} characterized using a patch electrode voltage-clamp technique. Voltage-dependent sodium, calcium, and potassium currents and calcium-activated potassium currents {{were present in the}} GH 3 cells. GH 4 /C 1 cells possess much less sodium current, less voltage-dependent potassium current, and comparable amounts of calcium current. Voltage-dependent inward sodium current activated and inactivated rapidly and was blocked by tetrodotoxin. A sloweractivating voltage-dependent inward calcium current was blocked by cobalt, manganese, nickel, zinc, or <b>cadium.</b> Barium was substituted for calcium as the inward current carrier. Calcium tail currents decay with two exponential components. The rate constant for the slower component is voltage dependent, while the faster rate constant is independent of voltage. An analysis of tail current envelopes under conditions of controlled ionic gradients suggests that much of the apparent decline of calcium currents arises from an opposing outward current of low cationic selectivity. Voltage-dependent outward potassium current activated rapidly and inactivated slowly. A second outward current, the calcium-activated potassium current, activated slowly and did not appear to reach steady state with 185 -ms voltage pulses. This slowly activating outward current is sensitive to external cobalt and cadmium and to the internal concentration ofcalcium. Tetraethylammonium and 4 -aminopyridine block the majority of these outward currents. Our studies reveal a variety of macroscopic ionic currents that could {{play a role in the}} initiation and short-term maintenance of hormone secretion, but suggest that sodium channels probably do not make a major contribution.

The synthetic approach involved the addition of a TOPSe/TOP solution into a CdO/TOP solution with or without TOPO at one temperature and subsequent growth at a lower temperature. The temporal evolution of the optical properties, namely, absorption and luminescence, of the growing nanocrystals was monitored in detail. A comprehensive examination on the control of the photoluminescence (PL) properties was performed by systematically varying the TOP/TOPO weight ratio of the reaction media. Surprisingly, a rational choice of 100 % TOP or 80 % TOP was found to produce "quality" nanocrystals when monitored under the present experimental conditions and growth-time scale. The term "quality" is mainly based on the sharp features and rich substructure exhibited in the absorption spectra of the growing nanocrystals, as well as the sharp features in the emission spectra with narrow full width at half-maximum (fwhm). There are two distinguishable stages of growth: an early stage (< 5 min) and a later stage. TOP {{plays a major role in}} the control of a slow growth rate in the early stage, while TOPO controls slow growth in the later stage. The optical sensitivity of the growing nanocrystals when dispersed in nonpolar or polar solvents was studied, including two size-dependent parameters, namely, the solvent sensitivity (PL intensity) and nonresonant Stokes shift (NRSS). The insights gained from the present study enable a synthetic approach in which high-quality CdSe nanocrystals are achieved with high synthetic reproducibility.

40|$|This paper uses an {{economic}} framework {{to investigate the}} depletion of heavy metal absorption capacity of soil. Specifically, the Hotelling model for the allocation of exhaustible resources across time is applied to <b>Cadium</b> deposition onto agricultural soil in the Rhine basin. The Hotelling model requires {{a knowledge of the}} resource as well as the demand function for the resource. The resource of absorption capacity is limited because above a certain Cd concentration in soil agriculture is not allowed; accumulation of Cd above this maximum acceptable soil concentration is not allowed. The demand function for absorption capacity corresponds to the cost function of avoiding deposition of heavy metals. According to the Hotelling model calculations, 0. 2 DM should be spent to avoid the deposition of 1 kg Cd at a discount rate of 5 % and 600 DM at 1 %. The optimal level of Cd control expenditure increases at the discount rate. The paper also presents a modified Hotelling model that takes the replenishment of the resource by removal of heavy metals from the soil (leaching and plant uptake) into account. Using a simple donor-controlled outflow model of Cd behavior in soil and a residence time of 1000 years, the optimal initial expenditure level for Cd control in the Rhine basin is determined to be 0. 0006 DM/kg (3 % discount rate). For the Katowice district, the optimal level is 20 DM/kg. A net input of Cd into the soil of the Rhine basin is allowed for 400 years in the Rhine basin and for 200 years in Katowice. This paper finds the modified Hotelling model to be a useful heuristic for understanding the time dimension of absorption capacity; specific recommendations cannot be derived, however, because they depend on tenuous inputs such as the cost curve for pollution control, the discount rate, and the maximum acceptable soil concentration...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Slow ionic {{currents}} {{were measured}} in the rat omohyoid muscle with the three-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Sodium and delayed rectifier potassium currents were blocked pharmacologically. Under these conditions, depolarizing test pulses elicited an early outward current, followed by a transient slow inward current, followed in turn by a late outward current. The early outward current {{appeared to be a}} residual delayed rectifier current. The slow inward current was identified as a calcium current on the basis that (a) its magnitude depended on extracellular calcium concentration, (b) it was blocked by the addition of the divalent cations <b>cadium</b> or nickel, and reduced in magnitude by the addition of manganese or cobalt, and (c) barium was able to replace calcium as an inward current carrier. The threshold potential for inward calcium current was around- 20 mV in 10 mM extracellular calcium and about- 35 mV in 2 mM calcium. Currents were net inward over part of their time course for potentials up to at least + 30 mV. At temperatures of 20 - 26 °C, the peak inward current (at ^- 0 mV) was 139 ± 14 AA/cm 2 (mean ± SD), increasing to 226 ± 28 uA/cm 2 at temperatures of 27 - 37 °C. The late outward current exhibited considerable fiber-to-fiber variability. In some fibers it was primarily a time-independent, nonlinear leakage current. In other fibers it appeared to be the sum of both leak and a slowly activated outward current. The rate of activation of inward calcium current was strongly temperature dependent. For example, in a representative fiber, the time-to-peak inward current for a + 10 -mV test pulse decreased from ^ " 250 ms at 20 °C to 100 ms at 30 °C. At 37 °C, the time-to-peak current was typically ^- 25 ms. The earliest phase of activation was difficult to quantify because the ionic current was partially obscured by nonlinear charge movement. Nonetheless, at physiological temperatures, the rate of calcium channel activation in rat skeletal muscle is about five times faster than activation of calcium channels in frog muscle. This pathway may be an important source of calcium entry in mammalian muscle...|$|E

Glass slides and capillaries were functionalized with hydrophobic dieneophiles resulting in a non-wetting surface. A retro Diels-Alder reaction facilitated by the thermal treatment of the surface’s function to cleave the hydrophobic dieneophile and resulted in the fabrication of a hydrophilic surface. Contact angle (CA) measurements were used as preliminary measurements for monitoring the changes in surface energy exhibited during the initial hydrophobic state (CA - 70 ± 3 °), after attachment of the dieneophile creating a hydrophobic state (CA - 101 ± 9 °) followed by reestablishment of the hydrophilic state (CA - 70 ± 6 °) upon cleavage of the Diels-Alder adduct. The treatments developed on flat glass surfaces were transferred to glass capillaries, with effective treatment confirmed by fluid column measurements. Effective flow gating {{was developed in the}} capillaries via patterning of the surface with hydrophilic/hydrophobic regions. Finally, attempts to create self-pressurizing capillaries were unsuccessful due to pronounced contact angle hysteresis for the hydrophobic surface treatment. Indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrates were functionalized with successive surface intiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) and electropolymerization. A novel hybrid styrenic/thiophene monomer (ProDOT-Sty) was synthesized and employed in the polymerization events.

40|$|Modelling of {{atmospheric}} transport of heavy metals emitted from Polish power sectorMany {{studies have been}} conducted to investigate the atmospheric heavy metals contamination and its deposition to ecosystems. The increasing attention to mercury pollution has been mainly driven by the growing evidence of its negative impacts on wildlife, ecosystems and particularly human health. Lead and <b>cadium</b> are also toxics which are being emitted into the atmosphere by anthropogenic as well as natural sources. The harmful influence of these three heavy metals was underlined in the Aarhus Protocol on Heavy Metals of 1998. The Parties of this protocol (including Poland) are obligated to reduce emissions, observe the transport and the amounts of lead, mercury and cadmium in the environment. Poland {{is one of the biggest}} emitter of mercury, lead and cadmium in Europe mainly due to emission from coal combustion processes. Therefore in Poland, research efforts to study the heavy metals emission, atmospheric transport, concentration and deposition are extremely important. The objectives of this work were twofold:•The practical objective was to develop and run a model to represent the atmospheric dispersion of mercury and to implement it in the air quality modelling platform Polyphemus. •The scientific objective was to perform heavy metals dispersion studies over Europe and detailed studies of the impact of the polish power sector on the air quality regarding mercury, cadmium and lead. To meet the declared aim, a new mercury chemical model was implemented into the Polyphemus air quality system. The scientific literature was reviewed regarding mercury chemistry and mercury chemical models. It can be concluded that the chemistry of mercury is still not well known. The models also differ in the way of calculating the dry and wet deposition of mercury. The elemental gaseous mercury ambient concentrations are evenly distributed, on the contrary, high variations in the spatial gradients of reactive gaseous and particulate forms of mercury air concentrations and deposition fluxes were noted. This study shows that many components of the developed model have crucial impacts on the results. In the model of mercury chemistry, the most effective pathway in the gaseous phase are the oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury by hydroxyl radical, ozone and most of all bromine oxide radicals, while in the aqueous phase the reduction reactions of elemental mercury dominate. These reactions have a crucial influence on the mass balance of reactive mercury, but a rather low influence on gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). In this model, dry deposition of gaseous elemental mercury is the prevailing process for removing mercury from the atmosphere. Dry deposition of GEM over land is equally distributed, due to almost uniform ambient concentrations. The relatively high dry deposition flux of gaseous elemental mercury has a huge influence on the presented results and differs significantly from other models where the dry deposition of GEM is often not taken into account. It was also shown that a change in the calculation of the scavenging coefficients or representative raindrop diameter for in-cloud scavenging has a significant impact on the amount of wet deposited mercury. The detailed results show that the Polish power sector can be responsible for up to 80 % of wet deposited mercury near large emission sources. The contribution from national sources over whole Poland reaches 21 % during the winter heating season when large quantities of coal are burned in the domestic sector and additionally the power sector activity is at its highest. The impact of emissions of cadmium and lead from the power sector is lower compared to the obtained results for mercury. The modelling results showed maximal impacts of 30 % and 10 % for cadmium and lead near large power sector sources on the ambient concentrations and deposition. Wider measurements of heavy metals are very much neede...|$|E
