5000|$|In June 2003, {{the company}} was one of ten firms which {{simultaneously}} entered into a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Office of the New York State Attorney General and various other securities regulators, regarding undue influence over each firm's research analysts by its investment-banking divisions. Specifically, regulators alleged that the firms had improperly associated <b>analyst</b> <b>compensation</b> with the firms' investment-banking revenues, and promised favorable, market-moving research coverage, in exchange for underwriting opportunities. The settlement, known as the [...] "global settlement", provided for total financial penalties of $1.4 billion, including $80 million against Lehman, and structural reforms, including a complete separation of investment banking departments from research departments, no <b>analyst</b> <b>compensation,</b> directly or indirectly, from investment-banking revenues, {{and the provision of}} free, independent, third-party, research to the firms' clients.|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} recent regulatory {{efforts to}} proscribe undisclosed {{conflicts of interest}} beyond mere scalping, including ownership interests in recommended securities, and the <b>compensation</b> connection between <b>analysts</b> and investment bankers within a firm. Part III of this article traces the history of prior cases imposing liability on industry participants, including investment advisers, analysts and others, for failing to disclose their conflicts of interest when recommending securities. Part IV of this article then examines {{the question of whether}} analysts have any civil liability to those relying on their recommendations for failure to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest. Finally, the author concludes that, in light of the new regulations, analysts should be liable to investors for their undisclosed conflicts of interest...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{regulations}} designed to address the potential conflict of interest that arises when sell-side analyst research is not independent of investment banking. We focus on two types of regulation: (1) internal barriers between equity research and investment banking that restrict communication; and (2) disclosure requirements relating to <b>analyst</b> <b>compensation.</b> We find that information barriers can increase research effort and improve report quality by limiting an investment bank's ability to distort its analyst's incentives. However, this type of regulation can also reduce information production and lower the quality of reports if an investment bank benefits directly from research activity. Disclosure requirements, on the other hand, unambiguously lead to more informative prices and a higher report quality relative to either information barriers or no regulation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} effect of market analysts’ expectations of share prices (price targets) on executive compensation. It examines how well the estimated effects of price targets on compensation fit with two competing views on determining executive compensation: the arm’s length bargaining model, which assumes that a board seeks to maximize shareholders’ interests, and the managerial power model, which assumes that a board seeks to maximize managers’ compensation (Bebchuk et al. 2005). The first chapter documents the pattern of CEO pay from fiscal year 1996 to 2010. The second chapter analyzes the Institutional Broker Estimate System Detail History Price Target data file, which that reports analysts’ price targets for firms. I show {{that the number of}} price target announcements is positively associated with company share price’s volatility, that price targets are predictive of changes in the value of stocks, and that when analysts announce positive (negative) expectations of future stock price, share prices change in the same direction in the short run. The third chapter analyzes {{the effect of}} price targets on executive compensation. I find that analysts' price targets alter the composition of executive pay between cash-based compensation and stock-based <b>compensation.</b> When <b>analysts</b> forecast a rise (fall) in the share price for a firm, the compensation package tilts toward stock-based (cash-based) compensation. The substitution effect is stronger in companies that have weaker corporate governance. The fourth chapter explores the effect of the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002 and its reinforcement in 2006 on the options granting process. I show that the introduction of SOX and its reinforcement eliminated the practice of backdating options but increased “spring-loading” of option grants around price targets announcements. Overall, the dissertation shows that price targets provide insights into the determinants of executive pay in favor of the managerial power model...|$|R
40|$|Ronald Masulis. I also {{appreciate}} seminar {{participants at}} Vanderbilt University. I gratefully acknowledge the data Using {{a database of}} stock recommendations with extensive coverage of brokerage firms and individual analysts, I examine the performance of portfolios recommended by individual analysts. The analysis allows a more accurate me asurement of analyst performance with extensive risk adjustments. The study shows that portfolios that equally weigh those portfolios recommended by individual analysts generate significant abnormal returns, for both buy and sell recommendations. Individua lly, about 10 % of analysts significantly outperform risk-adjusted benchmarks in their buy recommendations; 6 % of analysts significantly outperform in their sell recommendations. About 3 % of analysts significantly underperform benchmarks for buys or sells. Abnormal performance is generated mainly within a narrow event window from the recommendation date to five trading days later, with no significant return drift thereafter. In addition, analyst performance is predictable according to their characteristics such {{as the number of}} recommendations they issue, the size of their brokerage firms, and the number of stocks covered. Surprisingly, the all-star ranking of Institutional Investor does not have much power in predicting analyst performance. In addition, although the II all-star ranking is significantly related to both risk-adjusted performance and raw return performance, its capacity to serve as a performance-based evaluation system for <b>analyst</b> <b>compensation</b> is quite limited. The ranking is affected more by recognition factors and reputation factor...|$|R
40|$|Generally {{every company}} will {{always try to}} {{increase}} its productivity. The purposes of its productivity are to increase material efficiency, reduce cost of production and optimizing time output. One of indication on increasing effective and efficient work productivity is spirit of work. High spirit of work will increase its productivity because the employer will do their job well so the job will be finished faster and better. Beside that right compensation will make the employer will have their work with high motivation and it will give benefit to the company. According to topic above, purpose of this experiment are to <b>analyst</b> of <b>compensation</b> effect to productivity of work, analyst the spirit of work effect to productivity of work and also to <b>analyst</b> <b>compensation</b> effect {{and the spirit of}} work effect to productivity of work. We collect data from 67 respondents of P. T. Organik Alam Lestari. We use probability sampling method. The analyzing method are quantitative and qualitative analyst. We use statistic analyst including correlation analyst, regression and also hypothesis. Hypothesis that we used is there are positive impact between independent variable and dependent variable, partially and collectively. The result, there are strong correlation (0, 587) between compensation (X 1) and work productivity (Y). From “Z” result, we find that Zhitung > Ztabel (2, 75 > 1, 96) and the conclusion is compensation variable (X 1) give positive effect and significant to work productivity variable (Y). From second hypothesis we get value 0, 637, that means there are strong correlation between spirit of work variable (X 2) and work productivity (Y) and also Zhitung > Ztabel (5, 52 > 1, 96). The conclusion is spirit of work variable (X 2) give positive effect and significant to work productivity variable (Y). we can prove that the hypothesis is a truth...|$|R
