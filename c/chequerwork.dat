[...] The bottom band contains round-headed arches, the middle band has a series of chevrons, and the top band has various crosses, <b>chequerwork</b> patterns and other decorations. It has similarities of design and style with the font at St Peulan's Church, Llanbeulan.

500|$|The {{most notable}} {{feature of the}} church is its font, which dates from the late 12th century, or {{possibly}} even {{the first part of the}} 11th century. It measures [...] by [...] (external measurements) and is [...] deep. [...] It is rectangular and decorated on three sides. One of the shorter sides has a cross with four arms of equal length imposed on a ring; at the base are two small hemispheres, and the design is framed with bands (some plain, some decorated with chevrons or a twisted rope pattern). It has been suggested that the hemispheres are bee skeps. One of the longer sides has a row of arches forming an arcade above a pattern of lozenges. [...] The other shorter side has a <b>chequerwork</b> pattern. The archeologist David Petts has noted that it is one of a number of fonts on Anglesey that has an area with little or no carving, perhaps because it was never anticipated that the plain side of the font would be seen or because the font was carved after being put in its position in the church. Although similar in style to other Anglesey fonts, its rectangular shape is [...] "unique", according to Petts, and the cross on one side [...] "finds no parallels among fonts of this period." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § XXIV. These capitals, called barbarous by our architects, {{are without}} {{exception}} the most subtle pieces of composition in broad contour which I {{have ever met}} with in architecture. Their profile is given in the opposite Plate X. fig. 3, b; the inner line in the figure being that of the stone behind the lily, the outer that of the external network, taken through {{the side of the}} capital; while fig. 3, c is the outer profile at its angle; and the reader will easily understand that the passing of the one of these lines into the other is productive of the most exquisite and wonderful series of curvatures possible within such compass, no two views of the capital giving the same contour. Upon these profoundly studied outlines, as remarkable for their grace and complexity as the general mass of the capital is for solid strength and proportion to its necessary service, the braided work is wrought with more than usual care; perhaps, as suggested by the Marchese Selvatico, with some idea of imitating those [...] "nets of <b>chequerwork</b> and wreaths of chainwork" [...] on the chapiters of Solomon's temple, which are, I suppose, the first instances on record of an ornamentation of this kind thus applied. The braided work encloses on each of the four sides of the capital a flower whose form, derived from that of the lily, though as usual modified, in every instance of its occurrence, in some minor particulars, is generally seen as represented in fig. 11 of Plate VIII. It is never without the two square or oblong objects at the extremity of the tendrils issuing from its root, set like vessels to catch the dew from the points of its leaves; but I do not understand their meaning. The abacus of the capital has already been given at a, Plate XVI., Vol. I.; but no amount of illustrations or eulogium would be enough to make the reader understand the perfect beauty of the thing itself, as the sun steals from interstice to interstice of its marble veil, and touches with the white lustre of its rays at mid-day the pointed leaves of its thirsty lilies.|$|E

The east window has a pointed arch, and two lights with Y-tracery. The north wall contains a blocked round-headed window pierced with a lancet, which is also blocked, a single-light window, and a two-light window with Y-tracery. [...] The north doorway is more ornate than the south, also with two orders of shafts, but six orders in the arch and more detailed decoration.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in Runcorn sandstone with ashlar dressings and a tiled roof. Its architectural style {{is that of}} the late Decorated period. The plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a two-bay chancel with a north chapel and a south two-storey vestry and organ chamber, and a southwest tower. The tower is in five stages with octagonal buttresses at each corner, which rise above the parapet to form turrets with conical caps. The parapet is embattled. The doorway is {{on the south side of}} the tower, and above it is a four-light window. There are clock faces in the fourth stage, and the bell openings in the top stage have four lights. Above each bell opening is a statue in a canopied niche. On the south side of the church the windows have four lights, while those on the north side have three lights.
