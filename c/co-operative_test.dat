In the study, the relationship between attitudinal factors, language use, self-assessment of Spanish proficiency, and second language retention was examined Subjects were 38 immersion graduates, and 20 currently enrolled Grade 6 immersion students. The Modern Language Association (MLA) <b>Co-operative</b> <b>Test</b> of Spanish and a 63 -item questionnaire designed to obtain information about opportunities to use Spanish, interest in foreign languages, parental encourage-ment, and ethnocentrism were administered to all subjects. Results indicated that some language loss occurred soon after the formal learning situation was terminated. Significant differences between MLA scores of students with continued formal exposure to Spanish and those who had discontinued Spanish, however, did not develop until high school At the high school level, significant differences across all four skills (writing, speaking, reading, and listening) were found with the greatest losses occurring in the productive skills...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{evaluation}} of potential new cultivars of barley in western Canada, 10 malting quality traits are assessed, at multiple sites in multiple years, on the most advanced malting lines in the <b>co-operative</b> <b>testing</b> system. These traits include thousand kernel and test weight, percent plump (over a 2. 3 mm screen), percent crude protein, percent malt extract, percent soluble wort protein, diastatic power, level of alpha amylase and beta-glucans, and wort viscosity. Breeders focus on improvement of these traits, which are under quantitative genetic control and are the major characteristics in the improvement of malt quality (Bertholdsson, 2004). The above malting traits are under both genetic control and environmental influence. For this reason, breeders estimate the likelihood and rate of genetic gain using (broad-sense) heritability (H 2; Strickberger, 1968). Although H 2 has been estimated for malting quality traits {{in a wide range}} of environments (Bertholdsson, 2004), there is little information on heritability of malting quality traits for (western) Canadian malting barley cultivars, including overlapping U. S. cultivars grown in the Northern Great Plains, and tested in western Canada. Using data from the western Canadian co-operative barley trials from 2001 to 2005, a total of 120 genotypes were assessed for 10 malting quality traits in 32 environments. Broad-sens...|$|R
40|$|A <b>co-operative</b> <b>testing</b> {{program is}} in {{progress}} between the Langley Research Center (NASA) and the National Aeronautical Establishment (NAE, Canada) to validate two different techniques of airfoil testing at transonic speeds. The procedure employed is to test the same airfoil model in the NAE two-dimensional tunnel and the Langley 0. 3 -m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (0. 3 -m TCT). The airfoil model used in testing was CAST- 10 - 2 /DOA- 2 super-critical airfoil. The Langley 0. 3 -m TCT has a relatively small cross section of 13 in x 13 in, giving a (h/c) ratio of 1. 44 for the same 9 in chord model. The approach employed in the 0. 3 -m TCT aims towards eliminating the wall effects by using active walls. The top and bottom walls are flexible. By changing the wall shapes during a test in an iterative manner, the wall interference effects are reduced. The method employed to change the wall shapes is the adaptive wall technique. The current test program provided an opportunity to validate the adaptive wall technique in the 0. 3 -m TCT. The relatively long chord airfoil represents a severe test case to test {{the efficacy of the}} adaptive wall technique under cryogenic conditions. The program also involved removal of side wall boundary-layer thus increasing the complexity of the wall adaptation technique. This paper deals with some salient results obtained regarding repeatability of test data and possible residual interference effects...|$|R

The studies were designed to appraise the specificity of immune serum prepared in horses against five representative prototype enteroviruses (poliovirus 1, coxsackieviruses A 9 and B 3, and echoviruses 4 and 11). Tests for neutralizing antibody were performed not only against the homologous viruses, but also against a battery of heterotypic picornaviruses, comprising 63 enteroviruses, several rhinoviruses, and three reoviruses. Each serum sample represented a pool of the individual bleedings taken from groups of five or six horses before and after immunization with each virus antigen (except echovirus 4, for which three animals were immunized). The results showed that, whereas the homologous titres of the antisera (poliovirus 1, coxsackieviruses A 9 and B 3, echoviruses 4 and 11) were found to be within a useful range (700 - 8000), heterotypic antibodies of significant titre were not detected. All corresponding pre-inoculation sera were negative. The specificity of the haemagglutination-inhibiting antibody of the coxsackievirus B 3 and echovirus 11 antisera was also demonstrated. This accumulated information {{played a major role in}} a decision to prepare in horses antisera to the rest of the enterovirus group. <b>Co-operative</b> <b>testing</b> of the other enterovirus equine antisera is now in progress...|$|R

The studies were designed to appraise the specificity of immune serum prepared in horses against 16 representative prototype enteroviruses (polioviruses 2 and 3, coxsackieviruses A 7, B 1, B 2, B 4, B 5 and B 6 and echoviruses 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12 and 17). Tests for neutralizing antibody were performed not only against the homologous viruses but also against the homotypic strains available in each laboratory. Tests for heterotypic antibody were made against the entire group of enteroviruses, reoviruses 1 - 3 and adenoviruses 1 - 11, 13 and 17. Each serum sample represented a pool of the individual bleedings taken from a group of horses before and after immunization with each virus antigen. The results showed that the homologous geometric mean titres of the immune sera ranged from 7000 to 36 000, whereas the preinoculation sera were negative. Results of the homotypic tests showed the usefulness of the sera. The specificity of the haemagglutination-inhibiting antibody of the sera against coxsackieviruses A 7, B 1, B 5, B 6 and echoviruses 3, 7, 12 was demonstrated.

The studies were designed to appraise the specificity of the immune serum of horses inoculated with prototype enteroviruses (coxsackie-viruses A 1, A 5, A 6, A 12 and A 22 and echoviruses 5, 6, 13 - 16, 18 - 20, 22 - 26, 29 and 32). Tests for neutralizing antibody were performed not only against the homologous viruses but also against regional homotypic strains. Tests for heterotypic antibody were made against the entire group of enteroviruses (except enterovirus 68), reoviruses 1 - 3, and adenoviruses 1 - 11, 13 - 17 and 19 - 22. Final vials of the dried serum were provided for the tests. Each serum sample represented a pool of the individual bleedings taken from a group of horses before and after immunization with each virus antigen. The results showed that the homologous geometric mean titres of 9 of 16 echovirus immune sera were 10 000 or above while the other 7 ranged from 2000 to 8000. The homologous antibody titre of one coxsackievirus type A serum was about 2000 while the titres of the other 4 type A sera ranged from about 5000 to 15 000. All corresponding pre-inoculation sera were negative. The results of the homotypic tests, though limited in number, showed the usefulness of the sera.

40|$|An {{important}} goal of software testing {{is to achieve}} at least high structural coverage. To reduce the manual efforts of producing such high-covering test inputs, testers or devel-opers can employ tools built based on automated structural test-generation approaches. Although these tools can easily achieve high structural coverage for simple programs, when they are applied on complex programs in practice, these tools face various problems, such as (1) the external-method-call problem (EMCP), where tools cannot deal with method calls to external libraries; (2) the object-creation problem (OCP), where tools fails to generate method-call sequences to produce desirable object states. Since these tools cur-rently could not be powerful {{enough to deal with}} these prob-lems in testing complex programs in practice, we propose <b>co-operative</b> developer <b>testing,</b> where developers provide guid-ance to help tools achieve higher structural coverage. To re-duce the efforts of developers in providing guidance to tools, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Covana, which precisely identifies and reports problems that prevent the tools from achieving high structural coverage primarily by determining whether branch statements containing not-covered branches have data dependencies on problem can-didates. We provide two techniques to instantiate Covana to identify EMCPs and OCPs. Finally, we conduct evalua-tions on two open source projects to show the effectiveness of Covana in identifying EMCPs and OCPs...|$|R
2500|$|Gardner {{says that}} cranks have two common characteristics. The first [...] "and most important" [...] {{is that they}} work in almost total {{isolation}} from the scientific community. Gardner defines the community as an efficient network of communication within scientific fields, together with a <b>co-operative</b> process of <b>testing</b> new theories. This process allows for apparently bizarre theories to be published — such as Einstein's theory of relativity, which initially met with considerable opposition; it was never dismissed {{as the work of}} a crackpot, and it soon met with almost universal acceptance.

40|$|Faulhaber's (1975) {{concept of}} {{cross-subsidization}} is of crucial importance for regulatory activities. Its basic idea that customers demanding a good should not {{pay more than}} they would if they "stood alone" is a fundamental fairness rule which can be applied by independent regulators in infrastructure industries. In reality, however, regulators frequently do not restrict the pricing policy of a regulated firm to zero profits due {{to the influence of}} politicians and pressure groups or, in the case of state-owned firms, because of a mandate to generate profits to reduce the state's budget deficit. They approve of prices generating positive economic profits. In this case, Faulhaber's (1975) concept is not applicable. We develop a less restrictive concept of cross-subsidization which can be applied when regulators are not independent and allow firms to make non-zero profits. We generalize the usual stand-alone and incremental cost tests to the case when regulated firms make positive profits, and provide an equivalence result for the (generalized) stand-alone cost (GSAC) test and the (generalized) incremental cost (GIC) <b>test.</b> <b>Co-operative</b> Game Theory, Cost Allocation, Cross-subsidization, Incremental Cost Test, Stand-alone Cost test,...|$|R
40|$|For the {{evaluation}} of adhesive bonds, a variety of non-destructive testing methods is known. Nevertheless, {{there is still a}} demand for improved quantitative characterization of bond quality. Furthermore, in service, adhesively bonded joints are subjected to complex combinations of mechanical and environmental loads, which are not covered by conventional failure and life prediction models. In a <b>co-operative</b> project, wedge <b>test</b> specimens, thick adherent specimens for shear strength determination, and bulk specimens were manufactured in order to investigate three different adhesives, a commercial epoxy adhesive and two model adhesives, a two component and a one component epoxy adhesive, respectively. Before and after combined mechanical and environmental loading, the samples were examined with ultrasonic non-destructive techniques by IZFP. In order to understand the damage mechanisms, the adhesives were analysed via IR spectroscopy by one of the project partners. The wedge test samples were made of 3 mm thick stainless steel substrates with 0. 3 mm thick adhesive layers. They were aged at 60 °C in water immersion and at 60 °C in dry air. In addition, they were loaded mechanically by wedge insertion. Two sets of wedge test samples were imaged in situ during the ageing process by high-frequency ultrasonic microscopy at 25 MHz and at 50 MHz. To this end, a special set-up was developed allowing ultrasonic imaging in immersion in water at controlled temperatures up to 60 °C. By evaluation of the ultrasonic data, the crack propagation was imaged during the ageing process. As shown here, the final crack front detected non-destructively by ultrasound agreed to the optical fracture image taken after destruction of the samples. In addition, the ultrasonic data are discussed with respect to the damage mechanisms in comparison to the IR spectroscopic findings...|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{environment}} has been changing dramatically {{during the recent}} years. Plenty of new requirements and problems such as the IPv 4 address shortage, traversing middle boxes and mobility that cannot be solved with the current Internet architecture have emerged. Among those problems, the IPv 4 address exhaustion is {{recognized as one of}} the key challenges in the original Internet design. The reason is the unprecedented growth in the number of user devices and regular network nodes which are addressed with IPv 4 locators. Several solutions including Network Address Translator (NAT) and IPv 6 (a new version of IP) have been proposed to alleviate the scalability problem. NAT postpones the depletion of the IP address space by reusing the IPv 4 address space and isolating customer networks from the public network; it makes hosts in the private address space unreachable from the public Internet. To be exact, a NAT, like a strict firewall, filters out all inbound data flows while outbound traffic from private hosts can go through it. The proposed NAT traversal techniques by IETF have many disadvantages. The Customer Edge Switching aims to replace NAT with a new device called co-operative firewall and eliminate the problems of existing NAT traversal solutions. A CES device provides global connectivity over the Internet using different types of identifiers, global unique domain names and private addresses. In this thesis, Customer Edge Traversal Protocol (CETP) is introduced as an edge-to-edge protocol and prototyped so as to tunnel data and control information while transporting the source and destination IDs from one customer network to another. This work also includes the policy management of <b>co-operative</b> firewalls. The <b>testing</b> results assure the suitability of CETP for inter-CES communication and edge-to-edge signaling...|$|R
