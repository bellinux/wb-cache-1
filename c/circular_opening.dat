5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a <b>circular</b> <b>opening.</b> This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the mouth, an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|The speech bubble {{makes the}} entire canvas {{relevant}} by broadening {{the attention to}} the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, {{there is reason to}} describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending a finger through a <b>circular</b> <b>opening,</b> which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin.|$|E

In the western musical tradition, the most usual shape is a cylinder, although timpani, for example, use bowl-shaped shells.

25|$|These capped fatty {{deposits}} (now called 'atheromas') produce {{enzymes that}} cause the artery to enlarge over time. As long as the artery enlarges sufficiently {{to compensate for the}} extra thickness of the atheroma, then no narrowing ("stenosis") of the opening ("lumen") occurs. The artery becomes expanded with an egg-shaped cross-section, still with a <b>circular</b> <b>opening.</b> If the enlargement is beyond proportion to the atheroma thickness, then an aneurysm is created.|$|E
25|$|Pillbox {{formed by}} a metal turret, {{which could be}} rotated through a full 360 degrees, set above a steel and brick-lined pit.

According to the manufacturer, it was suitable for Vickers, Bren, Hotchkiss or Lewis machine guns in either a ground defence or anti-aircraft role, or a Boys anti-tank rifle or rifle grenade for ground defence. Weapon change requires selection of appropriate bracket. The army did not favour the design - most were installed at airfields.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the structural behaviour of RC beams with <b>circular</b> <b>openings</b> of different sizes and locations modelled using ABAQUS FEM software. Seven RC beams with the dimensions of 1200 mm× 150 mm× 150 mm were tested under three-point loading. Group A consists of three RC beams incorporating <b>circular</b> <b>openings</b> with diameters of 40 mm, 55 mm and 65 mm in the shear zone. However, Group B consists of three RC beams incorporating <b>circular</b> <b>openings</b> with diameters of 40 mm, 55 mm and 65 mm in the flexural zone. The final RC beam {{did not have any}} openings, to provide a control beam for comparison. The results show that increasing the diameter of the openings increases the maximum deflection and the ultimate failure load decreases relative to the control beam. In the shear zone, the presence of the openings caused an increase in the maximum deflection ranging between 4 % and 22 % and a decrease in the ultimate failure load of between 26 % and 36 % compared to the control beam. However, the presence of the openings in the flexural zone caused an increase in the maximum deflection of between 1. 5 % and 19. 7 % and a decrease in the ultimate failure load of between 6 % and 13 % relative to the control beam. In this study, the optimum location for placing <b>circular</b> <b>openings</b> was found to be in the flexural zone of the beam with a diameter of less than 30 % of the depth of the beam...|$|R

25|$|The front {{facade of}} the {{residence}} consists of eye-catching peach and white brick masonry and stucco front porch with a main arched balcony crowned by a female face. A second, smaller, arched entrance is the main entryway into the porch and house. Early 1900s ironworks gracefully separate the front porch from the front street sidewalk. The front doors of the house are wooden louvered characteristic of the middle-to-late 19th century. A circular front wall wind hole with decorative molding accentuates the porch; another smaller <b>circular</b> <b>opening</b> decorates high above the archway into the porch. The interior consists of nine rooms, a long, sunny, lateral hallway with multiple wooden veneer shutters, and an external cobble-stone foyer leading to the back courtyard.|$|E

This massive space, flanked by four huge arched windows made from yellow Belgian glass, contains the unique marble Historical Frieze which is an intrinsic part of {{the design of the}} monument. It is the biggest marble frieze in the world. The frieze consists of 27 bas-relief panels depicting the history of the Great Trek, but incorporating references to every day life, work methods and religious beliefs of the Voortrekkers. The set of panels illustrates key historical scenes starting from the first voortrekkers of 1835, up to the signing of the Sand River Convention in 1852.

25|$|A Snyder {{column is}} an {{extremely}} effective air-cooled column used in selected fractional distillations. It is a single glass tube {{with a series of}} circular indentations/restrictions in the walls of the cylinder (e.g., 3 or 6) in which rest, inverted, the same number of roughly tear-shaped, hollow, sealed glass stoppers; above each point where an inverted tear-shaped stopper rests, the cylinder has further Vigreux-type indentations, in this case serving to limit how high the glass stopper can be raised (by vapor flow) above its resting place, where, when not raised, it seals the <b>circular</b> <b>opening</b> created by the circular indentation. These floating glass stoppers act as check valves, closing and opening with vapor flow, and enhancing vapor-condensate mixing. A standard application of Snyder columns, is as the condenser/fractionation column above a Kuderna-Danish concentrator, used to efficiently separate a low boiling extraction solvent such as methylene chloride from volatile but higher boiling extract components (e.g., after the extraction of organic contaminants in soil).|$|E

25|$|The {{pollution}} that {{is associated}} with death has to be handled carefully. A separate part of the home is designated to house the corpse for funeral proceedings before being taken away. The priest comes to say prayers that are for the cleansing of sins and to affirm the faith of the deceased. Fire is brought to the room and prayers are begun. The body is washed and inserted clean within a sudre and kusti. The ceremony then begins, and a circle is drawn around the body into which only the bearers may enter. As they proceed to the cemetery they walk in pairs and are connected by white fabric. A dog is essential in the funeral process because it is able to see death. The body is taken to the tower of death where the vultures take care of it. Once the bones are bleached by the sun the bones are pushed into the <b>circular</b> <b>opening</b> in the center. The mourning process is four days long, and rather than creating graves for the dead, charities are established in honor of the person.|$|E
