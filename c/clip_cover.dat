40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: Endoscopic {{resection}} {{is the cornerstone}} of endoscopic treatment of esophageal high grade dysplasia or early cancer. Endoscopic resection is, however, a technically demanding procedure, which requires training and expertise. The aim of the current study was to prospectively evaluate efficacy and safety of the first 120 endoscopic resection procedures of early esophageal neoplasia performed by six endoscopists (20 endoscopic resections each) who were participating in an endoscopic resection training program. Patients and methods: The program consisted of four tri-monthly 1 -day courses with lectures, live-demonstrations, hands-on training on anesthetized pigs, and one-on-one hands-on training days. Gastroenterologists from centers with multidisciplinary expertise in upper gastrointestinal oncology participated, together with an endoscopy nurse and a pathologist. Outcome measures were complete endoscopic removal of the target area and acute complications. Results: A total of 120 consecutive esophageal endoscopic resection procedures (85 ER-cap, 35 multiband mucosectomy [MBM]) were performed by six endoscopists: 109 in Barrett's esophagus, 11 for squamous neoplasia; 85 piecemeal endoscopic resections (median 3 specimens, interquartile range 2 - 4 specimens). Complete endoscopic removal was achieved in 111 / 120 cases (92. 5 %). Six perforations occurred (5. 0 %) : five were effectively treated endoscopically (<b>clips,</b> <b>covered</b> stent), and one patient underwent esophagectomy. There were 11 acute mild bleedings (9. 2 %), which were managed endoscopically. Perforations occurred in ER-cap procedures performed by four participants (7. 1 % ER-cap vs. 0 % MBM; P = 0. 18), and in 1. 7 % of the first 10 endoscopic resections and 8. 3 % of the second 10 endoscopic resections per endoscopist (P = 0. 26). Conclusion: In this intense, structured training program, the first 120 esophageal endoscopic resections performed by six participants were associated with a 5. 0 % perforation rate. Although perforations were adequately managed, performing 20 endoscopic resections may not be sufficient to reach the peak of the learning curve in endoscopic resectio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{field of}} interventional {{cardiology}} continues to progress quickly. The efficacy of percutaneous interventions with newer generation drug-eluting stents has advanced a lot {{over the last}} decade.

Major improvements continue {{in the field of}} medical co-therapy such as antiplatelet therapies (bivalirudin, prasugrel, and ticagrelor) and this will further improve outcomes of PCI. The same is true for intravascular imaging such as ultrasound IVUS and optical coherence tomography OCT. However, interventional cardiology has become a rather broad field, also including alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, etc. At the moment, the fastest growing area is the structural interventions, especially for aortic valve stenosis (transcatheter aortic valve implantation TAVI) and for mitral regurgitation (mitral <b>clipping).</b> This review <b>covers</b> recent advances in all these different fields of interventional cardiology...|$|R
5000|$|A {{crocodile}} clip (also alligator clip or spring clip) is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws {{which is used}} for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets {{its name from the}} resemblance of its jaws to that of an alligator's or crocodile's. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded clothespin, the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a spring to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4 mm female banana jack, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit.

5000|$|The design {{dates to}} 1880s with the Danish Forsøgsrekylgevær (Self Loading rifle M.1888), meaning [...] "trial recoil rifle", being a {{precursor}} design.

The rifle used a non-removable stripper clip that used gravity to feed rounds to the action; when the gun was not in use one could fold the <b>clip</b> down to <b>cover</b> the opening. The rifle used the 8×58RD cartridge, first in black-powder {{and then in a}} much more powerful smokeless powder version. The design was not successful. An improved design in 1896 gave the rifle an enclosed, but still gravity-fed, magazine. This version saw some 50-60 rifles being produced, but they were only issued to the Danish navy for use by coastal fortifications troops.|$|R

40|$|Among cool-season turfgrasses {{tall fescue}} shows the best {{adaptation}} to the Italian climate. Many turf type cultivars have been recently released and management practices consequently should be adapted. The purpose of the research was to evaluate, in a tall fescue turf, soccer playing characteristics and quality of recent cultivars maintained at low mowing height. The trial {{was carried out in}} Pisa (Italy), “Arminda” and “Safari” cultivars were mowed at 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 cm.

Ball rebound, traction, penetration resistance and hardness were also measured as playing quality parameters for soccer. Both cultivars showed an adaptation to low mowing height with an increased shoot density and a finer leaf texture. Hardness and ball rebound were significantly affected by mowing heights, highest values being recorded for the lowest mowing heights. Nevertheless a good playing quality was measured for all the plots.

40|$|Plant {{production}} and soil microbial biomass (SMB) in grassland ecosystems are linked by flows of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) {{between the two}} groups of organisms. In native mixed grasslands of the southern Great Plains, these cycles are strongly influenced by climate. They may also be modulated by the timing and intensity of disturbances such as fire and clipping. We assessed the relative influence of climate and disturbance on plant community and soil C and N dynamics. Combined effects of fire and clipping were assessed in a 2 x 3 factorial design including spring fire and light clipping or continuous clipping. Seasonal fire effects were evaluated in a one-way analysis incorporating spring and fall fire in unclipped plots. Plant cover and biomass (by functional type), litter mass, SMB C and N, soil density fraction concentration and composition, soil organic C, total N, and inorganic N, soil temperature and moisture, soil respiration, and net N mineralization were measured at monthly intervals. C 4 grasses were unaffected by fire or clipping, probably as a result of summer drought in both studyyears. <b>Clipping</b> reduced <b>cover</b> of C 3 annual grasses but increased that of C 3 perennials, resulting in no net change in C 3 grass biomass. Fire did not affect C 3 grass cover or biomass. Both fire and clipping reduced litter mass. This was reflected in seasonal declines in SMB C in fire treatments, suggesting that the primary input of microbial C in this ecosystem occurs by decomposition of current-season plant litter. Litter removal offers a single mechanism by which fire-induced increases in soil temperature and reductions in light soil density fraction concentration, soil moisture, and net N mineralization rates may be explained. Lack of treatment effects on soil respiration rates suggest that plant roots represent {{an important component of the}} plant-soil C cycle, not quantified in this research. Overall, treatment effects were relatively minor compared to seasonal climate-related changes in response variables, particularly in light of repeated summer drought...|$|R

We test the use of digital photography as a more accurate and repeatable method. We assessed the digital photography method on four forage grassland species (Pseudoroegneria spicata, Festuca campestris, Poa pratensis, Achnatherum richardsonii). Digital photos of 2 -dimensional cutout silhouettes of three bird species sharp-tailed grouse, western meadowlark and savannah sparrow were used to model the impact of clipping (i. e., grazing) on visual cover. In addition, photos of artificial voles were used to model litter on cover available to small mammals. Nine sites were sampled and data were analyzed by the dominant grass species in each study plot. Regression analysis showed that digital photos (r 2 ¼ 0. 62) were a better predictor than the Robel pole (r 2 ¼ 0. 26) for assessment of <b>cover.</b> <b>Clipping</b> heights showed that clipping at less than 15 cm left the silhouettes 50 % exposed.

Also we acknowledge the closing of the cystic duct. We analyzed the medical records of 15251 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed during 1994 - 2015, with emphasis on: surgical technique, conversion rate, hemorrhage, postoperative bile leaking, iatrogenic MBD injuries and mortality. We divided the cases in 5 study groups, group 1 (1994 - 2004) N= 5138, group 2 (2005 - 2015) N= 10113, group 3 (fundus first cholecystectomies, N= 2348), group 4 (retrograde cholecystectomies, N= 12889) and group 5 (subtotal laparoscopic cholecystectomy-SLC, N= 14) which we compared regarding the main parameters. We prefer to perform a “step by step” clipping each time the length of the <b>clip</b> does not <b>cover</b> all the circumference of the cystic duct. This artifices, is a simple laparoscopic gesture easy to perform and has the advantage of avoiding a large excessive and risky laparoscopic dissection {{in the vicinity of the}} main biliary duct. More seldom we appeal to the suture of the cystic stump using the intracorporeal knots or a simple stump ligation with an extracorporeal preformed not. We did not encounter any late or early complications following the implementation of this technical laparoscopic artifice.
