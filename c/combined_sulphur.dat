40|$|A certain {{proportion}} of DRI produced in India is consumed for the steel production through the induction furnace route which provides for slag metal separation actuated by a mere melting of the DRI without any purification reactions. Government of India, {{owing to the}} poor quality of steel produced from DRI through the induction furnace route has stipulated that, steel to be marketed must contain less than 0. 085 % of <b>combined</b> <b>sulphur</b> and phosphorous. Therefore the DRI producing companies are initiating a method of dephosphorizing the steel produced from the induction furnace route. The present work is an attempt at dephosphorizing the steel produced in the induction furnace route from DRI which is high in phosphorous (upto 0. 096 % are common). A neutral lining is provided in the induction furnace and double slagging {{by the addition of}} Calcium Aluminate, Calcium Barium Aluminate and Barium Aluminate is adopted.

The active material is reduced in fuel rich parts of the boiler and oxidized in air rich parts. Advantages could be achieved such as new mechanisms for oxygen transport in space and time.

From an operational point of view, manganese ore worked excellently. From the temperature profile of the boiler it can be concluded that fuel conversion was facilitated, especially in the dense bottom bed. The effect did not always translate to reduced emissions, which suggests that final combustion in the cyclone outlet was also influenced. Substituting 10 % of the sand bed with manganese ore made it possible to reduce the air to fuel ratio without generating large amounts of CO. The use of 100 % manganese ore resulted in higher emissions of CO than the sand reference, but, when <b>combined</b> <b>sulphur</b> feeding, dramatic reductions in CO emissions, up to 90 % compared to sand reference, was achieved...|$|E

First of all, he takes this ore, with its impurities, and mixes it (as {{he finds it}} {{essential}} and best) with its own weight of sulphuret of lead--lead <b>combined</b> with <b>sulphur.</b> Both the lead and the sulphur are wanted; for the iron that is there present, as you see by the table, {{is one of the}} most annoying substances in the treatment that you can imagine, because it is not volatile; and while the iron remains adhering to the platinum, the platinum will not flow readily. It cannot be sent away by a high temperature--sent into the atmosphere so as to leave the platinum behind. Well, then, a hundred parts of ore and a hundred parts of sulphuret of lead, with about fifty parts of metallic lead, being all mingled together in a crucible, the sulphur of the sulphuret takes the iron, the copper, and some of the other metals and impurities, and combines with them to form a slag; and as it goes on boiling and oxidising, it carries off the iron, and so a great cleansing takes place.|$|R

Organic apple growers are highly dependent {{on the use of}} sulphur, lime sulphur and copper fungicides to control apple scab. Whereas only elemental sulphur is permitted for scab control in organic apple production in Denmark, and in addition lime sulphur in The Netherlands, copper fungicides are used in organic production in many European countries. However, the use of copper fungicides in the EU is now being phased out (EU Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2092 / 91) and alternative fungicides for control of apple scab and other diseases in other crops are increasingly needed. As part of the EU project REPCO (Replacement of Copper Fungicides in Organic apple and grapevine production in Europe, 2003 - 7) we are prospecting for plant extracts and other materials, including resistance inducers, to be used for apple scab control in organic fruit production.

CuxS films, 70  nm thick, are deposited on glass substrates by vacuum thermal evaporation from a Cu 2 S:S (50 : 50  wt. %) sulphur rich powder mixture. The as-deposited highly conductive crystalline CuS (covellite) films show high carrier concentration (∼ 1022  cm− 3), low electrical resistivity (∼ 10 − 4  Ω cm) and inconclusive p-type conduction. After the mild post-annealing, these films display increasing values of resistivity (∼ 10 − 3 to ∼ 10 − 2  Ω cm) with annealing time and exhibit conclusive p-type conduction. An increase of copper content in CuxS phases towards the semiconductive Cu 2 S (chalcocite) compound with annealing time is reported, due to re-evaporation of sulphur from the films. However, the latter stoichiometry was not obtained, which indicates the presence of vacancies in the Cu lattice.

Eskom’s coal-fired power stations in South Africa comprised 92. 8 % of the total electricity produced in 2010 / 2011 (Eskom, 2011). Trace amounts of mercury {{can be found in}} coal, mostly <b>combined</b> with <b>sulphur,</b> and can be released into the atmosphere upon combustion. Coal-fired electricity generation plants are the highest contributors to mercury emissions in South Africa. A major factor affecting the amount of mercury emitted into the atmosphere is the type and efficiency of emission abatement equipment at a power station. Eskom employs particulate emission control technology at all its currently operating coal-fired power stations, and new power stations are being built with sulphur dioxide abatement technology. A co-beneficial reduction of mercury emissions exists {{as a result of the}} implementation of emission control technology. The amount of mercury emitted from each of Eskom’s coal-fired power stations is calculated, based on the amount of coal burnt and the mercury content in the coal. Emission reduction factors are taken into consideration to reflect the possible co-benefit received from the installed particulate control technologies at the stations. Estimates are provided for different scenarios where the current technology is replaced or additional emission control technology is added to the existing technology.

On completion of Eskom’s emission reduction plan, which includes fabric filter plant retrofits at two and a half stations and a flue gas desulphurisation retrofit at one power station, total mercury emissions from the fleet will potentially be reduced by 6 - 13 % by 2026 relative to the baseline. Mercury emission reduction is perhaps currently not the most pressing air quality problem in South Africa. While the focus should then be on reducing emissions of other pollutants which have a greater impact on human health, mercury emission reduction can be achieved as a co-benefit of installing other emission abatement technologies.

While substantial reductionsof S and/or N are needed to reach CL at Dlugi Staw, only minor reductions are needed to obtain CL-level at Zielony Staw. Based on a nitrogen saturation index, both watersheds are in chronec stages of N-saturation. As long as the inputs of acid compounds are high, episodes particularly related to spring melt, may cause chemical conditions critical for aquatic life even at Zielony Staw with high acid neutralising capacity (ANC). This is primarily because the outlet streams might be totally dominated by melt water during such episodes, which means that organisms living in these streams have small changes to avoid episodes with extreme water quality. Because of far higher ANC at Zielony Staw, such episodes are both more uncommon and less extreme at this site compared with at Dlugi Staw.

In order to separate the hydrate from the soluble sulphur, the mixed precipitate in washed by dialysis until it is neutral to litmus, and dried in a vacuum at the ordinary temperature until the weight is constant; the yellow mass thus obtained is powdered, sifted through silk, again dried in a vacuum, and finally extracted with carbon disulphide, which dissolves 51. 6 per cent. of the total mass. The residual sulphur hydrate, S 8,H 2 O, when compressed into cylinders, has a sp. gr. 1. 9385 at 19 °/ 4 °, loses its water at 80 °, and has a slight vapour pressure at the ordinary temperature, the powdered substance losing 2. 41 per cent. and the compressed substance 1. 33 per cent. when kept over sulphuric acid for 205 days. The partially dried powder contains 3. 1 per cent. and the compressed substance 5. 8 per cent. of sulphur soluble in carbon disulphide. If, however, the hydrate consisted of octahedral <b>sulphur</b> <b>combined</b> with water, the amount of soluble sulphur in the partially dried powder would be 35. 186 per cent.; it is probable, therefore, that the hydrate is derived from an amorphous unstable variety of sulphur which is transformed slowly under ordinary conditions, and more rapidly under pressure, into soluble sulphur.

60|$|The Unknown.--With {{the highest}} {{respect for the}} memory of Dr. Black, and for the opinion of his disciple, I shall answer the {{arguments}} I have just heard. I will not allow any facts or laws from the action of dead matter to apply to living structures; the blood is a living fluid, and of this we are sure {{that it does not}} burn in respiration. The terms warmth and cold, as applied to the blood of animals, are improper in the sense in which they have been just used; all animals are, in fact, warm-blooded, and the degrees of their temperature are fitted to the circumstances under which they live, and those animals, the life of which is most active, possess most heat, which {{may be the result of}} general actions, and not a particular effect of respiration. Besides, a distinguished physiologist has rendered it probable that the animal heat depends more upon the functions of the nerves than upon any result of respiration. The argument derived from change of colour is perfectly delusive; it would not follow if carbon were liberated from the blood that it must necessarily become brighter; <b>sulphur</b> <b>combining</b> with charcoal becomes a clear fluid, and a black oxide of copper becomes red in uniting with a substance which abounds in carbon. No change in sensible qualities can ever indicate with precision the nature of chemical change. I shall resume my view, which I cannot be said to have fully developed. When I stated that carbonic acid was formed in the venous blood in the processes of life, I meant merely to say that this blood, in consequence of certain changes, became capable of giving off carbon and oxygen in union with each other, for the moment inorganic matter enters into the composition of living organs it obeys new laws. The action of the gastric juice is chemical, and it will only dissolve dead matters, and it dissolves them when they are in tubes of metal as well as in the stomach, but it has no action upon living matter. Respiration is no more a chemical process than the absorption of chyle; and the changes that take place in the lungs, though they appear so simple, may be very complicated; it is as little philosophical to consider them as a mere combustion of carbon as to consider the formation of muscle from the arterial blood as crystallisation. There can be no doubt that all the powers and agencies of matter are employed in the purposes of organisation, but the phenomena of organisation can no more be referred to chemistry than those of chemistry to mechanics. As oxygen stands in that electrical relation to the other elements of animal matter which has been called electropositive, it may be supposed that some electrical function is exercised by oxygen in the blood; but this is a mere hypothesis. An attempt has been made founded on experiments on the decomposition of bodies by electricity to explain secretion by weak electrical powers, and to suppose the glands electrical organs, and even to imagine the action of the nerves dependent upon electricity; these, like all other notions of the same kind, appear to me very little refined. If electrical effects be the exhibition of certain powers belonging to matter, which is a fair supposition, then no change can take place without their being more or less concerned; but to imagine the presence of electricity to solve phenomena the cause of which is unknown is merely to substitute one undefined word for another. In some animals electrical organs are found, but then they furnish the artillery of the animal and means of seizing its prey and of its defence. And speculations of this kind must be ranked with those belonging to some of the more superficial followers of the Newtonian philosophy, who explained the properties of animated nature by mechanical powers, and muscular action by the expansion and contraction of elastic bladders; man, in this state of vague philosophical inquiry, was supposed a species of hydraulic machine. And when the pneumatic chemistry was invented, organic structures were soon imagined to be laboratories in which combinations and decompositions produced all the effects of living actions; then muscular contractions were supposed to depend upon explosions like those of the detonating compounds, and the formation of blood from chyle was considered as a pure chemical solution. And, now that the progress of science has opened new and extraordinary views in electricity, these views are not unnaturally applied by speculative reasoners to solve some of the mysterious and recondite phenomena of organised beings. But the analogy is too remote and incorrect; the sources of life cannot be grasped by such machinery; to look for them in the powers of electro-chemistry is seeking the living among the dead: that which touches will not be felt, that which sees will not be visible, that which commands sensations will not be their subject.|$|R
