40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of freely accessible <b>consultation</b> <b>hours</b> in secondary schools by youth health care departments, on population rates for suicide and parasuicide. To this end, an ecologic case-referent study design was used, with data from the Netherlands Bureau of Statistics, the National Hospital Discharge Register, the High-School Students Study, the youth health care departments in the Netherlands and relevant census. Cases were 137 suicide victims aged 15 – 19 y and 182 12 – 18 y old subjects admitted to hospital because of parasuicide and additionally coded as having had surgery as a consequence of the attempted suicide or having a pertinent psychiatric disorder. The relevant census in the regions of the participating youth health care departments served as referents. The High-School Students Study included 4997 students aged 12 – 18 y of which 303 reported having attempted suicide at least once. In the ecologic case-referent studies the adjusted Odds Ratio for completed suicide in regions with open <b>consultation</b> <b>hours</b> was 0. 98 (95 % CI 0. 69 – 1. 38) and the weighted Odds Ratio for parasuicide was 1. 30 (95 % CI 0. 97 – 1. 75). Analysis of the data of the High-School Students Study resulted in an Odds Ratio of 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 72 – 1. 26). The overall homogeneous Odds Ratio for (para) suicide in regions with open <b>consultation</b> <b>hours</b> for all three studies was 1. 00 (95 % CI 0. 97 – 1. 04); the heterogeneous Odds Ratio was 1. 08 (95 % CI 0. 95 – 1. 09).

The first scenario allows for a remote version of the usual consultation, but allows all participants to operate from their current location, removing the need for traveling. In the second scenario, the teacher is working on MS and notices that some students are learning on a specific slideset. Due to the text chat or some other form of notification, the teacher notices that there is an interesting discussion going on. Therefore, the teacher decides to join the discussion and invites the student to an audio session to discuss the problem in detail.

40|$|Background In {{this study}} {{the effect is}} {{assessed}} of (repeated) well-care visits and freely accessible <b>consultation</b> <b>hours</b> at secondary schools on the prevalence of adolescent health-compromising behaviour and later obesity. Methods An ecological case-referent study design was used with data from the Netherlands Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Defence, the 1992 High-School Student Study, all youth health care departments in The Netherlands and relevant census. Data from the High-School Student Study included 4569 students aged 12 - 18 years, of whom 4167 had answered all questions on health-compromising behaviour and eating habits. The data from the Ministry of Defence included 1004 cases with a body mass index greater than 27 {{of a total of}} 12 251 male conscripts. The census of 18 - and 19 -year-old males in the regions of the relevant youth health care departments served as referents. Results Except for the use of alcohol, the effect of more well-care visits was in all cases negative, and for the use of tobacco even significantly so [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 15, 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) = 1. 01 - 1. 33]. The availability of open <b>consultation</b> <b>hours</b> had an adverse effect on use of alcohol (OR = 1. 29, 95 per cent CI = 1. 11 - 1. 50). The OR for obesity in male conscripts showed an adverse effect of a greater number of well-care visits (OR = 2. 46, 95 per cent CI = 1. 74 - 3. 46) and the availability of open <b>consultation</b> <b>hours</b> (OR = 1. 97, 95 per cent CI = 1. 72 - 2. 25).

40|$|The {{workload}} {{of general}} practitioners (GPs) is usually {{defined in terms}} of the number of hours worked (divided in time spent on different practice tasks), rates of contact (office consultation and home visit rates) and length of consultations. They are influenced by two groups of factors: demand-related influences and supply-related influences. Demand-related influences refer to the list sizes of GPs and the composition of the practice population. Supply-related influences refer to the way GPs themselves manage their workload. In this article the relative influence of demand- and supply-related variables on the workload of Dutch GPs is assessed. The data for this analysis has been collected as part of the Dutch National Survey of Morbidity and Interventions in General Practice. We draw on four data sources: a three months recording of all contacts between GPs and their patients, a census of the practice population of the GPs, a mailed questionnaire among GPs and a one week diary kept by the GPs. The population consists of 168 GPs. The number of hours spent by GPs on practice activities is mainly determined by demand-related characteristics. List size and the percentage of elderly on the list are positively related to the time spent on direct patient care. Running a free flow <b>consultation</b> <b>hour</b> is the only factor on the supply side with an additional effect. GPs supervising a trainee and those with a larger percentage of elderly and publicly insured patients on their list spent more hours on other activities such as practice administration, deliberation and reading medical literature. List size and the percentage of elderly on the list have a negative influence on the office contact rate, while the percentage of low educated patients on the list and the number of practice secretaries per GP have a positive impact. Furthermore, GPs without a free flow <b>consultation</b> <b>hour</b> and those working in health centres tend to have smaller office contact rate than the others. Home visit rates are smaller when the practice secretaries provide a higher percentage of consultations in the practice, in single handed practices and in the case of female GPs. However, the percentage of elderly on the list is the main determinant of the home visit rate. The average length of consultations is not substantially affected by either supply- or demand-related characteristics. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

This study {{is part of a larger}} study into the nationwide implementation of meeting centers in the Netherlands. The data gathered on the basis of questionnaires shows that, although the support offer is almost identical on the interregional level, there are differences in terms of initiator(s), type of location, frequency of discussion groups and monthly meeting for all participants, background of staff members, number of volunteers and structural funding. The people with dementia who use the meeting centers in the various regions do not differ significantly on sex, age, civil status, severity of dementia and physical invalidity. The family carers also exhibit more similarities than differences on the interregional level. In every region the majority of carers are female, married or cohabiting, and a minority are gainfully employed. They generally share a household with the person with dementia, or they live in the same municipality. In nearly all centers the majority of carers exhibit psychological and/or psychosomatic symptoms. In most regions participants make use of all elements of the support program (social club, discussion groups, informative meetings, <b>consultation</b> <b>hour).</b> The study shows that the support program based on the Amsterdam model meets general needs of people with dementia and their carers and is therefore generally applicable, but adaptive implementation is desirable...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of erectile dysfunction {{reported in the}} larger studies varies between 17. 8 % and 52 %. Accordingly, the erectile dysfunction {{is the second most}} sexual dysfunction related to men. The affected men are less satisfied with their sexual life than non-affected men and mention less often a high partnership-related life quality. This work elaborates on the partnership-related satisfaction of men who seek professional help in andrological <b>consultation</b> <b>hours</b> due to their erectile dysfunction {{as well as on the}} correlation between the severity of the disorder and the degree of partnership-related satisfaction. Another topic of the work was the question whether the psychological strain related to the disorder is correlated to the partnership-related satisfaction on an emotional level. For this purpose we interviewed n= 37 men over a period of seven months who visited the specialized andrological <b>consultation</b> <b>hours</b> at “Charité” (Berlin) and the “Klinikum am Urban” due to an erectile dysfunction. The survey was conducted via a cross sectional questionnaire which was based on an abbreviated version of the FSEV and the questionnaire “Ressources in Sexuality and Partnership”. We described the population of the survey by means of descriptive statistics in detail. In order to challenge the working hypothesis (H 1 = the severity of the disorder is correlated with the in-partnership satisfaction) we used the rank correlation coefficient by Kendall (Kendall Tau). The age of the participants varied between 33 and 76 years. 34 out of 37 participants lived in a permanent partnership during the survey. Only n= 4 men stated that they are “quite” to “very much” satisfied with respect to their sexual life while n= 27 men mentioned an emotional satisfaction related to their partnership. Thus, the majority of the help-seeking men lived in an emotionally stable partnership. Another result was a decreasing in-partnership satisfaction related to sexuality with increasing severity of the disorder. A connection between psychological strain and the partnership satisfaction related to the emotional level could not be found by mathematical means. It is well known that a medicamentous therapy in combination with a sexual therapy is a more promising treatment of erectile dysfunctions than a medicamentous therapy alone. In conclusion and in accordance with the findings of the present study that most help-seeking men mentioned a high emotional in-partnership satisfaction, the partnership itself should be increasingly used as resource during the therapeutically treatment...|$|E

40|$|Background: General Practitioners (GPs) can {{cope with}} {{workload}} by, among others, spending more hours in patient care or by spending less time per patient. The way GPs are paid {{might affect the}} way they cope with workload. From an economical point of view, capitation payment is an incentive to minimize the amount of work, contrary to a fee-for-service system, which makes more work remunerative. The main question {{of this study was}} ‘to what extent are the allocation of time and strategies to cope with workload affected by remuneration?’ The Dutch mixed system (until 2006) provides the opportunity to investigate the effects of both payment systems. Methods: 1) We carried out multilevel analyses (practice-level and GP-level) on four variables considering allocation of time: 2) Hours spent in patient care. 3) Booking-interval (scheduled time per patient on <b>consultation</b> <b>hour).</b> 4) Number of home visits. 5) Waiting time. Workload is measured as the number of contacts per week. Data origin from the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. This study was carried out between 2000 and 2002 among 104 practices, comprising 195 GPs. These GPs were representative for the Dutch population of GPs. Data were collected using questionnaires, diaries, and electronic medical files. The models were corrected for relevant case mix, GP, and practice characteristics. The percentage of patients for which GPs received a capitation payment varied from 42 to 91 %. Results: Booking-intervals turned out to be shorter when the workload was higher. Contrary to our expectations, this negative effect of workload became weaker when the proportion of patients for which GPs received a capitation payment was higher. Furthermore, significant effects were found for the number of elderly, ethnic minorities, urbanization, and practice type. Conclusions The way GPs cope with workload and allocate time seems to be more determined by the composition of their practice population and their organizational setting than the remuneration system.

40|$|Increasing {{cases of}} chronic {{diseases}} and {{a decrease of}} healthcare professionals are leading to time deficiencies in patient doctor communication on health issues during <b>consultation</b> <b>hours.</b> This has caused patients to suffer {{from a lack of}} understanding regarding their healthcare issues as well as raised actionability concerns for patients. Actionability is defined as the ability of patients to perform certain actions (taking drugs, going through treatments, etc.) that would benefit their healthcare problem. The deficiency of patients' actionability occurs when patients have little to no opinion regarding potential health care solutions, as caused by the unavailability of physicians. Because of this, a framework capable of capturing treatment options and related information from online sources (medical websites and reviewed biomedical articles) with the aid of several third party applications, such as MMTx (MetaMap Transfer), RapidMiner, and E-Utils package is proposed. It is hypothesized that the actionability gap can be filled by increasing patients' knowledge on their healthcare issues.

Results showed significant differences in means for all anthropometric indicators (p< 0. 0001), increased proportion of undernourished, overweight, and obese children, as well as a significant decrease of those with normal nutritional status. <b>Consultation</b> <b>hours</b> increased 27. 7 % and 41. 1 % for nutritionists and doctors, respectively. We concluded that the WHO standard represents more adequately optimum child growth, increases the proportion of children with nutritional excess and deficit leading lo enhanced nutritional attention by health professionals...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to assess the {{prospects}} and implementing continuous assessment (CA) in in higher education. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire from instructors and students of Adigrat University as well as Mekelle and Aksum Universities for comparison purpose. Both quantitative and qualitative data were carried out. Result of this study indicated that, instructors were not continuously collecting information about student progress, small number of assessment is used in courses and few instructors give feedback at all. Significant number of instructors and students had poor knowledge and negative attitude towards CA. Based on the results, it can be concluded and recommend that instructors need to use the results from CA as a means of identifying students ’ progress and thereby providing support. Accordingly, departments need to have strong documentation and reporting systems, the maximum and minimum numbers of students in a class need to be put at a standard level. In addition, concerned officials of the university need to closely examine the challenges. On the other hand, offering pre remedial classes on specific courses, putting tests on the exam banks, establishing and following student networking programs and peer learning groups, tutorial classes, providing <b>consultation</b> <b>hours,</b> ensuring classroom size, continuous assessment, encouraging students participation in the classroom and providing incentives for instructors had positive effect on academic performance...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the participation {{and acceptance of}} an intensivated surveillance program for women with high familial mamma- and ovarian-cancer risk. The results where compared with the recommendations developed by the German Consortium of hereditary Breast- and Ovarial cancer. We tested the feasability of the surveillance program and its acceptance in women. Women with risk for familial Breast- or Ovarian-carcinoma need an intensivated surveillance program. An intensivated program, including different imaging methods {{can lead to a}} an early tumor diagnosis and consequently reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients. The goal is a standardized surveillance program for women with heredetary breast- and ovariancarcinoma in specialized centers, where due to intersdisciplinary cooperation an optimal treatment is archieved. A total of 102 women, age 21 to 61 years, referred to the special <b>consultation</b> <b>hour</b> for familiar breast cancer at the obstretic and gynecology clinic, Charite-Campus Mitte where interviewed via phone. The prevention behaviour was compared with the recommendations for early recognition of the german consortium, developed for high risk patients. Also subjective risk assement, empiric estimated risk and psychological stress were objected. Only 34 (33, 3 %) women performed an optimal surveillance according to the recommendations of Schmutzler [60]. The majority performed irregular surveillance or did not take advantage of all diagnostic procedures. Women with extremely high familial breastcarcinoma exposition presented in 71, 4 % an insufficient or sufficient Surveillance. Women with a medium risk in familial breastcarcinoma performed optimal surveillance. Patients with high familial risk develop feelings of helplessless and loss of control. In contrast to patients with a low risk for familial breast carcinoma signs of rejection are predominant. Highest acceptance has the gynecological breast observation with 77, 5 %, Breast Ultrasound has the lowest acceptance. Even after consulatation and detailed information about the individual age specific risk for breast carcinoma the subjective personal risk was overestimated. This overestimation does not induce a intensivated surveillance. The high-risk women have to be encouraged to perform intensivated screening. Also the psychological distress has a srong influence on the precaution behaviour. The more psychological distress the women had, the worse the precaution behaviour and vice versa. Therefore it is necessary to consult high risk women more than once to convince them about the necessity of an intensivated regular surveillance program. A continuos medical, psycholigical and genetic support should be archieved. High quality standards of the surveillance methods should be archieved to contribute to the morbidity and mortality reduction...|$|R
40|$|Objektive: A {{pregnancy}} {{can influence}} {{the course of a}} rheumatic disease. Furthermore, the rheumatic disease can {{have an impact on the}} outcome of the pregnancy. In this study, we reviewed all pregnancies that were treated in a special <b>consultation</b> <b>hour</b> for pregnant women with rheumatic diseases at the Charité in Berlin between 2007 and 2014. Methods: The patients were identified by the diagnosis „high-risk pregnancy“ and then they were contacted in order to obtain an agreement to participate in the study. If a woman were treated for more than one pregnancy, each pregnancy was counted as a single case. Information on course and outcome of the pregnancy were collected retrospectively. Data were analysed descriptively in groups of diagnosis first and then each rheumatic diagnosis was analysed by his own. The results were compared with data from the literature. Results: The study included 59 patients for a total of 68 pregnancies. Pregnancies were divided by diagnosis into connective tissue diseases [K] (Systemic Lupus erythematosus n= 29, cutaneous Lupus erythematosus n= 7, Sjögren’s syndrome n= 6, Systemic Sclerosis n= 3, other connective tissue diseases n= 3), rheumatic joint diseases [G] (rheumatoid arthritis n= 6, juvenile idiopathic arthritis n= 3, psoriatic arthritis n= 2, ankylosing spondylitis n= 4, SAPHO syndrome n= 1) and 2 other diseases [S] (Cogan syndrome n= 1, sarcoidosis n= 1). Disease activity occurred most often in the second trimenon, there was an association with the discontinuation of an anti-rheumatic medication in the first trimenon. Live birth rate was 97 %. Mean birth weight and length were significantly smaller in group “K” than in group “G” (p= 0, 001). In the first 6 months after birth there occurred significantly more often disease activity in group “G” than in group “K” (p= 0, 001). Compared to all other diagnoses there occurred significantly more complications in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (p= 0, 020). In total complications occurred in 37, 9 % of all cases (except twin-pregnancies). They were abortions (n= 2), premature delivery (n= 12), small for gestational age (n= 5) and pregnancy related diseases (n= 14). 3 children born to women with a connective tissue disease had an affected development (autism spectrum disorder, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Conclusion: Despite of a high live birth rate there occurred a lot of complications in the studied pregnancies. Pregnancies in women with rheumatic diseases should therefore be treated closely by a rheumatologist in collaboration with an obstetrician...|$|R
40|$|Background: Appendicitis and splenic rupture are 2 rare {{complications}} of colonoscopy {{reported in the}} literature. To our knowledge splenic rupture following colonoscopy has been reported 17 times in the English-language literature and is associated with excess traction on the splenocolic ligament. Appendicitis after colonoscopy has been reported only 9 times and is usually associated with obstruction of the appendiceal lumen with fecal matter during colonoscopy. Methods: We present the case reports of 2 patients: a 76 -year-old woman who presented in <b>consultation</b> 24 <b>hours</b> after a routine colonoscopy with massive hemoperitoneum secondary to splenic rupture, seen on computed tomographic (CT) scan, who then underwent splenectomy; the second, a 60 -year-old male who presented {{to the emergency room}} 16 hours after colonoscopy with clinical and computed tomographic scan findings of acute appendicitis who underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy. Results: Treatment of both patients resulted in resolution of their complications, splenic rupture and appendicitis. They both had an uneventful postoperative course and are doing well several months postoperatively. Conclusions: We report 2 rare {{complications of}} colonoscopy, splenic rupture and appendicitis. In the setting of a recent colonoscopy and abdominal pain, a high index of suspicion is needed for their diagnosis...|$|R
