In addition, various plasmid-encoded cytokines modulate the immune system differently according to the delivery time.

CMC also reacted with NaOH from sodium silicate to form three water-insensitive solid reaction products, disodium glycolate salt, sodium glucosidic salt, and sodium bicarbonate. Other water-sensitive solid reaction products, such as sodium polysilicate and sodium carbonate, were derived from hydrolysates of sodium silicate. Dissolution of these products upon contact with water generated heat that promoted cement’s self-degradation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the {{formation}} of hierarchically self-assembled nanofiber films from amylose-grafted sodium <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>celluloses</b> (NaCMCs) that were synthesized by a chemoenzymatic approach. First, maltooligosaccharide primer-grafted NaCMCs were prepared by a chemical reaction using two kinds of NaCMCs with different degrees of polymerization (DPs) from Avicel and cotton sources. Then, phosphorylase-catalyzed enzymatic polymerization of α-d-glucose 1 -phosphate from the nonreducing ends of the primer chains on the products was conducted to produce the prescribed amylose-grafted NaCMCs. The films were obtained by drying aqueous alkaline solutions of the amylose-grafted NaCMCs. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the film fabricated from the material with the higher DP from the cotton source showed a clear, self-assembled, highly condensed tangle of nanofibers. The SEM image of the material with the lower DP from the Avicel source, on the other hand, showed an unclear nanofiber morphology. These {{results indicate that the}} DPs of the main chains in the materials strongly affected the hierarchically self-assembled nanofiber formation. The SEM images of the films after washing out the alkali, furthermore, showed that the fibers partially merged with each other at the interfacial area owing to the double helix formation between the amylose-grafted chains.

This paper reports testwork completed on fine particles of several solids, iron oxide, hydroxylapatite, galena and sphalerite, {{as well as}} on a relatively coarse quartz sample (- 75 + 38 μm).

The degree of flocculation and dispersion was determined by settling tests in 250 ml graduated cylinders. It was observed that flocculation of the fine hydrophilic particles significantly reduced their mechanical entrainment, while dispersion severely aggravated it.

40|$|Adsorption of anionic polyelectrolytes, sodium salts of <b>carboxymethyl</b> <b>celluloses</b> (CMCs) with {{different}} degrees of substitution (DS = 0. 9 and 1. 2), from aqueous electrolyte solutions onto regenerated cellulose surfaces was studied using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. The influence of both calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) and sodium chloride (NaCl) on CMC adsorption was examined. The QCM-D results demonstrated that CaCl(2) (divalent cation) caused significantly greater CMC adsorption onto regenerated cellulose surfaces than NaCl (monovalent cation) at the same ionic strength. The CMC layers adsorbed onto regenerated cellulose surfaces from CaCl(2) solutions exhibited greater stability upon exposure to flowing water than layers adsorbed from NaCl solutions. Both QCM-D and SPR results showed that CMC adsorption onto regenerated cellulose surfaces from CaCl(2) solutions increased with increasing CaCl(2) concentration up to the solubility limit (10 mM). Voigt-based viscoelastic modeling of the QCM-D data indicated that the CMC layers adsorbed onto regenerated cellulose surfaces had shear viscosities of eta(f) approximate to 10 (- 3) N. s. m(- 2) and elastic shear moduli of mu(f) approximate to 10 (5) N. m(- 2). Furthermore, the combination of SPR spectroscopy and QCM-D showed that the CMC layers contained 90 - 95 % water.

The application of vaporizable NH 4 OAc allows future use of the eluent system in two-dimensional separations employing evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD). The losses of samples during filtration and during the chromatographic experiment were determined. The scaling exponent as of the relation s 21 / 2 ~Mas was approx. 0. 61, showing that NaCMCs exhibit an expanded coil conformation in solution. No systematic dependencies of a s on DS were observed. The dependences of molar mass on SEC-elution volume for samples of different DS can be well described by a comm on calibration curve, which is of advantage, as it allows the determination of molar masses of unknown samples by using the same calibration curve, irrespective of the DS of the NaCMC sample. Since no commercial NaCMC standards are available, correction factors were determined allowing converting a pullulan based calibration curve into a NaCMC calibration using the broad calibration approach. The weight average molar masses derived using the so established calibration curve closely agree with the ones determined by light scattering, proving {{the accuracy of the}} correction factors determined...|$|R

CMEC, sodium bicarbonate and Povidone concentrations were included as independent variables. The tablets were prepared by direct compression method and were evaluated for in vitro buoyancy and dissolution studies. From the polynomial model fitting statistical analysis, it was confirmed that the response floating lag time and D 1 hr is suggested to quadratic model and t 90 is suggested to linear model. All the statistical formulations followed first order rate kinetics with non-Fickian diffusion mechanism. The desirability function was used to optimize the response variables, each having a different target, and the observed responses were highly agreed with experimental values. Statistically optimized formulation was characterized by FTIR and DSC studies and found no interactions between drug and polymer. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the model in the development of GRFDDS containing a propranolol HCl.
