5|$|Like most {{expansion}} teams, the Raptors {{struggled in}} their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft day trade in 1998, the team set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000, 2001, and 2002. <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> instrumental in leading the team to a then-franchise high 47 wins and their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, they failed to make significant progress, and <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets.|$|E

These works (including three known as the Ife marbles), were sent by Carter to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Chris <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} {{to write this}} episode based on an interest in dendrochronology, a subject that involves analyzing annual growth rings found in non-tropical tree species. Carter credits the episode's ominous ending with his experience {{growing up in the}} era following the Watergate scandal, having spent his life coming to mistrust the government profoundly.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned {{heavily on}} the {{platform}} that <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> weak on defense, citing the cancellation of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s. During this time Carter's defense secretary, Harold Brown, announced the stealth bomber project, apparently implying {{that this was the}} reason for the B-1 cancellation.|$|E

5|$|Thomas F. Wilson, {{known for}} playing the {{character}} Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future films, began his recurring role as policeman Stan Carter. In the comic books, Stan <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> a vicious serial killer {{by the name of}} Sin-Eater. Due to the show being for youth-oriented audiences, it is highly unlikely the series will make him the murdering alter-ego.|$|E
5|$|A Marvel One-Shot {{featuring}} Peggy <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> in {{the works}} for some time before Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the Captain America films. D'Esposito, co-president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to replicate the period setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film was a more ambitious production than previous One-Shots, with more action scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of Howard Stark.|$|E

5|$|California native Chris <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> {{given the}} {{opportunity}} to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, the Watergate scandal and the 1970s horror series , triggered the idea for The X-Files. He wrote the pilot episode in 1992.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> {{interested}} in the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in ancient mass extinctions on Earth and used these themes in the episode. Much of the episode was also inspired by Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ, and a scene showing an operation on Mulder has been thematically compared to the Crucifixion of Jesus. For the dream sequences, casting director Rick Millikan brought back many actors and actresses who had been absent from the show for several years, including Jerry Hardin as Deep Throat, Rebecca Toolan as Teena Mulder, and Megan Leitch as Samantha Mulder.|$|E
5|$|During her {{tenure in}} the World Wrestling Federation, {{she held the}} Women's Championship once, {{although}} {{she was not a}} trained wrestler. During the Armageddon pay-per-view in December 1999, she flashed her breasts in what was an early instance of intentional nudity in the WWF. After the event, she was shown nude several more times on other pay-per-views. She is also an ex-wife of wrestler and color-commentator Jerry Lawler, who quit the WWF after <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> released in early 2001 but returned after their divorce in July 2001. She currently works on the independent circuit under her real name.|$|E

5|$|The Carter {{administration}} {{years were}} difficult for Kennedy; {{he had been}} the most important Democrat in Washington ever since his brother Robert's death, but now <b>Carter</b> <b>was,</b> and Kennedy at first did not have a full committee chairmanship with which to wield influence. Carter in turn sometimes resented Kennedy's status as a political celebrity. Despite generally similar ideologies, their priorities were different. Kennedy expressed to reporters that he was content with his congressional role and viewed presidential ambitions as almost far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron <b>Carter,</b> <b>was</b> {{for the murder}} in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E

5|$|The season, which {{aired on}} ABC from January 6 to February 24, 2015, over 8 episodes, aired {{during the season}} two mid-season break of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Despite {{steadily}} dropping viewership, critical response to Agent <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> positive, with much praise going to Atwell's performance, the series' tone and setting, and its relative separation {{from the rest of}} the MCU. The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Writer and series creator Chris Carter {{decided that}} {{rather than trying to}} present a typical Bigfoot-like creature, he would present the Jersey Devil as a missing link. <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} to write the episode by an essay by E. O. Wilson regarding ants and a story he wrote that posed whether mankind was hellbent on its own extinction. The concept of mankind being carnivores and eating its own tail evolved into the idea of using an evolutionary mutation that was a throwback to the Neanderthal. A Greg Cannom werewolf outfit from a previous project was used for the costume of the creature.|$|E
5|$|Agent <b>Carter</b> <b>was</b> filmed {{over five}} days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E
