50|$|The {{combination}} of DOS and hardware (810, 1050 and XF551 disk drives) for Atari 8-bit floppy usage allows sectors numbered from 1 to 720. The DOS's 2.0 disk bitmap {{provides information on}} sector allocation, counts from 0 to 719. As a result, sector 720 cannot be written to by the DOS. Some companies used a copy-protection scheme where hidden data was put in sector 720 that cannot be copied through the DOS <b>copy</b> <b>option.</b> Another more-common early copy-protected scheme simply does not record important sectors as allocated in the FAT, so the DOS Utility Package (DUP) does not duplicate them. All of these early techniques were thwarted by the first program that simply duplicated all 720 sectors.|$|E

Direct3D 11.1 includes new feature level 11_1, which brings minor updates to the shader language, such as larger constant buffers and optional double-precision instructions, as well as improved blending modes and mandatory support for 16-bit colour formats to improve the performance of entry-level GPUs such as Intel HD Graphics. WARP has been updated to support feature level 11_1.|$|R

The STANAG- 4575 standard defines a linear file {{system in which}} each file is stored in a single contiguous block of disk space. There is a small directory listing {{at the beginning of}} the disk. This listing stores the starting position and length for each file. It also stores the file's name and its creation date and time. This file system is very efficient for storing files that are recorded sequentially because it does not require the disk to constantly update a file allocation table on each write. Unfortunately, the STANAG- 4575 file system is not directly supported by Microsoft Windows. This means that it is not possible to simply attach a recorder's disk to a PC and copy the files directly using Windows Explorer. This paper will discuss an approach that allows the contents of a STANAG formatted disk to be read from a standard Windows PC. In addition to copying files from the disk, this approach allows several other useful operations to be performed on the disk. These operations include advanced <b>copy</b> <b>options</b> such as partial file copies and splitting files into multiple pieces. It can also provide a mechanism for deleting files, reformatting the disk and performing a sanitization procedure on a disk to declassify it...|$|R

25|$|While the Liverpool dispute {{was still}} {{unresolved}} {{at the end}} of May 1984 there was already pressure on the left-wing leadership of Lewisham London Borough Council to <b>copy</b> the Liverpool <b>option</b> and confront the Government with a deficit budget. At a meeting of Labour controlled London boroughs in mid-June, the idea of a united strategy of many councils refusing to levy a rate was introduced. The idea caught on, especially with the leaders of the four South London boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark, Lewisham and Greenwich, and with John McDonnell, chair of the finance committee of the Greater London Council. On 22 June 1984, they signed a statement published in Labour Herald which outlined the strategy.|$|R
40|$|The {{enhancement}} {{of intellectual property}} rights (IPR) under the TRIPs agreement 2 has to some degree been paralleled by {{an expansion of the}} literature on the optimal forms and roles of IPR systems. Economists have long concerned themselves (albeit with limited success) with such matters as optimal patent scope and duration. Public sector scientists have been particularly concerned with the effects of IPR on the dissemination of research findings, while a broad range of groups has expressed divergent opinions about the implications of IPR for the environment and traditional cultures, among other subjects. And industry representative groups like the U. S. Chamber of Commerce have in the past pressed hard for strengthened protection worldwide. What is missing from this knowledge base is much of a concept of the perspective of how actual users of IP systems view its components and roles. We are aware, largely from surveys in developed countries, that the importance of IPR are seen quite differently in different sectors. Nogues (1990, pp. 11 - 14), for example, found executives on average ranked patent rights low as a component of R&D investment determinants. The reasons are generally conjectured as the ease of <b>copying,</b> the <b>option</b> to use alternative protectio...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} for pricing Asian power options is developed when the underlying asset follows a jump-fraction process. The partial differential equation (PDE) in the fractional environment with jump is constructed for such option using general Itô's lemma and self-financing dynamic strategy. With the boundary condition, an analytic formula for the option with geometric average starting {{at any time}} before maturity is derived by solving the PDE, and the option with arithmetic average is evaluated in Monte Carlo simulation using control variate technique {{with the help of}} the above analytic solution. Overwhelming numerical evidence indicates that the technique proposed is computationally efficient and dramatically improves the accuracy of the simulated price. Moreover, this study will pave a novel way to <b>copy</b> with the <b>option</b> contracts based on thinly-traded assets like oil, or currencies or interest rates...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{cheating}} detection, {{most notably}} the detection of answer copying, has gained in pop-ularity during the past decade, resulting {{in a number of}} statistical indices that have been shown to work quite well at identifying the most serious offenders. However, in spite of the existence of these methods and in spite of the widespread attention that cheating on tests has drawn in recent years, all too often these indices are not applied in practice, even when answer copying is suspected. The most likely reasons for this are that (a) the methods are not known to exist and (b) the methods are not suf-ficiently easy to compute. This is particularly true in classroom situations, where teachers lack the time, resources, and expertise to keep abreast of the literature on copying detection methods. Although making known the existence of statistical approaches to detect answer copying remains a marketing challenge, Castle Rock Research Corporation has gone a long way toward making statistical detection of answer <b>copying</b> a viable <b>option</b> for classroom teachers. Castle Rock Research Corporation (2005 b) now offers a service called INTEGRITY that performs a number of analyses to evaluate the statistical integrity of the test and the student’s test scores. INTEGRITY provides item analysis and subgroup and test center comparisons that are as detailed and prescrip-tive as those provided by any of the other test analysis packages on the market. However, what clearly offsets INTEGRITY from other packages is its ability to perform collusion detection...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a lively {{discussion}} on the Division’s listserv regarding the proposed name change for the Division. Proponents of the new name, Society for Internet and Media Psychology, {{felt it was important}} to link the Division to what many of us believe is the most important development in communications since the printing press. Others felt just as strongly that a new name was unnecessary and that Division of Media Psychology did a fine job of defining who we are and what we are interested in. The question was put to our members, and a majority of those voting (59 %) supported the new name. However, our bylaws require a two-thirds majority for any changes to the bylaws (such as a name change), so the name of the Division won’t change—at least not this year. Ryan Niemiec has put together an exciting series of Division presentations, posters and symposia for the upcoming APA convention in Toronto. We have included the entire upcoming Division program in this issue. Budgetary restrictions have resulted in a decision to publish The Amplifier twice a year rather than three times each year. We will be having a spring/summer issue with a complete listing of the upcoming convention activities and a fall/winter issue. Your Board is also exploring having The Amplifier published online with those members who desire a paper <b>copy</b> having the <b>option</b> to simply print it out at their desk; we haven’t made a final decision about this, and we would welcome your views.
