2500|$|San Juan Creek {{begins in}} the {{southern}} Santa Ana Mountains, a few miles northwest of Lake Elsinore. Its highest elevation is [...] above sea level. Paralleling the Ortega Highway (California State Route 74) the creek flows erratically south, west and occasionally northwest. In the furthest {{upper reaches of the}} watershed, the creek is typically ephemeral. The creek channel in the uppermost few miles is a narrow mountain stream with many rapids and waterfalls, which include a series of large [...] cascades, known as San Juan Falls. There are little alluvial deposits in the canyons, and the creek mostly cascades over bedrock. In this upper reach, the pool-and-riffle stream <b>channel</b> <b>structure</b> is evident. There are a few developments within the area, but most of the canyon is too narrow for development, and the only major structure that influences the creek throughout San Juan Canyon is Ortega Highway, which follows the course of the entire canyon.|$|E
2500|$|Steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) {{occurred}} historically in Adobe Creek {{based on}} a report touting the trout in the Sportsman Gazetteer in 1877. This very early report makes rumors that Adobe Creek's trout were introduced extremely unlikely since the first trout hatcheries in California did not propagate any trout until the 1870s, and much of their production was shipped to hatcheries out of state. A physical specimen was collected in 1893 by Stanford Biology Professor W. W. Thoburn {{and is in the}} California Academy of Sciences collection. In 1898 John Otterbein Snyder collected steelhead trout specimens in San Antonio Creek (now Adobe Creek). A 1909 land office brochure promoted Los Altos for its [...] "never-failing mountain trout stream, trout caught a few feet from kitchen doors". The reaches upstream from Hidden Villa have been judged excellent trout spawning habitat. Josephine Duveneck wrote, [...] "Before the era of concrete, fish used to swim up to spawn and native trout lured many a small boy to seek out the deeper pools carrying his home-made fishing pole and can of worms." [...] Local historian Florence Fava also reported that [...] "the creeks which lace the (Hidden Villa) property and join Adobe Creek were originally full of fish". Steelhead often were caught using large wet flies with 2x tippet during the early 1970s. [...] Locations that held spawning steelhead included the large cement pieces downstream from the Foothill Junior College paint shop outflow and cut banks just below Interstate 280. [...] According to the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), steelhead were caught by local fishermen during 1985, 1986 and 1987 in Mayfield Slough at the confluence of Matadero and Adobe Creeks. At least six steelhead were noted passing the tidal gates at Mayfield Slough in the Palo Alto Flood Basin in April 1987. There are many formidable obstacles to fish passage on Adobe Creek, including the culverts at the El Camino Real and Interstate 280 overpasses, a drop structure at the Foothill College bridge and the long concrete trapezoidal <b>channel</b> <b>structure</b> from El Camino Real northward to Highway 101. Additional barriers occur at the O'Keefe Lane and Hidden Villa bridges, and the creek suffers from significant bank erosion, failing channel stabilization structures, and sedimentation. Finally, the trash rack at the tidal gate at the mouth of Mayfield Slough is an intermittent complete barrier to fish passage when it is closed.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of ion <b>channel</b> <b>structures</b> are being determined. This generates a need for computational tools to enable functional annotation of <b>channel</b> <b>structures.</b> However, {{a number of studies}} of ion channel and model pores have indicated that the physical dimensions of a pore are not always a reliable indicator of its conductive status. This is due to the unusual behavior of water within nano-confined spaces, resulting in a phenomenon referred to as ‚Äòhydrophobic gating‚Äô. We have recently demonstrated how simulating the behavior of water within an ion channel pore can be used to predict its conductive status. In this addendum to our study, we apply this method to compare the recently solved structure of a mutant of the bestrophin chloride channel BEST 1 with that of the wild-type channel. Our results support the hypothesis of a hydrophobic gate within the narrow neck of BEST 1. This provides further validation that this simulation approach provides the basis for an accurate and computationally efficient tool for the functional annotation of ion <b>channel</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempted to}} {{contribute to the development of}} knowledge within the domain of international channels of distribution and especially the degree of integration of such <b>channel</b> <b>structures.</b> Through an intensive literature review, four main theories have been identified as potential bases for the study of the subject matter, these are the functional approach, IPA, the financial consideration approach and TCA. Of these four theories, the author argues that, currently, TCA occupies a dominant position within related academic research. Consequently, TCA has been utilised as the theoretical basis of the study, the main aim of which has been the development and testing of a proposed model for the design of international <b>channel</b> <b>structures</b> for newly industrialised countries. Following an extensive review of relevant material, the model developed by Bello and Lohtia (1995) has been identified as offering a robust and systematic insight into the application of the TCA propositions into the subject matter. Nevertheless, the author has identified a number of limitations associated with Bello and Lohtia's model, and consequently, on the strength of related literature, has proposed a modified/extended model. In order to test the modified extended model, appropriate research constructs were operationalised. Through a self-completion questionnaire, the proposed model was applied/ tested in the IT -related sector of the Taiwanese economy. Sufficient data were collected and advanced multivariate techniques (in particular, structural equation modelling) were/utilised. Examination of the model fit led to a revised model. The pathways/ causal relationships within the revised proposed model can be categorised under four main types: 1. 	Constructs as second-order factors: H[sub] 2 [sub]a : "Transaction-specific Assets' is a second-order factor of "Human TSA", "Product TSA", "Physical TSA", "Dedicated TSA" and "Brand Name TSA". 		 Partially supported H[sub] 5 [sub]a : 'Business Strengths of Principals' is a second-order factor of "Firm's Size", "Firm's Exporting Experience", "Firm's Financial Ability", "Familiarity with Foreign Markets" and "Firm's Core Business". Tentatively supported 2. 	Hypothesised pathways/causal relationships related to the decisions regarding 'integration of international channel structures: 'H[sub] 1 : The higher the 'Transaction Frequency', the greater the likelihood to integrate international <b>channel</b> <b>structures.</b> Supported H[sub] 2 : The higher the 'Transaction-specific Assets', the greater the likelihood to integrate international <b>channel</b> <b>structures.</b> Supported H[sub] 3 [sub]a: HJ. : The lower the degree of 'Environmental Diversity', the greater the likelihood to integrate international <b>channel</b> <b>structures.</b> Opposite H[sub] 3 [sub]b: The greater the degree of 'Environmental Volatility', the greater the likelihood to integrate international <b>channel</b> <b>structures.</b> Not supported H[sub] 4 : The lower the 'Channel Production Costs', the greater the likelihood to integrate international <b>channel</b> <b>structures.</b> Not supported H[sub] 5 [sub]a: The greater the magnitude of 'Business Strengths of Principals', the greater the likelihood to integrate international <b>channel</b> <b>structures.</b> Supported 3. 	Secondary hypotheses relevant to 'Business Strengths of Principals': H[sub] 6 [sub]a : The higher the degree of 'Environmental Diversity', the higher the magnitude of 'Business Strengths of Principals'. Supported H[sub] 6 [sub]b : The higher the degree of 'Environmental Volatility', the lesser the magnitude of 'Business Strengths of Principals'. Supported H[sub] 7 : The greater the magnitude of 'Business Strengths of Principals', the lower the 'Channel Production Costs'. 4. 	Additional significant causal pathways added following data analysis: AH[sub] 1 : The higher the 'Channel Production Costs', the greater the magnitude of 'Business Strengths of Principals'. AH[sub] 2 : The higher the 'Transaction Frequency', the higher the magnitude of 'Business Strengths of Principals'. Finally, it is believed that the research presented in this thesis has made an original contribution to the scholarly study and literature on international <b>channel</b> <b>structures,</b> and more specifically: 1. 	offered a new conceptualisation of the 'Business Strengths of Principals' and 'Transaction-specific Assets' constructs; 2. 	expanded the conceptualisation of TCA through the addition of the 'Business Strengths of Principals' construct; 3. 	 offered - some initial evidences to suggest that transaction costs, rather than production costs, are more important determinants of international channel structures; 4. 	expanded the boundary condition of TCA, as applied to the subject matter, by successfully applying the theory in a new environment; 5. 	introduced the 'channel functional measure approach' as a measure of degree of channel integration; and 6. 	provided a set of prescriptive guidelines for the design of international <b>channel</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
