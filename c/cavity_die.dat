5000|$|Impression-die forging is {{also called}} [...] "closed-die forging". In impression-die forging, the metal {{is placed in}} a die {{resembling}} a mold, which is attached to an anvil. Usually, the hammer die is shaped as well. The hammer is then dropped on the workpiece, causing the metal to flow and fill the die cavities. The hammer is generally {{in contact with the}} workpiece on the scale of milliseconds. Depending on the size and complexity of the part, the hammer may be dropped multiple times in quick succession. Excess metal is squeezed out of the die cavities, forming what is referred to as [...] "flash". The flash cools more rapidly {{than the rest of the}} material; this cool metal is stronger than the metal in the die, so it helps prevent more flash from forming. This also forces the metal to completely fill the die cavity. After forging, the flash is removed.In commercial impression-die forging, the workpiece is usually moved through a series of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form. The first impression is used to distribute the metal into the rough shape in accordance to the needs of later cavities; this impression is called an [...] "edging", [...] "fullering", or [...] "bending" [...] impression. The following cavities are called [...] "blocking" [...] cavities, in which the piece is working into a shape that more closely resembles the final product. These stages usually impart the workpiece with generous bends and large fillets. The final shape is forged in a [...] "final" [...] or [...] "finisher" [...] impression cavity. If there is only a short run of parts to be done, then it may be more economical for the die to lack a final impression cavity and instead machine the final features.Impression-die forging has been improved in recent years through increased automation which includes induction heating, mechanical feeding, positioning and manipulation, and the direct heat treatment of parts after forging.One variation of impression-die forging is called [...] "flashless forging", or [...] "true closed-die forging". In this type of forging, the die cavities are completely closed, which keeps the workpiece from forming flash. The major advantage to this process is that less metal is lost to flash. Flash can account for 20 to 45% of the starting material. The disadvantages of this process include additional cost due to a more complex die design and the need for better lubrication and workpiece placement.There are other variations of part formation that integrate impression-die forging. One method incorporates casting a forging preform from liquid metal. The casting is removed after it has solidified, but while still hot. It is then finished in a single <b>cavity</b> <b>die.</b> The flash is trimmed, then the part is quench hardened. Another variation follows the same process as outlined above, except the preform is produced by the spraying deposition of metal droplets into shaped collectors (similar to the Osprey process).Closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities. However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This is one of the major reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.|$|E

50|$|It is {{also known}} as {{impression}} die forging. Impressions are made in a pair of dies. These impressions are transferred to the work piece during deformation. A small gap between the dies called flash gutter is provided so that the excess metal can flow into the gutter and form a flash. Flash has got a very important role during deformation of the work piece inside the <b>die</b> <b>cavity.</b> Due to high length to thickness ratio of the flash gutter, friction in the gap is very high. Due to this the material in the flash gap is subjected to high pressure. There is high resistance to flow. This in turn promotes effective filling of the <b>die</b> <b>cavity.</b> In hot forging, the flash cools faster as a result of it being smaller in size.

40|$|The {{role of a}} coating die is to {{distribute}} a uniform, two dimensional liquid film over a solid surface, often formed as an intermediate step in the manufacturing process of polymeric sheet products. The goal of coating die design is to deliver, with a single die, the largest range of fluid rheologies and flow conditions to within specified uniformity limits. Demanding applications require the film thickness nonuniformity to {{be as little as}} one percent across the entire coating surface for acceptable quality of the final product, necessitating optimized design as well as precision manufacturing. There are two principal techniques used for the prediction of optimal die geometry and the analysis of flow uniformity at the slot exit, which includes full numerical computation and theoretical approximate models. Three dimensional computational solutions are numerically intensive, often requiring long computational times to accurately simulate a single die flow condition, and for this reason it is difficult to optimize coating die design solely through the use of full numerical computation. In the alternative approximate modeling approach, the complete set of three dimensional equations governing flow are averaged across the cavity cross section. As a result, the details of the flow and pressure fields at each node point specified within the cavity geometry is exchanged for average flow properties. The advantage of these simplified approximate models is that they are much easier to solve, allowing for many flow conditions and geometric parameters to be tested quickly; however, quantifiable error is incurred due to the approximations of the complete three dimensional set of governing momentum equations. Much of the initial work on theoretical single <b>cavity</b> <b>die</b> design and the approximate modeling approach focused on the viscous dominated analysis of both the cavity and slot regions for a generalized Newtonian fluid obeying a power law dependence of viscosity on shear rate. Since this initial work, the viscous dominated model has been generalized to include the inertial and gravitational effects within the cavity as well as expanded to incorporate more complex geometries for which the cavity cross sectional area, slot lengths, and slot heights may vary widthwise along the die. For the solution of the single cavity approximate die design model, additional parameters, known as the kinetic and viscous shape factors, are necessary inputs; these parameters incorporate the specific cross sectional shape of the cavity domain into the pressure drop flow relationship. In more complex but often superior designs, a secondary cavity and slot are added to improve flow distribution, where the function of the inner cavity and slot are identical to those respective of the single cavity coating die design, however significant flow occurs in the cross section of the outer cavity between the exit of the inner slot and entrance to the outer slot. Despite the complication of this flow in the outer cavity cross section, much of the initial work on theoretical dual <b>cavity</b> <b>die</b> design directly applied the established governing equations of flow in the inner cavity, represented in the approximate models, to both the inner and outer cavities. Ruschak and Weinstein (1997 a) obtain a different outer cavity equation for the analysis of dual cavity coating dies, utilizing a perturbation technique to derive a flow equation which accounts for the three dimensional nature of the outer cavity flow and considers the nonlinearities occurring due to inertia or generalized Newtonian rheology. Here, a similar, yet generalized, shape factor for the outer cavity arises which is defined to be consistent with the usual definition for the inner cavity for purely viscous, Newtonian flow. The focus of this research is to utilize Computational Fluid Dynamics as idealized experimental data, which is to be used for the improvement and verification of the theoretical outer cavity approximate die design model. Additionally, this research provides the first numerical computations of the outer cavity shape factor, incorporating shear thinning fluids as well as fluid inertia. Here, a two dimensional validation of the fundamental assumptions utilized in the derivation of the outer cavity approximate model is performed, while an attempted three dimensional validation of the predicted flow per unit cavity width exiting the outer slot provides confidence in the validity of the approximate modeling approach. A final, practical demonstration of the solution of the outer cavity approximate model provides valuable information for the investigation into the the optimum design of the outer cavity cross section. Ultimately, this research provides a firmer foundation for the design of the outer cavity in a dual cavity coating die, while further demonstrating the utility and importance of the theoretical approximate die design modeling approach...|$|E
