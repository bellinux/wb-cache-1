50|$|In 1998, Yermukhamet Yertysbayev {{headed the}} Institute. Director Yertysbayev had both {{political}} and academic background. He was able to establish an active dialogue with the opposition and showed strong determination to defend the national interests. Under Yertysbayev the scholarly analytical review Kazakhstan-Spectrum issues by the KazISS become the principle asset of the Institute that enjoyed very high reputation in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. Yermukhamet Yertysbayev encouraged academic interests of the experts. As the result the number of dissertations increased dramatically as well of the books by both individual and <b>composite</b> <b>authors.</b> However, excessive academic focus overshadowed {{the mission of the}} KazISS as a think tank aimed at analytical support of the President.
