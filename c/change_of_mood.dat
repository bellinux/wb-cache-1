5|$|Kristin Lemmerman of CNN {{said that}} it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the {{beginning}} contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.' Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> and development of characters. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave Goblet of Fire the grade of A-, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a nightmare factory for young readers.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cancers {{in the brain}} come from {{elsewhere}} in the body – most commonly the lung, breast and skin. Cancers of brain tissue can also occur, and originate from any tissue {{in and around the}} brain. Meningioma, cancer of the meninges around the brain, is more common than cancers of brain tissue. Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood.</b> Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans. A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer. The corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour. Surgery may be considered, however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.|$|E
25|$|In October 2004, Cohen {{released}} Dear Heather, {{largely a}} musical collaboration with jazz chanteuse (and romantic partner) Anjani Thomas, although Sharon Robinson returned to collaborate on three tracks (including a duet). As light {{as the previous}} album was dark, Dear Heather reflects Cohen's own <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> – {{he said in a}} number of interviews that his depression had lifted in recent years, which he attributed to Zen Buddhism. In an interview following his induction into the Canadian Songwriters' Hall of Fame, Cohen explained that the album was intended {{to be a kind of}} notebook or scrapbook of themes, and that a more formal record had been planned for release shortly afterwards, but that this was put on ice by his legal battles with his ex-manager.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, Blair Sanderson states [...] "Angular lines, {{piercing}} sonorities, and abrupt <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> characterize Coleman's sharply defined music, and its edginess makes this album {{best suited for}} adventurous listeners".|$|R
500|$|A secco recitative, [...] "" [...] (Alas, {{that the}} curse, which strikes the earth there), renders a {{contrasting}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood.</b> Bach interprets {{the curse of}} sin, and the hopeless situation of the humans {{and the threat of}} the Last Judgment in music full of dissonances.|$|E
500|$|The first recitative, [...] "" [...] (The sinful {{birth of}} the cursed heirs of Adam), is secco, but several phrases are close to an arioso. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that Bach follows {{the meaning of the}} text closely, for example by [...] "rhythmic dislocations for death and destruction", a change in harmony on [...] "poisoned", and [...] "the {{complete}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> at the mention of the blessed Christian". He summarizes: [...] "Here anger and resentment at Man’s inheritance of suppurating sin is contrasted against the peace and joy of God-given salvation".|$|E
500|$|Apart from a {{juvenile}} fantasia for violin and piano, Smetana composed only four chamber works, yet {{each had a}} deep personal significance. The Piano Trio in G minor of 1855 was composed {{after the death of}} his daughter Bedřiška; its style is close to that of Robert Schumann, with hints of Liszt, and the overall tone is elegiac. It was 20years before he returned to the chamber genre with his first String Quartet. This E minor work, subtitled From My Life, was autobiographical in character, illustrating the composer's youthful enthusiasm for his art, his friendships and loves and, in a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood,</b> the onset of his deafness represented by a long harmonic E in the final movement above ominous string tremolos. His second String Quartet, in D minor, written in 1882–83 in defiance of his doctor's orders to refrain from all musical activity, was composed in short snatches, [...] "a swirl of music of a person who has lost his hearing." [...] It represents Smetana's frustrations with his life, but is not wholly gloomy, and includes a bright polka. It was one of his final compositions; between the two quartets he wrote a violin and piano duet From the homeland, a mixture of melancholy and happiness with strong affinity to Czech folk material.|$|E
50|$|These {{choices were}} {{available}} {{not only to}} reflect permanent relationships, but to express momentary <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> attitude.

5000|$|Author Francis Davis {{states that}} [...] "'Glass Enclosure' juxtaposes to {{harrowing}} effect an agitated blues riff and a ten-bar fanfare".

500|$|As [...] states, this [...] "short tutti {{outburst}} ... closes this superb chorus in a {{blaze of}} 'Herrlichkeit'." [...] , commenting on the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> in the final section, writes, [...] "The sense of relief after the stifling pathos of the opening sections is palpable ... After so much pathos, the final coda led by the sopranos releases the pent-up energy in an explosion of joy." [...] comments, [...] "The words, to the end of this section, are based on Isaiah 58:7-8 ... It brings Jesus’ words to mind, ‘Inasmuch as you do it unto them, you do it unto me’ and his denunciation of the careless rich. Isaiah continues, ‘Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee.’ Bach sets the paraphrase of these last words to a glorious fugue, with two expositions, and so brings to an end one of his finest choruses and one that is worthy indeed of the inspired words of Isaiah.” [...] also expresses his admiration for Bach's setting: [...] "The chorus of the first movement, set to two beautiful verses of Isaiah, brings out the meaning of that text in the Sermon on the Mount, 'Blessed [...] are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,' and the cantata ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season 11, the revamp began with new, more modern opening credits, using an electric guitar, rather than an acoustic. [...] Later in that season, a live episode, [...] "Reasonable Doubt", was broadcast in hope of offering a short-term ratings boost and encourage more long-term viewers. Although an immediate success, the live episode did not bring about a sustained increase in ratings. Producers also hoped that a shift in direction, a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> and setting, {{and the addition of}} four cast members would cement Blue Heelers long-term future. They also wanted the show to remain relevant and more accurately reflect today's modern world: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Board of Agriculture was {{established}} by Act of Parliament in 1889. [...] Although rationing during the First World War {{was limited to the}} end of 1917 and 1918, a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> arose about food security, and the Ministry of Food was created in 1916. [...] There was a national feeling that a man who had fought for his country should be entitled to retire to a smallholding on British land that would provide him with a livelihood. [...] This led to various initiatives, collectively called Homes for Heroes. [...] By 1926 agricultural law had become openly redistributive in favour of ex-servicemen. County Councils had compulsory purchase powers to requisition land they could let as smallholdings. [...] Ex-servicemen were the preferred tenants. [...] The tenant could then buy the land and could ask the Council to lend them money to fund the purchase as a mortgage. [...] The Council could not refuse without the Minister of Agriculture's permission.|$|E

2500|$|The 1930s {{contained}} {{criticism that}} praised the poem, but most critics found fault with particular {{aspects of the}} poem. F. R. Leavis, in his Revaluation (1936), argued that [...] "Criticism of Stanza VIII ... has been permissible, even correct, since Coleridge's time. But the empty grandiosity apparent there is merely the local manifestation of a general strain, a general factitiousness. The Ode... belongs to the transition at its critical phase, and contains decided elements of the living." [...] He continued, [...] "But these do not lessen the dissatisfaction that one feels with the movement—the movement that makes the piece an ode in the Grand Style; for, as one reads, it {{is in terms of}} the movement that the strain, the falsity, first asserts itself. The manipulations by which the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> are indicated have, {{by the end of the}} third stanza, produced an effect that, in protest, one described as rhythmic vulgarity..., and the strain revealed in technique has an obvious significance". In 1939, Basil Willey argued that the poem was [...] "greatly superior, as poetry, to its psychological counterpart in The Prelude" [...] but also said that [...] "the semi-Platonic machinery of pre-existence... seems intrusive, and foreign to Wordsworth" [...] before concluding that the poem was the [...] "final and definitive expression to the most poignant experience of his poetic life".|$|E

5000|$|For example, the Penguin Guide to Compact Discs says of Schreier's {{recording}} of Franz Schubert's Schwanengesang, [...] "Schreier's voice {{may no longer}} be beautiful under pressure, but ... the range of tone and the intensity of inflexion over word-meaning makes this one of the most compelling recordings ever."

5000|$|In 1875 Borodin {{started his}} First String Quartet, {{much to the}} displeasure of Mussorgsky and Vladimir Stasov.

His Second Quartet, in which his strong lyricism is represented in the popular [...] "Nocturne", followed in 1881.

60|$|In {{the first}} place, {{she had had}} another <b>of</b> her swift <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood,</b> and had once again tucked away hostility into its corner.

Consequently she resolved, when they should meet again, to resume her attitude of good-fellowship. That in itself would have been enough to make her smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's wrong?" [...] asked Alfred, rather stupidly. The <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> {{had been}} too rapid for him.

60|$|The {{explanation}} of this <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> became apparent some little time farther on. Lady Mottisfont, {{after five years}} of wedded life, was expecting to become a mother, and the aspect of many things was greatly altered in her view. Among the more important changes was that of no longer feeling Dorothy to be absolutely indispensable to her existence.|$|E
60|$|No {{difficulty}} {{was there}} in associating my <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> with her absence. I brooded.

60|$|During this interval, even Adele {{was seldom}} sent for to his presence, {{and all my}} {{acquaintance}} with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.

5000|$|... "That's Not Me" [...] {{is another}} example [...] "Wouldn't it Be Nice" [...] {{of the way in}} which the Beach Boys (or more properly, Brian Wilson) use texture to reflect <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood.</b> Listen to the way the texture changes for the {{sections}} beginning [...] "I'm a little bit scared" [...] and [...] "I once had a dream". The strong percussive elements drop out to leave a smooth, sustained organ and vocal texture with a heavily reverbed guitar. This song has no intro, but notice how unusual harmonic twists give variety to what might otherwise be a rather repetitive verse structure.|$|R
