5|$|Alchemical {{magic was}} used to <b>create</b> <b>or</b> alter potions to achieve more {{powerful}} effects, repair or enchant items, identify unknown items or creatures, and combine different Order or Chaos spells to create spells with multiple elements (such as earth and fire spells creating a molten metal spell). Alchemical magic could also imbue a target with elemental attributes; for example, a warrior imbued with the Water element would deal extra cold-type damage but receive additional heat-type damage.|$|E
5|$|Higher-speed rail (HrSR), {{also known}} as {{high-performance}} rail, higher-performance rail, or almost-high-speed rail, is a jargon used to describe inter-city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more than conventional rail but are not high enough to be called high-speed rail services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to <b>create</b> <b>or</b> expand the high-speed rail networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed rail, or semi-high speed rail instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} a location in the galaxy as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms, {{the presence or absence of}} an active galactic nucleus, the frequency of nearby supernovae that can threaten the existence of life, the metallicity of that location, and other factors. Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot <b>create</b> <b>or</b> sustain life with efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Via {{a series}} of T-dualities one obtains the result that in any type II {{superstring}} theory, when an NS5-brane and a Dp-brane cross one necessarily <b>creates</b> <b>or</b> destroys a D(p-2)-brane. Lifting this statement to M-theory one finds that when two M5-branes cross, one <b>creates</b> <b>or</b> destroys an M2-brane. Using S-duality one may obtain transitions without NS5-brane. For example, when a D5-brane and a D3-cross one <b>creates</b> <b>or</b> destroys a fundamental string.|$|R

5|$|Redemption {{features}} an online multiplayer component which allows players {{to engage in}} scenarios together. One player assumes {{the role of the}} Storyteller, guiding other players through a scenario using the Storyteller interface. The interface allows the Storyteller to <b>create</b> <b>or</b> modify scenarios by placing items, monsters, and characters across the map. Character statistics, such as experience points, abilities, and disciplines, can also be modified. Finally, the Storyteller can assume the role of any character at any given time. These functions allow the Storyteller to dynamically manipulate the play environment while the other players traverse it.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{designer}} Frank Serafine, {{a longtime}} Star Trek fan, {{was invited to}} create the sound effects for the picture. Given access to state-of-the-art audio equipment, Serafine saw the picture as the chance to modernize outdated motion picture sound techniques with digital technology. Owing to background noise such as camera operation, much of the ambient noise or dialogue captured on set was unusable; it was Serafine's job to <b>create</b> <b>or</b> recreate sounds to mix back into the scenes.|$|E
5|$|Credited with 19 episodes, Steve Callaghan is {{the most}} {{prolific}} writer on Family Guy staff. Many of the writers that have left the show {{have gone on to}} <b>create</b> <b>or</b> produce other successful series. Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan co-wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom Scrubs during their eight-year run on the show, while also serving as co-producers and working their way up to executive producers. Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman left the show and went on to create the long-running and still ongoing adult animated series American Dad! MacFarlane is also a co-creator of American Dad! On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Barker had departed American Dad! during its run as well, after 10 seasons of serving as producer and co-showrunner over the series.|$|E

5|$|Like the iPhone, {{with which}} it shares a {{development}} environment the iPad only runs its own software, software downloaded from Apple's App Store, and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices. The iPad runs almost all third-party iPhone applications, displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen. Developers may also <b>create</b> <b>or</b> modify apps {{to take advantage of}} the iPad's features, and there are one million apps optimized for the iPad, as of March 2016. Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad. The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2. On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010; to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.|$|E
5|$|PRSA is {{organized}} as a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization and {{governed by a}} set of bylaws. A Chair is nominated each year and elected based on a vote of the Leadership Assembly. The Leadership Assembly consists of one delegate for every 100 members, as well as anyone that holds an elected office. Elected positions within PRSA are held on a volunteer-basis. A Board of Directors can propose membership fee changes that must be approved by the assembly. The board has the authority to <b>create</b> <b>or</b> dissolve task forces and committees as well as revoke or reward membership status. PRSA's Board of Ethics and Professional Standards and the Universal Accreditation Board make recommendations on the code of conduct and accreditation programs respectively. PRSA has more than 100 chapters in ten districts, 300 student chapters and 14 interest groups.|$|E

25|$|By 1947, when Abba Lerner {{wrote his}} article Money as a Creature of the State, economists had largely {{abandoned}} {{the idea that}} the value of money was closely linked to gold. Lerner argued that responsibility for avoiding inflation and depressions lay with the state because of its ability to <b>create</b> <b>or</b> tax away money.|$|E
25|$|If {{a surgeon}} {{attempts}} to <b>create</b> <b>or</b> increase cleavage by loosening the medial {{borders of the}} breasts, it could result in symmastia, a confluence of the breast tissue of both breasts across the midline anterior to the sternum, creating a lack of defined cleavage. Procedures are generally followed during breast reconstruction to preserve a natural cleavage of breasts.|$|E
