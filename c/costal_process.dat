50|$|The sacrum is {{a complex}} {{structure}} providing support for the spine and accommodation for the spinal nerves. It also articulates with the hip bones. The sacrum has a base, an apex, and three surfaces - a pelvic, dorsal and a lateral surface. The base of the sacrum, which is broad and expanded, is directed upward and forward. On {{either side of the}} base is a large projection known as an ala of sacrum and these alae (wings) articulate with the sacroiliac joints. The alae support the psoas major muscles and the lumbosacral trunk which connects the lumbar plexus with the sacral plexus. In the articulated pelvis the alae are continuous with the iliac fossa. Each ala is slightly concave from side to side, and convex from the back and gives attachment to a few of the fibers of the iliacus muscle. The posterior quarter of the ala represents the transverse process, and its anterior three-quarters the <b>costal</b> <b>process</b> of the first sacral segment. Each ala also serves as part of the border of the pelvic brim. The alae also form the base of the lumbosacral triangle. The iliolumbar ligament and lumbosacral ligaments are attached to the ala.|$|E

30|$|Thoracolumbar {{junctional}} variances manifest {{either as}} an {{increase or decrease}} in the number of rib-bearing thoracic vertebrae or altered appearances of the <b>costal</b> <b>processes</b> of the most caudal thoracic or the uppermost lumbar vertebra. Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae have been described as either sacralisation of the lowest lumbar segment or lumbarisation of the most superior sacral segment of the spine [35]. On imaging, these are best seen with CT. Clinically, these can be associated with back pain/“Bertolotti syndrome” [36] and can lead to nomenclature and/or surgical errors [37]. Castellvi et al. proposed a radiographic classification system based on the morphological characteristics of these vertebrae [38]. Treatment may be conservative or surgical.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} {{the relationships between}} the neurovascular structures and surrounding bone, which are hidden from the surgeon by soft tissue, and to aid in avoiding nerve root and vertebral artery injury in anterior cervical spine surgery. METHODS: Using six cadaveric spines, we measured important landmarks on the anterior surface of the spine, the bony housing protecting the neurovascular structures in the lateral disc space, and the changes that occur during the discectomy with interbody distraction of the vertebral bodies. The measurements included the distance between the medial borders of the longus colli muscle at the level of each interspace; the width and height of each disc space at the midline; the width and height of the costal process; the distances between the cranial tip of the uncinate process (UP) and the vertebral body (VB) above and from the tip of the UP to the vertebral artery; the anteroposterior diameter or the extent of the disc spaces in the midline; the height at the midpoint of the distracted disc space; the UP-VB distance in distraction; and the width of the visible nerve root. RESULTS: The distance between the medial borders of the longus colli muscles increased in a rostral to caudal direction. The height of the UP was shortest at C 4 -C 5 and greatest at C 5 -C 6; the width was narrowest at C 4 -C 5 and widest at C 6 -C 7. The width of the <b>costal</b> <b>process</b> measured from the VB to the anterior tubercle was narrowest at C 2 -C 3 and widest at C 6 -C 7. The midpoint height of the <b>costal</b> <b>process</b> was smallest at C 6 -C 7 and tallest at C 4 -C...|$|E
40|$|Five {{species of}} the genus Labiobaetis (Baetidae) are {{recognized}} from China based on mature nymphs, including a new species, Labiobaetis ancoralis n. sp. and a new combination, Labiobaetis mustus (Kang & Yang) n. comb. The new spe-cies differs from L. multus (Müller-Liebenau) and L. pulchellus (Müller-Liebenau & Hubbard) by the spatulate submar-ginal setae on labrum and the apical segment of maxillary palpus with a pronounced excavation near apex.

50|$|Somites form in {{the early}} embryo {{and some of these}} develop into sclerotomes. The sclerotomes form the {{vertebrae}} as well as the rib cartilage and part of the occipital bone. From their initial location within the somite, the sclerotome cells migrate medially towards the notochord. These cells meet the sclerotome cells {{from the other side of}} the paraxial mesoderm. The lower half of one sclerotome fuses with the upper half of the adjacent one to form each vertebral body. From this vertebral body, sclerotome cells move dorsally and surround the developing spinal cord, forming the vertebral arch. Other cells move distally to the <b>costal</b> <b>processes</b> of thoracic vertebrae to form the ribs.|$|R

50|$|The sclerotome {{forms the}} {{vertebrae}} and the rib cartilage {{and part of}} the occipital bone; the myotome forms the musculature of the back, the ribs and the limbs; the syndetome forms the tendons and the dermatome forms the skin on the back.

From their initial location within the somite, the sclerotome cells migrate medially towards the notochord. These cells meet the sclerotome cells from the other side to form the vertebral body. The lower half of one sclerotome fuses with the upper half of the adjacent one to form each vertebral body.

40|$|The {{group of}} {{symptoms}} attributable to compression of neurovascular structures through {{the influence of}} an anomalous cervical rib remains a surgical challenge. Admittedly controversial, the abundant literature dealing with the subject {{over the past several}} decades indicates the perplexity of the problem and the divergence of opinion relative to treatment. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the cervical rib syndrome as a clinical entity and to demonstrate that patients with resistant symptoms benefit from adequate surgical treatment. A personal series of nineteen cases and twenty-four operations will be analyzed. Background Anomalous ribs are found in the cervical and lumbar regions of man 24. 52 W These evolutionary remnants may result from a fault in body segmentation during embryonic development 20 #{ 149 }The rudimentary structure originates from the ossifica-tion center of the vertebral <b>costal</b> <b>process</b> and eventually replaces the process. Ossification and growth of the rib usually are not complete until about the twenty-fifth year, although cervical ribs, like thoracic ribs, may be well developed at th...|$|E
40|$|AbstractClassic {{studies have}} shown that the presomitic {{mesoderm}} is already committed to a specific morphological fate, for example, the ability to generate a rib. Hox gene expression in the paraxial mesoderm has also been shown to be fixed early and not susceptible to modulation by an ectopic environment. This is in contrast to the plasticity of Hox expression in neuroectodermal derivatives. We reexamine here the potential of somites for morphological plasticity by transplanting the cranial (occipital) somites 1 – 4, that normally produce small contributions to the skull, to the trunk of avian embryos. Surprisingly, the transposed cranial somites are able to form reasonably normal vertebral anlage. In addition, the cranial somitic mesoderm produces intervertebral disks, structures not normally found in the skull. These somites are however unable to generate some elements of the vertebrae, such as the <b>costal</b> <b>process.</b> In contrast to the morphogenetic plasticity of the occipital somites, their characteristic inability to support survival of dorsal root ganglia was not significantly modified by posterior transplantation. Dorsal root ganglia initially developed and then degenerated with the same morphological stages as normally observed. In striking contrast to the plasticity of morphology, we found that all four members of the of the fourth paralogous group of Hox genes that are expressed endogenously at the level of the graft are not upregulated in the caudad-transposed cranial mesoderm. It therefore appears that genes other than those of the Hox family normally expressed at this axial level control the position-specific morphogenesis of ectopic vertebrae formed from cranial somites. In evolutionary terms, the present results imply that occipital somites that were incorporated into the “New Head” retain the ability to develop according to their original morphogenetic fate, into vertebrae...|$|E
50|$|The {{transverse}} process of a lumbar vertebra is also {{sometimes called the}} <b>costal</b> or costiform <b>process</b> because it corresponds to a rudimentary rib (costa) which, {{as opposed to the}} thorax, is not developed in the lumbar region.|$|R
50|$|The {{rib cage}} is an {{arrangement}} of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs. In humans, the rib cage, {{also known as the}} thoracic cage, is a bony and cartilaginous structure which surrounds the thoracic cavity and supports the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle), forming a core portion of the human skeleton. A typical human rib cage consists of 24 ribs, the sternum (with xiphoid <b>process),</b> <b>costal</b> cartilages, and the 12 thoracic vertebrae. Together with the skin and associated fascia and muscles, the rib cage makes up the thoracic wall and provides attachments for the muscles of the neck, thorax, upper abdomen, and back.|$|R
40|$|Wave {{energy has}} a great {{potential}} in many coastal areas thanks {{to a number of}} advantages: the abundant resource, the highest energy density of all renewables, the greater availability factors than e. g. wind or solar energy; and the low environmental and particularly visual impact. In addition, a novel advantage will be investigated in this work: the possibility of a synergetic use for carbon-free energy production and coastal protection. In this context, wave energy can contribute not only to decarbonising the energy supply and reducing greenhouse emissions, but also to mitigating coastal erosion. In effect, wave farms will be deployed nearshore to generate electricity from wave energy, and therefore the leeward coast will be exposed to a milder wave climate, which can potentially mitigate coastal erosion. This thesis aims to determine the effectiveness of wave farms for combating coastal erosion by means of a suite of state-of-the-art process-based numerical models that are applied in several case studies (Perranporth Beach,UK; and Xago Beach, Spain) and at different time scales (from the short-term to the long-term). A wave propagation model, SWAN, is used to establish the effects of the wave farm on the wave conditions. The outcomes of SWAN will be coupled to XBeach, a <b>costal</b> <b>processes</b> model that is applied to analyse the effects of the milder wave conditions on the coast. In addition to these models, empirical classifications and analytical solutions are used as well to characterise the alteration of the beach morphology due to the presence of a wave farm. The analysis of the wave farm impacts on the wave conditions and the beach morphology will be carried out through a set of ad hoc impact indicators. Parameters such as the reduction in the significant wave height, the performance of the wave farm, the effects on the seabed level and the erosion in the beach face area are defined to characterise these impacts. Moreover, the role played by the key design parameters of wave farms, e. g. farm-to-coast distance or layout, is also examined. The results from this analysis demonstrate that wave farms, in addition to their main purpose of generating carbon-free energy, are capable of reducing erosion at the coast. Storm-induced erosion is significantly reduced due to the presence of wave farms in the areas most at risk from this phenomenon. However, the effects of wave farms on the coast do not lend themselves to general statements, for they will depend on the wave farm design (WEC type, layout and farm-to-coast distance) and the characteristics of the area in question, as shown in this document for Perranporth and Xago. In summary, this synergy will improve the economic viability of wave farm projects through savings in conventional coastal defence measures, thereby fostering the development of this nascent renewable, reducing greenhouse gas emission and converging towards a more sustainable energy model. Thus, wave energy contributes to mitigating climate change by two means, one acting on the cause, the other on the effect: (i) by bringing down carbon emissions (cause) through its production of renewable energy, and (ii) by reducing coastal erosion (effect) ...|$|R
