In the radiation dominated epoch, {{the interaction between the}} k-chameleon field and background matters can be neglected, the behavior of the k-chameleon therefore is {{the same as that of}} the ordinary k-essence. After the onset of matter domination, the strong coupling between the k-chameleon and matters dramatically changes the result of the ordinary k-essence. We find that during the matter-dominated epoch, only two kinds of attractors may exist: one is the familiar K attractor and the other is a completely new, dubbed C attractor. Once the universe is attracted into the C attractor, the fraction energy densities of the k-chameleon Ω_ϕ and dust matter Ω_m are fixed and comparable, and the universe will undergo a power-law accelerated expansion. One can adjust the model so that the K attractor do not appear. Thus, the k-chameleon model provides a natural solution to the cosmological coincidence problem.
