Road bicycles have their frames measured in centimetres, while off-road bicycles have their frames measured in inches. The size (diagonal) of television and computer monitor screens is always denominated in inches. Food sold by length or width e.g. pizzas or sandwiches, is generally sold in inches. Clothing is always sized in inches, with the metric equivalent often shown as a small supplementary indicator. Gas is usually measured by the cubic foot or cubic metre, but is billed like electricity by the kilowatt hour.|$|E
2500|$|Finland has an {{abundance}} of minerals, but many large mines have closed down, and most raw materials are now imported. For this reason, companies now {{tend to focus on}} high added-value processing of metals. [...] The exports include steel, copper, chromium, zinc and nickel, and finished products such as steel roofing and cladding, welded steel pipes, <b>copper</b> <b>pipe</b> and coated sheets. Outokumpu is known for developing the flash smelting process for copper production and stainless steel.|$|E
2500|$|Business reorganisations saw {{the sale}} of the <b>copper</b> <b>pipe</b> {{business}} in 1975 to a company called Econa Ltd., and a reinvestment in new coining machinery with continuous casting techniques. [...] The modernisation was interrupted in 1977 when an underground fire was discovered beneath the new casting lines. [...] The fire had to be dug out to a depth of nearly 30ft. [...] In 1980 the pressings business, which had been expanding rapidly, was formed into a separate subsidiary named Birmingham Mint Pressings Limited. [...] From 1976 to 1981 coins were struck for over 50 countries and in 1979 a record output of 13 million coins per week was achieved.|$|E

2500|$|In {{television}} stations, recording studios, {{and other}} installations where signal quality is critical, a special signal ground {{known as a}} [...] "technical ground" [...] (or [...] "technical earth", [...] "special earth", and [...] "audio earth") is often installed, to prevent ground loops. This is basically {{the same thing as}} an AC power ground, but no general appliance ground wires are allowed any connection to it, as they may carry electrical interference. For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio. In most cases, the studio's metal equipment racks are all joined together with heavy copper cables (or flattened copper tubing or busbars) and similar connections are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general chassis grounded appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC ground connection to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy <b>copper</b> <b>pipe,</b> if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.|$|E

All sorts of rubbish was shot there: it had a mound of scrap-iron in a corner; rows of empty oil-cans; sacks of cotton-waste, with a heap of charcoal, a deck-forge, fragments of an old hencoop, winch-covers all in rags, remnants of lamps, and a brown felt hat, discarded by a man dead now (of a fever on the Brazil coast), who had been once mate of the Sofala, had remained for years jammed forcibly behind a length of burst <b>copper</b> <b>pipe,</b> flung at some time or other out of the engine-room.
