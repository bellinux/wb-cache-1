5|$|Parasitic <b>cones</b> of the Itcha Range shield {{were formed}} mainly during the Early Pleistocene mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago. These {{secondary}} vents are monogenetic in nature, meaning each cone was only active {{for a single}} eruption sequence before becoming extinct. The duration of volcanic activity at these <b>cones</b> can last from hours to years. Parasitic <b>cones</b> of the Itcha Range are small cinder <b>cones</b> situated at the summit and flanks of the shield volcano.|$|E
5|$|Several Mono–Inyo-related {{explosion}} pits are on Mammoth Mountain. The Red <b>Cones,</b> {{south of}} Mammoth Mountain, are basaltic cinder <b>cones</b> {{and are the}} southernmost part of the Mono–Inyo Craters volcanic chain.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed or {{cuttings}} of hardened growth {{less than}} a year old. The seed can be collected from the <b>cones</b> and stored; they are best sown in spring or autumn. The stems and flowers are long-lasting if put in water. The flowers, <b>cones</b> and foliage are used in the cut-flower industry.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of mining technology, the <b>cone</b> crusher {{can be divided}} into four types: compound <b>cone</b> crusher, spring <b>cone</b> crusher, hydraulic <b>cone</b> crusher and gyratory crusher. According to different models, the <b>cone</b> crusher is divided into VSC series <b>cone</b> crusher (compound <b>cone</b> crusher), Symons <b>cone</b> crusher, PY <b>cone</b> crusher, single cylinder hydraulic <b>cone</b> crusher, multi-cylinder hydraulic <b>cone</b> crusher, gyratory crusher, etc.|$|R
25|$|The massive Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} {{complex in}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province of northern British Columbia has had more than 20 eruptions throughout the past 10,000years (Holocene), including Mess Lake <b>Cone,</b> Kana <b>Cone,</b> Cinder Cliff, Icefall <b>Cone,</b> Ridge <b>Cone,</b> Williams <b>Cone,</b> Walkout Creek <b>Cone,</b> Moraine <b>Cone,</b> Sidas <b>Cone,</b> Sleet <b>Cone,</b> Storm <b>Cone,</b> Triplex <b>Cone,</b> Twin <b>Cone,</b> Cache Hill, Camp Hill, Cocoa Crater, Coffee Crater, Nahta <b>Cone,</b> Tennena <b>Cone,</b> The Saucer, and the well-preserved Eve <b>Cone.</b> Active or recently active hot springs are found in several areas along the western flank of Edziza's lava plateau, including Elwyn springs (36°C), Taweh springs (46°C), and inactive springs near Mess Lake. All three hydrothermal areas are near the youngest lava fields on the lava plateau and are probably associated with the most recent volcanic activity at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. An undated pumice deposit exists throughout the complex estimated to be younger than 500years.|$|R
30|$|The {{class of}} <b>cone</b> b-metric spaces {{is larger than}} the class of <b>cone</b> metric spaces since any <b>cone</b> metric space must be a <b>cone</b> metric b-metric space. Therefore, it is obvious that <b>cone</b> b-metric spaces generalize b-metric spaces and <b>cone</b> metric spaces.|$|R
5|$|Strobilurus esculentus and S.stephanocystis {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to S.tenacellus. S.esculentus mushrooms have thin, sharp cap margins and only fruit on fallen spruce <b>cones.</b> S.stephanocystis has a yellow-brown to reddish-yellow cap that is not hygrophanous. Baeospora myosura is another small agaric that grows on pine and spruce <b>cones,</b> but it fruits in autumn.|$|E
5|$|The shaded north {{slopes of}} cinder <b>cones</b> provide more {{protection}} from direct sunlight and prevailing southwesterly winds {{and have a}} more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring). These parts of cinder <b>cones</b> are therefore colonized by plants first.|$|E
5|$|The steep conical cinder <b>cones</b> of Edziza {{were formed}} by lava {{fountain}} eruptions, emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava {{from a single}} vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinder around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Edziza's cinder <b>cones</b> have bowl-shaped craters at their summits and rise {{more than a hundred}} metres above their surroundings. Cinder <b>cones</b> are widespread in British Columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the <b>cone</b> of {{weighted}} n-point quasi-metrics WQMet_n, the <b>cone</b> of weighted quasi-hypermetrics WHyp_n and the <b>cone</b> of oriented cuts OCut_n are projec- tions along an extreme ray of the metric <b>cone</b> Metn+ 1, of the hypermetric <b>cone</b> Hypn+ 1 and of the cut <b>cone</b> Cut_{n+ 1 }, respectively. This projection is such that if one knows all faces of an original <b>cone</b> then one knows all faces of the projected <b>cone...</b>|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that the second-order <b>cone</b> and the {{circular}} <b>cone</b> have many analogous properties. In particular, there exists an important distance inequality associated with the second-order <b>cone</b> and the circular <b>cone.</b> The inequality indicates that the distances of arbitrary points to the second-order <b>cone</b> and the circular <b>cone</b> are equivalent, which is crucial in analyzing the tangent <b>cone</b> and normal <b>cone</b> for the circular <b>cone.</b> In this paper, we provide an alternative approach to achieve the aforementioned inequality. Although the proof is a bit longer than the existing one, the new approach offers a way to clarify when the equality holds. Such a clarification is helpful for further study {{of the relationship between the}} second-order <b>cone</b> programming problems and the circular <b>cone</b> programming problems.|$|R
30|$|Each <b>cone</b> metric is {{certainly}} a partial <b>cone</b> metric. The following example shows that there does exist some partial <b>cone</b> metric {{which is not a}} <b>cone</b> metric.|$|R
5|$|Trees usually {{reproduce}} using seeds. Flowers {{and fruit}} may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen <b>cones</b> and seed <b>cones.</b> Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns, produce spores instead.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the Spanish Creek and Ray Lake {{areas were}} synglacial but {{continued}} after the glacial ice had melted away. Two cinder <b>cones,</b> known as Flourmill Cone and Pointed Stick Cone, {{were created in}} the Spanish Creek area. Lava flows from the two cinder <b>cones</b> lie on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, indicating an early Holocene age.|$|E
5|$|Yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} {{have been}} reported flocking to Banksia <b>cones</b> ten days after bushfire as the follicles open. With pine trees, they prefer green <b>cones,</b> nipping them off at the stem and holding in one foot, then systematically lifting each segment and extracting the seed. A cockatoo spends about twenty minutes on each pine cone.|$|E
30|$|Note {{that each}} <b>cone</b> metric is {{certainly}} a partial <b>cone</b> metric. The following example shows that there do exist partial <b>cone</b> metrics that are not <b>cone</b> metrics.|$|R
50|$|The Moses H. <b>Cone</b> Memorial Hospital, the {{flagship}} of the system, opened in 1953 on 63 acre near downtown Greensboro. Bertha <b>Cone</b> established it {{in honor of}} her husband, Moses H. <b>Cone.</b> Moses <b>Cone</b> was a textile magnate and founder of <b>Cone</b> Mills.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, <b>cone</b> preinvex {{and related}} {{functions}} have been studied. The concept of <b>cone</b> subpreinvex functions is introduced. Some properties of <b>cone</b> subpreinvex functions {{have been established}} and their relationships with <b>cone</b> convex, <b>cone</b> subconvex, <b>cone</b> preinvex functions have been explored. Under the condition of <b>cone</b> subpreinvex functions, optimality conditions for vector valued minimization problems are obtained over topological vector space. A Mond-Weir type dual problems for a class of Gateaux differentiable multiobjective programs are formulated. The duality results are established under the condition of <b>cone</b> subpreinvex functions...|$|R

5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's <b>cones</b> are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the <b>cones</b> are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's <b>cones</b> are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E
30|$|Generally, PDC bit’s crown shape {{consists}} of inner <b>cone,</b> <b>cone</b> apex, and outer <b>cone.</b> Inner <b>cone</b> takes {{effect on the}} stability and guiding of the bit; <b>cone</b> apex is the part which penetrates into the formation first, {{the design of the}} structure is related to the formation characteristics, the length of outer <b>cone</b> is determined by cutter density, and the outer <b>cone</b> affects the wear of the bit (Kerr 1988; Cerkovnik 1982). This paper analyzes the relation of inner <b>cone</b> angle and outer <b>cone</b> arc radius to per revolution-specific rock-breaking work, and lays the foundation for the optimization design of PDC drill bit’s crown shape.|$|R
30|$|Remark 1.3 It {{is obvious}} that any <b>cone</b> metric space must be a <b>cone</b> b-metric space. Moreover, <b>cone</b> b-metric spaces generalize <b>cone</b> metric spaces, b-metric spaces and metric spaces.|$|R

5|$|Additional collections, then still {{believed}} to be T.toomansis, were made from South Australia in 1952, again on dead <b>cones</b> of unspecified Banksia, and also in 1956 on dead <b>cones</b> of Banksia marginata. In 1957 and 1958, R. W. G. Dennis redescribed the species, and after consultation with Canadian mycologist James Walton Groves, who had earlier completed a monograph on the genus Tympanis, transferred the taxon to the genus Encoelia (family Sclerotiniaceae). Encoelia species are small, tough, brownish discomycetes that typically grow in clusters on hardwood or woody substrates. Because the original collections were incomplete and certain microscopic features inadequately described, various collections made from Australia were presumed to be variations of the original 1887 collection.|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and <b>cones</b> can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E
40|$|Given {{a closed}} {{orientable}} Euclidean <b>cone</b> 3 -manifold C with <b>cone</b> angles ≤ π {{and which is}} not almost product, we describe the space of constant curvature <b>cone</b> structures on C with <b>cone</b> angles < π.

5|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine <b>cones.</b>|$|E
30|$|In 2007, Huang and Zhang [5] {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} <b>cone</b> metric spaces and extended the Banach contraction principle to <b>cone</b> spaces over a normal solid <b>cone.</b> Moreover, they defined the convergence via interior points of the <b>cone.</b> Such an approach allows {{the investigation of the}} case that the <b>cone</b> is not necessarily normal. Since then, there were many references concerned with fixed point results in (ordered) <b>cone</b> spaces (see [6 – 15]). In 2012, based on the definition of <b>cone</b> metric spaces and partial metric spaces, Sonmez [16, 17] defined a partial <b>cone</b> metric space and proved some fixed point theorems for contractive type mappings in complete partial <b>cone</b> metric spaces.|$|R
40|$|AIM—The short {{wavelength}} sensitive (S) <b>cone</b> electroretinograms (ERGs) {{were examined}} in two patients with Oguchi's disease to study S <b>cone</b> function.  METHODS—Ganzfeld colour flashes under bright white background illumination were used to elicit S <b>cone,</b> and mixed long (L) and middle (M) wavelength sensitive <b>cone</b> ERGs.  RESULTS—The S <b>cone</b> ERG b-wave was normal with short wavelength stimuli with normal L and M <b>cone</b> responses in both patients.  CONCLUSIONS—These ERG {{results indicate that the}} S <b>cone</b> system as well as the L and M <b>cone</b> system is not defective in Oguchi's disease, while the S <b>cone</b> responses are not detectable in the complete type of congenital stationary night blindness as reported previously.
