40|$|The {{material}} loss upon erosion was measured for several iron-chromium alloys. Two types of erodent material were used: spherical glass beads and sharp particles of <b>crushed</b> <b>glass.</b> For erosion with glass beads the erosion resistance (defined as the reciprocal of {{material loss}} rate) was linearly dependent on hardness. This is {{in accordance with}} the erosion behavior of pure metals, but contrary to the erosion behavior of alloys of constant composition that were subjected to different heat treatments. For erosion with <b>crushed</b> <b>glass,</b> however, no correlation existed between hardness and erosion resistance. Instead, the erosion resistance depended on alloy composition rather than on hardness and increased with the chromium content of the alloy. The difference in erosion behavior for the two types of erodent particles suggested that two different material removal mechanisms were involved. This was confirmed by SEM micrographs of the eroded surfaces, which showed that for erosion with glass beads the mechanism of material removal was deformation-induced flaking of surface layers, or peening, whereas for erosion with <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> it was cutting or chopping...|$|R

Although the recycled <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> is able to reduce the water absorption and drying shrinkage in concrete products due to its near to zero water absorption characteristics, the potential detrimental effect of using glass due to alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in cementitious materials is a real concern. The extent of ASR {{and its effect on}} concrete paving blocks produced with partial replacement of natural aggregates by <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> cullet are investigated in this study. This study is comprised of two parts. The first part quantified the extent of the ASR expansion and determined the adequate amount of mineral admixtures that was needed to reduce the ASR expansion for concrete paving blocks prepared with different recycled <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> contents using an accelerated mortar bar test in accordance with ASTM C 1260 (80 °C, 1 N NaOH solution). In the second part, concrete paving blocks were produced using the optimal mix proportion derived {{in the first part of}} this study and the corresponding mechanical properties were determined. It was found from the mortar bar test that the incorporation of 25 % or less RCG induced negligible ASR expansion after a testing period of 28 days. For mixes with a glass content of higher than 25 %, the incorporation of mineral admixtures such as pulverized fuel ash and metakaolin was able to suppress the ASR expansion within the stipulated limit but the results need to be confirmed by other test methods such as the concrete prism test. The study concluded that the optimal mix formulation for utilizing <b>crushed</b> waste <b>glass</b> in concrete paving blocks should contain at least 10 % PFA by weight of the total aggregates used.

Special concrete made with waste material is becoming popular in a construction site. This is because the special concrete is selected due to quality, integrity, economic factor and environmental factor. The waste glass is selected as an additional material to provide a good in compressive strength value. The compressive strength is the importance of mechanical properties of concrete and typically the concrete is sustained and stiffed in compression load. The significant issue to utilize the waste glass from the automotive windscreen is to improve the strength of concrete.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mechanical}} surface treatments {{as well as}} heat treatments on the erosion resistance of 6061 aluminum alloy and 1045 steel were studied. Mechanical surface treatments {{were found to have}} little or no effect on the erosion resistance. This is due to the formation by particle impact of a work hardened surface layer regardless of the initial surface condition. The erosion resistance of Al single crystals is found to be independent of orientation. This is due to destruction of the surface microstructure and formation of a polycrystalline surface layer by the impact of erodant particles as observed by X-ray diffraction. While upon solution treatment of annealed 6061 aluminum the increase in hardness is accompanied by an increase in erosion resistance, precipitation treatment which causes a further increase in hardness results in slightly lower erosion resistance.

The static {{tests were conducted}} with monolithic specimens having known geometric surface areas, whereas the SPFT tests were conducted with <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> that had an uncertain specific surface area. The error in the specific surface area of the <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> used in the SPFT tests, which was calculated by modeling the particles as spheres, was assessed based on {{the difference in the}} forward dissolution rates measured with the two test methods. Three series of static tests were conducted at 70 C following ASTM standard test method C 1220 using specimens with surfaces polished to 600, 800, and 1200 grit and a leachant solution having the same composition as that used in the ILS. Regression of the combined results of the static tests to the affinity-based glass dissolution model gives a forward rate of 1. 67 g/(m{sup 2 }d). The mean value of the forward rate from the SPFT tests was 1. 64 g/(m{sup 2 }d) with an extended uncertainty of 1. 90 g/(m{sup 2 }d). This indicates that the calculated surface area for the <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> used in the SPFT tests is less than 2 % higher than the actual surface area, which is well within the experimental uncertainties of measuring the forward dissolution rate using each test method. These results indicate that the geometric surface area of <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> calculated based {{on the size of the}} sieves used to isolate the fraction used in a test is reliable.

In this paper, the glass asphalt mix is evaluated for its stiffness characteristics, rutting potential and fatigue performance and compared with a dense- graded asphalt surfacing mix. The results indicate that the asphalt mix with <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> could outperform the conventional dense-graded mix in terms of rutting. The fatigue performance was comparable although the conventional mix performed marginally better than the glass asphalt mix. This fatigue behaviour is attributed {{to the fact that the}} glass asphalt mix was stiffer than the conventional mix at typical field conditions, i. e. temperature of 20 ?C and a loading frequency of 10 Hz.

The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the change of compression index, void ratio, and coefficient of consolidation of Kuantan Clayey stabilized by recycle and' reuse material mixed with Portland cement by using one-dimensional consolidation test and study the engineering properties of clay soil before and after undergoing one-dimensional consolidation test. This thesis describes the onedimensional consolidation tests done to compute the changes of compressibility and justify the suitable amount of additives used. <b>Crushed</b> <b>glass,</b> shredded carpet fibres, fly ash, and shredded high density polyethylene plastic which are classified as recyle and reused materials were added into Kuantan clay soil and then mixed with Portland cement to study and evaluate the Kuantan clay in term of compressibility. In this thesis, the values of coefficient of consolidation and compression index soils were done using a One-dimensional consolidation test. The analysis of the test was performed semiautomatically using One-dimensional consolidation program from ELE International. After analysis by the system, the coefficient of consolidation and compression index of the samples obtained were employed as parameter to find the compressibility of Kuantan clay soil. From the results conducted, analysis of using fly ash blend is more conservative reading in coefficient of consolidation indicated better rate of consolidation. Still, soil sample added with <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> mixed with Portland cement performed better decrement in compression index indicated better performance in compressibility. The achieved results utilizing high density polyethylene and carpet fibres gave low performance in compressibility compared to <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> and fly ash.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to conduct an {{experimental}} investigation on the influence of complete replacement of natural coarse aggregate with spherically-shape and crushed waste cathode ray tube (CRT) glass to the aspect of workability, density, and compressive strength of the concrete. After characterizing the glass, a group of concrete mixes was prepared to contain a 40 % spherical CRT glass and 60 % <b>crushed</b> CRT <b>glass</b> as a complete (100 %) replacement of natural coarse aggregates. From a total of 16 types of concrete mixes, the optimum proportion was selected based on its best performance. The test results showed that the use of spherical and <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> that possesses a smooth surface, rounded, irregular and elongated shape, and low water absorption affects the workability of concrete. Due to a higher specific gravity of <b>crushed</b> <b>glass,</b> concrete mixes containing CRT glass had a higher density compared to ordinary concrete. Despite the spherical and <b>crushed</b> CRT <b>glass</b> being stronger than gravel, the results revealed a reduction in compressive strength of the concrete.
