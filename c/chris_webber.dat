On its original airing, the film drew 2.7 million viewers, setting a record as the highest-rated ESPN documentary ever.|$|E
5|$|Howard was an All-American {{center and}} an honors student at Chicago Vocational Career Academy. Michigan {{was able to}} sign him early over {{numerous}} competing offers and then convince others in his recruiting class to join him. The Fab Five, which included <b>Chris</b> <b>Webber,</b> Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson, served as regular starters during their freshman and sophomore years for the 1991–92 and 1992–93 Wolverines. Howard was the last member of the Fab Five to remain active as a professional basketball player. Although many of the Wolverines' accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 were forfeited due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal, which involved booster payments to players to launder money from illegal gambling, Howard's 1993–94 All-American season continues to be recognized.|$|E

5|$|Steve Fisher {{assumed the}} {{coaching}} position immediately before the 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament from Frieder after having served {{and led the}} team to six straight victories and the championship. Fisher also signed the most famous recruiting class known as the Fab Five (<b>Chris</b> <b>Webber,</b> Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson). He would take these players to the NCAA championship game as Freshmen and Sophomores. In their sophomore 1992–93 season they compiled a 31–5 overall (15–3, Big Ten) record, which has since been vacated. Fisher also won the 1997 NIT tournament with a team that compiled a 25–9 overall (11–5) record. Many of Fisher's accomplishments were tarnished by NCAA sanctions. He left the job due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the schools}} {{do not share}} {{geographic}} proximity, which would induce frequent recruiting battles, {{there have been some}} high-profile recruits that were heavily targeted by both institutions. <b>Chris</b> <b>Webber,</b> Michigan's Mr. Basketball in 1991 and the National High School player of the year, chose Michigan over Duke and eventually became the #1 pick in the 1993 NBA Draft after playing two seasons for the Wolverines. Duke returned the favor by gaining a commitment from Michigan-raised Detroit Country Day alum Shane Battier, the 1997 Mr. Basketball of Michigan, who led Duke's 2001 National Championship team, while sweeping all of the National Player of the Year awards. Battier had been a fan of the Fab Five growing up. More recently, Michigan landed Mitch McGary, who had visited only Michigan, Duke and University of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The case {{began when}} the {{investigation}} of an automobile rollover accident during Mateen Cleaves' 1996 Michigan Wolverines recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the team. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated {{over the next few}} years and by 1999 several were called before a federal grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball players (<b>Chris</b> <b>Webber,</b> Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock) were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin. Eventually he confessed to having accepted some of the money he was charged with having borrowed. For his perjury during a federal grand jury investigation, he was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by National Basketball Association after performing public service.|$|E

Webber and three other Wolverines who played in the 1990s were alleged to have received over $290,000 in improper loans from a man considered to be a booster of the University of Michigan, although amounts were never verified. The four other Fab Five members were not implicated and the school was cleared of any direct involvement or knowledge of the loans, which were made to players and their families.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the elite}} eight {{round of the}} 1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Michigan earned a rematch against a Jimmy Jackson-led Ohio State Buckeyes team that had beaten them twice {{during the regular season}} by double digits. [...] Michigan won the rematch as all but two Wolverines points were scored by the Fab Five. Despite their talent, they never won a single {{championship}}, be it the Big Ten Regular Season Championship, Big Ten Conference Tournament, or NCAA Championship. They reached the NCAA championship game as freshmen in 1992 and again as sophomores in 1993. They lost to Duke 71–51 in the 1992 title game and lost 77–71 to North Carolina in 1993, a game which is remembered mostly for <b>Chris</b> <b>Webber's</b> costly [...] "timeout", which resulted in a technical foul as Michigan had no timeouts remaining.|$|R
5|$|Michigan {{basketball}} {{players have been}} successful in professional basketball. Fifty-eight have been drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA); twenty-six of those were first round draft picks, including both Cazzie Russell and <b>Chris</b> <b>Webber</b> who were drafted first overall. The 1990 NBA Draft in which Rumeal Robinson was selected 10th, Loy Vaught was selected 13th, and Terry Mills was selected 16th made Michigan the third of only ten schools that have ever had three or more players selected {{in the first round of}} the same draft. Five players have gone on to become NBA champions for a total of nine times and eight players have become NBA All-Stars a total of 18 times. Rudy Tomjanovich coached both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals Champions.

5|$|The Fab Five, the 1991 {{recruiting}} {{class of}} five freshman starters, were <b>Chris</b> <b>Webber,</b> Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having {{gone to the}} championship game of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy gym shorts, which was later popularized by Michael Jordan, and for wearing black athletic socks. Due to the Ed Martin scandal, the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been forfeited. Although Webber was {{the only member of}} the Fab Five officially implicated with the scandal, the reputation of the whole group has been tarnished. Webber (1993), Howard (1994) and Rose (1992, 1994) were college basketball All-Americans. and both King (1995 3rd team and 1993 & 1994 honorable mention) and Jackson (1995 2nd team & 1994 honorable mention) achieved All-Big Ten honors. All but Jackson played in the NBA. They were the subject of Mitch Albom's book entitled Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream, which at one point was under development by Fox Television as a made-for-television movie. In March 2011 ESPN broadcast a documentary, Fab Five, that was the network's highest-rated in its history.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2015, Davis {{signed a}} five-year, $145 million {{contract}} extension with the Pelicans. On November 6, he tied his career-high of 43 {{points in a}} loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On December 1, he tied a career-high 9 blocked shots in an offensive off night against the Memphis Grizzlies. On December 20, in a win over the Denver Nuggets, Davis scored a single-quarter career-high 19 first quarter points to finish the game with 27. On January 15, Davis converted an alley oop dunk from Jrue Holiday with 2 seconds remaining to give New Orleans a 109–107 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. On January 28, Davis was named as a reserve for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game. He again came close to a five-by-five with a 28-point, 10-rebound, 4-assist, 4-block, 4-steal effort on February 3 against the San Antonio Spurs. The following day, he {{was named to the}} NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge lineup. On February 21, in a win over the Detroit Pistons, Davis scored a franchise-record 59 points and pulled down 20 rebounds. The previous franchise record was 50 points by Jamal Mashburn exactly 13 years earlier against the Memphis Grizzlies. Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal and <b>Chris</b> <b>Webber</b> as the only NBA players with 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game since 1983. Davis also became just the 20th player in NBA history to score at least 59 points in a game, and became the youngest player in NBA history to score 59 points in a game, and the second youngest (behind Bob McAdoo) to record 50 points and 20 rebounds in a game. The 59 points was an NBA-wide season high at the time. The total was not surpassed until the final night of the season when Kobe Bryant posted 60 in his final career game. Davis posted a third 40-point game (40 points and 13 rebounds) on March 9 against the Charlotte Hornets. On March 20, he was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season with a left knee injury and a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Upon being deactivated, Davis claimed that he had been playing through left shoulder pain since his rookie season.|$|E
500|$|Another Michigan {{writer from}} SB Nation {{described}} {{the film as}} thorough {{in its ability to}} provide the viewer with the answers to natural intrigues such as: [...] "How was the recruiting class assembled? Who pushed for the baggy shorts? The black socks? How did a stodgy University of Michigan culture react to this bold, brash and outspoken team?" [...] Other columnists were also satisfied to learn that Rose came up with the shorts and Jackson came up with the socks. He also commended the film on its detail surrounding <b>Chris</b> <b>Webber's</b> infamous timeout in the 1993 NCAA championship. The same reviewer enumerated his five biggest omissions from the film: Michigan athletic director Bill Martin, 1991–92 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team, 1992–93 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team, Michael Talley and Webber. He was also critical of Mitch Albom's involvement with the Fab Five.|$|R

In 2013, in honor of the show's 50th anniversary celebration, Francis would reprise the role of Laura when the writers revisited the iconic Ice Princess plot, and Laura was briefly remarried to Scott. Although initial reports said the actress would stick around, Francis left the role again in August 2013. Francis returned to the series in 2015, this time as part of Luke's exit storyline. Francis later signed a deal for her to remain with the series indefinitely.|$|R
