5|$|Mihail Kogălniceanu {{was married}} to Ecaterina Jora (1827–1907), the widow of Iorgu Scorțescu, a Moldavian Militia colonel; they had more than eight {{children}} together (three of whom were boys). The eldest son, Constantin, studied Law and had a career in diplomacy, being the author of an unfinished work on Romanian history. Ion, his brother, was born in 1859 and died in 1892, being {{the only one of}} Mihail Kogălniceanu's male <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> heirs. His line was still surviving in 2001. Ion's son, also named Mihail, established the Mihail Kogălniceanu Cultural Foundation in 1935 (in 1939–1946, it published a magazine named Arhiva Românească, which aimed to be a new series of the one published during the 1840s; its other projects were rendered ineffectual by the outbreak of World War II).|$|E
5|$|The Justice Department {{filed the}} charges on February 15, 2013, and Jackson pleaded guilty on February 20, 2013 to {{one count of}} wire and mail fraud in {{connection}} with his misuse of $750,000 of campaign funds. On June 7, 2013, federal prosecutors indicated that they sought a four-year prison sentence for Jackson. On August 14, 2013, Jackson was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison, while wife Sandi was sentenced to 12 months in prison for filing false tax returns in attempt to conceal the crimes. The two sentences did not run concurrently. Rather, Jackson initially served prison time and upon his release, his wife was to begin her prison sentence shortly thereafter. The staggered sentences allowed for the Jackson <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> access {{to at least one}} parent during the time each is in prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

He also states that unemployment is the primary cause of child support arrears, and further states that these arrearages make the father subject to arrest and imprisonment without due process.|$|E
25|$|The London Boroughs of Harrow and Brent contain {{significant}} Irish Traveller populations. In {{addition to}} those on various official sites {{there are a number}} who are settled in local authority housing.

25|$|It is the {{privilege}} of married couples {{who are able to}} bear children to provide mortal bodies for the spirit children of God, whom they are then responsible to nurture and rear. The decision as to how many <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> and when to have them is extremely intimate and private and should be left between the couple and the Lord.

25|$|The {{marketing}} of human beings, particularly women, as objects for sexual use meant that elite men owned {{the vast majority}} of women they interacted with, and related to them as would masters to slaves. Being a slave meant relative lack of autonomy during this time period, and belonging to a harem caused a wife and her <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> little insurance of stability and continued support due to the volatile politics of harem life.|$|E
25|$|Parental {{views are}} perhaps the most {{essential}} factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society. The values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent's occupational status. Parents from the professional class tend to raise their children to become curious independent thinkers, while working class parents raise their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more communal perspective with a strong respect for authority. Middle class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values while working class parents emphasize external values.|$|E
25|$|Later that night, Viola Liuzzo, a white {{mother of}} five from Detroit {{who had come to}} Alabama to support voting rights for blacks, was assassinated by Ku Klux Klan members while she was {{ferrying}} marchers back to Selma from Montgomery. Among the Klansmen in the car from which the shots were fired was FBI informant Gary Rowe. Afterward, the FBI's COINTELPRO operation spread false rumors that Liuzzo {{was a member of the}} Communist Party and had abandoned her <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sexual relationships with African American activists.|$|E

25|$|Since the mid-1970s, Zucker {{has treated}} about 500 pre-adolescent gender-variant <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them accept the gender {{identity}} {{they were assigned}} at birth until they are at an age he believes they may determine their own gender identity. For children assigned as male at birth, Zucker asks parents to take away toys associated with girls and instruct the child not to play with or draw pictures of girls. Psychologist Darryl Hill wrote that Zucker and Bradley believed that reparative treatments can reduce rejection by enabling gender non-conforming children to mix with children of the same sex, reducing the possibility of adult gender dysphoria.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} of the school occurred after a visit to Mexico by Prime Minister of Japan Kakuei Tanaka. The Government of Japan donated 300 million yen to finance the school's construction in 1975. Tanaka later placed the school's first stone. The school, inaugurated by President of Mexico Luis Echeverría, and by Secretary of Education of Mexico Porfirio Muñoz Ledo, opened in September 1977. The governments of Japan and Mexico accredited the school. The Nisei in Mexico were the primary party who had the school built because they wanted their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the Japanese cultural heritage. In 1984 the high school was inaugurated. Takeo Fukuda, the Prime Minister of Japan, visited the school that year.|$|E
25|$|In one {{particularly}} controversial 1965 incident, white civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo {{was murdered by}} Ku Klux Klansmen, who gave chase and fired shots into her car after noticing that her passenger was a young black man; one of the Klansmen was Gary Thomas Rowe, an acknowledged FBI informant. The FBI spread rumors that Liuzzo {{was a member of}} the Communist Party and had abandoned her <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sexual relationships with African Americans involved in the Civil Rights Movement. FBI records show that J. Edgar Hoover personally communicated these insinuations to President Johnson. FBI informant Rowe has also been implicated in some of the most violent crimes of the 1960s civil rights era, including attacks on the Freedom Riders and the 1963 Birmingham, Alabama 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.|$|E

25|$|Stories are {{effective}} educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling {{can be seen}} as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the storylistener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities. Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening. As well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used to teach <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learningstyle would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.|$|E
500|$|The party {{regards the}} family to be a natural, {{necessary}} and basic element in a free society. It regards {{the family to}} be a carrier of traditions and culture, {{and to have a}} role in raising and caring for children. The party also wants all <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a right of visitation and care from both parents, and to secure everyones right to know who their biological parents are. The party opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2008, questioning how children would [...] "cope" [...] with the law.|$|E
500|$|As Hughes and Plath were legally {{married at}} the time of her death, Hughes {{inherited}} the Plath estate, including all her written work. Hughes has been condemned repeatedly for burning Plath's last journal, saying he [...] "did not want her <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to read it." [...] He lost another journal and an unfinished novel and instructed that a collection of Plath's papers and journals should not be released until 2013. Hughes has been accused of attempting to control the estate for his own ends, although royalties from Plath's poetry were placed into a trust account for their two children, Frieda and Nicholas.|$|E
