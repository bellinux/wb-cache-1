40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of downgrades in UK {{corporate}} credit ratings has exceeded {{the number of}} upgrades, leading some {{to conclude that the}} credit quality of UK companies has deteriorated.

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>rating</b> {{systems are}} complex {{processes}} and involve mainly two parties; {{a company and}} a bank. The complexity of a relationship between a company and a bank {{lies in the fact}} that a company usually has access to more information about the company than the bank. Hence, an auditor acts as a third party who validates the information involved in <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> <b>processes.</b> The purpose of this dissertation is to explore how auditing is being used in <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> <b>processes</b> and to identify the role auditing has. In addition, this study recognizes the use of auditing in both Denmark and Sweden, with a goal to compare and explore the differences between the countries. In order to collect secondary data, Danish and Swedish banks were interviewed. To be able to explore the rather newly discovered relationship between auditing and <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> <b>processes,</b> this study was carried out with an exploratory research design. In addition, this study is based on assumptions stated in the Agency Theory, the Positive Accounting Theory and the Stakeholder Model. Because the intention was to use existing theories, a deductive research approach was suitable. The empirical findings imply that auditing is being used in banks’ <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> <b>processes</b> to validate the information and to reduce the risk. The trustworthiness of auditors and the relationship between a company and a bank influence banks’ perceptions regarding the creditworthiness of companies. The role of auditing is rather common in Denmark and Sweden, whereas the amount of accessible information is higher in Sweden than in Denmark. The pattern is that more information diminishes the risk and implies that the role of auditing is less important. This study is limited to only taking the bank’s perceptions of auditing into consideration, leaving out other stakeholders. Moreover, the examination is restricted to Danish and Swedish banks. The findings are interesting for banks and small companies to consider, because they explain the importance of auditing other components such as customer relationship. As a conclusion, the findings would be appropriate for Swedish banks to review in order to evaluate possible consequences of the statutory audit...|$|R

The survey targeted 19 regional financial institutions, including regional banks and cooperative institutions in Japan. We found that soft information is used in lending decisions but is rarely used directly in loan pricing, and found that each branch exercises greater discretion in loan pricing.

Our evidence suggests that this positivity bias is driven by strategic behavior: Loan officers inflate proposed ratings in reaction to past downward corrections by their current approver. Moreover, experienced loan officers inflate those parameters of a credit rating which are least likely to be corrected by approvers. Overall, we find that internal control does not improve the informational efficiency of the credit assessment process...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> {{transitions}} exhibit a serial correlation also known as a rating drift. This is clearly confirmed by this analysis, which also reveals that the <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> migration <b>process</b> is additionally influenced by three non-observable hidden risk situations. This finding violates the common stationary assumption. The hidden risk situations in turn serially depend on each other in successive observation periods. Taken together, they represent the memory of a <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> transition <b>process</b> and influence the future transient process. To take this into account, I introduce an extension of a higher order Markov model and a new Markov mixture model. These models allow me to capture these inherent serial correlation structures, to bypass the stationary assumption and to model the process as time non-homogeneous. An algorithm is introduced to derive a single transition matrix with the new additional information. Finally, by means of different CVaR simulations by CreditMetrics, I show that the standard Markov process overestimates the economic risk...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relative importance}} of a shock to expected cash flows (i. e., cash-flow news) and a shock to expected discount rates (i. e., discount-rate news) in credit rating changes. Specifically, we use a Vector Autoregressive model to implement the return decomposition of Campbell and Shiller (Review of Financial Studies, 1, 1988, 195) and Vuolteenaho (Journal of Finance, 57, 2002, 233) to extract cash-flow news and discount-rate news from stock returns at the firm-level. We find that credit rating changes are, on average, more strongly associated with cash-flow news than with discount-rate news, consistent with cash-flow news being more permanent than discount-rate news. We further find that both cash-flow news and discount-rate news are more strongly related to credit rating changes when they convey negative information about firm value. This asymmetric association is consistent with the non-linear nature of default risk and with the fact that rating agencies incorporate bad news sooner than good news into their rating revisions.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{environmental}} factors on financial bottom lines {{is a concept}} that has been widely debated for decades. Research attempting to address the debate and provide answers for practitioners has resulted in mixed results. However our economies fall victim to the detrimental effects of climate change, the impacts of environmental hazards are becoming less deniable. The management of some the world’s largest corporations acknowledge this risk and recognize opportunity to mitigate their exposure to a changing climate often while increasing operational efficiency and creating a more sustainable future for the corporation. In the investment realm, an acceptance of the potential risk and opportunity of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors has grown with many investors now actively seeking out information pertaining to ESG allowing them to make better informed decisions and maximize the returns on their portfolio. However, the rating systems most depended on by investors have not necessarily moved at the same speed with environmental factors often still being overlooked in the research process.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to analyze {{benefits}} of {{the establishment of the}} European Rating Agency. The partial aim is to determine the influence of the credit ratings on economics situation in selected European countries and to analyze problems of current credit rating industry.

Non-perfect competition, weak transparency of the rating process and conflict of interest are considered as the most important problems of the credit rating agencies. By way of the analysis of the ability of the European Rating Agency to remove or at least to partially eliminate discussed problems has been found that the European Rating Agency {{would not be able to}} remove all problems of the credit rating industry.

40|$|Title: <b>Credit</b> <b>Rating</b> Impact on Information Environment – A {{study on}} the informational impact of credit ratings in {{financial}} markets using equity analysts’ performance as proxy. Introduction: The <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> agencies provide risk assessment for a massive amount of financial assets around the world. These risk assessments are in turn used by numerous different market participants. The general idea behind this industry is that the credit ratings provide additional information or alternatively increase the quality of information in financial markets. Recent studies (most of which is written after the financial crisis of 2008) argue that there are several issues in the <b>rating</b> <b>processes</b> leading to failure to provide accurate ratings. Other studies still claim that <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> agencies still provide useful information or alternatively increase the quality of information by sorting and ranking public knowledge of assets. We {{see the need for}} an investigating study examining the informational benefits of <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> in the information environment of markets. Research Approach: How does the issuing of credit ratings impact the information environment in financial markets? Purpose: The study aim to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} current and historical effects that credit ratings have, and have had, on the information quality of markets and hence the efficiency of markets. Method: Our study takes a deductive research approach where the methodology is one of a quantitative and explanatory character. To analyze the effects on market information we use the BKLS model (Barron, Kim, Lim & Stevens, 1998), which uses equity analysts’ performance as proxy for the information environment. These data are then used in a long-term time-series study looking for long-term changes in analysts’ performance with yearly observations. Furthermore we test the instant market effects on stock prices from the issuing of a <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> in a secondary short-term time-series study with daily observations. Conclusions: We find that the issuing of a <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> in fact decreases the amount/quality of information available in financial markets (both public and private information). We contribute these effects to conflicts of interest in the <b>rating</b> <b>processes</b> and agency problems in the relationship between issuer and <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> agency. Several practical examples of this are found such as ratings shopping, solicitation of ratings issuing, agencies offering consultant services and the lack of regulatory measures taken by regulators such as ESMA and SEC. We propose several ways of developing the research in this field; most importantly we want to see future studies on the differences between solicited/unsolicited issuing of ratings. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} which {{variables are}} statistically signi cant in a corporate <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> <b>process,</b> {{and if there}} has been a tightening in rating practice during and after the nancial crisis hit Europe in 2008. We investigate whether we can argue that the possible tightening of standards {{can be seen as a}} procyclical way of assessing credit ratings. By procyclical ratings we refer to CRAs' tendency to excessive downgrade in recession, leading to higher capital cost for the downgraded companies, thus leading to even poorer results and an intensi ed recession. Utilizing annual fundamental values from rms in the Eurozone and the UK from 2004 - 2012 with a Moody's rating, we nd indications for such a tightening of standards, but the evidence is not strong enough to draw any rigid conclusions. All our di erent models over predict post-crisis ratings, with signi cant di erence of means. Further we nd a general downgrading post-crisis of approximately 0. 75, where a value of 1 equals one subrank rating, adjusted for the e ects from corporate fundamental variables. Breaking it down into cross-section analysis, we nd strong evidence that some industries and regions may have experienced stricter standards than others. Our analysis is based on two di erent methods; (1) building models based on pre-crisis data using corporate nancials and macroeconomic variables to compare an out-of- sample estimation with the actual post-crisis ratings, and (2) using propensity score matching also using corporate nancials. nhhma...|$|E
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2015 Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 41). Credit stands for being monetary liable and rating stands for symbolic result of evaluation. But {{the combination of these}} two words defines more than their meaning; it is the process of evaluation to rate to someone’s creditworthiness. This concept got popularity after the financial crisis started over the globe. Usually banks and financial institutions are popular in case of lending or giving credit money which are deposited to them by depositors. And when a depositor fails to repay back both the bank/FI and creditor suffers. Continuity of these sufferings turns them to bankrupt. Eventually a country becomes bankrupt as the most influential sector in economics (banking sector) of the country defaults. From this point of view, some companies named Moody’s, Flitch and Standard & Poor had developed and remained practicing the concept of credit rating from more than 200 years back. Increase in occurrence of financial recession, the practice of credit rating was spreading over the world as countries’ were becoming financially insolvent. Credit Rating is two types; International credit rating (rating of a country) and national credit rating (rating of an institution/person). Many more organizations and associations like ICRA, ACRAA also emerged with the intention to regulate, control, formulate rules and to integrate this credit rating practice. At first its application was mandatory on Bank, FIs and NBFIs. Bit by bit, {{it turned out to be}} applicable on corporate business and SMEs too. Country’s credit rating is also compulsory for public finance and foreign aid sanction. Eventually, credit rating practice started in Bangladesh in 2002 with holding the hand of CRISL. Bangladesh Bank has also administrated BASEL accord and amended the credit rating act 1996. CRAB was the first mover of the industry which incorporated at 2004. Chain of command from top to bottom approach is maintained in <b>Credit</b> <b>Rating</b> <b>process</b> of CRAB. At first CRAB does an initial meeting with its client and takes information. Then a detail analysis is done on clients’ business model, financial condition, industry risk, operation risk, management, background, and credit facility. After that a group of credit rate debates and decides an appropriate rating maintain all the codes of conduct for the credit worthiness of the company. An award letter and credit rating report have to be submitted mentioning the rating to its client. In this report I’ve discussed about credit rating, credit rating in Bangladesh, requirements of rating in Bangladesh, about CRAB, details discussion on the <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> <b>process</b> at CRAB, brief discussion on the financial ratios, grading. In my internship report I have done an analysis on ABC Ltd. And it was rated A 3 which defines it has strong capacity to meet financial commitments. Over all, there are some recommendations on CRAB and its rating process. It can be said that importance of credit rating is increasing day by day. Proper rating can save a country to get bankrupt.

40|$|This {{research}} {{draws on}} neo-institutional theories {{to examine how}} the power of major bond rating agencies affects the corporate <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> <b>process.</b> Specifically, it analyzes {{the extent to which}} major corporate bond rating agencies encourage engagement in normative practices by corporate firms through the bond rating process. Contrary to initial hypotheses, bond rating agencies discourage firm emphasis on core competencies, shareholder value, and financialization, despite the popularity of these practices in the corporate sector. Additionally, the research finds that the high level of uncertainty and concentration of power that characterize the bond rating industry create an environment in which institutional myths about best practices contribute to rating decisions. Statistical models suggest that specific organizational forms and practices are rewarded by bond rating agencies regardless of their impact on firm health or default. Finally, this research examines how major rating agencies responded to mounting criticism of the financial rating industry using content analysis of 164 bond rating documents published by the two largest bond rating agencies (Moody's and Standard & Poor's), participant observation at a corporate credit rating workshop conducted by one of these major rating agencies, and statistical analysis. Findings demonstrate that bond rating agencies engage in impression management to bolster their claims to legitimacy, and this has ultimately led to a change in the rating process as they increasingly embrace the performance of objectivity. Statistical models demonstrate that in the interest of legitimacy, these powerful social actors have reduced the role of less reliably measured indicators of credit risk in the rating process which has ultimately undermined their unique contributions to the industry...|$|E

This paper studies a repeated principal-agent problem in which a regulator approves <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> agencies. <b>Credit</b> <b>rating</b> agencies may collude to assign inflated ratings. Yet we show that there exists an approval scheme which induces <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> agencies to assign correct ratings. <b>Credit</b> <b>rating</b> agencies Collusion Regulation...|$|R
40|$|Corporate <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> is a <b>process</b> to {{classify}} commercial enterprises {{based on their}} creditworthiness. Machine learning algorithms can construct classification models, but in general they do not tend to be 100 % accurate. Since {{they can be used}} as decision support for experts, interpretable models are desirable. Unfortunately, interpretable models are provided by only few machine learners. Furthermore, <b>credit</b> <b>rating</b> often is a multiclass problem with more than two rating classes. Due to this fact, multiclass classification is often achieved via meta-algorithms using multiple binary learners. However, most state-of-the-art meta-algorithms destroy the interpretability of binary models. In this study, we present Thresholder, a binary interpretable threshold-based disjunctive normal form (DNF) learning algorithm in addition to modifications of popular multiclass meta-algorithms which maintain the interpretability of our binary classifier. Furthermore, we present an approach to express doubt in the decision of our model. Performance and model size are compared with other interpretable approaches for learning DNFs (RIPPER) and decision trees (C 4. 5) as well as non-interpretable models like random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. We evaluate their performances on three real-life data sets divided into three rating classes. In this case study all threshold-based and interpretable models perform equallywell and significantly better than other methods. Our new Thresholder algorithm builds the smallest models while its performance is as good as the best methods of our case study. Furthermore, Thresholder marks many potential misclassifications in advance with a doubt label without increasing the classification error...|$|R
