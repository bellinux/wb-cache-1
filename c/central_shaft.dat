25|$|Propulsion was {{achieved}} through three propellers: two outboard or wing propellers had three blades, while the central propeller had four. The two lateral propellers were powered by reciprocating steam triple expansion, while the <b>central</b> <b>shaft</b> {{was driven by}} a steam turbine. All power on board was derived from a total of 29 coal-fired steam boilers in six compartments. However, Olympics boilers were adapted for firing by oil {{at the end of}} the First World War, which reduced the number of engine crew required from 350 to 60.|$|E
25|$|The Great Hall was {{a room of}} some size, 80ft long by 22ft wide. The {{floor of}} the room was Hopton Wood stone, and it had a {{panelled}} wagon roofed ceiling. The wall were panelled to 10ft high in old oak, and above the panelling hung 17th century tapestries. On the south wall were several traceried windows, consisting of two tiers of four very narrow lights. The upper lights were trefoil headed having such massive framework that the <b>central</b> <b>shaft</b> is equal in width to the lights. On the west wall was a stone mullioned leaded light window some 20ft in height.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the many {{individual}} pits transferred to larger mine complexes with <b>central</b> <b>shafts,</b> at which point the sinking of inclined shafts and the mixing of layout and equipment with the workings was abandoned entirely. The <b>central,</b> vertical <b>shafts</b> lay in the host rock (usually in the hanging wall), just as permanently established as the main gangways (usually in the footwall).|$|R
50|$|The tail {{has evolved}} for support, {{clinging}} and climbing, {{acting as a}} third leg or tripod. The pygostyle (tail vertebrae) is larger for strong tail muscles to be inserted and it {{is more or less}} stiff. There are six pairs of tail feathers, the middle feathers of which have strong <b>central</b> <b>shafts</b> for extra support.|$|R

25|$|Many {{specimens}} {{preserve a}} pair of long, narrow tail feathers, which grew longer than {{the entire length of}} the rest of the body. Unlike the feathers of most modern birds, these feathers were not differentiated into a central quill and barbs for most of their length. Rather, most of the feather formed a ribbon-like sheet, about six millimetres wide. Only at the last one quarter of the feather, towards the rounded tip, does the feather become differentiated into a <b>central</b> <b>shaft</b> with interlocking barbs. Many individuals of Confuciusornis lacked even these two tail feathers, possibly due to sexual dimorphism. The rest of the tail around the pygostyle was covered in short, non-aerodynamic feather tufts similar to the contour feathers of the body, rather than the familiar feather fan of modern bird tails.|$|E
25|$|There were {{originally}} three lighthouse keepers {{with their families}} on the island. The initial rotating light mechanism had to be wound up hourly, and in 1883, the principal lighthouse keeper died when he fell down the <b>central</b> <b>shaft</b> trying to attach weights to the mechanism. In 1977, the number of lighthouse keepers were reduced from two to one due to operational improvements. There was a Committee of Inquiry into lighthouse automation in 1981 and the Dog Island site was one of nine sites throughout New Zealand that was to remain staffed; in this case, {{it was due to}} its remoteness, and its ability to help with search and rescue in the area. In August 1989, Dog Island was fully automated and the last permanent lighthouse keeper in New Zealand was withdrawn from service. The lighthouse is remote controlled from Maritime New Zealand's Wellington office.|$|E
25|$|Having {{the beam}} {{connected}} to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant {{that it was possible}} to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating <b>central</b> <b>shaft,</b> belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E

500|$|When {{design work}} began, the navy {{department}} {{was asked to}} submit new requirements to fix deficiencies found in the preceding battlecruiser classes, which primarily covered propulsion systems and the main armament. Previous battlecruisers used a four shaft arrangement for their engines; reducing the number to three would allow the new ships to equip a diesel engine on the <b>central</b> <b>shaft.</b> This would substantially increase the cruising range, and would ease the transfer of fuel and {{reduce the number of}} crew needed to operate the ships' machinery. The navy department also argued for an increase in the main battery guns, from 28-centimeter (11in) guns to 30.5cm (12in) weapons. This was because the latest British battleships had thicker main belt armor, up to [...] Since the German battlecruisers were intended to fight in the line of battle, their armament needed to be sufficiently powerful to penetrate the armor of their British opponents. Weight increases were managed by reducing the number of guns, from 10 to 8—the increase in gun caliber added only 36tons to the ships' displacement. Tirpitz argued against the increase in gun caliber, for he thought the 28cm gun was powerful enough.|$|E

50|$|Logrunners as a {{group are}} characterised within their group by their {{distinctive}} tail feathers where the rachis (or <b>central</b> <b>shafts)</b> of the tail feathers protrude and are stiffened. The broad tail of the bird is less than four inches (10 cm) in length and the strong protruding rachis {{at the ends of}} the tail feathers are almost void of the usual barbs, giving the feather the appearance of spines. This appearance gives rise to some of the common names for the bird such as spine-tail or spine-tailed logrunner.|$|R
50|$|Sectional coolers {{work with}} {{indirect}} water cooling. The cooling water reaches {{the space between}} the several chambers by an internal <b>central</b> hollow <b>shaft.</b> It circulates between and around the chambers and leaves the cooler through an external <b>central</b> hollow <b>shaft.</b> The product which is to cool usually falls directly into the product feed housing. By the rotary movement and the conveyor elements the product is conveyed to other end of the cooler. The rotation causes a permanent mixing of the product in the chambers and hence a good heat transfer.|$|R
2500|$|Digging the <b>Central</b> <b>Shaft</b> {{also allowed}} workers to open two {{additional}} faces to excavate: once the shaft was complete in 1870 workers dug outwards {{from the center}} to meet the tunnels being dug from {{the east and west}} portals.

2500|$|Pagodas {{originally}} were reliquaries and did {{not contain}} sacred images, but in Japan many, for example Hōryū-ji's five-storied pagoda, enshrine statues of various deities. To allow {{the opening of a}} room at the ground floor and therefore create some usable space, the pagoda's <b>central</b> <b>shaft,</b> which originally reached the ground, was shortened to the upper stories, where it rested on supporting beams. In that room are enshrined statues of the temple's main objects of worship. Inside Shingon pagodas there can be paintings of deities called on the ceiling and on the <b>central</b> <b>shaft</b> there can be decorations and paintings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1910, {{the tunnel}} was {{electrified}} {{with the goal}} of reducing smoke and increasing the speed of traffic. Three years later, traffic within the tunnel was so heavy, at 70,000 cars a month, that the power plant in Adams, with its 6000kW generator, could not keep up. Power was then drawn from a nearby dam three miles north of the eastern entrance. In 1926, three thousand feet of the western end of the tunnel were deepened by a foot and a [...] half. Electrification ended in the tunnel in 1946 with the advent of diesel locomotives, and a fan was installed in the <b>Central</b> <b>Shaft</b> to remove diesel fumes. As of 2016, the <b>Central</b> <b>Shaft</b> system remains in place; however, ventilation relies on a single fan operating on low power on account of the low number of trains on the line.|$|E
