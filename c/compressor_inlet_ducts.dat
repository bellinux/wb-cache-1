The impeller and diffuser form the basic components of a centrifugal compressor. The vaneless diffuser is primarily used for low or moderate pressure ratios and it provides wide operating range. Centrifugal compressor usually discharges non-uniform flow into the diffuser. This nature of exit flow from the impeller deteriorates {{the performance of the}} down stream vaneless diffuser. The development of the flow in a wide vaneless diffuser with a radial- bladed impeller upstream of it is the subject matter of this paper. The results are being reported in terms of variation of radial velocity, total pressure and flow angle along the radial path of the vaneless diffuser. The results are presented for the flow rate corresponding to maximum point of the characteristics of the <b>compressor</b> for three <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> shapes. Besides the performance parameters like static pressure rise coefficient, total pressure loss coefficient and pressure recovery coefficient for all these cases have also been presented. The results depict a strong dependence of vaneless performance and flow behavior on the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> shapes and flow rate.

Numerical simulating of the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> is carried out. Implementation process of this method is discussed in detail. With processing the data of solving results, parameters in capture area are got under different Inlet Velocity Ratio (IVR) condition with this method. Efficiency and hydraulic loss of the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> are calculated for the waterjet propulsor. The results are compared with that got with semi-elliptical fitting method. The calculation results obtained with both methods show good consistency. When IVR equals to 0. 6, the efficiency reaches a maximum value, about 0. 943. And the hydraulic loss reaches a minimum value, about 0. 76. In the whole IVR range, the relative error of efficiency between these two methods is less than 0. 2 %. The relative error of hydraulic loss of the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> between these two methods is less than 1. 3 %. The calculating process and results show that this method is convenient to calculate efficiency and hydraulic loss of the waterjet propulsor <b>inlet</b> <b>duct.</b> It can be easily inserted into automatic optimization process of an <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> to improve thrust performance of vehicles equipped with waterjet propulsors...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of “buzz-saw” noise in a turbofan <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> necessitates consideration of nonlinear acoustics, modelling a complete fan blade set, modelling an acoustic liner, and calculations at high frequencies. A recent series of papers has described new work concerning {{the application of}} one-dimensional propagation models to the {{prediction of}} buzz-saw noise. A numerical model, termed the frequency domain numerical solution or FDNS, has been developed. It can be used to calculate the nonlinear propagation of the rotor-alone pressure field in either a rigid or acoustically-lined <b>inlet</b> <b>duct.</b> From this the in-duct noise level of the buzz-saw tones can be determined. In previous work, validation of this method by comparison with in-duct noise measurements has been limited to rigid <b>inlet</b> <b>ducts,</b> {{because of the lack of}} availability of suitable measurements from lined ducts. In this article new measurements of buzz-saw noise in an acoustically-lined <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> are utilized. A comparison of measurements of buzz-saw noise in a lined <b>inlet</b> <b>duct,</b> and noise predictions from numerical simulations by the FDNS is presented. The detailed measurements reveal the effect of an acoustic liner on buzz-saw noise. The suitability of the numerical model to be used to provide realistic noise predictions for supersonic ducted fans is also examined...|$|R

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model {{of an open}} combined regenerative Brayton and inverse Brayton cycles with regeneration before the inverse cycle is established in this paper by using thermodynamic optimization theory. The flow processes of the working fluid with the pressure drops and the size constraint of the real power plant are modeled. There are  13  flow resistances encountered by the working fluid stream for the cycle model. Four of these, the friction through the blades and vanes of the compressors and the turbines, {{are related to the}} isentropic efficiencies. The remaining nine flow resistances are always present because of the changes in flow cross-section at the <b>compressor</b> <b>inlet</b> of the top cycle, regenerator inlet and outlet, combustion chamber inlet and outlet, turbine outlet of the top cycle, turbine outlet of the bottom cycle, heat exchanger <b>inlet,</b> and <b>compressor</b> <b>inlet</b> of the bottom cycle. These resistances associated with the flow through various cross-sectional areas are derived as functions of the <b>compressor</b> <b>inlet</b> relative pressure drop of the top cycle, and control the air flow rate, the net power output and the thermal efficiency. The analytical formulae about the power output, efficiency and other coefficients are derived with 13 pressure drop losses. It is found that the combined cycle with regenerator can reach higher thermal efficiency but smaller power output than those of the base combined cycle at small <b>compressor</b> <b>inlet</b> relative pressure drop of the top cycle...|$|R
40|$|Fan {{noise is}} one of the {{principal}} noise sources generated by a turbofan aero-engine. At supersonic fan speeds, fan tones are generated by the “rotor-alone” pressure field. In general, these tones can be well absorbed by an <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> acoustic liner, apart from at high supersonic fan speeds. However, in practice <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> liners contain acoustically hard longitudinal splices which cause scattering. This leads to acoustic energy being scattered into a range of different azimuthal mode orders, similar to the modal content resulting from rotor–stator interactions. The effectiveness of an <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> lining is reduced because acoustic energy is scattered into modes that are poorly absorbed by the liner. In this article, the effect of this acoustic scattering is examined by three-dimensional finite-element simulations of sound transmission in a turbofan <b>inlet</b> <b>duct.</b> Results include predictions of the sound power transmission loss with different splice widths, and at different supersonic fan speeds. These results demonstrate how acoustic scattering by liner splices can adversely affect fan tone noise levels at low supersonic fan speeds, but have little adverse affect on noise levels at high supersonic fan speeds. The potential noise benefit that could be achieved by manufacturing thinner splices is also examined...|$|R

40|$|Turbofan engine-face flow {{distortion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} troublesome and least understood problems for designers of modern engine inlet systems. One concern is that there are numerous sources of flow-field distortion that are ingested by the inlet or generated within the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> itself.
