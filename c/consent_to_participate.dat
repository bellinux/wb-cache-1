50|$|To be ethical, {{researchers}} must obtain the full and voluntary informed consent of participating human subjects. If {{the subject is}} unable to consent for him/herself, researchers can seek consent from the subject's legally authorized representative. For a minor child this is typically a parent or guardian since as {{under the age of}} 18 cannot legally give <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in a clinical trial.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{researchers}} conduct {{clinical research}} on human subjects by asking volunteers to give informed <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> {{in an experiment}} by taking drugs that {{have not always been}} proven safe or effective in humans, though their safety has been tested (usually in animals) prior to any human trials. At the HVTN, many current vaccine studies are using products with a safety record that has been established in previous human trials.|$|E
50|$|Patients at the Clinical Center <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in {{research}} studies, also called protocols, and are treated without charge.

5000|$|Operation Whitecoat was a {{biodefense}} {{medical research}} program {{carried out by}} the United States Army at Fort Detrick, Maryland between 1954 and 1973. The program pursued medical research using volunteer enlisted personnel who were eventually nicknamed [...] "Whitecoats". These volunteers, all conscientious objectors, including many members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, were informed of the purpose and goals of each project before providing <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in any project. The stated purpose of the research was to defend troops and civilians against biological weapons and it was believed that the Soviet Union was engaged in similar activities.|$|E
50|$|A special {{informed}} consent problem happened historically with biobanks. Previous to {{the advent of}} biobanks, researchers would ask specimen donors for <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in a single study, and give participants information about that study. In a biobank system, a researcher may have many specimens collected over many years and then long after the donors gave the sample, that researcher may want to conduct a new study using those samples but have no good way to give donors information about that study and collect their consent. This problem was first identified in widespread publication in 1995 when an article on this topic was published.|$|E

5000|$|California {{law allows}} SVPs to be {{committed}} to the hospital indefinitely (under Jessica's Law) while they are ostensibly receiving treatment. It was believed that holding the [...] "sex offenders" [...] indefinitely at the mental hospital would prevent them for committing additional sex crimes. But treatment is in short supply. Significant treatment at Coalinga is rare. Moreover, 80% of sexual offenders have refused therapy. Three-quarters of CSH's 850-plus detainees refuse to participate in a core treatment program, undermining a central piece of Coalinga State Hospital's purported mission. The vast majority refuse to participate beyond the first phase of a five-phase therapy regimen. Only 25 to 30 percent of sexually violent predators <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the active phases of California's sex offender treatment program.|$|E
50|$|Research should cause no harm to {{subjects}}, at {{no point}} should subjects feel distressed. Deception needs {{to be left out}} of the research process, under no circumstance should a researcher lie to their subjects. Participation in research should be voluntary, and therefore subjects must give their informed <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the research. Researchers should be very cautious when dealing with vulnerable clients (persons who are mentally ill, incarcerated people, or minors) they should make sure to get the proper consent. Researchers should fully disclose their identity. Anonymity or confidentiality must be maintained for individual research participants unless it is voluntary and explicitly waived. Actively attempt to remove from the research records any elements that might indicate the subjects identities. And finally, benefits from a research project should outweigh any foreseeable risks.|$|E
50|$|A {{study by}} East and Rook tested the {{compensation}} value of sibling relationships among unpopular early adolescents. Specifically, the researchers hypothesised that peer-rejected {{children would have}} less supportive school friendships than more average peers, and that while such children would have more social and emotional problems they would also derive more support from a peer alternative, alleviating their difficulties. The peer alternative could be either a sibling or a nonschool friend. The study drew {{from a group of}} 450 sixth-grade subjects (average age 12), who again were mostly middle class male and female students who had received parental <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate.</b> Unlike Rubin et al.'s longitudinal study, East and Rook used a cross-sectional design. Although this avoided any attrition problems, a selection was still possible: 35% of the parents of eligible adolescents declined to allow their children to participate, for largely unstated reasons.|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} {{approved}} by the Ethic Committee of Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University (2002 - 18 - 1 J).

30|$|The {{study was}} {{approved}} by the appropriate ethics committees in France (CEERB Bichat, 0235) and Belgium (a different IRB for Brussels and Ghent) and declared on clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.Gov: NCT 01172132). All patients or relatives were informed and <b>consented</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the study and to publications.|$|R
50|$|After {{the study}} ended, many poor, African-American {{children}} {{ended up with}} neurological disabilities as a result, often incurring permanent nervous damage. Therefore, the study was not beneficial for the children themselves {{in terms of their}} health. In addition to having to cope with the impacted health of their children, parents also felt deceived by KKI team by being shown housing without full details behind the lead treatment quality of the properties they stayed in. Thus, criticism was made that both the children and parents were exploited by the study. Naturally, comparisons were made to the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study due to the similar affected demographic groups, in terms of race and class, lack of clear and explicit <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in each study, lack of adequate care provided during each study, and the long-term, devastating impact of the study’s condition on the subject’s quality of life. Parallels between arguments on the implications and benefits of the research for each study followed suit, strengthening the idea that among other social and economic fronts, minorities also faced discrimination in the context of medicine.|$|E
50|$|The Location Privacy Protection Act of 2012 (S.1223) was {{introduced}} by Senator Al Franken (D-MN) in order to regulate the transmission and sharing of user location data in USA. It {{is based on the}} individual's one time <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in these services (Opt In). The bill specifies the collecting entities, the collectable data and its usage. The bill does not specify, however, the period of time that the data collecting entity can hold on to the user data (a limit of 24 hours seems appropriate since most of the services use the data for immediate searches, communications, etc.), and the bill does not include location data stored locally on the device (the user should be able to delete the contents of the location data document periodically just as he would delete a log document). The bill which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would also require mobile services to disclose the names of the advertising networks or other third parties with which they share consumers' locations.|$|E

Here, only the digital story texts of the 23 students who <b>consented</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> {{in this research}}, remained in school for the duration of the project, and completed their digital stories were analysed thematically (Pinnegar & Hamilton, 2011) and we looked explicitly at their talk about the future.
