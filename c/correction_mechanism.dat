Although good designed retransmission schemes can be optimal with respect to energy efficiency, they can introduce problems to fulfill the required QoS of an application. Since the channel conditions and the requirements vary dynamically, we concentrate on adaptive implementations of error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> traditionally optimize the performance and provide an optimal solution to withstand all possible errors.

The exact implementation of this mechanism will be defined individually by each Member State, but it has to comply with the basic principles outlined in a directive published by the European Commission. This directive was published in June 2012, and outlined common principles for the role and independence of institutions (such as a Fiscal Advisory Council) responsible at the national level for monitoring the observance of the rules, {{which is one of the}} key elements to ensure that the [...] "automatic correction mechanism" [...] will actually work.

5000|$|Member states {{bound by}} the Fiscal Compact have to {{transpose}} into national legal order {{the provisions of the}} Fiscal Compact. In particular, national budget has to be in balance or surplus under the treaty's definition. An automatic <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> has to be established to correct potential significant deviations. A national independent monitoring institution should be mandated to provide fiscal surveillance. The treaty defines a balanced budget as a general budget deficit not exceeding 3.0% {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP), and a structural deficit not exceeding a country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO) which at most can be set to 0.5% of GDP for states with a debt&#8209;to&#8209;GDP ratio exceeding 60% - or at most 1.0% of GDP for states with debt levels within the 60%-limit. The country-specific MTOs are recalculated every third year and might be set at stricter levels compared to what the treaty allows at most. The treaty also contains a direct copy of the [...] "debt brake" [...] criteria outlined in the Stability and Growth Pact, which defines the rate at which debt levels above the limit of 60% of GDP shall decrease.|$|E
5000|$|Correction {{of deficit}} deviations: If a {{significant}} deviation (more than 0.5% of GDP) from the MTO or the adjustment path towards it, is observed on {{basis of an}} overall assessment with the structural balance as a reference (including analysis of the [...] "expenditure benchmark"), the automatic <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> shall immediately correct the situation through implementation of counter measures being effective after {{a short period of}} time, unless the deviation has been caused by [...] "extraordinary events outside control of the Member State" [...] or the arrival of a [...] "severe economic downturn". In June 2014, the Council endorsed the following cited method to assess whether or not [...] "effective action" [...] {{during the course of the}} past two years had been taken by a state with an open ongoing EDP, which is checked for to figure out if the state managed to follow its required [...] "adjustment path towards respecting its MTO" [...] or should have implemented additional corrective measures through its automatic <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> during the period: The assessment starts by comparing the headline deficit target and the recommended improvement in the structural balance, as notified by the latest Council recommendation to the state, with the headline deficit and the apparent fiscal effort measured by the change in structural budget balance. If not achieved, the Commission will carry out a [...] "careful analysis" [...] based on (1) a top-down assessment of the adjusted change of the structural balance (adjusting for: (i) the impact of revisions in potential GDP growth compared with the growth scenario underpinning the Council recommendation, (ii) the impact of revenue windfalls/shortfalls relative to the ones used in the baseline scenario, and (iii) the negative impact of the changeover to ESA 2010 on the cost of tax credits) and (2) a bottom-up assessment of the consolidation measures undertaken by the authorities for the period in concern (which differs from the adjusted top-down assessment by calculating the structural adjustment effort unaffected by potential changes in public debt interest rates and potential changes of the GDP deflator - compared to the forecast figures utilized by the baseline scenario in the previous 126(7) report calling for [...] "effective action to end an excessive deficit"). In the event that both (1)+(2) return a shortfall for the targeted structural deficit improvements, the state will be deemed not to have implemented the required amount of corrective measures, equal to the launch of a 126(9) report requiring immediate effective action to be taken to make up for the recorded shortfall.|$|E

If any state legally bound by the fiscal provisions (Title III of the treaty) is reported to have a non-compliant implementation law, or if any ratifying state believes another states implementation law is non-compliant after the deadline for compliance, then the Court of Justice can be asked to judge the case, and in the event of finding support for the claim it will submit an enforcement ruling setting a final deadline for compliance. If the non-compliance continues after expiry of the new extended deadline ruled by the Court of Justice, then it can impose a penalty of up to 0.1% of GDP against the concerned state.

In the presence of such mechanisms should decisions be reached unanimously or through a majority rule? We demonstrate that judicial reviews do not in general make effects-based decision approaches more attractive than Per Se. However, by reducing false-convictions costs and increasing false-acquittals costs of effects-based procedures they tend to make these more attractive than Per Se when the former effect outweighs the latter. Further, judicial reviews and internal error-correction mechanisms subject to unanimity reduce deterrence. Mor...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is the {{development}} of models for converging economies. After discussing models of balanced growth, univariate models of the gap between per capital income in two economies are examined. The preferred models combine unobserved components with an error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> and allow a decomposition into trend, cycle and convergence components. A new type of second-order error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> is shown to be particularly useful in this respect. The levels of per capita income in two economies may be modelled jointly by bivariate convergence models. These models generalise balanced growth models and can be based on autoregressive or unobserved components formulations. Both approaches provide coherent forecasts but the unobserved components models also yield a description of trends, cycles and convergence components. The methods are applied to data on the US and Japan. The generalisation to multivariate series is then set out. cycles, balanced growth, error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism,</b> stochastic trend, unobserved components...|$|E
