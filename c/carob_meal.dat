40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of increasing the level of two sources of fibrous by-products, orange pulp (OP) and <b>carob</b> <b>meal</b> (CM), in iso-NDF growing-finishing pig diets on nutrient balance, slurry composition and potential ammonia (NH 3) and methane (CH 4) emissions. Thirty pigs (85. 4 ± 12. 3 kg) were fed five iso-nutritive diets: a commercial control wheat/barley (C) and four experimental diets including two sources of fibrous by-products (OP and CM) and two dietary levels (75 and 150 g/kg) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. After a 14 -day adaptation period, faeces and urine were collected separately for 7 days to measure nutrient digestibility and the excretory patterns of N from pigs (6 replicates per diet) housed individually in metabolic pens. For each animal, the derived NH 3 and CH 4 emissions were measured in samples of slurry over an 11 - and 100 -day storage periods, respectively. Source and level of the fibrous by-products affected digestion efficiency {{in a different way}} as the coefficients of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) for dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), fibre fractions and gross energy increased with OP but decreased with CM (P < 0. 05). Crude protein CTTAD decreased with the inclusion of both sources of fibre, being lower at the highest dietary level. Faecal concentration of fibre fractions increased (P < 0. 05) with the level of inclusion of CM but decreased with that of OP (P < 0. 01). High dietary level for both sources of fibre increased (P < 0. 02) CP faecal content but urine N content decreased (from 205 to 168 g/kg DM, P < 0. 05) in all the fibre-supplemented compared to C diet. Additionally, the proportions of undigested dietary, water soluble, and bacterial and endogenous debris of faecal N excretion were not affected by treatments. The initial slurry characteristics did not differ among different fibre sources and dietary levels, except pH, which decreased at the highest by-product inclusion levels. Ammonia emission per kg of slurry was lower in all the fibre-supplemented diets than in C diet (from 2. 44 to 1. 81 g, P < 0. 05). Additionally, slurries from the highest dietary level of by-products tended (P < 0. 06) to emit less NH 3 per kg of initial total Kjeldahl N and showed a lower B 0, independently of the fibre source. Thus, the fibre sources and their dietary levels affected pig nutrient digestion and composition of urine and faeces, showing potential to decrease NH 3 and CH 4 emissions at high levels of inclusion, independently of type of fibre...|$|E
50|$|<b>Carob</b> pod <b>meal</b> {{is used as}} an {{energy-rich}} feed for livestock, {{particularly for}} ruminants, though its high tannin content may limit its use. Carob pods were mainly used as animal fodder in the Maltese Islands, apart from times of famine or war when they formed part of the diet of many Maltese. In the Iberian Peninsula, carob pods were used to feed donkeys.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the in vivo {{anthelmintic}} activity of sainfoin hay (Onobrychis viciifolia) and <b>carob</b> pod <b>meal</b> (Ceratonia siliqua) against gastrointestinal nematodes. Seven days before infection, 64 naive lambs were assigned to four different groups: Group S received sainfoin hay and group CAR was fed with carob pods. The remaining lambs received lucerne hay (Medicago sativa) and were assigned to positive (non-treated, NT) and negative (treated, T) control groups (treatment with albendazole). On day 0, lambs were artificially trickle infected for 6  weeks, with a mixture of infective larvae of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Parasitological and pathophysiological parameters were measured repeatedly during the 2 -month study. Compared to the NT group, decreases in egg excretion were observed in the CAR and S groups with significant differences only found for sainfoin (p <  0. 05). At necropsy, group S showed decreases in the total worm numbers of both nematode species with significant differences for H. contortus. In contrast, no differences were noticed for the CAR group. Compared to the NT group, lower values for fecundity of female H. contortus were found in the S and CAR groups, however differences were non-significant. No differences in body weight gains were found between groups. Consistent results were found showing significantly higher packed cell volume (PCV) values in the T and S groups compared to NT and CAR groups. Overall, these results confirm a positive effect associated with the feeding of lambs with tanniniferous resources on host resilience (PCV values) and against gastrointestinal parasitic nematodes by affecting some biological traits of worm populations (e. g. eggs per gram of faeces and worm numbers). However, the anthelmintic effects differed between the two tannin-containing resources, which might be associated with the quantity and/or quality of secondary metabolites (condensed tannins and/or other polyphenols) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of gastric evacuation rates (GERs) and digesta content, moisture and pH values along the gastrointestinal tract was performed between gilthead sea bream and European sea bass. In order to distinguish species-specific differences from diet-elicited effects, all parameters were determined under either a fishmeal diet or a <b>carob</b> seed germ <b>meal</b> diet that contained high levels of total and soluble non-starch polysaccharides. GERs were significantly different between species {{and they were not}} affected by diet. Similarly, species-specific patterns were revealed in the distribution of digesta and water content along the gastrointestinal tract. In sea bream, stomach digesta and water content decreased with time, whereas in sea bass stomach retained the highest digesta and water content throughout the sampling period. The anterior and distal intestine exhibited the lowest accommodating capacities of digesta and water in either species. Overall, sea bream performed stomach digestion at lower hydration levels and higher pH compared with sea bass. Diet affected stomach moisture in both species and pH of stomach digesta in sea bass and of all intestinal sections in sea bream. The results obtained indicated that water and inorganic ion exchanges through the gut may differentiate between the species and warrant further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of <b>carob</b> seed germ <b>meal</b> (CSGM) as a soybean meal (SBM) replacement {{in the diet}} of red tilapia hybrid was evaluated in an 8 -week feeding trial. Five isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets with increasing CSGM (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 %), {{at the expense of}} SBM, were fed to triplicated groups of tilapia fingerlings. Their growth, feeding efficiency, whole body proximate composition, selected plasma biochemical parameters, and liver and gut histopathology were assessed. The survival and growth of red tilapia were unaffected by the dietary CSGM inclusion up to 30 %. Growth and feeding efficiencies were significantly reduced at 40 % CSGM inclusion. Hematocrit and body crude lipid were significantly lower (p <  0. 05) in fish fed 30 – 40 % CSGM while plasma ALT and protein were significantly higher compared to the control (0 % CSGM). In addition, some instances of lipofuscin and cellular degradation were shown in liver while morphological changes were observed in fish fed 30 and 40 % CSGM. Some of these included a 60 % and 34 % reduction in goblet cell prevalence and villi length, respectively, as well as a thickening of the intestinal mucosal and submucosa layers of 51 and 27 %, respectively as dietary CSGM increased from 0 to 40 %, that was likely due to increased anti-nutritional factors. In conclusion, a dietary inclusion of only up to 20 % untreated CSGM was recommended for red hybrid tilapia...|$|R
40|$|Ghrelin is an orexigenic {{hormone that}} may affect {{substrate}} utilization in humans. Ghrelin is influenced by macronutrients, but the effects of insoluble dietary fiber and polyphenols are unknown. We investigated {{the effects of a}} polyphenol-rich insoluble dietary fiber preparation from carob pulp (carob fiber) on postprandial ghrelin responses and substrate utilization. Dose-dependent effects of the consumption of carob fiber were investigated in a randomized, single-blind, crossover study in 20 healthy subjects, aged 22 - 62 y. Plasma total and acylated ghrelin, triglycerides, and serum insulin and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) levels were repeatedly assessed before and after ingestion of an isocaloric standardized liquid meal with 0, 5, 10, or 20 g of carob fiber over a 300 -min period. The respiratory quotient (RQ) was determined after consumption of 0 or 20 g of carob fiber. Carob fiber intake lowered acylated ghrelin to 49. 1 %, triglycerides to 97. 2 %, and NEFA to 67. 2 % compared with the control meal (P &# 60; 0. 001). Total ghrelin and insulin concentrations were not affected by consumption of a <b>carob</b> fiber-enriched liquid <b>meal.</b> Postprandial energy expenditure was increased by 42. 3 % and RQ was reduced by 99. 9 % after a liquid <b>meal</b> with <b>carob</b> fiber compared with a control meal (P &# 60; 0. 001). We showed that the consumption of a carob pulp preparation, an insoluble dietary fiber rich in polyphenols, decreases postprandial responses of acylated ghrelin, triglycerides, and NEFA and alters RQ, suggesting a change toward increased fatty acid oxidation. These results indicate that carob fiber might exert beneficial effects in energy intake and body weight...|$|R
40|$|Social {{dominance}} {{is widely}} known to facilitate access to food resources in many animal {{species such as}} deer. However, research has {{paid little attention to}} dominance in ad libitum access to food because it was thought not to result in any benefit for dominant individuals. In this study we assessed if, even under ad libitum conditions, social rank may allow dominant hinds to consume the preferred components of food. Forty-four red deer hinds (Cervus elaphus) were allowed to consume ad libitum meal consisting of pellets of sunflower, lucerne and orange, and seeds of cereals, corn, cotton, and <b>carob</b> tree. The <b>meal</b> was placed only in one feeder, which reduced accessibility to a few individuals simultaneously. During seven days, feeding behavior (order of access, time to first feeding bout, total time spent feeding, and time per feeding bout) were assessed during the first hour. The relative abundance of each meal component was assessed at times 0, 1 and 5 h, as well as its nutritional composition. Social rank was positively related to {{the amount of time spent}} feeding during the 1 (st) h (P = 0. 048). Selection indices were positively correlated with energy (P = 0. 018 during the 1 (st) h and P = 0. 047 from 1 (st) to 5 (th)) and fat (only during the 1 (st) h; P = 0. 036), but also negatively with certain minerals. Thus, dominant hinds could select high energy meal components for longer time under an ad libitum but restricted food access setting. Selection indices showed a higher selectivity when food availability was higher (1 (st) hour respect to 1 (st) to 5 (th)). Finally, high and low ranking hinds had longer time per feeding bout than mid ones (P = 0. 011), suggesting complex behavioral feeding tactics of low ranking social ungulates...|$|R
