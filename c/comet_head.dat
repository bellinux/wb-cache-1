5000|$|The early 80s saw Thommessen {{gradually}} employing quotes and well-known phrases as {{basis for}} some of his works. The initial works that would later constitute his full-length concert opera A Glass Bead Game saw {{the light of day}} during this period: From a Glass Bead Game featuring themes from Beethoven and Verdi - premiered by the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra in 1980, Macrofantasy On Grieg's, 'Piano Concerto in a Minor', Op. 16 premiered by the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra in 1981 and Beyond Neon performed by the Minnesota Symphony Orchestra in 1982. Through a Prism was penned in 1982. As composer in residence at the 1982 Bergen International Festival, Thommessen’s piano work EingeBACHt saw its premiere at the festival as did a performance of the final version of his opera The Hermaphodite - a work that was premiered earlier the same year by the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. The same year also saw Thommessen composing the stage music for a version of Romeo and Juliet performed at the unveiling of the Norwegian Theatre’s new Oslo building, while The Emerald Tablet saw its premiere at the Høvikodden/Henie Onstad Kunstsenter and Gnostic Fragments as well as The Phantom of Light were commissioned by the Swedish National Concert Institute. [...] During {{the latter half of the}} 80s, Thommessen composed a number of major works: the trumpet concerto The Second Creation, the opera The Duchess Dies, the viola concerto Near the <b>Comet</b> <b>Head,</b> the synthesizer concerto From Above as well as the organ and cello concerto Through a Prism. These works in turn led to Thommessen being bestowed with a number of awards: The Norwegian Critics’ Award (1987), the Wilhelm Hansens Family Endowment (1987), the Lindeman Prize (1989). Through a Prism earned Thommessen a 1989 Norwegian Society of Composers Work of the Year Award, a second prize at the 1990 International Rostrum of Composers as well as the 1990 Nordic Council Music Prize.|$|E

40|$|The {{disconnection}} event (DE) in {{the plasma}} tail of Comet Halley on January 9 - 12, 1986 is examined. The distances between the <b>comet</b> <b>head</b> and the disconnected tail are measured {{for a series}} of images for that time period and then extrapolated to the nucleus to determine the disconnection time: January 9. 60 +/- 0. 2 days. The approximate solar-wind conditions {{at the time of the}} DE were obtained by corotation of IMP- 8 satellite data in earth orbit to Comet Halley. At the time of the DE, Comet Halley is inferred to have been close to a magnetic-sector boundary and a high-speed stream-compression region. However, a heliographic latitude separation of 22 degrees (between the comet and IMP- 8) and gaps in the IMP- 8 data render a more definitive statement about the linkage of the DE to external conditions quite difficult.

40|$|A summary is {{presented}} {{of a theory}} for the head and tail regions of Type 2 (dust) comets, wherein dust particles having a wide distribution of sizes {{are assumed to be}} released from the comet nucleus in an essentially continuous manner in time during the period of distinctive cometary phenomena. The dust particles are assumed to be accelerated radially outward from the nucleus {{as a result of a}} drag interaction with the expanding gas in the <b>comet</b> <b>head.</b> In the tail region the only significant forces assumed to act on the dust particles are solar gravity and the force of solar radiation pressure. It is shown how results describing the surface density in the tail are obtained and how by matching calculated distributions with measured ones it is possible to determine the dust and head-gas emission rates as a function of time, the distribution of dust particle sizes, and the emission velocity from the inner head region as a function of particle size and time.

40|$|Temporal {{variations}} of the Fe II, Mg II, and Al III circumstellar lines towards Beta Pictoris have been detected and monitored since 1985. However, the unusual presence of Al III ions is still puzzling, since the UV stellar flux from an A 5 V star such as Beta Pic is insufficient to produce such an ion. In order to better define the origin of such a phenomenon, new observations {{have been carried out}} to detect faint signatures of other highly ionized species in the short UV wavelength range, where the stellar continuum flux is low. These observations reveal variations not only near the C IV doublet lines, but also in C I and Al II lines, two weakly ionized species, not clearly detectable until now. In the framework of an infalling body scenario, highly ionized species would be created in the tail, far from the <b>comet</b> <b>head,</b> by collisions with ambient gas surrounding the star, or a weak stellar wind. Spectral changes have also been detected near a CO molecular band location, which, if confirmed, would provide the first molecular signature around Beta Pictoris...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} ejection of {{dust from}} discrete emission sources on the rotating {{nucleus of the}} Comet Halley is modelled in order to explain the evolution of spiral jets which unwind from the nucleus condensation into envelopes or halos in the <b>comet</b> <b>head.</b> The model is applied to digitally processed images of three features of the comet taken from Mount Wilson plates during the 1910 fly-by. The model permits a determination of the motion and spin vector for each emission source, its cometocentric coordinates, and a function relating particle ejection velocity to the solar radiation pressure exerted on the ejecta. It is found that the obliquity of the comet orbit's plane to its equatorial plane is 45 deg, the axis of rotation period of 17. 3 days. The derived function of particle ejection velocity to the solar radiation pressure implied no contribution from grains larger than 10 microns in radius.

The insitu emission spectrum (300 to 650 nm) is recorded at different locations upstream of the target and at different delay times from the lasers (IR and green). Spectral features are identified as emissions from C 2 (Swan System: a (sup 3) pi(sub g) - delta (sup 3) pi(sub u) and C 3 (<b>Comet</b> <b>Head</b> System: A (sup 1) pi(sub u) - chi (sup 1) sigma(sub u) (sup +).

40|$|Visualization of CFD {{simulation}} data on unstructured, 3 D grids poses several challenges. The {{wide range}} of real-world data set sizes and the geometric versatility within individual, unstructured CFD simulation models present special challenges to the engineers analyzing flow simulation results. Users also face perceptual problems such as occlusion, visual complexity, lack of directional cues, and lack of depth cues. These perceptual problems combined with the versatility of real-world CFD simulation data models motivates highly interactive and versatile visualization solutions. We present two new integral objects, the streamrunner and streamcomets, that address these challenges. The streamrunner gives the user interactive control over the evolution of streamlines from the seed point until reaching their full length. The streamrunner control minimizes occlusion and visual complexity and maximizes directional and depth cues for flow visualization in 3 D. The streamcomet shifts even more interactive control to the user by letting the user control {{the position of the}} comet’s head along the integral path, the comet tail length, the diameter of the <b>comet</b> <b>head</b> and tail, and optionally the comet’s animation speed.

40|$|It is {{accepted}} that radiotherapy and chemotherapy cause genotoxic effects {{as part of}} their therapy side effects, which are highly variable among different patients. This study evaluated DNA integrity using the comet assay in peripheral blood lymphocytes from breast cancer patients before (“pre-treatment patients”; n = 47) and after (“post-treatment patients”; n = 24) radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy treatment and from healthy donors (n = 15). Comet evaluation was made by visual (types 0 - 4) and digital (percentage of DNA remaining in the <b>comet</b> <b>head</b> = % head DNA) analysis. The association between the level of DNA damage and cancer prognostic factors was assessed. The treatments caused a significant increase in DNA damage registered by both visual (p < 0. 001) and digital (p < 0. 001) analysis. No significant associations between the level of DNA damage in pre-treatment patients and cancer prognostic factors were found. Results showed a significant correlation between the comet results from each patient before and after treatment (r = 0. 64, p = 0. 001). The % head DNA in post-treatment samples from patients with high level of DNA damage before treatment (30. 3 ± 3. 1 %, p < 0. 01) was lower than in post-treatment samples from patient with low to medium level of DNA damage before therapy (49. 2 ± 4. 4 %). Results support the usefulness of the comet assay as a sensitive technique to evaluate the basal DNA status and the damage caused by cancer treatments. The assay could contribute to the treatment decisions, taking into account the patients’ basal DNA damage before therapy. Fil: Capitaine Funes, Juan. Universidad Nacional de Rosario.
