40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study dust {{exposure}} and inflammatory reactions in the respiratory tract among coffee curing workers in Tanzania. METHODS: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} in a Tanzanian <b>coffee</b> <b>curing</b> <b>factory.</b> Coffee workers (n = 15) were compared with unexposed controls (n = 18); all workers were nonsmokers. Exhaled nitric oxide was examined using an electrochemistry-based NIOX MINO device. Personal air samples were analyzed for total dust and endotoxins, using gravimetric analysis and the chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate endpoint assay, respectively. RESULTS: Total dust levels ranged from 0. 2 to 27. 9 mg/m, and endotoxin levels ranged from 42 to 75, 083 endotoxin units/m. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide, analyzed by linear regression and adjusted for age (β = 0. 57; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 08 to 1. 06; P = 0. 02), was higher among coffee workers than among the control group. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a relationship between the coffee dust and signs of respiratory inflammation...|$|E

Five years later he established the first inland coffee-curing plant in India, In 1885, Stanes & Co went out of business. Stanes recalled that [...] "the firm suffered great losses and Messrs Stanes Watson failed in business, {{which led to the}} collapse of my firm. I had to begin all over again, all that I had was 500 rupees" [...] (about £40 at that date). Failure in business was at that time a disgrace and Robert Stanes's son, Fred, who was five at the time, remembered both the shame and also having to return to England on a cargo boat. Stanes wrote that [...] "my dear wife endured it all without a murmur and with the greatest patience". He started again and the business again prospered.

40|$|ABSTRACT: With {{the advent}} of precast {{construction}} technology, the construction industry has seen a rapid {{change in the way}} structures are built. Precast construction has brought down project costs and durations, increased the predictability and improved the quality of construction. It has also resulted in a shift in construction tasks from the construction site to the factory floor. Precast elements are manufactured and <b>cured</b> in controlled <b>factory</b> environments and are then transported to the construction site for assembly. This shift into the factory makes the process a viable candidate for automation. However {{due to the nature of}} the construction industry, it is important that the used automation technology be reconfigurable in a way that accommodates frequent changes in design and demand. The majority of precast elements currently used are made of reinforced concrete. This paper considers the unique constraints inherent in precast construction, and proposes a method to automate the production of precast concrete elements. Assembly and placement of rebar cages is an important step during the precast segment manufacturing process. An automated procedure for assembling the steel reinforcement cage for precast elements is described. This includes the placement of longitudinal reinforcement bars, followed by the placement and bending of transverse reinforcement. The entire design and analysis is conducted using Virtual Reality-assisted Virtual Prototyping to reach a favorable design for the proposed mechanism, without having to construct an actual prototype...|$|R
40|$|Generally, it is {{relatively}} easy to obtain a high joint strength with most modern bonding systems if these are <b>cured</b> under ideal <b>factory</b> conditions. However, civil engineering construction joints are cured on site and are required to last the lifetime of the structural member in harsh environmental conditions. This implies that site joints might not be constructed and cured as well as those fabricated in the factory. The paper compares two possible methods for bonding an FRP composite patch/plate to a steel adherend suitable for construction sites. The first method utilises the accepted technique of bonding two dissimilar materials using a two-part cold cure adhesive. The second method employs a pre-impregnated FRP composite plate in conjunction with a compatible film adhesive; these comparisons are undertaken by examining the results of double-strap butt joint tests. A possible site technique using the pre-impregnated FRP composite to upgrade a steel beam whilst it is under a low frequency vibration load is investigated; this represents the repair of a steel bridge constantly under traversing traffic. The butt joint test results show that on average, the pre-impregnated composite in conjunction with the film adhesive leads to a failure load which is 15 % higher than that of the cold setting adhesive technique. The results of the rehabilitated beam tests show that the bonded joint between the pre-impregnated CFRP composite and the steel adherend did not suffer any significant damage from the low frequency vibrations imposed upon the steel beam during the cure period.

40|$|Among {{the wide}} variety of European dry meat products, the most famous ones are made from pork, but other {{interesting}} products are obtained from meat of different species: i. e., the “bresaola”, from bovine, horse, etc. Deer meat and meat products are interesting in this picture, since they include the high degree of consumers’ appreciation for dried products, and the growing interest for food having an “environment friendly” image. The production of dry-cured hams from deer has a small and commercially highly valuable market niche. The raw meat derives especially from hunting, although in the last decades the use of meat from farmed animals, which assures a more constant supply and a higher hygienic quality, has become an interesting reality. The raw meat from de-boned thighs of 32 male fallow deer of either 18 or 30 months of age fed at pasture, with or without supplementary feeding, was used to verify the effect of the age and feeding regime on the sensory properties of dry-cured deer meat. All thighs were <b>cured</b> in a <b>factory</b> specialized in game processing. During eight sections, 11 trained assessors judged the four types of dry-cured meat, supplied in a balanced sequence, by evaluating, with 100 mm linear scales, 14 descriptors: marbling, dryness, fallow deer odour (o.), cheese o., milk o., goat o., sweet aromatic, sour taste (t.), sweet t., metallic hardness, cohesiveness, elasticity, granularity. GPA showed a good differentiation of the meat types: the 1 st dimension (46 % total variability explained), correlated with marbling, dryness, hardness and sweet aromatic, helped to separate mainly the two tested ages, whereas along the 2 nd dimension (30 % total variability explained) the meats were separated mainly according to the diet through granularity, elasticity, cohesiveness and sweet aromatic...|$|R
