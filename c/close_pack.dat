Harry and {{two other}} lieutenants of the 33d--for {{the battle of the}} Alma had made so many death {{vacancies}} in the regiment that he had obtained his promotion--were there, and two young officers of the 30th who were cousins of one of Jack's tentmates. It certainly was a <b>close</b> <b>pack.</b> Tom Hammond had obtained some planks, and, laying these on the flour barrel, had contrived a sort of circular table, round which the parties sat with their backs to the wall, on boxes, empty preserved potato tins, rum kegs, and portmanteaus. There was no room for Tom to enter the tent, so the full dishes were handed in through the entrance, and the empty ones passed out. Each guest of course brought his own plate, knife, fork, spoon, and drinking tin. As for a change of plates, no one dreamed of such a thing.|$|E

Still, you might have lost more men than you did before you finished with them if we had not turned up. You see, fighting with pirates is quite a different thing from fighting with any other opponents. These fellows know well enough that there is no mercy for them, and that they have nothing before them but to fight until they die, or to be tried and hanged. The veriest coward would fight till the last with such an alternative as that before him. I would rather fight a hundred and fifty French or Spanish seamen than a hundred pirates.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Although {{television}} {{pictures from}} Earth satellites {{have been used}} for over ten years to detect major sea ice features, direct photo-interpretation methods have been supplemented with a fully-automated technique employing Composite Minimum Brightness (CMB) charts. Lack of on-board calibration has prevented quantitative use of the CMB method. In a newly-developed procedure the satellite brightness measurements taken over selected areas are used for external calibration. The calibrated data were used to study sea ice conditions in the North American Arctic. Characteristic brightness levels were found corresponding to the following: 1) compact or very <b>close</b> <b>pack,</b> snow covered; 2) compact or very <b>close</b> <b>pack,</b> without snow but with little or no puddling; 3) very close to <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> with much puddling; 4) open pack, generally with much puddling and rotten ice; 5) very open pack or ice-free conditions.

5000|$|Roger Burrows {{worked with}} Dr. Ensor Holiday, of Guy's Hospital, London, {{in the early}} 1970s, {{developing}} a set of geometric patterns called Altair Designs. Altair Designs were variations of a unique and unusual Islamic design constructed on an arrangement of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> of circles, with variation in circle sizes. The design variations {{were found to have}} unique visual properties and served to stimulate the visual imagination. Altair Designs were originally published by Random House as colouring books for both adults and children under the Altair Design name. Burrows began developing, in the late 1960s, a dynamic geometry of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> spheres of different sizes where spheres change size and move from one unique <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> arrangement to another, creating unique three-dimensional forms. Burrows has given numerous lectures on his geometry of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> spheres as well as lectures on the evolution of geometrical systems through time, and how they were applied by cultures in the past. Burrows has also developed designs based on <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> circle arrangements generated by his geometry of spheres, including Images: The Ultimate Coloring Experience, and Hidden Images published by Running Press. Burrows redrew all of the original Altair designs for Wooden Books published in 2009. Altair Designs and Images designs are all based on unique geometrical structures - in the case of Altair Designs they are based on two arrangements of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> circles {{and in the case of}} [...] "Images" [...] designs based on <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> circle arrangements of all sorts plus many other precise geometrical systems.|$|R

40|$|Operation of manned {{oil and gas}} {{installations}} in arctic locations is complicated and presents new challenges. One of the challenges is to maintain {{the safety of the}} crew, by obtaining adequate lifeboat systems for crew evacuation. This master thesis focuses on different methods for meeting this challenge. The weather and climate conditions in the Arctic are very different from the conditions we find in more southern oceans. Extreme temperatures, winds caused by polar lows, icing and sea ice presents new and difficult challenges which is demanding for the operation of lifeboats. Hazard identification analyses of two types are performed to identify potential hazards of operating existing lifeboats in arctic conditions. These identify the following hazards as the most critical: Freezing of moving davit components Risk of floating pieces of ice occurring in the launching zone for free fall lifeboats <b>Close</b> <b>pack</b> ice present at the time of evacuation Open drift ice or <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> ice present during the initial operational phase Sea spray icing on the lifeboat at sea Open drift ice or <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> ice present in the operational phase Based on the hazard identification analyses, a specification of requirements for arctic lifeboats is established. This specification is intended to supplement, and not replace, the existing regulations and requirements which apply to lifeboats. Based on the specification, alternatives for modification of existing lifeboats are suggested and discussed. The modification alternatives include modifications of launching equipment, hull strengthening and propulsion equipment. However, full compliance with the specification is not believed to be achievable by modifications. Three different concepts for arctic survival crafts are outlined, each intended for a specific set of ice conditions. Concept one is an arctic free fall lifeboat, intended to be launched by free fall in the icefree summer season, and launched by a more conventional method in the ice season. The lifeboat is designed to be able to operate in higher ice concentrations than existing lifeboats are capable of. Concept two is an arctic conventional lifeboat, intended to be launched {{in the same way as}} existing conventional lifeboats. It is designed to operate in very high ice concentrations, by use of Archimedes screws. Concept three is an arctic survival vehicle, designed to operate in continuous ice and very high ice concentrations. Propulsion is provided by twin pair of tracks. In the final part of the thesis, the Arctic Free Fall Lifeboat is developed further. Dimensions, capacities, hull design and features for arctic operation are described. An improved launching arrangement is also described, capable of operating in two different modes depending on the ice concentrations in the area. The thesis concludes that existing lifeboats can be modified to achieve better performance and safety in arctic conditions, but the potential for improvement is limited. To achieve high performance and a high level of safety, arctic lifeboats must be designed and built for this purpose. </p...|$|E

The crystallographic features of the grain refiner and the Al matrix are very consistent with the edge-to-edge matching model. For three other typical grain refiners for Al alloys, TiC (when a = 0. 4328 nm), TiB 2 and AIB(2), the matching only occurs between the <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> directions in both phases and between the second <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> plane of the Al matrix and the second <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> plane of the refiners.
