5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a <b>colourant,</b> such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the drum roaster in 1817 by Daniel Wheeler allowed {{for the creation of}} very dark, roasted malts, contributing to the flavour of porters and stouts. Its development was prompted by a British law of 1816 forbidding the use of any ingredients other than malt and hops. Porter brewers, employing a predominantly pale malt grist, urgently needed a legal <b>colourant.</b> Wheeler's patent malt was the solution.|$|E
40|$|The pH, titratable acidities, {{proximate}} {{and mineral}} compositions of two natural <b>colourants</b> and three synthetic <b>colourants</b> were determined. The pH and titratable acidity were determined {{over a period}} of 14 days at 24 h intervals. The natural <b>colourants</b> were the calyxes of Hibiscus sabdariffa (SL) and the stem of Sorghum bicolour (KD), while the synthetic <b>colourants</b> were Egg Yellow (EY), Chocolate Brown (CB) and Dark Orange (DO). The pH of all samples increased as the number of days increased. The pH of SL was considerable lower than that of other <b>colourants</b> in this study (from 1. 6 on day 1 to 2. 7 on day 14) thus suggesting high acidity while the other <b>colourants</b> had basic pH (5. 6 - 6. 2 on day 1 to 7. 4 - 8. 4 on day 14). The natural <b>colourants</b> had higher moisture, lipid, carbohydrate and fibre contents while the synthetic <b>colourants</b> were very high in ash content.

25|$|A <b>colourant</b> or {{opacifier}} – These can be naturally {{present in}} the glass due to impurities in the raw materials or can be deliberately added to the melted glass as minerals or as slag from metalworking processes. The most important contributions are from iron, copper, cobalt, manganese, tin, antimony, and lead. Opacity can be due to bubbles in the glass or the inclusion of opacifying agents such as tin and antimony. The resulting colour and opacity from a given composition also may be controlled by the temperature and redox conditions inside the furnace.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{attempts}} to replace saffron with a cheaper dye. Saffron's usual substitutes in foodturmeric and safflower, among othersyield a garishly bright yellow that could hardly be confused with that of saffron. Saffron's main <b>colourant</b> is the flavonoid crocin; it has been discovered in the less tediously harvestedand hence less costlygardenia fruit. Research in China is ongoing. In Europe saffron threads were {{a key component of}} an aromatic oil known as crocinum, which comprised such motley ingredients as alkanet, dragon's blood (for colour), and wine (again for colour). Crocinum was applied as a perfume to hair. Another preparation involved mixing saffron with wine to produce a viscous yellow spray; it was copiously applied in sudoriferously sunny Roman amphitheatresas an air freshener.|$|E
500|$|In Japan {{there is}} a {{sizeable}} dye industry devoted to the plant. The purported variety Commelina communis var. hortensis, which is apparently a cultivated form of another putative variety, namely Commelina communis var. ludens, is grown for its larger petals which yield a blue juice used in manufacturing a paper called boshigami or , which is the famous product of the Yamada village in the Shiga prefecture. The paper is usually resoaked, allowing the pigment to be reabsorbed in water {{for use as a}} dye. The dye, also referred to as aigami, but also as [...] or , is composed primarily of malonyl awobanin and was used extensively as a colorant in 18th and 19th century woodblock prints in Japan, especially during the early Ukiyo-e era. The colorant is known to have been used by several famous Ukiyo-e artists such as Torii Kiyonaga. However, aigami fades to a greenish yellow {{in a matter of months}} when exposed to sunlight. As a result, the color was eventually replaced by imported Prussian blue, a much more stable colour with its first commercial appearance in 1829 in the work of Keisai Eisen. The plant is also grown for its dye in northern China. Additional uses of the <b>colourant</b> include making preparatory designs on cloth before dyeing with other pigments.|$|E

30|$|Identification can {{therefore}} {{rely on the}} fact that relatively few <b>colourants</b> could be used in any one piece due to limitations of geography, availability, and time period [14]. Unusual or unexpected <b>colourants</b> can create a need for the use of multi-technique analyses [14]. On the other hand, HSI has been shown to successfully differentiate between <b>colourants</b> that other techniques find difficult [56]. Red lake pigments (madder, for example) are very light sensitive and so their characterisation and any data on their degradation can be of upmost help [56]. HSI was used to discriminate between madder, cochineal, and brazilwood however the addition of binding media etc. made it more ambiguous. A more comprehensive database was recommended [56].|$|R

50|$|Photosensitization i.e. {{photochemical}} sensitization.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to select a pool of potential red/pink natural colour candidates and evaluate their stability during ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) processing and subsequent storage and to compare their behaviour against the artificial colour erythrosine. It was hypothesised that heat processing and post-treatment storage conditions would {{have a negative effect}} on the stability of the natural <b>colourants.</b> RESULTS: All <b>colourants</b> except fermented red rice showed significant colour loss post-UHT processing (α= 0. 05). Analysis of the colour parameters L*, a* and b* determined that lycopene was the least stable of the <b>colourants</b> and red radish the most stable under all conditions. Fermented red rice was observed to be heat-stable after exposure to UHT processing and also remained relatively stable during storage, as was black carrot. The variation across trials and the spoilage of some samples were attributed to the fluctuations in temperature (± 5 [*]°C) observed during processing. CONCLUSION: Heat processing and post-treatment storage conditions had a negative effect on the stability of the natural <b>colourants...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{reasons for}} {{the small number of}} {{colorants}} found could be that some of these cloths were prepared specifically as gifts for visitors and the colours and materials that the makers knew would retain their integrity over time were chosen; these <b>colourants</b> were used in prestigious cloths which were always intended to be gifts or for ceremonial uses and crucially like artisans worldwide experience had taught them that some <b>colourants</b> although initially bright and vivid quickly faded and so were rarely used after this discovery. The sequential extraction procedure showed that noni root was used to produce <b>colourants</b> based on morindin and morindone. The colour produced from noni is a stable and true red as opposed to the more brown/red produced from tree bark tannins and therefore noni has been frequently used to create a red colour.|$|R

25|$|Colourants/Opacifiers: These can be {{naturally}} {{present in}} the glass due to impurities in the raw materials, e.g. {{in the case of}} green/blue-green glass which results from the presence of iron in the sand. Other <b>colourants</b> are likely to be deliberate additions to the glass melt of small quantities of mineral-rich material or in some cases slags from metalworking processes. The elements in ancient glass that affect its appearance are mainly iron, manganese, cobalt, copper, tin and antimony. The presence or absence of lead is also important, while it doesn’t produce a colour itself (except in the form lead-tin oxide or lead-antimony oxide) it can change the hue of other <b>colourants.</b> In addition when added to opaque glasses it ensures that the <b>colourants</b> form in a controlled way and are uniformly distributed. Opacity in glass can be due to a number of factors; intensity of colour, bubbles in the glass or the inclusion of opacifying agents, such as tin (SnO2 & PbSnO3) and antimony (Ca2Sb2O7 & CaSb2O6 & Pb2Sb2O7).|$|R
