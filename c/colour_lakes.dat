40|$|First, {{a series}} of novel {{reactive}} cationic copolymers (P(DHAC-DMDAAC) s) of N,N-diallyl- 3 -hydroxy-azetidinium chloride (DHAC) and dimethyldiallylammonium chloride (DMDAAC) with controlled structures and controlled molecular weights characterized by intrinsic viscosities of 0. 11 – 0. 89 dL g 1 were successfully synthesized by varying the molar ratios of rawmaterials DHAC to DMDAAC from 1 : 99 to 20 : 80 and increasing initial monomer concentrations from 35 to 55 %with a decrease of initiator amount from 7 to 3 %during polymerization. Second, {{it was found that}} the dye-fixing performance of P(DHAC-DMDAAC) s could be further increased by incorporation of 7 %molar content of DHAC units into the main chains of controlled-molecular-weight poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) (PDMDAAC) dye fixatives, and their best dye-fixing performance was better than all the widely used commercial polycationic dye fixatives, indicating that the obtained P(DHAC-DMDAAC) s could be novel useful reactive polycationic dye fixatives for cotton fabric. Last, it was found from studies on dye-fixing mechanisms on cotton fabric by modern analysis techniques that the reactive units (DHAC) of the obtained P(DHAC-DMDAAC) s could form covalent bonds with the hydroxyl groups of cotton (cellulose) to give an ether linkage, resulting in strong interactions of P(DHAC-DMDAAC) s with the cotton fabric as well as the electrostatic forces between the anionic dyes and the basic cationic groups in the polymers to produce water-insoluble <b>colour</b> <b>lakes,</b> for the development of the dye fastness on cotton fabric...|$|E
40|$|Cyanobacterial toxins {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} high risk categories of waterborne toxic biological substances. For this reason there is a clear need to know which freshwater environments are most susceptible to the development of large populations of cyanobacteria. Phytoplankton data from 134 UK lakes were used to develop a series of Generalised Additive Models and Generalised Additive Mixed Models to describe which kinds of lakes may be susceptible to cyanobacterial blooms using widely available explanatory variables. Models were developed for log cyanobacterial biovolume. Water colour and alkalinity are significant explanatory variables and retention time and TP borderline significant (R 2 adj = 21. 9 %). Surprisingly, the models developed reveal that nutrient concentrations are not the primary explanatory variable; water colour and alkalinity were more important. However, given suitable environments (low colour, neutral-alkaline waters), cyanobacteria do increase with both increasing retention time and increasing TP concentrations, supporting the observations that cyanobacteria are {{one of the}} most visible symptoms of eutrophication, particularly in warm, dry summers. The models can contribute to the assessment of risks to public health, at a regional- to national level, helping target lake monitoring and management more cost-effectively at those lakes at highest risk of breaching World Health Organisation guideline levels for cyanobacteria in recreational waters. The models also inform restoration options available for reducing cyanobacterial blooms, indicating that, in the highest risk lakes (alkaline, low <b>colour</b> <b>lakes),</b> risks can generally be lessened through management aimed at reducing nutrient loads and increasing flushing during summer...|$|E
40|$|Two {{distinct}} directions {{have begun}} to elucidate key parameters {{in the search for}} extinct life on Mars. Carbonate sediments, deposited about 10, 000 years ago in association with biological activity, have been sampled from the paleolake beds of Lake Vanda and Meirs in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica.

50|$|During December to March, {{the lake}} {{turns to a}} vibrant cobalt blue colour, {{returning}} to a colder steel grey colour for April to November. The exact cause of this phenomenon is still a matter of conjecture, but it is generally considered likely that it revolves around the warming of the surface layers of the lake {{during the summer months}} to around 20 C, causing calcium carbonate to precipitate out of solution and enabling micro-crystallites of calcium carbonate to form. This results in scatter of the blue wavelengths of sunlight. During winter the lake becomes well mixed, and recent research indicates that during this phase of the <b>colour</b> cycle the <b>lake</b> is somewhat murkier due to the redistribution of tannins and calcium carbonate particles throughout the lake. Solar elevation has also been found to influence the perceived <b>colour</b> of the <b>lake.</b> The movement of planktonic life-forms within the lake during the seasons and during the day may additionally play a part in the colour change.|$|R

40|$|A {{discontinuous}} ice {{coverage and}} lake temperature record of 36 -yr duration has been compiled for <b>Colour</b> <b>Lake</b> (79 ” 25 ’N, 90 ” 45 ’W) on Axe 1 Heiberg Island, Northwest Territories. About once every 6 yr, the ice cover remains {{through the entire}} summer, creating a residual ice cover the following winter. Residual ice covers are more frequent in the last 10 yr (1986 - 1995) than in the 20 yr from 1959 to 1978, indicating a reduction in climate factors controlling ice decay. These factors are identified {{as the number of}} thawing degree-days, suggesting a tendency toward cooler summers over the last decade. We report year-round meteorology observations that indicate a mean annual temperature of about- 15. 2 ”C, with- 500 thawing degree-days in summer. Following a residual ice year, spring lake-water temperatures are significantly greater than they are following nonresidual years. The increased temperatures {{can be attributed to the}} stabilizing effect of the residual ice pan the previous fall. Without an ice pan, convection cools the entire water column before the surface freezes. When the lake has an ice pan at the start of freezing, the surface freezes over quickly, effectively trapping water heated during summer. The warmer spring water temperatures act as negative feedback, decreasing the potential for a second consecutive residual ice year. In many studies the thickness and duration of ice-cov-ered conditions on lakes have been used as climate in-dicators in temperate (e. g. Anderson et al. 1996; Wynne et al. 1996), Arctic (e. g.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Colour</b> <b>Lake</b> is a small, {{naturally}} acidic (pH 3. 7) lake on Axel Heiberg Island (Canadian High Arctic) that experiences occasional year-round ice cover. We {{investigated the}} benthic vegetation of this lake, {{with a specific}} aim of determining whether the annual growth of benthic bryophytes reflects the state of summer ice cover. We found {{the bed of the}} lake to be almost completely covered by mosses or liverworts to a depth of 22 m. The mosses showed annual growth bands 10 - 30 mm in length, visible as changes in leaf density and size. Four to five bands retained recognizable leaves and measurable amounts of chlorophyll-a (chla), and up to 12 bands were recognizable from leaf scars. We could not find a consistent relationship between band length and persistence of ice cover for a given year. We suggest that this lack is due to the complex effects of ice cover on moss growth conditions, specifically on the water temperature and irradiance at depth. Photosynthetic characteristics of Calliergon over a range of light and temperature conditions, determined using pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometry, are presented in support of this argument. We conclude that moss banding patterns are an unreliable method of hindcasting episodic failure of ice to melt in Arctic lakes.
