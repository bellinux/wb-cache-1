40|$|To build a {{building}} {{can be very}} complex and complicated task. Right from the inception until after the practical completion many things could go wrong. Architect could {{be held liable for}} any failure in design regarding to his duty and services provided to the client. The objective of this research is to determine into circumstances in which architects might be liable towards the design during design stage and to look into consequences of architect??s design liability regarding to his services and duties. The research has determined twelve circumstances of architect??s duty and services which contributed to architect??s design liability. His duty and services in design must include everything that covers in contractual agreement. An architect must perform his basic duty and services under Architects (Scale of Minimum Fees) Rules 1986. In performing his duty to the client, architect is subject to Rule 28 Code of Professional Conduct and Rule 29 <b>Conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engagement</b> under Architects Rules 1996 Part IV Code of Professional Conduct and <b>Conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engagement.</b> The research found that architect??s failure to perform his duties and services expected by the client will extent the architect??s liability to any negligence in design. As a result, architects will be liable for breach of duty to his client. The research found that most of the court will judge the architect??s on whether or not he perform his duty of care to his client and the standard of skill and care expected to be performed by the architect. Failure by the architect to meet the standard of skill and care expected which then caused error on building design will render the architect to be liable for pure economic loss, and nuisance in tort. Thus, this research is perhaps would contribute towards enhancement of the architect??s knowledge regarding their design liability under construction law...|$|E

At the same time, the rolling friction occurs with a variable relative slippage in some areas of rollers samples and the rolling friction without slipping in the other areas. These friction modes provide the kinematic <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> of teeth of spur gears along the lines of their links with different signs of slippage.

Study 2 examined data from 683 employees in a retail organization. The internal reliability was confirmed and construct validity was demonstrated.

40|$|This {{academic}} review critically {{examines the}} {{theoretical and empirical}} bases of claims made for the educational benefits of physical education and school sport (PESS). An historical overview {{of the development of}} PESS points to the origins of claims made in four broad domains: physical, social, affective and cognitive. Analysis of the evidence suggests that PESS has the potential to make contributions to young people’s development in each of these domains. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, there is suggestive evidence of a distinctive role for PESS in the acquisition and development of children’s movement skills and physical competence. It can be argued that these are necessary, if not deterministic <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> in lifelong physical activity. In the social domain, there is sufficient evidence to support claims of positive benefits for young people. Importantly, benefits are mediated by environmental and contextual factors such as leadership, the involvement of young people in decision‐making, an emphasis on social relationships, and an explicit focus on learning processes. In the affective domain, too, engagement in physical activity has been positively associated with numerous dimensions of psychological and emotional development, yet the mechanisms through which these benefits occur are less clear. Likewise, the mechanisms by which PESS might contribute to cognitive and academic developments are barely understood. There is, however, some persuasive evidence to suggest that physical activity can improve children’s concentration and arousal, which might indirectly benefit academic performance. In can be concluded that many of the educational benefits claimed for PESS are highly dependent on contextual and pedagogic variables, which leads us to question any simple equations of participation and beneficial outcomes for young people. In the final section, therefore, the review raises questions about whether PESS should be held accountable for claims made for educational benefits, and about the implications of accountability...|$|E
40|$|Indigenous {{engagement}} in Canadian archaeology encompasses jurisdictional variances, microcosmic colonial/resistance implications {{and the promise}} of mutually-beneficial heritage management practices. Drawing from literature commentary, primary document review, surveys and interviews, this dissertation explores consistency and uniqueness in the relationship between commercial archaeology and Indigenous peoples in Canada. Four <b>Conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and four Capital properties of engagement emerge and are theorized as constituting a framework capable of considering the diversity of engagement practice in Canada. Conditions include: Regulation, Capacity (Developer and Community) and Relationships. The regulatory heritage regimes governing engagement are considered across provincial/territorial boundaries together with a host of legislation, policy documents, treaty settlements, and other State/Indigenous agreements. The reasons for developers to instigate and maintain Indigenous community engagement components of cultural resource management (CRM) and the infrastructures within communities capable of realizing community-centric heritage management outcomes are defined and explored. The importance of interpersonal and institutional relationships and the identities of participants and proxies in the course of these relationships are emphasized in detail by those involved in archaeological practice. Drawing from Bourdieu’s cultural and social capital marketplaces, the four capitals in this dissertation include: embodied, objectified, collective (social/institutionalized), and economic. Embodied cultural capital represents the skills, knowledge and experiences acquired and transmitted during engagement and as a product of the archaeological process. Objectified cultural capital represents the varyingly ascribed values attached to objects/artifacts and places/sites by archaeologists and Indigenous peoples. Objectified capital also represents the various ways heritage is commodified in commercial/development transactions. Collective capital represents both the social (group/community affiliation) and institutionalized (institutional affiliation/certification) capitals. Collectively, these capitals define and perpetuate the proxy roles of engagement participants, emphasizing that Indigenous {{engagement in}} archaeology is about more than just the individuals involved. Finally, economic capital represents the tangible monetary component of engagement. Together, these conditions and capitals are defined and combined as Indigenous and critical heritage epistemologies synthesize a fluid interpretative framework considering the dynamics of Indigenous engagement in contemporary archaeology...|$|E
40|$|The {{engagement}} of employees {{has been a}} 'hot topic' among business and organizational behaviour researchers, consultants and human resource practitioners in recent years. Engagement is a motivational concept. In this study employee engagement (or job engagement) {{has been defined as}} an employee's full investment of oneself in one's work activities. The study nevertheless accepts that the field of engagement has been plagued with numerous terms, definitions, measures and theories. Although engagement research originated in the early 1990 s, there is today a lack of consensus and consistency about important conceptual issues, such as definition and dimensionality. The current scholarly work sought to bring some clarity to the field by firstly recognising two broad streams for which the conceptualizing, theorising and operationalizing of engagement have differed markedly. The self-investment and anti-burnout engagement streams were named. Next, a domain for research focus was selected. The self-investment engagement stream, which offers the most unique, objective and encompassing meaning and theory of engagement, was identified. This stream recognises Kahn's 1990 work as the foundation of engagement study. The conceptualization of engagement as the full-investment of oneself, physically, cognitively and emotionally in one's work has been derived from this early contribution. The theory of engagement found within the self-investment stream, proposes that several antecedents influence three psychological conditions, which in turn predict engagement. in the current study, task-relevant job resources, socially relevant job resources and job demand characteristic were incorporated in the theoretical framework for evaluation. The job characteristic antecedents are task significance, skill variety, autonomy, feedback, internal interaction, work overload, friendship opportunity and managerial support. The psychological <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> are known as psychological meaningfulness, availability and safety. The study's results have supported the hypotheses that task significance and internal interaction are direct predictors of meaningfulness; autonomy, feedback, internal interaction and work overload are predictors of psychological availability; while, friendship opportunity and managerial support are significantly associated with psychological safety. The three psychological conditions were positively associated with engagement. It was found that psychological meaningfulness mediated the associations between the other two conditions and engagement. Then, skill variety showed a direct positive association with engagement, rather than an indirect association via one of the psychological conditions...|$|E
