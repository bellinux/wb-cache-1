5|$|According to The Census of the Peach Crop of 1907 in West Virginia {{published}} by the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, Kuykendall was engaged {{in the management of}} a commercial peach orchard near Romney known as Sherman Orchard. In 1907, Kuykendall's orchard produced Carman, Champion, Elberta, Salways, Bilyeu, and Heath <b>Cling</b> peach varieties, totaling 5,800 baskets in all.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Nothofagus {{leaves in}} the Meyer Desert Formation of the Sirius Group show that {{intermittent}} warm periods allowed Nothofagus shrubs to <b>cling</b> to the Dominion Range as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late Pliocene). After that, the Pleistocene ice age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.|$|E
5|$|Mubarak's top aides, {{family and}} son Gamal {{told him he}} could ride out the turmoil, which {{convinced}} him to <b>cling</b> to power. It was also reported that one son, Alaa, accused his younger brother Gamal of ruining their father's reputation. Eyewitnesses said that the Egyptian army had pulled out troops from many locations near the presidential palace.|$|E
50|$|According to Buddhaghosa, {{the above}} {{ordering}} {{of the four}} types of <b>clinging</b> {{is in terms of}} decreasing grossness, that is, from the most obvious (grossest) type of <b>clinging</b> (sense-pleasure <b>clinging)</b> to the subtlest (self-doctrine <b>clinging).</b>|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{based on}} Buddhaghosa's analysis, <b>clinging</b> is more {{fundamentally}} an erroneous core belief (self-doctrine <b>clinging)</b> than a habitualized affective experience (sense-pleasure <b>clinging).</b>|$|R

5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide. The {{greatest}} diversity is in the tropics {{although there are many}} species adapted to relatively cold waters. The majority of species <b>cling</b> on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and mud, and a few are pelagic.|$|E
5|$|Those {{still on}} board Gothenburg tried to <b>cling</b> to the rigging, but {{throughout}} the early morning of 25 February, several more people were drowned after they were swept overboard by large broadside waves. Many passengers associated with the gold diggings were unwilling {{to let go of}} their gold and money belts, as it was probably their life savings; these individuals insisted on keeping them tied and once overboard reportedly drowned very quickly.|$|E
5|$|After the {{offspring}} are born, lemurs either carry them around or stash them while foraging. When transported, the infants either <b>cling</b> to the mother's fur or are {{carried in the}} mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo lemurs, infants are carried by mouth until {{they are able to}} <b>cling</b> to their mother's fur. Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, and dwarf lemurs), bamboo lemurs, and ruffed lemurs. In the case of the ruffed lemurs, the young are altricial and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal lemur species. Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them. Alloparenting (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive lemurs and aye-aye. Allonursing is also known to occur in several lemur groups. Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red-bellied lemur, mongoose lemur, eastern lesser bamboo lemur, silky sifaka, fat-tailed dwarf lemur, and ruffed lemurs.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} {{consciously}} knowable mental experiences, the Abhidhamma identifies sense-pleasure <b>clinging</b> with the mental factor of [...] "greed" [...] (lobha) {{and the other}} three types of <b>clinging</b> (self-doctrine, wrong-view and rites-and-rituals <b>clinging)</b> with the mental factor of [...] "wrong view" [...] (ditthi). [...] Thus, experientially, <b>clinging</b> can be known through the Abhidhamma's fourfold definitions of these mental factors as indicated in the following table: ...|$|R
2500|$|Each of {{the five}} skandhas trigger <b>clinging</b> asserts [...] "", and the {{delusion}} of identifying [...] "I, mine, myself" [...] through that skandha. This <b>clinging</b> creates karmic imprints that lead to rebirth and more Dukkha. This ceases when this <b>clinging</b> ceases, no more karma is being produced, and rebirth ends.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Clinging</b> causes future suffering: {{the five}} {{aggregates}} are the substrata for <b>clinging</b> and thus [...] "contribute to the causal origination of future suffering".|$|R
5|$|Fish are {{plentiful}} {{in the waters}} surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which <b>cling</b> to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to <b>cling</b> to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|In a {{land where}} {{approximately}} 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs <b>cling</b> to {{only a small fraction}} of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.|$|E

5|$|Insecure {{attachment}} {{styles in}} toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or {{may go to}} the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently <b>cling</b> to him/her, and fail {{to return to their}} previous play. These children {{are more likely to have}} later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals are {{associated}} with C.australis in healthy ecosystems. The most common epiphytes are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern Asplenium, and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns <b>cling</b> to the branches. Astelia species and Collospermum often establish in the main fork of the tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include Griselinia lucida, {{as well as a}} range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue—Phanaerochaeta cordylines and Sphaeropsis cordylines—occur almost exclusively on C.australis.|$|E
5|$|Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras {{have their}} front dorsal fins {{modified}} into large suckers {{with which they}} <b>cling</b> onto a host animal such as a whale, sea turtle, shark or ray, but this is probably a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish, and has been found inside {{the heart of a}} shortfin mako shark.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Master thesis was to evaluate the <b>clinging</b> constant (CL) for Newtonian fluid in a Laminar flow regime in turns of the viscosity, pipe tripping speed and the annular space. The <b>clinging</b> constant is {{used to describe the}} apparent contribution of pipe velocity on the pressure drop when considering surge‐ and swab pressures. The <b>clinging</b> constant is based on the amount of drilling fluid that <b>clings</b> to the pipe wall when tripping, due to the no‐slip  velocity at a drill pipe surface. There are two volume changes in opposite directions that occur when a pipe is tripped in‐ or out of the wellbore: The volume of drilling fluid that sticks to the pipe, and the volume of drilling fluid that goes in the opposite direction to fill up the space after the drillpipe (or that gets displaced when the pipe is tripped in). The <b>clinging</b> constant is derived by using these volume rates. Since  the  definition  of  the <b>clinging</b>  constant  was  unknown,  it  had  to  be  defined.  Two definitions were made (Chapter 4) and evaluated against each other iin Chapter 6. As a result, three equations of the <b>clinging</b> constant were derived in terms of the three variables. A Standard Case was defined to evaluate the variables (later redefined into Standard Case 2). The objective was to evaluate the effect that one variable had on CL. The other variables were not supposed to make any impact on the correlation obtained be tween the variable and the <b>clinging</b> effect. The results showed that all of the variables affected the <b>clinging</b> constant. The annular clearance was the variable that affected CL the most. The  model  is  based  on  many  assumptions  which  give  uncertainties to  the  equations obtained. The method used to obtain the <b>clinging</b> radiuses (to find the two volume parts) was numerical, which is another source of error. The results were eval uated in Chapter 6 including some further improvements. The conclusion, with the equation s from Chapter 5, is given in Chapter 7. </p...|$|R
50|$|Females {{give birth}} to one infant after a {{gestation}} period of 130 days, between June and August. For the first 6-8 weeks, the infant <b>clings</b> to the mother's stomach, but for the following 19 weeks, it <b>clings</b> to her back.|$|R
5|$|Sponge flies, {{also known}} as spongilla-flies (Neuroptera, Sisyridae), are {{specialist}} predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae hatch and drop into the water where they seek out sponges to feed on. They use their elongated mouthparts to pierce the sponge and suck the fluids within. The larvae of some species <b>cling</b> {{to the surface of}} the sponge while others take refuge in the sponge's internal cavities. The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.|$|E
5|$|The fruits {{produced}} by cacti after the flowers have been fertilized vary considerably; many are fleshy, although some are dry. All contain {{a large number}} of seeds. Fleshy, colorful and sweet-tasting fruits are associated with seed dispersal by birds. The seeds pass through their digestive systems and are deposited in their droppings. Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals; giant tortoises are reported to distribute Opuntia seeds in the Galápagos Islands. Ants appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera, such as Blossfeldia. Drier spiny fruits may <b>cling</b> to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind.|$|E
5|$|The nectar of the ﬂowers {{is sought}} after by insects, bellbirds, tūī and stitchbirds. The leaves and the rough bark provide {{excellent}} homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, ﬂy larvae, weta, snails and slugs. Many {{of these are}} then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to <b>cling</b> and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While {{it is said that}} they foretell dry summers, it has been observed that they tend to follow dry seasons.|$|E

5|$|The sea otter's use {{of rocks}} when hunting and feeding makes {{it one of}} the few mammal species to use tools. To open hard shells, it may pound its prey with both paws against a rock on its chest. To pry an abalone off its rock, it hammers the abalone shell using a large stone, with {{observed}} rates of 45 blows in 15 seconds. Releasing an abalone, which can <b>cling</b> to rock with a force equal to 4,000 times its own body weight, requires multiple dives.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales {{are attached to the}} substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales <b>cling</b> somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} progressed westward, Tampa and nearby {{locations}} started to experience its effects. Strong winds {{from the northeast}} blew {{water out of the}} Tampa Bay to the lowest level ever recorded. The barometer fell to 961mbar (hPa; 28.4inHg), and extremely high waves battered the shore from Flamingo to Cape Romano. The surf continued well inland, forcing survivors to <b>cling</b> atop trees. North of Tampa, the hurricane's effects were moderate or light, while in the southwestern part of the state, damage increased in severity. A portion of the local citrus crop was destroyed. Property damage was widespread from Tampa to Jacksonville and points south. High winds tore the roofs off homes and shook some structures off their foundations.|$|E
