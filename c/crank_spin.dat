60|$|The engine-room floor-plates slanted, {{and light}} and shadow played about the {{throbbing}} machinery. It {{looked as if the}} lamps swung in a semicircle, but they did not. All else slanted at an ever-changing angle; the swiveled lamps were still. Overhead the dark and bulky cylinders cut against the reflected glimmer on the skylights; below, valve-gear and connecting-rod flashed across the gloom, and the twinkling <b>cranks</b> <b>spun</b> in their shallow pit. One saw the big columns shake and strain as the crosshead shot up and down; the thrust-blocks groaned with the back push of the propeller.|$|R
5000|$|Crankflip: The rider bunny hops {{and kicks}} the pedals {{backwards}} so the <b>crank</b> arms <b>spin</b> one full <b>crank</b> around {{and then the}} feet catch back onto the pedals to stop the cranks.|$|R
50|$|Some seeders/spreaders have {{directional}} fins {{to control}} {{the direction of the}} material that is thrown from the spreader. All broadcast spreaders require some form of power to spin the disk. On hand carried units, a hand <b>crank</b> <b>spins</b> gears to turn the disk. On tow behind units, the wheels spin a shaft that turns gears which, in turn, spin the disk. As is partially visible in one of the photos, with tractor mounted units, a mechanical P.T.O. shaft connected to the tractor and controlled by the tractor operator, spins the disk. There are some seeder/spreaders made for garden size tractors that use a 12 volt motor to spin the dispersing disk and yaw.|$|R
50|$|The first dynamo {{based on}} Faraday's {{principles}} {{was built in}} 1832 by Hippolyte Pixii, a French instrument maker. It used a permanent magnet which was rotated by a <b>crank.</b> The <b>spinning</b> magnet was positioned so that its north and south poles passed by a piece of iron wrapped with insulated wire.|$|R
60|$|He got out {{in front}} of Brown and plunged down the ladder. Since Terrier must be stopped and turned, he was needed. Water ran from his clothes when he reached a slanted {{platform}} and seized a greasy wheel. The telegraph gong was clanging and the beat of engines slackened as he followed the orders. Then the <b>spinning</b> <b>cranks</b> stopped altogether and {{for a minute or two}} there was a strange quietness. One heard the wind, and water splashed in the bilges.|$|R
40|$|Lifetimes {{of states}} in the lowest lying {{positive}} parity band in 106 Cd have been measured using the Doppler shift attenuation method. The deduced B(E 2) transition rates show a marked decrease with increasing <b>spin.</b> <b>Cranking</b> and semiclassical model calculations suggest that the structure has {{the character of a}} shears-type band resulting from the coupling of g 9 / 2 proton holes to aligned pairs of h 11 / 2 and g 7 / 2 neutron particles. This is the first clear evidence for the phenomenon of “antimagnetic” rotation in nuclei...|$|R
2500|$|When first {{riding a}} fixed gear, a cyclist {{used to a}} {{freewheel}} may try to freewheel, or coast, particularly when approaching corners or obstacles. Since coasting is not possible {{this can lead to}} a [...] "kick" [...] to the trailing leg, and even to loss of control of the bicycle. Riding at high speed around corners can be difficult on a road bike converted into a fixed-gear bicycle, as the pedals can strike the road, resulting in loss of control. Proper track bikes have a higher bottom bracket to compensate for the constantly <b>spinning</b> <b>cranks</b> and largely mitigate this problem.|$|R
50|$|Finally, in January 1998, the Band’s “Miss Saigon” show {{put them}} on top. The music {{was taken from the}} Santa Clara Vanguard’s show in 1991, but the {{outstanding}} feature of the show was a nearly full scale helicopter that was assembled by members of the Church. Since the door onto the competition field at the Budokan was very small, the helicopter had to be assembled {{in the back of the}} field during the Band’s show and then hoisted on a scissor lift just as it made its appearance. A member of the Band sat inside the helicopter and operated the <b>crank</b> that <b>spun</b> the huge propeller. As the helicopter appeared at the end of the show, the crowd response was overwhelming and at the very end, the entire helicopter was spun around to create a very dramatic effect. With this victory, the Band’s first at the All Japan Marching Band and Baton Twirling Association Championships, Mr. Sekine was inspired to come up with more spectacular and unusual effects to introduce in future shows.|$|R
5000|$|Popular flavors include strawberry, cherry, lemon, green tea, grape, melon, [...] "Blue Hawaii", sweet plum, and colorless syrup. Some shops provide {{colorful}} varieties {{by using}} {{two or more}} different syrups. To sweeten kakigōri, condensed or evaporated milk is often poured on top of it. It {{is similar to a}} snow cone, but with some notable differences: it has a much smoother fluffier ice consistency, much like fresh fallen snow, and a spoon is almost always used to eat it. The traditional way of making kakigōri uses a hand <b>cranked</b> machine to <b>spin</b> a block of ice over an ice shaving blade. Even though electric ice shavers are most often used, street vendors can still be seen hand-shaving ice blocks in the summer.|$|R
60|$|Standing on a slanted {{platform}} {{with his hand}} on the throttle, he waited for the lurch that lifted the spinning screw. When the blades left the water, the engines raced with a horrible din and he must cut off steam. If he let the engines go, something might break when the propeller got hold again. The work demanded a firm but delicate touch, since the pressure must change with the swiftly-changing load. One could not argue when the bows would plunge and the stern swing clear; one must know instinctively. The muscular effort was not hard, but Lister's face was wet with sweat, and when he was slow and the engine-room rang with the clash of machinery his heart beat. The big columns that held the cylinders rocked; <b>crank</b> and connecting-rod <b>spun</b> too fast for him to see. There was a confusing flash of steel and a daunting uproar.|$|R
40|$|High-spin {{states have}} been studied in the neutron-deficent odd-N 131 Ce nucleus. The {{experiment}} was performed at Argonne Laboratory, USA, using the fusion evaporation reaction 100 Mo(36 S, 5 n). The beam of 36 S was produced by the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) to an energy of 165 MeV with a beam current of 5 pnA. The gamma ray coincidence data were recorded with GAMMASPHERE. A detailed spectroscopic study of the 131 Ce nucleus has established two new band structures and extended some of the known bands to higher <b>spin.</b> <b>Cranked</b> Woods- Saxon calculations {{have been used to}} assign possible configurations for the newly found structures. Angular intensity-ratio measurements have been performed to gain information on the multipolarities of transitions in this nucleus. In order to strengthen the suggested configuration for the 131 Ce bands a comparison was carried out between the experimental and theoretical B(M 1) /B(E 2) ratios of reduced transition probabilities. A large signature splitting in the negative-parity bands is discussed as evidence for non-axial nuclear shape which is induced by the core-polarisation effects of neutrons from the upper h 11 / 2 midshell...|$|R
40|$|Rekluse Motorsports of Boise, ID has {{sponsored}} an MBE senior project to design an interactive display for their aftermarket dirt bike clutches. They {{would like a}} free standing structure that runs off electricity so emissions are not a concern inside at trade shows. The purpose is to the show the expansion and engagement of the clutch to display the unique features. The user {{should be able to}} experience what sets a Rekluse clutch apart from other aftermarket clutches. To meet this request, a kiosk style display has been designed and will be built to meet their needs. The display features a CRF 450 dirt bike engine, handle bars with clutch lever, brakes and throttle. The standard clutch cover will be removed and replaced with a clear one so clutch function is visible. The throttle will input to an electric motor that will <b>spin</b> a <b>crank</b> gear to <b>spin</b> clutch. Once the user provides enough throttle for the clutch to engage, a drive wheel on the output shaft will spin to simulate the drive wheel on an actual bike. As a result, the user will experience the same feel of the Rekluse clutch without having to be on a bike to test drive it...|$|R
