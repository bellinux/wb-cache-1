25|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> has {{increased}} steadily. Since the late 1990s, lawmakers, consumer advocacy groups, college officials and other higher education affiliates {{have become increasingly}} concerned about the rising use of credit cards among college students. The major credit card companies {{have been accused of}} targeting a younger audience, especially college students, many of whom are already in debt with college tuition fees and college loans and who typically are less experienced at managing their own finances. <b>Credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> may also negatively affect their grades as they are likely to work more both part and full-time positions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{antecedents of}} the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debts</b> in young consumers in Malaysia. We examine whether {{easy access to}} <b>credit</b> <b>card,</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> related knowledge, aggressive promotion by <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> industry, low minimum payment requirement and attitude towards <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> influence <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debts</b> in the younger generation. Regression model was used to meet the objectives. These findings based on a sample of 240 young <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> holders, show that the factors that affect <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debts</b> are <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> related knowledge, aggressive promotion by <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> industry and low minimum payment requirements. These findings also provide insights for both bank management and policy-makers to improve the bank performance in terms of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debts...</b>|$|R

25|$|Governments issue {{government}} bonds {{in their own}} currency and sovereign bonds in foreign currencies. State and local governments issue municipal bonds to finance projects or other major spending initiatives. Debt issued by government-backed agencies is called an agency bond. Companies can issue a corporate bond or obtain money from a bank through a corporate loan. Preferred stocks {{share some of the}} characteristics of fixed interest bonds. Securitized bank lending (e.g. <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debt,</b> car loans or mortgages) can be structured into other types of fixed income products such as ABS – asset-backed securities which can be traded on exchanges just like corporate and {{government bonds}}.|$|E
25|$|Securitization is the {{financial}} practice of pooling {{various types of}} contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities, which may be described as bonds, pass-through securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing. Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS).|$|E

2500|$|However, many {{financial}} analysts estimate {{such concerns}} {{are based upon}} mirror-imaging of the Western model and do {{not take into account}} the already proven Asian Tiger model. Yet, recently, <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> has become a major problem, as the ROC does not have an individual bankruptcy law.

2500|$|Securities {{backed by}} credit card {{receivables}} have been benchmark for the ABS market since they were first introduced in 1987. [...] Credit card holders may borrow funds on a revolving basis up to an assigned credit limit.

[...] Because principal repayment is not scheduled, <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> {{does not have an}} actual maturity date and is considered a nonamortizing loan.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{the median}} generic FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011. [...] The {{performance}} {{definition of the}} FICO risk score (its stated design objective) is to predict {{the likelihood that a}} consumer will go 90 days past due or worse in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated. [...] The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated. [...] Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use. [...] For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a revolving <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.|$|E
2500|$|Startups {{have several}} options for funding. Venture capital firms and angel investors may help startup {{companies}} begin operations, exchanging seed money for an equity {{stake in the}} firm. Venture capitalists and angel investors provide financing {{to a range of}} startups (a portfolio), with the expectation that {{a very small number of}} the startups will become viable and make money. In practice though, many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using [...] "bootstrapping", in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> to finance the venture. Factoring is another option, though it is not unique to startups. Other funding opportunities include various forms of crowdfunding, for example equity crowdfunding, in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals, typically by pitching their idea on the Internet.|$|E

30|$|I combine {{three main}} data sets {{for the purpose}} of the study. The first data set is {{regional}} financial series on the use of consumer credits and outstanding <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debts.</b> These statistics were collected and disseminated by the Finturk portal of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency of Turkey (BRSA) for the years 2009 to 2012. Total consumer credits include credits for vehicle purchases, mortgages, bank credit accounts, outstanding <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debts,</b> and other consumer credits. Regrettably, the BRSA does not provide regional data before 2008 on the grounds that banks reported most of the financial indicators (such as regional credits) as if they pertained to the Istanbul region {{due to the fact that}} credits were approved by the headquarters in Istanbul (Turkey’s financial capital), even when the real recipient of the credit actually resided elsewhere. Starting from 2008, reporting procedures were improved to reflect the correct regional financial outlook.|$|R
50|$|In April 1997, {{a lawsuit}} against General Electric Capital Corp was filed {{on behalf of the}} company's {{customers}} who filed for bankruptcy. The GE Capital Corp. was accused of unfair debt collection practices. The class action lawsuit resulted in $100 million settlement with over 100,000 class members from 50 states.Plaintiffs claimed that the company solicited agreements from bankrupt debtors to repay their <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debts</b> but failed to notify bankruptcy court of the agreement. Those reaffirmation agreements legally required the debtors to continue paying off their debt in exchange for keeping the <b>credit</b> <b>card,</b> even though bankruptcy erases <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debts.</b> The lawsuit claimed that GE Capital was required by law to file the agreements with bankruptcy courts and did not do so.As part of the settlement, the company agreed to refund, with interest, all <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> payments made after debtors entered into the reaffirmation agreements between January 1, 1993, and June 30, 1997. GE Capital Corp. also promised to advise credit bureaus to correct any negative credit reports related to class members’ failure to repay reaffirmed debt.|$|R
2500|$|A {{suitably}} large {{portfolio of}} assets is [...] "pooled" [...] {{and transferred to}} a [...] "special purpose vehicle" [...] or [...] "SPV" [...] (the issuer), a tax-exempt company or trust formed for the specific purpose of funding the assets. [...] Once the assets are transferred to the issuer, there is normally no recourse to the originator. The issuer is [...] "bankruptcy remote", meaning that if the originator goes into bankruptcy, {{the assets of the}} issuer will not be distributed to the creditors of the originator. In order to achieve this, the governing documents of the issuer restrict its activities to only those necessary to complete the issuance of securities. Many issuers are typically [...] "orphaned". In the case of certain assets, such as <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>debt,</b> where the portfolio is made up of a constantly changing pool of receivables, a trust in favor of the SPV may be declared in place of traditional transfer by assignment (see the outline of the master trust structure below).|$|E

50|$|Settlement {{companies}} generally package their settlements into {{a larger}} bulk settlement with the creditor for 35% - 50% of the existing balances.
