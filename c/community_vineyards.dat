40|$|AbstractLandscape {{structure}} plays a {{major role}} in ecosystem functioning as it influences species dynamics, including that of plant herbivores, pathogens and their natural antagonists. Here we hypothesized that the presence of forest patches within an agricultural matrix influences foliar fungal communities by altering the local species pool and/or the microclimate near the edges. We tested this hypothesis in a mosaic landscape composed of forests and vineyards. Leaves and bioaerosols were sampled along three forest-vineyard gradients. Fungal communities were characterized using a metabarcoding approach (Illumina sequencing of the ITS 2 marker). Our results showed that foliar fungal communities significantly differ between plant species. They also significantly differ from those of the surrounding atmosphere. In contrast to our hypothesis, the landscape structure (proximity to the forest edge) did not influence the composition and diversity of foliar fungal <b>communities</b> in <b>vineyards.</b> Host species dominates over landscape structure in shaping foliar fungal communities. 10.

They form various microbial communities in response to environmental factors, including soil texture and chemical components. Because of this, it is difficult to determine the microbial community structure of soil. In vineyard soils, the overall microbial community structure has yet to be unraveled. To understand the microbial <b>community</b> in <b>vineyard</b> soil, we surveyed comprehensively microbial <b>communities</b> in Japanese <b>vineyard</b> soils by using a culture-independent molecular approach. We identified 681 fungal clone sequences and 1076 bacterial clone sequences in soil samples collected from nine independent Japanese vineyards, and the results suggested that Ascomycota is the dominant group in the fungal community, whereas Proteobacterium and Acidobacterium are the dominant groups in the bacterial community. DNA was directly extracted from the soil samples, and the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) region or the bacterial 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The recovered fungal clones were sorted into 225 operational taxonomic units and the majority of the clone sequences were assigned to Ascomycota. Meanwhile, the recovered bacterial clones were sorted into 17 phyla, and the abundant phyla were Proteobacterium and Acidobacterium. These results differed from the reported fungal and bacterial community structures in forest and agricultural soils. Moreover, we preliminarily generated a catalog of Japanese vineyard soils. The microbial community structures in the vineyard soils were extremely complex, suggesting that the microbial community structure in each vineyard soil has individual characteristics. Our study comprehensively showed for the first time fungal and bacterial community structures in Japanese vineyard soils, and is most likely to provide a clue to understand the nature of Japanese vineyard soils.

50|$|A strong <b>community</b> of <b>vineyards</b> and {{orchards}} {{had grown}} up between the 1850s and the 1880s.

40|$|Microbial {{communities}} {{living in}} nine vineyards distributed over three altitudinal transects were studied over 2 years. Fungal and bacterial community dynamics were explored using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and by determining bacterial cells and fungal colony-forming units (CFUs). Moreover, extensive chemical and physical {{analyses of the}} soils were carried out. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that bacterial and fungal communities are affected by altitude, which acts as a complex physicochemical gradient. In fact, soil moisture, Al, Mg, Mn and clay content are changing with altitude and influencing the bacterial genetic structure, while {{in the case of}} fungi, soil moisture, B and clay content are found to be the main drivers of the community. Moreover, other exchangeable cations and heavy metals, not correlating with altitude, are involved in the ordination of the sites, especially Cu. Qualitative ARISA revealed the presence of a stable core microbiome of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within each transect, which ranged between 57 % and 68 % of total OTUs in the case of fungi and between 63 % and 72 % for bacteria.

In the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, where {{wine grape}} {{production}} and biodiversity conservation are of major importance, innovative {{management of the}} landscape is necessary to integrate the two activities. Alternative farming, such as organic and biodynamic farming, focuses on the preservation of biological processes in agroecosystems {{with the aim of}} increasing the sustainability of these sytems. It has been demonstrated in other regions that alternative farming can enhance biodiversity. This study assessed the potential of alternative vineyard management to conserve biodiversity, in particular epigaeic arthropod diversity, relative to the more widespread integrated vineyard management in the CFR. A hierarchical design was used, consisting of three localities, with three land-uses nested within each locality. The land-uses were alternative vineyards, integrated vineyards and natural vegetation sites as reference habitats. Sampling was done in June and October 2006 using pitfall traps. Nested ANOVAs were used to test for differences in abundance and species richness of the total assemblages, functional feeding guilds and selected generalized predatory taxa. Assemblage patterns were assessed using hierarchical agglomerative clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Canonical correspondence analyses were used to evaluate the effects of environmental variables, management practices and landscape variables on <b>community</b> composition. Alternative <b>vineyards</b> supported a significantly higher overall arthropod abundance and species richness, more diverse predatory, saprophagous, phytophagous and omnivorous guilds, as well as more abundant and speciose spider and rove beetle assemblages than the integrated vineyards. Integrated vineyards harboured a greater abundance of predators, whereas results for nectarivores, wood borers, parasitoids and carabid beetles were variable. The differences could be explained in part by higher non-crop vegetation complexity and reduced management intensity of the alternative <b>vineyards.</b> <b>Community</b> composition was influenced by a combination of management practices, the surrounding landscape and geographic locality, which highlighted the interdependence of the cultivated land and its surroundings...|$|R

40|$|Background Dispersal events between habitat patches in a {{landscape}} mosaic can structure ecological communities and influence the functioning of agrosystems. Here we investigated whether short-distance dispersal events between vineyard and forest patches shape foliar fungal communities. We hypothesized that these communities homogenize between habitats {{over the course of}} the growing season, particularly along habitat edges, because of aerial dispersal of spores. [br/] Methods We monitored the richness and composition of foliar and airborne fungal communities over the season, along transects perpendicular to edges between vineyard and forest patches, using Illumina sequencing of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS 2) region. [br/] Results In contrast to our expectation, foliar fungal <b>communities</b> in <b>vineyards</b> and forest patches increasingly differentiate over the growing season, even along habitat edges. Moreover, the richness of foliar fungal communities in grapevine drastically decreased over the growing season, in contrast to that of forest trees. The composition of airborne communities did not differ between habitats. The composition of oak foliar fungal communities change between forest edge and centre. [br/] Discussion These results suggest that dispersal events between habitat patches are not major drivers of foliar fungal communities at the landscape scale. Selective pressures exerted in each habitat by the host plant, the microclimate and the agricultural practices play a greater role, and might account for the differentiation of foliar fugal communities between habitats...|$|R
50|$|In 1938, as {{a result}} of the Hurricane of 1938 - the Edgartown Harbor Light was closed to public access due to severe {{structural}} damage caused to the lighthouse and its access causeway. In 1939, the new conical cast-iron tower from Ipswich was installed and automated. Due to automation and related removal of the resident lighthouse Keeper, there was no longer a built-in system for accommodating public access. Subsequently, the Edgartown lighthouse was closed to public access from 1938 to 1988. August 1991, Hurricane Bob caused severe damage to the rap and stone public access causeway to the Edgartown Light. VERI initiated restoration of the causeway by raising funds from property owners abutting Lighthouse Pond. VERI board member, Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr., who owned a home abutting Lighthouse Pond, was instrumental in organizing donations from his fellow neighbors. The donated funds were applied toward engineering and permitting efforts, as well as structural rebuilding of the causeway. Necessary engineering; permit applications; public hearings; material acquisition, and reconstruction oversight was performed at no cost to VERI or the <b>community</b> by <b>Vineyard</b> Environmental Protection, Inc.(VEP). An important component of the new causeway's engineering design was the addition of a second culvert to facilitate tidal flushing of Lighthouse Pond.
