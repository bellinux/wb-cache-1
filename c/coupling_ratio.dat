Mammalian members of this family are: SLC13A1 (NaS1), SLC13A2 (NaC1), SLC13A3 (NaC3), SLC13A4 (NaS2) and SLC13A5 (NaC2). DASS family proteins encode plasma membrane polypeptides with 8-13 putative transmembrane domains, and are expressed in a variety of tissues. They are all Na+-coupled symporters. The Na+:anion <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio</b> is 3:1, indicative of electrogenic properties. They have a substrate preference for divalent anions, which include tetra-oxyanions for the NaS cotransporters or Krebs cycle intermediates (including mono-, di- and tricarboxylates) for the NaC cotransporters.

50|$|WDMs are optical {{components}} in which power is split or combined {{based on the}} wavelength composition of the optical signal. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexers (DWDMs) are optical components that split power over at least four wavelengths.

A given component may combine and divide optical signals simultaneously, as in bidirectional (duplex) transmission over a single fiber. Passive optical components are data format transparent, combining and dividing optical power in some predetermined ratio (<b>coupling</b> <b>ratio)</b> regardless of the information content of the signals.

Early methods have mainly focused {{on the use of}} radiolabeled compounds, including 14C-labelled gamma-butyrobetaine and 14C-labelled 2OG. Enzyme-coupled method have also been applied to detect carnitine formation, by using the enzyme carnitine acetyltransferase and 14C-labelled acetyl-coenzyme A to give labelled acetylcarnitine for detection. Using this method, it is possible to detect carnitine concentration down to the pico-molar range.

40|$|Optical coupler is an {{important}} component in a fiber optics system. To obtain a coupler, two fiber must be sufficiently close such that electrostatic field carried by the fiber overlap and partial transfer of energy to the other fiber occurred. In this work, the investigation on the fabrication of fiber based coupler is performed by using Acupler 2000 fiber optic coupler manufacturing system. If two lined up fibers are sufficiently close such that the fields overlap, light can be coupled from one fiber to another. The two lined up fibers are twisted each other on the fiber holder of the pulling stage. The main control computer kept sampling the PDI and PD 2 light intensity readings and calculated the <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio,</b> excess loss throughout the full process. The PDI, PD 2, <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio,</b> excess loss and motor pulling distances displayed on the working window are updated continuously. The main control computer stopped the pulling process when the <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio</b> reached the desired value. The flow gas pressure is 1 bar. The desired value of excess loss for 50 : 50 <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio</b> is 0. 07 dB with an insertion loss of 3. 40 dB.

40|$|ABSTRACT The electrogenic Na-K pump <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio</b> in {{the large}} neurons of the lobster cardiac {{ganglion}} was determined by two different electrophysiological techniques. A graphical analysis plotting exp(E. F/RT) vs. [K]o after the pump was blocked by ouabain {{was used to determine}} values for [K]i, PNa/PK, and the pump <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio.</b> These measurements were made 4 - 8 h after the cells were penetrated with microelectrodes, and thus represent non-Na-loaded steady state values. The value obtained for the pump <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio</b> under these conditions was 1. 44 ± 0. 06 (11 = 9) or close to 3 Na for 2 K. The second technique used to measure the <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio</b> was to iontophoretically inject Na ions into the neuron. Neurons were penetrated with three microelectrodes, two of which were filled with 2 M Na-citrate; the third electrode contained either 2 M K-citrate or 3 M KCI. By passing current between the Na salt-containing electrodes, Na was injected into the cell soma. The injection system was calibrated by injecting z 4 Na-citrate into counting vials from representative microelectrodes (calculated z 4 Na transport = 0. 92). By knowing the Na load injected into the cells, and by measuring the time-current area produced by the Na activation of the Na-K pump, the <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio</b> was calculated to be 1. 54 ± 0. 05 () 1 = 19), which is not significantly different from the value obtained by the first method. This value represents a Na-loaded experimental situation. When Na was removed from the external bathing solution, the <b>coupling</b> <b>ratio</b> shifted to 2 Na to 1 K (2. 0 ± 0. 07, 11 = 4). These results suggest that the pump normally operates with a 3 : 2 ratio both in steady state and under Na load but that in the absence of external Na, it can operate with less than a full complement (2) of K on the external surface of the pump...|$|E

40|$|Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) {{offer an}} {{attractive}} framework for flavour models, since they feature relations between quarks and leptons. Combining them with Supersymmetry (SUSY) and flavour symmetries, we derive predictions for the flavour and SUSY flavour structure from various GUT models and discuss how the double missing partner mechanism (DMPM) {{solution to the}} doublet-triplet splitting problem can be combined with predictions for GUT scale quark-lepton Yukawa coupling relations. We construct two predictive SUSY SU(5) GUT models with an A 4 flavour symmetry, that feature realistic quark-lepton Yukawa <b>coupling</b> <b>ratios</b> and mixing angle relations. These GUT scale predictions arise after GUT symmetry breaking from a novel combination of group theoretical Clebsch-Gordan factors, and we carefully construct additional shaping symmetries and renormalisable messenger sectors to protect the models' predictions from dangerous corrections. The major difference between both models are their respective predictions of a normal and inverse neutrino mass ordering. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, fit to experimental data, and discuss how the models can be tested by present and future experiments. To combine predictive GUT scale quark-lepton Yukawa <b>coupling</b> <b>ratios</b> with the DMPM in SUSY SU(5), we introduce a second GUT breaking Higgs field in the adjoint representation. Two explicit flavour models with different predictions for the GUT scale Yukawa sector are presented, including shaping symmetries and renormalisable messenger sectors, and combined with the DMPM.

In SUSY theories, the one-loop SUSY threshold corrections are of particular importance in investigating GUT scale quark-lepton mass relations and thus link a given GUT flavour model to the sparticle spectrum. We calculate the one-loop SUSY threshold corrections of the full MSSM Yukawa coupling matrices in the electroweak-unbroken phase and introduce a new software tool SusyTC as a major extension to the Mathematica package REAP.

The reversal potentials were monitored by a series of voltage ramps before, during, and after the osmotic pulse. The shifts of the reversal potentials immediately after the osmotic jump gave V stream.
