The cover depicts the Joker {{standing next to a}} tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her <b>cheek</b> <b>with</b> the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.|$|E
25|$|In a cheek kiss, both persons {{lean forward}} and either lightly touch <b>cheek</b> <b>with</b> cheek or lip with cheek. Generally the gesture is {{repeated}} {{with the other}} cheek, or more, alternating cheeks. Depending on country and situation, the number of kisses is usually one, two, three or four. Hand-shaking or hugging may also take place.|$|E

25|$|Where cheek kissing is used, in some {{countries}} a single kiss is the custom, while in others a kiss on each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks. In the United States, an air kiss is becoming more common. This involves kissing in the air near the <b>cheek,</b> <b>with</b> the cheeks touching or not. After a first date, {{it is common for}} the couple to give each other a quick kiss on the cheek (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had and perhaps to indicate an interest in another meeting.|$|E

The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, [...] "My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled." ...|$|E

500|$|The pilot commences with Dexter {{driving through}} Miami, summarizing, in a monologue, that {{something}} is to occur on that night. After a choir performance at a bandstand, Dexter kidnaps Mike Donovan (Jim Abele), a pastor who rapes and murders young boys, takes him to a remote cabin in the Everglades, and forces him {{to look at the}} bodies of his victims. Before sedating him, Dexter explains that he could never kill a child, because he abides by a moral code. Later, Donovan awakes to find himself strapped to a table. Dexter makes an incision in Donovan's <b>cheek</b> <b>with</b> a scalpel and collects his blood in a slide, and then proceeds to kill him. Dexter, returning from dumping Donovan's remains, narrates that he is not sure why he feels the need to kill, and speaks of his adoptive parents, Harry and Doris Morgan, both of whom are dead. He also believes himself to be emotionally detached from other people. [...] At his apartment, Dexter stores Donovan's blood in a case containing the blood of his other victims. Dexter explains that he kills according to a code taught to him by his foster father who, as a Miami police officer, instructed Dexter on how to avoid being caught, and to kill only those who [...] "deserve it". Flashbacks throughout the episode reveal that Harry first decided to impart these [...] "lessons" [...] upon Dexter after discovering that the boy had been killing neighborhood pets.|$|E
