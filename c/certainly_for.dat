5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books. Writing in The New Republic, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “e {{are in danger of}} having the insights of psychotherapy used as a tool for character destruction, <b>certainly</b> <b>for</b> libel, potentially for revenge.” Sales of the book were disappointing, {{in part because of the}} reviews, in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E
25|$|The F3000 race at the Birmingham Superprix {{was just}} as sunny as the two {{previous}} ones, there was a carnival atmosphere. But not <b>certainly</b> <b>for</b> Martin Donnelly as he {{got a lot of}} attention for wrong reasons. During the qualifying session after a spin at the Holts Corner, he abandoned his car, and watched with horror as Erico Cheli t-boned his car. His Eddie Jordan Racing team worked very hard to get the Reynard car repaired, and thankfully he started the race with an incomplete livery. His team mate Jean Alesi fought throughout the race with Marco Apicella. It stayed that way at the end, with Alesi beating Apicella by a slender margin. Donnelly came back to finish third.|$|E
25|$|Huxley's main co-respondents in {{the modern}} {{evolutionary}} synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gaylord Simpson, Bernhard Rensch, Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists J. B. S. Haldane, Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. However, {{at the time of}} Huxley's book several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>for</b> Huxley, E. B. Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important; and Cyril Darlington, the chromosome expert, was a notable source of facts and ideas.An analysis of the 'authorities cited' index of Evolution the modern synthesis shows indirectly those whom Huxley regarded as the most important contributors to the synthesis up to 1941 (the book was published in 1942, and references go up to 1941). The authorities cited 20 or more times are:Darlington, Darwin, Dobzhansky, Fisher, Ford, Goldschmidt, Haldane, J. S. Huxley, Muller, Rensch, Turrill, Wright.This list contains a few surprises. Goldschmidt was an influential geneticist who advocated evolution by saltation, and was sometimes mentioned in disagreement. Turrill provided Huxley with botanical information. The list omits three key members of the synthesis who are listed above: Mayr, Stebbins the botanist and Simpson the palaeontologist. Mayr gets 16 citations and more in the two later editions; all three published outstanding and relevant books some years later, and their contribution to the synthesis is unquestionable. Their lesser weight in Huxley's citations was caused by the early publication date of his book. Huxley's book is not strong in palaeontology, which illustrates perfectly why Simpson's later works were such an important contribution.|$|E

500|$|In the episode's {{original}} plot, Dupre was to {{have jumped}} into Mulder's body. There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena; Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such a way. With more than a little reluctance, the producers agreed to make the change. As writer Howard Gordon later recalled, [...] "We'd wanted Mulder to experience the soul switch". Eventually, however, Fox's stance was changed; most notably, in the two-part sixth season episode, [...] "Dreamland", when Mulder's consciousness is exchanged with government agent Morris Fletcher. Gordon ultimately came to believe that the final decision was almost <b>certainly</b> <b>for</b> the best and saw the benefit of introducing Scully's former boyfriend as it provided a welcome opportunity to delve into her history.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. <b>Certainly</b> <b>for</b> me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E
500|$|Faust and the {{production}} team have acknowledged some of the fandom and fan-created elements of the show and incorporated them into the animation. Though Hasbro's priority is to deliver a child-friendly show, the writers and production staff, according to Linda Steiner, {{senior vice president of}} Hasbro Studios, [...] "We will <b>certainly,</b> <b>for</b> fun, do the 'bronie' check to see if this could pass with them, but our job is to deliver to the kids first." [...] Margaret Loesch, {{president and chief executive of}} Hub Network, said that they have kept their nods to the fandom to subtle hints. She added, [...] "We haven't driven this movement, the fans have, and we don't want to get ahead of that. We want to nourish this phenomenon, not manipulate it." [...] A writer for the show, Meghan McCarthy, said, [...] "Some pop culture-y things are thrown in, but we don't want to do anything that's too 'wink wink'. It detracts from the story that we're trying to tell". Many of the nods to the older audience are drawn in by the storyboard artists and animators, who are challenged to populate scripted scenes with background ponies; McCarthy points the example of ponies fashioned after the main characters from The Big Lebowski due to having to fill in space for scenes set in a bowling alley for the episode [...] "The Cutie Pox".|$|E
5000|$|In reaction, {{some writers}} tried either to resurrect older English words ( [...] for musician, [...] <b>for</b> <b>certainly,</b> [...] <b>for</b> conscience, [...] for confused) {{or to make}} new words from Germanic roots ( [...] for conclusion, [...] for anniversary, [...] for prophet). However, few of these words remain in common use.|$|R

500|$|Another pivotal romantic {{relationship}} {{for the character}} occurred when Chloe began dating her best friend Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). The decision to develop the friendship into a romance was debated by the writers, as it was Hendrickson and Rikaart who approached the writers wanting to work together. Due to their real-life friendship, Rikaart said of the storyline turn, [...] "The level of comfort is so easy, <b>certainly</b> <b>for</b> portraying the friendship part of the Kevin/Chloe relationship, that is a no-brainer. [...] So it was like, {{when are we going}} to have to start acting?" [...] The relationship is plagued with constant issues, such as interference from Kevin's mentally unstable ex-wife Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), and mob princess Angelina Veneziano's (Diana DeGarmo) intense crush on Kevin (which leads to a brief marriage, with Angelina's mob father threatening to kill Kevin if he doesn't wed his daughter). Angelina leaves town and Chloe and Kevin finally marry. In 2013, Kevin and Chloe have financial troubles which Kevin thinks can be solved through criminal acts; Hendrickson said, [...] "Money is usually a common issue between couples. They’re kind of battling through this struggle. He’s trying to do his best to take care of the family and morally, it just doesn’t sit well with her. Especially with what he’s been through in the past." [...] Rikaart told On-Air On-Soaps that he and Hendrickson have discussed wanting the characters to break up, [...] "We always say, 'We have done this. We have played this. [...] Now let’s play breaking up.' That will be different." ...|$|E

[...] In the secular music category he wrote many rondeaux, all in French, as well as some ballate in Italian (almost <b>certainly</b> <b>for</b> the royal wedding of the Malatesta family).|$|E

2500|$|This is {{an unfortunate}} {{oversight}} as {{the plan of}} the estate (based on the [...] "Radburn principle" [...] pioneered in Radburn, New Jersey – a town whose design was itself inspired by the original Garden City) was an impressive and largely successful addition to the town, and matched most Garden City principles. <b>Certainly</b> <b>for</b> a period that {{has a reputation for}} poor town and residential planning it is remarkably well executed piece of urban design.|$|E
