In this study, 14 mandarin accessions representative of the diversity in this group were analyzed for their salt stress tolerance properties. Physiological parameters such as gas exchange, osmotic pressure, as well as leaf and root <b>chloride</b> <b>contents</b> were measured. Samples were harvested to characterize the presence of hydrogen peroxide and to monitor the activity of enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species synthesis and detoxification processes. Very different physiological behaviors were noted among accessions. Most cultivars that are used as rootstocks such as Citrus reshni Hort. ex Tan.

Also, some accessions used as varieties showed similar tolerance traits. Interestingly some accessions that presented high leaf <b>chloride</b> <b>contents</b> were not always associated with sensitivity traits. Also accessions such as 'Willowleaf' showed quite high leaf <b>chloride</b> <b>contents</b> that were correlated with better detoxification processes. Tolerance traits that we identified are discussed in relation to the known genetic structure in mandarins.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} behaviour for passivation of new alloy corrosion-resistant steel Cr 10 Mo 1 {{immersed in}} alkaline solutions with different pH values (13. 3, 12. 0, 10. 5, and 9. 0) and <b>chloride</b> <b>contents</b> (0. 2 M and 1. 0 M), was investigated by various electrochemical techniques: linear polarization resistance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and capacitance measurements. The chemical composition {{and structure of}} passive films were determined by XPS. The morphological features and surface composition of the immersed steel were evaluated by SEM together with EDS chemical analysis. The results evidence that pH {{plays an important role}} in the passivation of the corrosion-resistant steel and the effect is highly dependent upon the <b>chloride</b> <b>contents.</b> In solutions with low chloride (0. 2 M), the corrosion-resistant steel has notably enhanced passivity with pH falling from 13. 3 to 9. 0, but does conversely when in presence of high chloride (1. 0 M). The passive film on the corrosion-resistant steel presents a bilayer structure: an outer layer enriched in Fe oxides and hydroxides, and an inner layer, rich in Cr species. The film composition varies with pH values and <b>chloride</b> <b>contents.</b> As the pH drops, more Cr oxides are enriched in the film while Fe oxides gradually decompose. Increasing chloride promotes Cr oxides and Fe oxides to transform into their hydroxides with little protection, and this is more significant at lower pH (10. 5 and 9. 0). These changes annotate passivation characteristics of the corrosion-resistant steel in the solutions of different electrolyte...|$|R

50|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{urbanisation}} of Jaipur city and areas surrounding the lake, the ecological {{system of the}} lake and its vicinity deteriorated drastically. It became heavily silted thereby reducing the surface area of the lake. The silt deposited (estimated to be about 2,500,000 cubic metres) was contaminated with effluents (untreated sewage) from the city's drainage system causing intense eutrophication. The ground water surrounding the lake was also found to be highly contaminated and created serious health hazards. The rainwater combined with sewage water flow from the city resulted in the lake water giving off a foul smell. Water samples collected from the lake were tested and found to clearly show that the water quality was not uniform. It was extremely poor in southeast, south and southwest due to the influent nalas.

5000|$|... ==Characteristics of boiler feedwater== Water has higher heat {{capacity}} {{than most other}} substances. This quality makes it an ideal raw material for boiler operations. Boilers {{are part of a}} closed system as compared to open systems in a gas turbine. The closed system that is used is the Rankine cycle. This means that the water is recirculated throughout the system and is never in contact with the atmosphere. The water is reused and needs to be treated to continue efficient operations. Boiler water must be treated in order to be proficient in producing steam. Boiler water is treated to prevent scaling, corrosion, foaming, and priming. Chemicals are put into boiler water through the chemical feed tank to keep the water within chemical range. These chemicals are mostly oxygen scavengers and phosphates. The boiler water also has frequent blowdowns {{in order to keep the}} <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> down. The boiler operations also include bottom blows in order to get rid of solids. Scale is precipitated impurities out of the water and then forms on heat transfer surfaces. This is a problem because scale does not transfer heat very well and causes the tubes to fail by getting too hot. Corrosion is caused by oxygen in the water. The oxygen causes the metal to oxidize which lowers the melting point of the metal. Foaming and priming is caused when the boiler water does not have the correct amount of chemicals and there are suspended solids in the water which carry over in the dry pipe. The dry pipe is where the steam and water mixture are separated.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study on the benefit of chloride ion testing in the prediction of soil corrosivity, which is determined using the method of linear polarization. Existing industry standards such as AWWA C 105 and PACE 82 - 3 are currently being used to evaluate the corrosivity of soils. These standards consist of various tests, whose results permit the calculation of a corrosivity index. The following tests are suggested: pH, oxidation-reduction potential, sulfide ion content, resistivity, drainage ability, soil type, and moisture content. Up to this point, no standards have incorporated chloride ion testing into their testing procedure, even though the effect of chloride ions on the corrosion rate is well documented. It is the goal of this project to determine whether there is enough evidence to suggest that <b>chloride</b> ion <b>content</b> be introduced into existing standards. In total, 153 soils were tested following the AWWA C 105 and PACE 82 - 3 standards, {{as well as for the}} <b>chloride</b> ion <b>content.</b> Of these, 75 soils were tested using linear polarization to determine the "true" corrosivity of the soils. The analysis results showed that the information provided by the <b>chloride</b> ion <b>content</b> was not significant enough to suggest that this variable be added to the existing grids. This is due to the fact that soil resistivity, which is a required test in both standards, accounts for the presence of chloride ions. However, it should be noted that the <b>chloride</b> ion <b>content</b> is a better predictor of corrosivity than soil resistivity, and it is suggested that <b>chloride</b> ion <b>content</b> be tested whenever possible...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} paper presents {{an analysis of}} total chloride contents in concrete. The concrete mixtures that were approved by the municipality of Riyadh city in Saudi Arabia for a main ready mix concrete plant were considered in this study. The analysis {{was based on an}} experimental investigation of chloride levels in mixing water, aggregates, and concrete. The analysis also used the maximal total chloride limits of British Standards for the concrete in conjunction with other ingredients required for the mix. The results obtained suggest that the effect of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> in mixing water has minimal to moderate influence upon the <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> of concrete up to w/c equal to 0. 4. It also shows that aggregate is the critical ingredient in terms of determining the presence of chloride in concrete. Critically, the limits of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> in any concrete mix could be violated even though the limits of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> still meet some standards for their content within concrete ingredients. The proportions of any mix design are also an important factor to be considered when attempting to specify the limits of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> of the ingredients of concrete mixtures for any type of concrete. It is vital to investigate empirically the relationship between total chloride and chloride contents in ingredients in order to precisely define the limits of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> in concrete mix ingredients. Mix design that has the lowest w/c ratio is preferable as far as the <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> is concerned.
