5|$|The <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> support biofuel development, {{including}} {{the development of}} new cellulosic technologies, with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.|$|E
5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that a <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> understand how conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{create an}} infomercial.|$|R
50|$|The {{first task}} for pastry week {{required}} {{the remaining four}} contestants to bake 24 palmiers, with two different savoury fillings and shapes. The technical <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make a Savarin, a liqueur-soaked yeast cake, which none of the contestants had made before. The final <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make 36 fondant fancies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first task}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make Yorkshire puddings, which {{involved}} the standard recipe {{filled with a}} variety of ingredients and flavours. The technical <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make 12 heart-shaped [...] "lace" [...] pancakes, which required the bakers to draw a heart-shaped design with the batter. The showstopper <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make 36 churros.|$|R
5|$|Markets for second-generation {{technologies}} have been strong and growing {{over the past}} decade, and these {{technologies have}} gone from being {{a passion for the}} dedicated few to a major economic sector in countries such as Germany, Spain, the United States, and Japan. Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Macrodiversity MIMO schemes pose {{unprecedented}} {{theoretical and}} practical challenges. Among many theoretical challenges, perhaps the most fundamental <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> understand how the different average link SNRs affect the overall system capacity and individual user performance in fading environments.|$|E
25|$|Advances in {{nanofabrication}} {{techniques and}} concerns about energy shortage make people interested in this idea. The main <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase efficiency, which is now only a few percent, compared with efficiencies of up to about 95 per cent for standard rotational electromagnetic generators.|$|E
50|$|The third <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> purify {{a cup of}} {{contaminated}} water.|$|R

25|$|The Otago Peninsula {{is one of}} the {{few places}} in New Zealand where there is {{everywhere}} visible evidence of the long human occupation of the land. In a magnificent but compact setting the <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> maintain its balance of human and natural in the face of growing residential and tourist development.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of behavioral addictions like pathological gambling must change {{our way of}} understanding and dealing with addictions. Pathological (disordered) gambling has commonalities in clinical expression, etiology, comorbidity, physiology and treatment with substance use disorders (DSM-5). A <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> understand the development of compulsivity at a neurochemical level not only for drugs.|$|E
25|$|The top of El Capitan can {{be reached}} by hiking out of Yosemite Valley on the trail next to Yosemite Falls, then {{proceeding}} west. For climbers, the <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> climb up the sheer granite face. There are many named climbing routes, all of them arduous, including Iron Hawk and Sea of Dreams, for example.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> light {{a candle}} using the various given materials.|$|R

25|$|A {{clean room}} is {{normally}} kept {{at a higher}} pressure than the external environment to keep contaminants out, and a biohazard laboratory is kept at a lower pressure to keep the biohazards in. The <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> combine these in a single building. Solutions suggested include a triple walled containment facility, {{and one of the}} suggestions includes extensive use of robot handlers for the samples.|$|E
25|$|A {{significantly}} profound <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{identify the}} natural environmental dynamics {{in contrast to}} environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in {{the object of the}} study.|$|E
25|$|In Costa Rica, 2020 {{projections}} for water demand {{for all uses}} are estimated to reach 39km3, equivalent to 35% of the total water resources available. The key <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> properly manage the exponential growth in demand from 5% to 35% of available water resources. Urban development continues to increase the pressure on water resources {{and the use of}} water and groundwater in particular is becoming increasingly more complex due to rapid urbanization and overexploitation from domestic, industrial, and agricultural demand.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build a scale, {{to weigh}} exactly 15,6 kg of potatoes.|$|R
5000|$|The third <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{extinguish}} candles from a distance, {{using only}} 100g of water.|$|R

25|$|As a mode {{of inquiry}} Rabinow distinguishes the Anthropology of the Contemporary from Michel Foucault’s History of the Present. As Rabinow {{describes}} it, the History of the Present consists in formulating {{an understanding of the}} past as “a means of showing the contingency of the present and thereby contribute to making a more open future.” The current <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be specific about which inquiries and what objects are best engaged with an approach that is drawn from a History of the Present orientation.|$|E
25|$|Case-control {{studies are}} usually {{faster and more}} cost {{effective}} than cohort studies, but are sensitive to bias (such as recall bias and selection bias). The main <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should {{be representative of the}} distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} livelihood benefits {{derived by}} rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources. Community forests also became {{the source of}} diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods. Community forestry shows traits of political, financial, and ecological sustainability, including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework, and robust civil society institutions and networks. However, a continuing <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalised groups. Lessons for replication emphasise experiential learning, establishment of a strong civil society network, flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities, and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process.|$|E

50|$|The Sam and Mark <b>Challenge</b> films <b>were</b> similar <b>to</b> the DSD challenges, {{but they}} {{followed}} {{the progress of the}} two presenters being challenged to DSD. These had five parts, with one part from one of the challenges being shown in each episode of the programme. Sam's <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> train to become a stuntman in the US, and take part in a stunt-show. Mark's <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> learn hip-hop dancing, and take part in a one on one battle at the UK Hip Hop Dance Championships.|$|R

25|$|Each {{category}} is distinguished by properties that all its objects have in common, {{such as the}} empty set or the product of two topologies, yet {{in the definition of}} a category, objects are considered atomic, i.e., we do not know whether an object A is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept. Hence, the <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. To define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets, one can characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find universal properties that uniquely determine the objects of interest.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make {{tuberculosis}} services {{accessible to}} the entire population. Although China has a policy of free tuberculosis services, in most places these are available only to permanent residents in a particular community. Urban migrants, who have relocated from poor rural areas to seek a better livelihood, {{are not eligible for}} such free services. These vulnerable, predominantly young migrants—now numbering more than 150 million—tend to live and work in crowded environments and are unlikely to seek medical care when they become ill. Such individuals contribute to the spread of tuberculosis, HIV infection, and other infectious diseases within urban centers. The growing epidemic of co-infection with tuberculosis and HIV if left unchecked will substantially increase the number of tuberculosis cases and deaths.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{challenge}} of project management {{is to achieve}} all of the project goals within the given constraints. This information is usually described in project documentation, created {{at the beginning of}} the development process. The primary constraints are scope, time, quality and budget. The secondary — and more ambitious — <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> optimize the allocation of necessary inputs and apply them to meet pre-defined objectives. The object of project management is to produce a complete project which complies with the client's objectives. In many cases the object of project management is also to shape or reform the client's brief in order to feasibly be able to address the client's objectives. Once the client's objectives are clearly established they should impact on all decisions made by other people involved in the project-project managers, designers, contractors, sub-contractors, etc. If the project management objectives are ill-defined or too tightly prescribed it will have a detrimental effect on decision making.|$|E
