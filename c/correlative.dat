5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron <b>correlative</b> contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E

40|$|The {{two goals}} {{of this paper}} are (i) to {{establish}} that there are comparative correla-tives that are not comparative conditionals and that the semantics of such correl-atives crucially involves a relation (possibly the identity relation) between differ-entials (against much of the previous literature, e. g., McCawley 1988, Beck 1997) and (ii) to argue that a unified analysis should be given for such non-conditional, differential-based comparative (and equative) <b>correlatives</b> and the more familiar, conditional-like comparative <b>correlatives.</b> <b>Correlatives</b> are “biclausal topic-comment structures [ [...] . ] [in which] the de-pendent clause introduces one or more topical referents to be commented on by the matrix clause, where each topical referent must {{be picked up by}} – correlated with – an anaphoric proform. ” (Bittner 2001).

25|$|Hauerwas {{believes}} {{that there is a}} difference between the concept of death and the criteria for death. The concept of death “involves a philosophical judgment of a significant change that has happened in a person” and therefore “is a <b>correlative</b> of what one takes to be the necessary condition of human life, e.g., … the potential for consciousness”. The criteria of death, however, are “those empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG”. Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve “as a symbol of when it is time to die”. A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.|$|E
25|$|But {{these two}} forces, the {{me and the}} not-me, are {{reciprocally}} limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, <b>correlative</b> and reciprocally finite, {{to which they are}} related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.|$|E

25|$|The {{truth is}} that Cousin's {{doctrine}} of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts {{to little more than}} a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind.

And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being—whether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being—are problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.|$|E
25|$|The uranium-lead dating of zircons from an ash {{bed in the}} Bass Formation, argon–argon dating of {{overlying}} igneous rocks, and thermochronologic {{studies of}} the underling Vishnu Basement Rocks constrain {{the age of the}} Bass Formation and associated Unkar Group.

This date is consistent with radiometric ages of Precambrian strata interpreted to be <b>correlative</b> with the Bass Formation and its age estimated from earlier paleomagentic studies. In addition, this date is consistent with the younger Cardenas Basalt having been erupted about 1,104 Ma. Finally, the uranium-lead dating of zircons is consistent with studies of the underlying Vishnu Basement Rocks that indicate they were exhumed from depths of 25 to 10km depths between 1,750 and 1,660 Ma and from a depth of 10km to the surface on which the Bass Formation lies between 1,660 and 1,250 Ma.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{provided}} a statistic showing that nearly a billion monarchs have {{vanished from the}} overwintering sites since 1990. At that time, {{one of the main}} reasons cited was the herbicides used by farmers and homeowners on milkweed, a plant used as a food source, a home and a nursery by the monarchs. A 2016 study also attributed the last decade's ten-fold decline in overwintering numbers of the eastern monarch population to the loss of breeding habitat, namely the many species of milkweed (Asclepias species) that developing larvae require for food, however scientists believe there are other factors as well. A number of researchers believe milkweed loss during the breeding season is the cause because declines in milkweed abundance are highly correlated with the adoption of herbicide-tolerant genetically modified corn and soybeans, which now constitute 89% and 94% of these crops, respectively, in the U.S. However, <b>correlative</b> evidence does not prove causation, and other possible causes of the overwintering declines have been proposed.|$|E

25|$|The {{environmentally}} ubiquitous L-alanine derivative, β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) {{has long}} {{been identified as a}} neurotoxin which was first associated with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism–dementia complex (ALS/PDC) in the Chamorro people of Guam. The widespread occurrence of BMAA can be attributed to cyanobacteria which produce BMAA as a result of complex reactions under nitrogen stress. Following research, excitotoxicity appears to be the likely mode of action for BMAA which acts as a glutamate agonist, activating AMPA and NMDA receptors and causing damage to cells even at relatively low concentrations of 10 μM. The subsequent uncontrolled influx of Ca2+ then leads to the pathophysiology described above. Further evidence of the role of BMAA as an excitotoxin is rooted in the ability of NMDA antagonists like MK801 to block the action of BMAA. More recently, evidence has been found that BMAA is misincorporated in place of L-serine in human proteins. It should be noted that a considerable portion of the research relating to the toxicity of BMAA has been conducted on rodents. A study published in 2016 with vervets (Chlorocebus sabaeus) in St. Kitts, which are homozygous for the apoE4 gene (a condition which in humans is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease), found that vervets orally administered BMAA developed hallmark histopathology features of Alzheimer's Disease including amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangle accumulation. Vervets in the trial fed smaller doses of BMAA were found to have <b>correlative</b> decreases in these pathology features.This study demonstrates that BMAA, an environmental toxin, can trigger neurodegenerative disease {{as a result of a}} gene/environment interaction. While BMAA has been detected in brain tissue of deceased ALS/PDC patients, further insight is required to trace neurodegenerative pathology in humans to BMAA.|$|E
