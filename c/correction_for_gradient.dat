40|$|The {{determination}} {{of water and}} oil droplet size distributions in food emulsions by low-field NMR {{has the advantage of}} a simple and non-perturbing sample preparation. Furthermore, NMR performs very well with respect to precision. The current implementation on most benchtop NMR spectrometers deploys a variation of gradient duration and requires continuous <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> <b>gradient</b> imbalances, thus making the whole procedure a time-consuming one. By using variation of gradient strength and further stretching the capability of commercial benchtop NMR spectrometers, both water and oil droplet sizes can be measured in a more rapid manner, typically two to three times faster. The measured droplet size distributions are equivalent to those assessed by the current (slow) method, for both O/W and W/O emulsions. Furthermore, the rapid method shows a good performance with respect to precision. In addition, the method is able to determine droplet sizes in samples with much smaller amounts of dispersed phase...|$|R

40|$|An outline {{is given}} of LIMS {{temperature}} determinations (as {{a function of}} pressure) from measurements in two channels covering portions of the 15 -micrometer band of carbon dioxide. The known sources of error from the radiometer and data reduction are used to estimate the systematic and random errors expected of the results. Observational determinations of the complete end-to-end precision are obtained by computing the standard deviation of six sequential temperature retrievals in regions where the atmosphere is horizontally uniform. This yields values of 0. 2 to 0. 6 K, in reasonable agreement with the estimates. A <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> horizontal <b>gradients</b> in the atmosphere leads to a large reduction in {{the differences between the}} stratospheric temperatures determined on the ascending and descending portions of the orbit.

Performing a genome-wide screen for changes in such proteins requires developing methods that automate analysis of {{a large amount of}} images, the first step of which requires robust segmentation of the cell. We developed a segmentation system, PombeX, that can segment cells from transmitted illumination images with focus gradient and varying contrast. <b>Corrections</b> <b>for</b> focus <b>gradient</b> are applied to the image to aid in accurate detection of cell membrane and cytoplasm pixels, which is used to generate initial contours <b>for</b> cells. <b>Gradient</b> vector flow snake evolution is used to obtain the final cell contours.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a study to produce a computer program to calculate laminar and turbulent boundary layer flows. The program is capable of calculating the following types of flow: (1) incompressible or compressible, (2) two dimensional or axisymmetric, and (3) flows with significant transverse curvature. Also, the program can handle a large variety of boundary conditions, such as blowing or suction, arbitrary temperature distributions and arbitrary wall heat fluxes. The program has been specialized to the calculation of equilibrium air flows {{and all of the}} thermodynamic and transport properties used are for air. For the turbulent transport properties, the eddy viscosity approach has been used. Although the eddy viscosity models are semi-empirical, the model employed in the program has <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> pressure <b>gradients,</b> suction and blowing and compressibility. The basic method of approach is to put the equations of motion into a finite difference form and then solve them by use of a digital computer. The program is written in FORTRAN 4 and requires small amounts of computer time on most scientific machines. For example, most laminar flows can be calculated in less than one minute of machine time, while turbulent flows usually require three or four minutes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issue of testing {{hypothesis}} in symmetric and log-symmetric linear regression models in small and moderate-sized samples. We focus on four tests, namely the Wald, likelihood ratio, score, and gradient tests. These tests rely on asymptotic results and are unreliable when the sample size is not large enough to guarantee a good agreement between the exact distribution of the test statistic and the corresponding chi-squared asymptotic distribution. Bartlett and Bartlett-type corrections typically attenuate the size distortion of the tests. These corrections are available in the literature for the likelihood ratio and score tests in symmetric linear regression models. Here, we derive a Bartlett-type <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> the <b>gradient</b> test. We show that the corrections are also valid for the log-symmetric linear regression models. We numerically compare the various tests, and bootstrapped tests, through simulations. Our results suggest that the corrected and bootstrapped tests exhibit type I probability error closer to the chosen nominal level with virtually no power loss. The analytically corrected tests, including the Bartlett-corrected gradient test derived in this paper, perform as well as the bootstrapped tests with the advantage of not requiring computationally-intensive calculations. We present two real data applications to illustrate the usefulness of the modified tests.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. This paper looks mainly at two measuring techniques, namely, the hot-wire anemometer and the pitot tube when utilized in wall-bounded shear flows. Additional heat losses occur from the hot wires in presence of walls that are not accounted for in the calibration process of the wires. Because of this, <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> erroneous in fluid velocity measured by the hot wire in the wall proximity are to be carried out. Similarly, when the pitot tube is applied to flow measurements, the mean shear gradient and the wall proximity come to play major roles of incorrect readings. Its size is therefore to be chosen such that <b>corrections</b> <b>for</b> the shear <b>gradient</b> and the wall proximity are minimal. The paper outlines, therefore, corrections applied to the pitot tube measured data in both pipe and channel flows. Available corrections are adopted in this paper to both the pipe and the channel flow measured data, yielding pitot tube results that are {{comparable to those of}} the hot wire and this was demonstrated by comparing the results corrected to the socalled the logarithmic velocity profile. cf 201...|$|R
40|$|Pulse wave distortions, mainly {{caused by}} reflections, and {{pressure}} gradients, caused by flow in the resistive vascular tree, may cause differences between finger and brachial artery pressures. These differences may limit the use of finger pressure measurements. We investigated whether brachial artery pressure waves could be reconstructed from finger pressure measurements by correcting <b>for</b> the pressure <b>gradient</b> in addition to <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> pulse wave distortion with a previously described filter. Finger artery pressure (with Finapres), intra-arterial brachial artery pressure (BAP), Riva-Rocci/ Korotkoff (RRK), oscillometric, and return-to-flow (RTF) measurements were simultaneously performed in 57 healthy elderly subjects and patients with vascular disease and/or hypertension. A generalized waveform filter was used to correct for pulse wave distortions. <b>Correction</b> equations <b>for</b> the pressure <b>gradient,</b> based on finger pressure, RRK, RTF, or oscillometric measurements, were obtained in 28 randomly selected subjects and tested in 29. Before reconstruction, Finapres underestimated mean and diastolic BAP (finger pressure minus BAP: systolic, - 3. 2 +/- 16. 9 mm Hg; mean, - 13. 0 +/- 10. 5 mm Hg; diastolic, - 8. 4 +/- 9. 0 mm Hg [mean +/- SD]). After filtering, reconstructed BAP waves were similar to actual BAP in shape but not in pressure level. Optimal <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> the pressure <b>gradient</b> with an equation based on RTF measurements reduced the pressure differences to meet American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation criteria (reconstructed finger pressure minus BAP: systolic, 3. 7 +/- 7. 0 mm Hg; mean, 0. 7 +/- 4. 6 mm Hg; and diastolic, 1. 0 +/- 4. 9 mm Hg).
