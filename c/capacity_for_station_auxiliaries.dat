30|$|Automatically {{controlled}} trains indeed consume {{less energy}} {{due to the}} optimized acceleration, traction, and braking processes, and it is reported that the energy consumption can be cut {{by as much as}} 30 % depending on the degree of automation [33]. In the operation experience of the Vancouver Sky-Train system [34], the energy consumption per passenger-kilometer is just less than half the average of the other systems since the braking process of train could be coordinated with other accelerating trains to enhance the usage of regenerative energy in DTO systems. Since the usage of the regenerative energy is strongly affected by the power supply system and the traffic density, the Singapore MRT operator introduced inverters at substations to recover the regenerative energy <b>for</b> <b>station</b> <b>auxiliary</b> loads. These inverters can recover up to 5 % of the total energy used by the urban rail transit systems [35].|$|R

40|$|Electric and hybrid {{vehicles}} play {{an increasing}} {{role in the}} road transport networks. Despite their advantages, they have relatively limited cruising range in comparison to traditional diesel/petrol vehicles and require significant battery charging time. Given a particular road network layout, determining appropriate locations and <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> charging <b>stations</b> is a chal- lenging multi-objective optimisation problem with many constraints. Some of the key objectives are to minimise the length of detours from a desired route necessary for recharging while assuming a reasonably small number of charging stations to serve the whole network (e. g., see [2]). We propose to model the facility location problem for the placement of charging stations as a k-domination problem on reachability graphs derived from the original road network. This model takes into consideration natural assumptions such as a threshold for the remaining battery charge, and provides some guaranteed minimal choice for travelling to recharge the battery.

30|$|In general, MIMO {{beamforming}} {{techniques in}} communication systems are addressed {{in three different}} systems: point-to-point, cellular, and ad hoc networks. The great potential of MIMO in point-to-point communication is shown in [1, 4, 6, 21] and linear precoders (eigen-coders) and beamformers have been designed for point-to-point MIMO links in [5, 7]. In cellular networks, beamforming algorithms minimize the total power and enhance <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> array-equipped base <b>stations</b> and single antenna mobile transmitters [8 – 11]. In ad hoc networks, without a central controller, distributed beamforming techniques increase system throughput and lower energy consumption [12, 22 – 24].

40|$|Resistojets are {{candidates}} <b>for</b> space <b>station</b> <b>auxiliary</b> propulsion, {{and should}} be characterized by both long life and multipropellant operations, requirements limited by available materials. Grain stabilized platinum is examined {{for use as a}} resistojet thruster material. Use of platinum in other applications indicates it can be used at moderately high temperatures for extended periods of time. Past results indicate that grain-stabilized platinum should be sufficiently inert in candidate propellant environments. Therefore, compatibility of platinum-yttria (P/Y 2 O 3) and platinum-zirconia (Pt/ZrO 2) with carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen and ammonia is examined. A series of 1000 hr tests in CO 2, H 2, and NH 3 is conducted at 1400 C and a series of 1000 hr tests in CH 4 is conducted at about 500 C. Scanning electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy and depth profiling analysis are then used {{to determine the effects of}} propellants on the material surface, to evaluate possible material contamination and to evaluate grain growth. The results indicate that there is carbon deposition on the surface of the Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 in both the CO 2 and CH 4 environments. In the H 2 environment, the Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 specimen surfaces are roughened. After exposure to the NH 3 environment, the Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 are roughened and pitted over the entire heated area with some pitted areas along the grain boundaries. SEM photos show grain growth in cross-sectional views of all the Pt/Y 2 O 3 samples and the Pt/ZrO 2 samples, except that tested in methane. Mass loss measurements indicate that Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 would last in excess of 200, 000 hr in each propellant environment. However, in NH 3 both Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 are severely pitted, with voids up to 50 percent into the material. Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 are not recommended for high temperature service in NH 3...|$|R
