The result {{of this study is that}} conventional buying and selling agreement can be used as measuring rod of electronic buying and selling agreement, since the agreement through <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> is the extent of conventional buying and selling agreement. However, if the buying and selling agreement through <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> is carried out trans-nationally, lex informatica using The Theory of International Space will be valid. Legal verification on buying and selling agreement through <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> is based on regulation of Undang-Undang nomor 11 tahun 2008 on <b>electronic</b> information and <b>transaction.</b> HIR regulates on general about regulation of valid evidence devices on civil procedure, while Undang-Undang nomor 11 tahun 2008 on <b>electronic</b> information and <b>transaction</b> regulates more extent issue related to anything that can be clarified as valid evidence devise on carrying out <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction...</b>|$|R

If the <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> business can be well managed business {{that will be a}} huge benefit to the economy. Currently e-commerce ecosystem in Indonesia is still unfavorable. One of the obstacles in <b>electronic</b> <b>transactions,</b> namely related payments. This problem arises because the consumer electronics business in Indonesia has yet to feel the ease and security in <b>electronic</b> <b>transactions</b> that affect their beliefs and attitudes. Related to this, online businesses have started offering payment solutions that enable customers. Therefore it takes an <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> conducive ecosystem to support such solutions. In this case the Government is obliged to facilitate <b>electronic</b> <b>transactions</b> conducive ecosystem. In addition, the implementation of the strategy also needed institutional electronic certificate to encourage the growth Ecosystem transasksi Electronic System Operator reliability and performance as well as facilitate the Government in managing electronic certificate policy.

40|$|Newly {{emerging}} {{digital economy}} provides {{us a new}} economic opportunity that replace traditional form of material transaction in physical space with a <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> in cyber space. One notable characteristic of <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> is that thanks to the information technology, <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> can occur with minimal information and delivery delay. One of the key questions with regard to this changing transaction type {{is the effect of}} reduced time delay on the level of production, consumption and price of goods in <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction.</b> This paper examines the effect of time delay on <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> by comparing changes in model behaviors in response to changes in time delay such as information recognition delay, delivery delay, production and marketing capacity acquisition delay etc. Three models were used to compare behavior changes; beer game model, commodity production cycle model, and market growth model. Results indicated that effect of reduced time delay on model behavior depends on several factors; competitiveness of market, price elasticity of supply and demand, availability of human resources. Also, the result suggest that availability of human resource is the key factor for a sustained growth of <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>electronic</b> <b>transactions</b> (eTs) {{will be the}} {{key driver}} in future {{information}} super highways and it is as significant now as it ever will be. The rapid increase {{in the use of}} the <b>electronic</b> <b>transactions</b> in businesses has given rise to the emergence of the globalization of commercial services. Many of the professional predictions indicate that use of the <b>electronic</b> <b>transactions</b> has increased the business to consumer relationships in day to day business work significantly. This has led to a frantic battle for payment mechanisms that can provide a new medium for conducting transactions. In most successful business processes in the current scenario the customer and the merchant do not meet face-to-face, and the clients have increased options and solutions available to them on real time when conducting transactions. This paper investigates the factors that influence the effectiveness of <b>electronic</b> <b>transactions</b> for the business to consumer relationships.

Electronic signatures are a key instrument in a document enabling electronic transactions-providing that assurance of data validity. The electronic signatures act as a legal attestation of the authenticity of that document with equivalent to handwritten signatures. The obstacle presented in the <b>electronic</b> <b>transaction</b> is the security factor which has been the major setback as the rate of crime increases in the Nigerian cyberspace. The paper further examined the relevancy of electronic signatures in <b>electronic</b> <b>transactions</b> in line with relevant laws at both international and domestic sphere.
