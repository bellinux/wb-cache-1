50|$|The largely Aramaic-speaking {{population}} of Syria during {{the heyday of}} the Byzantine empire was probably not exceeded again until the 19th century. Prior to the Arab Islamic Conquest in the 7th century AD, the bulk of the population were Arameans, but Syria was also home to Greek and Roman ruling classes, Assyrians still dwelt in the north east, Phoenicians along the coasts, and Jewish and Armenian communities was also extant in major cities, with Nabateans and pre-Islamic Arabs such as the Lakhmids and Ghassanids dwelling in the deserts of southern Syria. Syriac Christianity had taken hold as the major religion, although others still followed Judaism, Mithraism, Manicheanism, <b>Greco-Roman</b> <b>Religion,</b> Canaanite Religion and Mesopotamian Religion. Syria's large and prosperous population made Syria {{one of the most important}} of the Roman and Byzantine provinces, particularly during the 2nd and 3rd centuries (AD).|$|R

40|$|My {{research}} {{was done on}} the spread of early Christianity in the Roman Empire starting after Christ’s ascension (roughly 33 A. D.). I examined the methods used by early Christians to spread their religion, {{as well as the}} persecution against Christians that caused further mobilization. I also compared the appeal of Christianity to that of <b>Greco-Roman</b> <b>religions</b> to try and infer why the idea caught so quickly. I took an in-depth look at the apostle Paul and the missionary journeys he took to spread the Word to the Empire. I also came to conclusions about how the efforts of these early Christians impacted the church for centuries to come. My research included reading various books and journal articles on the topic...|$|R

50|$|In {{the ancient}} <b>Greco-Roman</b> <b>religion,</b> Dionysos (or Bacchus) was {{the god of}} the grape harvest, {{winemaking}} and wine, of ritual madness and ecstasy, of merry making and theatre. The original rite of Dionysus is associated with a wine cult and he may have been worshipped as early as c. 1500-1100 BC by Mycenean Greeks. The Dionysian Mysteries were a ritual of ancient Greece and Rome which used intoxicants and other trance-inducing techniques (like dance and music) to remove inhibitions and social constraints, liberating the individual to return to a natural state. In his Laws, Plato said that alcoholic drinking parties should be the basis of any educational system, because the alcohol allows relaxation of otherwise fixed views. The Symposium (literally, 'drinking together') was a dramatised account of a drinking party where the participants debated the nature of love.|$|R
5|$|From the mid-first century AD, Christianity {{took root}} in Egypt {{and it was}} {{originally}} seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from Egyptian <b>Religion</b> and <b>Greco-Roman</b> <b>religion</b> and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out. In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples. Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed. As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to speak their language, {{the ability to read}} hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.|$|R
50|$|During the 2nd {{century the}} Goths of {{southern}} Russia discovered a newfound taste for gold figurines and objects inlaid with precious stones. This style was borrowed from Scythians and the Sarmatians, had <b>some</b> <b>Greco-Roman</b> influences, {{and was also}} popular with the Huns. Perhaps the most famous examples {{are found in the}} fourth-century Pietroasele treasure (Romania), which includes a great gold eagle brooch (picture). The eagle motif derives from East Asia and results from the participation of the forebears of the Goths in the Hunnic Empire, as in the fourth-century Gothic polychrome eagle-head belt buckle (picture) from South Russia.|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] available on Sabinet Gateway project - African Journal Archive, [URL] Hymn to Zeus by the Stoic philosopher Cleanthes {{is one of the}} most intriguing texts to survive from tl 1 e Hellenist:ic period, and of great significance for the history of Hellenistic philosophy, the history of Hellenistic and <b>Greco-Roman</b> <b>religions</b> as well as the history of Greek literatu re. A detailed study of all three these facets - philosophical, religious and literary - is essential for understanding the poem. The Hymn itself is remarkable precisely because it combines different philosophical, religious and literary traditions and sources into a new expression of philosophical religion. Scholars, however, often focus on one aspect of the text without giving due recognition to the integration accomplished in it. To do justice to this text means to understand the way the text itself interprets the traditions it draws upon; it also means to take the Hymn seriously as a text that still has something to say to us.

5000|$|Gold {{glass or}} gold {{sandwich}} glass {{is a luxury}} form of glass where a decorative design in gold leaf is fused between two layers of glass. First found in Hellenistic Greece, it is especially characteristic of the Roman glass of the Late Empire in the 3rd and 4th century AD, where the gold decorated roundels of cups and other vessels were often {{cut out of the}} piece they had originally decorated and cemented to the walls of the catacombs of Rome as grave markers for the small recesses where bodies were buried. About 500 pieces of gold glass used in this way have been recovered. [...] Complete vessels are far rarer. Many show religious imagery from Christianity, traditional <b>Greco-Roman</b> <b>religion</b> and its various cultic developments, and in a few examples Judaism. Others show portraits of their owners, and the finest are [...] "among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity". [...] From the 1st century AD the technique was also used for the gold colour in mosaics.|$|R
