25|$|Various {{transformation}} {{properties for}} ensuring OT system correctness have been identified. These properties {{can be maintained}} by either the transformation <b>control</b> <b>algorithm</b> or by the transformation functions. Different OT system designs have different division of responsibilities among these components. The specifications of these properties and preconditions of requiring them are given below.|$|E
25|$|The <b>control</b> <b>algorithm</b> invokes a {{corresponding}} set of transformation functions, which {{determine how to}} transform one operation against another according to the operation types, positions, and other parameters. The correctness responsibilities of these two layers are formally specified {{by a set of}} transformation properties and conditions. Different OT systems with different control algorithms, functions, and communication topologies require maintaining different sets of transformation properties. The separation of an OT system into these two layers allows for the design of generic control algorithms that are applicable to different kinds of application with different data and operation models.|$|E

25|$|The ESC {{system uses}} several sensors to {{determine}} what the driver wants (input). Other sensors indicate the actual {{state of the vehicle}} (response). The <b>control</b> <b>algorithm</b> compares driver input to vehicle response and decides, when necessary, to apply brakes and/or reduce throttle by the amounts calculated through the state space (set of equations used to model the dynamics of the vehicle). The ESC controller can also receive data from and issue commands to other controllers on the vehicle such as an all wheel drive system or an active suspension system to improve vehicle stability and controllability.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{theoretical}} benefits, {{such as a}} tighter turning radius at low speed, {{attempts have been made}} to construct motorcycles with two-wheel steering. One working prototype by Ian Drysdale in Australia is reported to [...] "work very well." [...] Issues in the design include whether to provide active control of the rear wheel or let it swing freely. In the case of active control, the <b>control</b> <b>algorithm</b> needs to decide between steering with or in the opposite direction of the front wheel, when, and how much. One implementation of two-wheel steering, the Sideways bike, lets the rider control the steering of both wheels directly. Another, the Swing Bike, had the second steering axis in front of the seat so that it could also be controlled by the handlebars.|$|E

Further, understanding concurrency <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> and distributed computations is itself a difficult task. Visualization can help with both of these problems. Thus, we have developed an exploratory environment in which people can prototype and test various versions of concurrency <b>control</b> <b>algorithms,</b> study and debug distributed computations, and view performance statistics of distributed systems. In this paper, we describe the exploratory environment and show how {{it can be used to}} explore concurrency <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> for the interactive steering of distributed computations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Node {{placement}} in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is frequently redundant and massive.

Tree-forming is a common strategy in topology <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> that can be employed for such purpose.

The framework separates the management APIs provided by individual virtual machine technologies from the high-level <b>control</b> <b>algorithms,</b> which makes the design of generic controllers possible. In addition, <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> can be replaced without effort, which provides an easy way for comparing the performance of different <b>control</b> <b>algorithms.</b> We discuss first approaches to <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> that were designed the framework.

40|$|Control {{applications}} are often implemented on highly cost-sensitive and resource-constrained embedded platforms, such as microcontrollers {{with a small}} on-chip memory. Typically, <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> are designed using model-based approaches, where {{the details of the}} implementation platform are completely ignored. As a result, optimizations that integrate platform-level characteristics into the <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> design are largely missing. With the emergence of cyber-physical systems (CPS) -oriented thinking, there has lately been a strong interest in co-design of <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> and their implementation platforms, leading to work on networked control systems and computation-aware <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> design. However, there has so far been no work on integrating the characteristics of a memory architecture into the design of <b>control</b> <b>algorithms.</b> In this paper we, for the first time, show that accounting for the impact of on-chip memory (or cache) reuse on the performance of control applications motivates new techniques for <b>control</b> <b>algorithms</b> design. This leads to significant improvement in quality of control for given resource availability, or more efficient implementations of embedded control applications. We believe that this paper opens up a variety of possibilities for memory-related optimizations of embedded control systems, that will be pursued by researchers working on computer-aided design for CPS...|$|R

[...] Compare to the pancreatic physiology, where insulin and amylin are released from the beta cells in pulses almost directly to the liver in response to the immediate blood glucose level. The natural release from the beta cells is a closed loop response to sensed glucose, and the shape of the insulin delivery is adaptable and appropriate to the food eaten and the body's present metabolic capability.|$|E
