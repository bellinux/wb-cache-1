Here SMMEs are defined as small business entities that are managed by one or more owner(s) while operating in any sector or sub-sector of the national economy. The main roles of SMMEs are to alleviate poverty, reduce unemployment and uplift the South African economy. South African SMMEs are responsible for employing {{more than half of the}} national workforce and are believed to contribute up to 34. 8 % towards the national Gross Domestic Product. Unfortunately an estimated 80 % of South African SMMEs fail within their first 5 years of existence; particularly due to the realisation of micro economic factors and macroeconomic factors.

Indeed, history is full of episodes in which the financial position of the public sector is substantially altered-or its true nature uncovered-as a result of government bailouts of financial or nonfinancial entities, in both the private and the public sector.

Country experiences are used to illustrate ways these issues are addressed in practice and challenges faced.
