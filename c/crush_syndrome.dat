25|$|Thomas and Blalock did {{groundbreaking}} {{research into}} the causes of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock. This work later evolved into research on <b>crush</b> <b>syndrome</b> and saved {{the lives of thousands}} of soldiers on the battlefields of World War II. In hundreds of experiments, the two disproved traditional theories which held that shock was caused by toxins in the blood. Blalock, a highly original scientific thinker and something of an iconoclast, had theorized that shock resulted from fluid loss outside the vascular bed and that the condition could be effectively treated by fluid replacement. Assisted by Thomas, he was able to provide incontrovertible proof of this theory, and in so doing, he gained wide recognition in the medical community by the mid-1930s. At this same time, Blalock and Thomas began experimental work in vascular and cardiac surgery, defying medical taboos against operating upon the heart. It was this work that laid the foundation for the revolutionary lifesaving surgery they were to perform at Johns Hopkins a decade later.|$|E

The newspaper Pravda complained that the lack of cranes meant that [...] "seconds and hours are being lost – that means lives." [...] The paper also stated that too many Soviet personnel were giving advice and not enough people were actually searching. The daily newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya noted that there were families living out in the open even while there were an abundance of tents available. Health minister Yevgeniy Chazov urged the creation of a governmental body to assist with disaster management. Baxter International, an American health care company with headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, designed and built a flying medical lab set up with 20 dialysis machines to be used with victims suffering from <b>crush</b> <b>syndrome</b> (trauma associated with building collapses), but were unable to get started for four days until the visas were available. With the hospitals destroyed, and their limited knowledge of the care requirements, the Soviets were not well-equipped to deal with the cases of <b>crush</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Author and professor of geopolitics Pierre Verluise detailed in his 1995 book Armenia in Crisis: The 1988 Earthquake, how a French doctor and director of a Leninakan hospital described that he had seen one hundred victims suffering from the syndrome each day during the first three days. In order to prevent kidney failure or death, the treatment requires prompt hospitalization, and according to the doctor, the victims were not receiving adequate medication and dialysis and, as a result, most died before the arrival of the first foreign dialysis machines.|$|E

40|$|Low-level direct {{electric}} current {{has been shown}} to be capable of destroying tumour tissue. Using an early-passage subcutaneous murine mammary carcinoma, the relationships between the volume of tumour destruction, charge and polarity have been examined. The results revealed a direct correlation between charge passed and absolute volume regression when the intratumoral electrode was made either an anode or a cathode. Tumour destruction for a given charge was significantly greater following anodic than cathodic treatment. A direct correlation was also observed between the percentage volume of prompt treatment-induced regression and the in situ end point of tumour growth delay. During the course of these experiments, a highly reproducible toxic effect was discovered, which has not been previously reported for this modality. An anodic charge greater than 10. 6 coulombs or a cathodic charge greater than 21. 6 coulombs resulted in 100 % mortality at 24 - 72 h, while lower charges had no influence on mortality. Quantitative assays of a number of blood parameters showed that mortality was associated with serum electrolyte imbalances and appeared to be the result of the metabolic load of tumour breakdown products. These effects are similar to the tumour lysis or surgical <b>crush</b> <b>syndromes</b> and should not constitute a significant problem in clinical practice, where the tumour mass to total body mass ratio will normally be much smaller...|$|R

40|$|Intervention of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force in the 1999 Marmara, Turkey earthquake. BackgroundMajor {{earthquakes}} {{are followed}} by {{a substantial number of}} <b>crush</b> <b>syndromes</b> and pigment-induced acute renal failures (ARFs). The natural evolution of this problem rapidly leads to death. Today's possibilities of dialysis therapy enable saving numerous lives that otherwise would be lost. Currently, the primary problem is organizational, if huge catastrophes occur and complex therapeutic options need to be offered to a large number of victims. MethodsFollowing the 1988 Spitak earthquake in Armenia, the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) established the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force (RDRTF) in order to anticipate organizational problems related to renal care in the aftermath of large natural and human-made catastrophes. The proposed concept was one of a dialysis advance team, which would assess the needs and possibilities of dialysis treatment, to be followed by supportive manpower and supplies. This article describes the organizational aspects of a rescue action that was undertaken following the Marmara earthquake, which occurred on August 17 th, 1999, in northwestern Turkey. In conjunction with Médecins Sans Frontières, a team landed at Istanbul Airport less than 22 hours after the disaster, and logistic and material support as well as manpower were provided over a period of approximately one month. Specific attention was paid to the choice of the renal replacement therapy, the transport of victims and materials, the implementation of preventive rehydration, and the problem of chronic renal failure patients dialyzed in the damaged area. ConclusionsWe demonstrate how previously anticipated international support may offer moral, financial, as well as logistical help to local nephrological communities confronted with serious disasters...|$|R
40|$|After {{baseline}} studies, 21 {{patients with}} osteoporosis {{were treated with}} human parathyroid hormone fragment (PTH 1 - 34) given as once-daily subcutaneous injections for 6 - 24 months.

Calcium and phosphate balances improved in some patients, but there was no significant improvement in the group values. There were, however, substantial increases in iliac trabecular bone volume: the mean increase, confirmed by repeat blind measurements, was 70 % above mean baseline volume. The new bone was histologically normal. Those patients who had the largest increases in 47 Ca-kinetic and histomorphometric indices of new bone formation showed the greatest increases in trabecular bone volume, suggesting that treatment with human parathyroid hormone fragment caused a dissociation between formation and resorption rates that was confined to trabecular bone.

40|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBOT) {{is the use}} of 100 % oxygen at {{pressures}} greater than atmospheric pressure. Today several approved applications and indications exist for HBOT.

40|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that the initial treatment of freezing cold injury (FCI) should be rapid rewarming to prevent direct injury from intracellular ice formation and protein denaturation, there is less conformity in the clinical intervention after rewarming.

With the exception of freezing cold injury, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is now accepted as an adjunct therapy {{for the management of}} all other acute traumatic peripheral ischaemias, such as <b>crush</b> injuries, compartment <b>syndrome,</b> thermal burns, compromised skin grafts and flaps, and threatened replantations.

40|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} (CS) is {{a common}} complication of crush injury but it is rare to find bilateral gluteal compartment syndrome (BGCS). Only six cases of BGCS {{have been reported in}} the literature. This syndrome has been reported after crush injury, drug overdose, surgical positioning, and vascular surgery. Apart from CS, crush injury is associated with multi-system adverse effects and these patients are at high risk for renal failure and sepsis. CS patients may present with dehydration; coagulation disorders; elevated creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin levels; hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia, which may cause life-threatening arrhythmias and therefore need urgent and aggressive therapy. The early goal in these patients is prevention of acute renal failure with aggressive fluid therapy, alkalinization of urine, and forced diuresis. Early treatment of hyperkalemia, antibiotic therapy, immunoprophylaxis, and wound care will minimize the risk of arrhythmias and sepsis. CS must be considered when any patient is diagnosed with <b>crush</b> injury <b>syndrome.</b> CS is defined as elevation of interstitial/ intracompartmental pressure, leading to microvascular and myoneural dysfunction and secondary hypoxia; it may cause functional loss or even death if not detected early and treated properly. The increase in pressure in one or all compartments of the gluteal region causes CS with devastating effects on muscle and neurovascular bundles. CS is traditionally diagnosed on the basis of five ‘p's: pain, pallor, paraesthesia, pulselessness and paralysis. Diagnosis of gluteal CS is difficult as the peripheral pulses are preserved and the condition is usually only diagnosed when neurological abnormality is noticed. Diagnosis of CS can be made by direct measurement of the compartment pressure and magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography. Gluteal CS is managed by fasciotomy and debridement of necrosed tissue, with secondary closure of fascia. A high index of suspicion is necessary for the early diagnosis of gluteal CS, and this will reduce the disability and complications as a consequence of this syndrome. The acute-care physician, the intensivist, and the trauma surgeon must be aware of this rare syndrome, as it can result in multiorgan dysfunction and death. Here we report a case of bilateral gluteal CS that was successfully treated in our trauma intensive care unit...|$|R

40|$|Sodium Fluoride (NaF) is {{the only}} {{medication}} so far clinically available with a bone formation stimulating property, through its peculiar mitogenic dose-dependent action on the osteoblast cell line. Bone strength is commensurate to bone mass, and in a condition with fragility fractures, like osteoporosis, it seems logical to restore bone mass without weakening bone strength. However, as with any active drug. NaF therapy requires adhesion to elementary rules if drawbacks are to be prevented. A first mandatory rule is not to prescribe NaF without calcium supplementation, if bone loss at the appendicular skeleton is to be avoided; to prevent this, the availability of monofluorophosphate (MFP), containing the fluoride and calcium salts in the same preparation has enhanced the compliance to calcium supplementation. A second rule is not to give supraphysiological doses of vitamin D, for the same reason. Third, if one wants to avoid a calcium shift from cortical to trabecular bone and osteomalacia, one should use small doses of NaF, {{of the order of}} 50 mg/day. With this in mind, the bioavailability of the drug has to be taken into account, particularly its gastrointestinal absorption which is dramatically enhanced if a plain non entericoated (EC) capsule is used, as compared to that of an EC tablet with the same face value. Too much NaF is deleterious to bone, a fact known for years. Already in 1972, it was noted that in all patients receiving 60 mg or more of NEC NaF, daily, morphologically abnormal bone developed and which appeared irregular and contained areas of incompletely mineralized bone. The bone was histologically and microradiographically normal in patients receiving 45 mg or less of NEC NaF/day. Fourth, NaF therapy is contraindicated in renal insufficiency owing to an enhanced retention in the skeleton. NaF is, however, by no means the ideal medication, because its therapeutic window is narrow. It has many bothersome drawbacks, and notably it is irritating for the gastric mucosa, a hazard which may be partly circumvented by the use of an Ec or slow release tablet. Furthermore, peripheral stress fractures may occur, and, in our experience, they were seen in 17 % of patients, almost exclusively in females with a low lumbar BMD. Their occurrence should be curtailed by not allowing an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity of more than 50 %. This is a relatively benign complication, because no stress fracture degenerated into a complete fracture. In all cases, the stress fractures healed after a transitory drug discontinuation. If there is some concern about cortical bone, NaF therapy may be associated with an antiresorber like estrogens which will prevent any further bone loss, and does not impair the response to NaF. NaF therapy should be reserved for patients suffering chiefly from trabecular osteoporosis and should be avoided in senile osteoporosis, because of a frequently impaired renal function. Currently, we would recommend in clinical practice a daily dose of 50 mg EC-NaF or 150 mg Ca-MFP as the therapy of involutional osteoporosis in women, reserving the dose of 75 mg EC-NAF or 200 mg MFP for males or female patients resistant to lower dose. The therapy should be maintained for 2 to 3 years, or more, according to the bone response, taking into account that patients with the vertebral <b>crush</b> fracture <b>syndrome</b> have lost on average 30 %, as compard to the young adult mean...|$|R
