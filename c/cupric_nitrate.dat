5000|$|A {{wide range}} of chemicals, both {{household}} and commercial, can give a variety of patinas. They are often used by artists as surface embellishments either for color, texture, or both. Patination composition varies with the reacted elements and these will determine {{the color of the}} patina. For copper alloys, such as bronze, exposure to chlorides leads to green, while sulfur compounds (such as [...] "liver of sulfur") tend to brown. The basic palette for patinas on copper alloys includes chemicals like ammonium sulfide (blue-black), liver of sulfur (brown-black), <b>cupric</b> <b>nitrate</b> (blue-green) and ferric nitrate (yellow-brown). For artworks, patination is often deliberately accelerated by applying chemicals with heat. Colors range from matte sandstone yellow to deep blues, greens, whites, reds and various blacks. Some patina colors are achieved by the mixing of colors from the reaction with the metal surface with pigments added to the chemicals. Sometimes the surface is enhanced by waxing, oiling, or other types of lacquers or clear-coats. More simply, the French sculptor Auguste Rodin used to instruct assistants at his studio to urinate over bronzes stored in the outside yard. A patina can be produced on copper by the application of vinegar (acetic acid). This patina is water-soluble and will not last on the outside of a building like a [...] "true" [...] patina.

40|$|In chemistry, a complex, {{also called}} a "coordination compound" or "metal complex", is a {{structure}} {{consisting of a}} central atom or molecule connected to surrounding atoms or molecules. Originally, a complex implied a reversible association of molecules, atoms, or ions through weak chemical bonds. As applied to coordination chemistry, this meaning has evolved. Some metal complexes are formed virtually irreversibly and many are bound together by bonds that are quite strong. Copper is a transition metal, which in the zero oxidation state has an electron configuration of [Ar] 4 s 24 p 63 d 9. Copper is found in three different oxidation states: Cu(I), Cu(II), and Cu(III). Copper (I) atoms have 10 d electrons. Cu(I) complexes being d 10 have no Jahn-Teller distortion. Cu (I) complexes are diamagnetic and typically colorless. If a Cu(I) complex is colored, the color {{is a result of}} a charge transfer band or an internal transition in a ligand. In the copper(II) oxidation state, the metal has 9 d electrons. Jahn- Teller distortion causes a splitting of eg and t 2 g orbitals. Most Cu(II) complexes are square planar for this reason. Usually observed in the electronic spectra of Cu(II) complexes is a single broad, poorly resolved band envelope. This envelope is typical of Cu(II) complexes in tetragonal complexes. These complexes are generally blue or green because of an absorption band in the 600 - 900 nm region of the spectrum. Reproducing complex biological reactivity within a simple synthetic molecule is a challenging endeavor with both intellectual and aesthetic goals. The sequence of examining biological reactivity, creating similar chemical architectures, and determining functional reaction conditions for model systems is a process that allows the biological code of reactivity to be deciphered. In the past years the report on the crystal structures of type 3 copper enzymes (e. g. catechol oxidase, hemocyanins, and tyrosinase), as too type 2 – type 3 copper enzymes (e. g. ascorbate oxidase, laccase, ceruloplasmin) has taken a new turn. The greater availability of such structural information now allows a shift in the role of synthetic modeling from structural and spectroscopic endeavors to development of functional and catalytic models. Functional models can provide an opportunity to examine a biological reactivity at a small-molecule level of detail through systematic and comparative studies. Although one goal of modeling is reproduction of reactivity, extension of this reactivity beyond the scope of the inspiring system is perhaps an even more important objective. Adequate synthetic models that have similar structural, spectroscopic and functional properties of active sites of copper proteins are done. These models provide many elegant examples of selective and environmentally benign oxidants capable of performing interesting organic transformations and many of these are copper complexes that use dioxygen as the ultimate oxidant above all in the catecholase activity. The coordination chemistry of copper(II) attracts much attention because of its biological relevance and its own interesting coordination chemistry such as geometry, flexible redox property, and oxidation state. 1 - 3 Nowadays, coordination compounds have been known to be useful in constructing molecular information processing systems, particularly by biological self-organizing processes. 4, 5 Especially for this purpose, synthesis, and structural and chemical characterization of copper complexes has been attempted to mimic metalloenzyme. 6 - 8 Recently, we tried to prepared new materials for electric devices. In a series of those compounds, we have prepared copper (II) complexes containing two nitrato ligands and a 2, 2 '-dipyridylamine(dpa) derivative ligand. The 2, 2 '- dipyridylamine and its derivatives have been widely used for metal complexes because of their good chelating property, structural flexibility, and feasible reduction property compared with other N,N'-chelating ligand including bipyridine and phenanthroline. Copper(II) complexes ligated by two nitrato ligands and a N. N'-chelating ligand (L), CuL(NO 3) 2, are common and some XRD structures have been reported. In those complexes, the coordination numbers varied from 4 to 6 according to nitrato ligating properties. The aqueous solution coordination chemistry of the transition metal copper is limited to its three accessible oxidation states (I-III) [8 - 12]. The lowest oxidation state, Cu(I) has a diamagnetic d 10 configuration and forms complexes without any crystal-field stabilization energy. Complexes of this type are readily prepared using relatively soft polarizable ligands like thioethers, phosphines, nitriles, isonitriles, iodide, cyanide and thiolates. A broad range of coordination geometries is observed. Cu(I) complexes are biologically relevant because they are able to reductively activate molecular oxygen (O 2). However, due to the lability of most Cu(I) complexes, they typically lack sufficient kinetic stability for radiopharmaceutical applications. Copper (II) exists as a d 9 metal center of borderline softness which favors amines, imines, and bidentate ligands like bipyridine to form square planar, distorted square planar, trigonal pyramidal, square pyramidal, as well as distorted octahedral geometries. Jahn-Teller distortions in six-coordinate Cu(II) complexes are often observed as an axial elongation or a tetragonal compression. Due to the presence of some crystal-field stabilization energy, Cu(II) is generally less labile toward ligand exchange and is the best candidate for incorporation into radiopharmaceuticals. A third oxidation state Cu(III) is relatively rare and difficult to attain without the use of strong π-donating ligands. These complexes usually adopt a square planar geometry due to the d 8 Cu(III) electron configuration. Reactions of <b>cupric</b> chloride, <b>nitrate</b> and perchlorate group with dibenzoylmethane and neutral uni and bidentate nitrogen donor ligands in ethanolic medium give series of complexes. The complexes have been characterized on the basis of elemental analysis, molar conductance, magnetic moment, infrared and electronic spectral data. Copper (II) forms bis-β- diketonate when a cupric salt is treated with a β- diketone in 1 : 2 molar ratio followed by addition of ammonia. However, if the metal ion and β- diketone are taken in 1 : 1 ratio instead of 1 : 2 and then treated with nitrogen donor ligands, mixed ligand complexes are formed. It was therefore thought worthwhile to study the reaction of cupric salts with dibenzoyl methane and some nitrogen donor ligands with a view to preparing mixed ligand complexes. ...|$|R

It is used in various technological applications such as high critical temperature superconductors, gas sensors, in photoconductive applications, and so on. Recently, it has been used as an antimicrobial agent against various bacterial species. Here we synthesized different sized CuO nanoparticles and explored the size-dependent antibacterial activity of each CuO nanoparticles preparation. Methods: CuO nanoparticles were synthesized using a gel combustion method. In this approach, <b>cupric</b> <b>nitrate</b> trihydrate and citric acid were dissolved in distilled water with a molar ratio of 1 : 1. The resulting solution was stirred at 100 &deg;C, until gel was formed. The gel was allowed to burn at 200 &deg;C to obtain amorphous powder, which was further annealed at different temperatures to obtain different size CuO nanoparticles. We then tested the antibacterial properties using well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration methods. Results: XRD spectra confirmed the formation of single phase CuO nanoparticles. Crystallite size was found to increase with an increase in annealing temperature due to atomic diffusion. A minimum crystallite size of 20 nm was observed in the case of CuO nanoparticles annealed at 400 &deg;C. Transmission electron microscopy results corroborate well with XRD results. All CuO nanoparticles exhibited inhibitory effects against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The size of the particles was correlated with its antibacterial activity.

40|$|The {{ability to}} seek out the source of a {{chemical}} signal is vital for many life forms, from single-celled organisms, such as white blood cells (which are able seek out pathogens due to the chemical messages they release), to complex communities, such as beehives (which requires individual units of bees to respond to a chemical signal in order to perform specific tasks). Inspired by these natural examples, herein we have developed signal (A) and seeker (B) droplets that are capable of finding each other in an open intricate fluidic network. The signal droplet (A) releases a chemical signal, which creates a chemical gradient inside the channel; in response to this signal, the seeker droplet (B) is able to chemotactically find the signal droplet (A) and merge with it at the location of droplet A. The droplets in this work are composed of ionic liquids (ILs). The signal droplet is constituted of trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium dicyanamide [P 6, 6, 6, 14][DCA] containing 1 M <b>cupric</b> <b>nitrate</b> (Cu(NO 3) 2). The seeker droplet is composed of trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride [P 6, 6, 6, 14][Cl] and a small amount of red dye (1 -(methylamino) anthraquinone), which is purely added for visualisation. The unidirectional movement of the seeker droplet is due to the triggered release of the [P 6, 6, 6, 14]+, a very efficient cationic surfactant, which is a constituent of the IL droplet. In the presence of an ionic strength gradient in the aqueous phase, an asymmetrical surface tension gradient is created, leading to Marangoni like flows, which drive the droplet from areas of low surface tension towards areas of high surface tension [1]. When the signal droplet (A) is placed onto a solution of 10 - 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Cu(NO 3) 2 diffuses from the droplet into the aqueous phase and creates an ionic strength gradient throughout the fluid network. Due to the poor solubility of the DCA anion, no [P 6, 6, 6, 14]+ is released from the signal droplet (A) and thus it remains stationary. Therefore when both the signal droplet (A) and seeker droplet (B) are placed onto a solution of 10 - 2 M NaOH, the seeker droplet will autonomously seek out the signal droplet. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the optimization {{process of the}} close space sublimation (CSS) technique to deposit zinc telluride (ZnTe) on thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells. Previous {{research has demonstrated that}} creating a heavily doped ZnTe intermediate layer between the absorber-CdTe and the back contacts produces low-resistive CdTe contacts that overcome the Schottky barrier created at the interface of a metal and a semiconductor [11]. ZnTe interlayer forms a tunnel barrier at the contact interface so the positive charges created at the p-CdTe/n-cadmium sulfide (CdS) junction can be easily collected at the back contact maximizing the current collection process. However, ZnTe contacting interlayer has to be deposited using expensive equipment and complex process, limiting its implementation in mass-production CdTe solar cells. In this thesis, it has been demonstrated that ZnTe can be deposited using the CSS technique, which is the most common method to deposit CdTe in both research and industry. In order to demonstrate the presence of ZnTe on top of CdTe photovoltaics, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and x-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization techniques were used to study the morphology and composition of the deposited film. ^ A requirement for this interlayer is {{that it has to be}} heavily doped. Therefore, the research presented in this thesis also includes the optimization of two copper (Cu) doping techniques to introduce impurities to the ZnTe layer in subsequent process and create the tunnel barrier at the contact interface. Previous research on ZnTe deposition used a ZnTe source already doped with Cu, limiting the optimization of the deposition parameters since Cu diffusion has to be controlled by these parameters [13, 14]. Cu is the best material to dope the ZnTe intermediate layer because of its conductive properties and because it replaces Zn atoms in the compound without altering the structure [13]. The first Cu doping technique involves an immersion process in a <b>cupric</b> <b>nitrate</b> solution, proposed by a previous doping study that used ZnTe deposited on glass samples [18]. However, the proposed technique had to be optimized to Cu dope ZnTe films deposited on complete and functional CdTe solar cells. The alternative technique uses copper telluride additives on conductive graphite paste to produce low-resistive back contacts and introduce Cu atoms into the bulk of the ZnTe layer to create the tunnel barrier by annealing the solar cell. This technique has been used in previous research to lower the back contact resistance [19]; however, it has not been used as a doping technique for ZnTe interlayer. Therefore, this technique had to be optimized to find the best copper telluride concentrations and the best annealing conditions to dope the ZnTe interlayer with copper. The resulting technique provided low-resistive and efficient back contacts that enhance the overall performance of the CdTe solar cells. ...|$|E
40|$|Nanoparticles {{represent}} a novel {{class of material}} consisting of hundreds to a few thousand atoms each, and their {{physical and chemical properties}} are significantly different than the bulk materials. The electronic structure, chemical and optical properties of nanoparticles can be tuned by the size, shape, surface modification and interaction with supporting materials, to fulfil the potential specific applications in catalysis, imaging and electronic devices. In the preparation of nanoparticles, protecting ligands {{play a crucial role in}} the dispersion, size control, and shape control of particles. Here in this thesis, ligand functionalization of metal nanoparticles and engineering of carbon nanomaterials were manipulated, and the influence of metal-organic interaction on the chemical, optical and electrochemical properties of nanoparticles and their applications in fuel cell electrocatalysis were studied. Ruthenium nanoparticles protected by ferrocenecarboxylates (RuFCA) were synthesized. The carboxylate group were bound onto the nanoparticle surface via Ru–O bonds in a bidentate configuration which is highly polarized, leading to the diminishment of the electron density of the iron centers and the increase of formal potential of the ferrocenyl moieties by 120 mV in electrochemical measurements. In addition, galvanic exchange reactions of the RuFCA nanoparticles with Pd(II) followed by hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C led to (partial) decarboxylation of the ligands such that the ferrocenyl moieties were now directly bonded to the metal surface, as manifested in voltammetric measurements that suggested intervalence charge transfer between the nanoparticle-bound ferrocene groups. In a further study, decarboxylation was also found happened at the metal-ligand interface in the hydrothermal treatment of 2 -naphthalenecarboxylate protected ruthenium nanoparticles at higher temperature 250 °C, and the naphthalenyl moieties became directly bonded to the metal cores, which was confirmed by infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements. In comparison with the as-produced RuCOONA nanoparticles, the decarboxylated nanoparticles (RuNA) exhibited markedly different optical and electronic properties due to electronic coupling between the particle-bound naphthalene groups. The intraparticle charge delocalization led to spilling of nanoparticle core electrons to naphthalene moieties, resulting in the negative shift of the formal potential. In addition, the electron-transfer properties of the ruthenium nanoparticles protected by 1 -dodecyne, laurate and 1 -dodecanethiol were examined by scanning tunneling spectroscopic (STS) measurements. Ruthenium-vinylidene (Ru=C=CH–), –oxygen (Ru-O), and –thiolate (Ru-S) interfacial bonds were formed when protected by alkyne, carboxylate and thiol ligands, respectively, and the polarization of the interfacial bonds was found to increase in the order of Ru=C=CH– < Ru-S < Ru-O. The relatively large nanoparticles (dia. ∼ 3 nm) were found to show clearly-defined Coulomb staircase; and with diminishing particle core dimensions to below 1 nm, Coulomb blockade started to emerge. The nanoparticle molecular capacitance and effective nanoparticle dielectric constants were estimated and the dielectric constants increased inversely with the nanoparticle core dimensions; and at any given particle size, the dielectric constants varied with the specific metal-ligand interfacial bonds, increasing in the order of Ru-S < Ru=C=CH– < Ru-O. Part of the dissertation research was devoted to carbon nanomaterials. In one of the study, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method and incorporated with ruthenium metal ions by exploiting the unique complexation of selected nitrogen dopants with ruthenium ions. Complexation of NGQDs with ruthenium ions likely occurred through the pyridinic nitrogen dopants, leading to the incorporation of multiple metal centers within the conjugated graphitic C sp 2 scaffolds (Ru-NGQDs). Intervalence charge transfer between embedded Ru ions was studied electrochemically, the Ru-NGQD compounds exhibited two pairs of voltammetric waves, with a peak spacing of 150 mV, suggesting Class II delocalized system. Near-infrared spectroscopic measurements demonstrated an absorption band emerged at ca. 1450 nm at mixed-valence metal charge transfer, by using Ce(SO 4) 2 as the oxidizing reagent. Covalently crosslinking of GQDs were accomplished by forming ensembles of a few hundred nanometers in size by McMurry deoxygenation coupling reactions of peripheral carbonyl functional moieties catalyzed by TiCl 4 and Zn powders in refluxing THF. Photoluminescence measurements showed that after chemical coupling, the excitation and emission peaks blue-shifted somewhat and the emission intensity increased markedly, likely due to the removal of oxygenated species where quinone-like species were known to be effective electron-acceptors and emission quenchers. Metal nanoparticles were also prepared and tuned for the applications as high-performance catalysts. In one of the research, gold core@silver semishell Janus nanoparticles were prepared by interfacial chemical etching of Au@Ag core–shell nanoparticles at the air/water interface. The resulting Janus nanoparticles exhibited an asymmetrical distribution of silver on the surface of the gold cores. Interestingly, the Au@Ag semishell Janus nanoparticles exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity in oxygen reduction reactions, as compared to their Au@Ag and Ag@Au core–shell counterparts, likely due to a synergistic effect between the gold cores and silver semishells that optimized oxygen binding to the nanoparticle surface. In another research, cysteine-stabilized Ag–Cu hollow nanoshells are prepared by the co-reduction of silver nitrate and <b>cupric</b> <b>nitrate</b> with sodium borohydride in the presence of sodium thiocyanate. When capped with 1 -dodecanethiol, the hollow nanoshells become dispersible in apolar organic solvents and the cavity may be exploited for the effective phase-transfer of target molecules such as rhodamine 6 G between water and organic media. The Ag–Cu nanoshells also show apparent catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4 -nitroaniline by sodium borohydride, a performance that is markedly better than that of the solid counterparts and comparable to leading results in recent literature based on relevant metal catalysts...|$|E
