40|$|As a {{consequence}} of heightened concern for the greenhouse effect, depleting oil reserves and skyrocketing oil prices, renewable fuels, Such as bioethanol, are becoming increasingly important. Cellulosic biomass like wood, agricultural residue and herbaceous material is a huge, cheap natural resource {{that can be used}} for ethanol production. Decreasing production costs through technological development is, however, still needed to make ethanol from cellulosics economically feasible. In this study, the effect on overall ethanol yield of an enzymatic prehydrolysis prior to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of steam pretreated corn stover was investigated. Two enzyme mixtures were utilised. A mixture of commercially available enzymes (Novozymes A/S, Baegersvaerd, Denmark) was compared with a developmental thermo-active cellulase complex produced by Roal Oy (Rajam&i, Finland). The thermoactive preparation comprised three essential cellulases and one xylanase enzyme. The prehydrolysis was, under the conditions evaluated, found to have no or negative effect on the overall ethanol yield. Longer prehydrolysis time resulted in a larger decrease in overall ethanol yield than shorter prehydrolysis. Using the experimental thermo-active enzyme mixture was shown to give a higher glucose concentration after prehydrolysis than when the commercial enzyme mixture was used in similar experiments. The highest ethanol concentration, 33. 8 g/L, was reached in the SSF with 11. 5 % water-insoluble substances using the developmental thermoactive cellulase complex, and 1. 8 g/L <b>compressed</b> baker's <b>yeast.</b> This concentration corresponded to 80. 2 % overall ethanol yield based on the glucose content in the raw material. However, if the xylose present in the beer at the end of the SSF could be fermented to ethanol, another 12. 6 g ethanol/L could theoretically be produced (0. 51 g ethanol/g xylose).

Introduction: Yeast {{is one of}} {{the most}} interesting substances used in the household, and one that is usually but little understood. The knowledge resulting from even a superficial study will more than repay the effort by a gain in uniformity of results following its use. The yeast plant {{is one of the}} simplest forms of vegetable life, consisting of a single cell microscopic in size. It belongs to the class of fungi and feeds only upon organic material. Under certain conditions unfavorable to the best development of the plant it Col= spores which are fitted to withstand drying and live for some time in a quiescent state. These spores are widely distributed, being found in the surface of the Ground, and for two or three inches beneath the surface as well as on nearly all fruits and vegetables. Many varieties of yeast have been studied and described but only two or three are cultivated. The yeast plant has been most carefully studied with respect to its power in producing alcohol, in breweries and distilleries. And much of the <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> on the market is a by-product of such plants. There are, however, large establishments which make <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> their principal product. In the process of manufacturing <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> the grain is carefully selected and washed. After crushing a part of it is flowed to sprout, forming malt.

In order to detect low-level contamination in samples, this study made use of a preliminary incubation technique (24 h at 37 °C), which boosted bacterial counts for the identification of sources of contamination. Numbers of bacteria were quantified by standard pour- and spread-plate techniques and various selective media. Raw materials were negligible in contributing to the bacterial contamination of commercial yeast, {{with the exception of}} soda ash, used to control the pH of fermentations, which contained 2 log CFU/ ml Enterococcus and aerobic bacteria. It was found that the scale up of seed yeast biomass was the primary site for contamination with Enterococcus, which progressively increased in number as the product passed down the production line. Coliforms were present at low levels, with significant increases (P 10 °C), whilst vacuum-packaged dry yeast remained bacteriologically stable.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} the Activity of Baker's Compressed and Active Dry Yeast. Parameters {{important in the}} production of Baker's Yeast were correlated with the product's final activity. Activity was a measure of the gas evolved in a fermenting dough, expressed as mMCO 2 /hr/g yeast solids. The drying of <b>Compressed</b> <b>Yeast</b> to Active Dry Yeast was optimised in terms of the drying air. A tunnel tray drier was used to dry yeast to a 9 % moisture content (dry weight). At 40 °C. the optimum drying humidity was found to be 30 - 32 % relative humidity. The leavening ability of yeast dried at 17 % and 45 % relative humidity decreased. A drying additive, 2 % glyceryl monostearate, halved the drying time to 4 hours. Equations were developed to describe these observations as a function of relative humidity, drying time and additive concentration. The equilibrium relative humidity of stored dried yeast was found to be 32 % at 20 °C. Fermentation parameters were correlated with the activity of <b>Compressed</b> <b>Yeast</b> using an experimental design. Growth temperatures varied from 28 °C. to 37 °C., initial pH from 4 to 6, glucose concentrations from 0. 5 % to 3 %, nitrogen concentrations from 0. 3 % to 1. 2 % and dissolved oxygen varied as either agitated or standing cultures. Factors significantly affecting cell yield and yeast activity were growth temperature, dissolved oxygen and glucose concentrations. Maximal yeast activity occurred at 0. 5 % glucose concentration, 28 °C. and non-agitated conditions. A model was developed to describe yeast activity as a function of these variables. The observed optimal conditions for cell yield were similar to those for yeast activity except for the dissolved oxygen level.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Roles of {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} in flour pre-ferment and white bread were investigated. Volatile compounds produced by the organisms were identified using gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from domestic commercial <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> and active dry yeast. Numbers per gram of sample were 10 ⁸ to 10 ⁹ in <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> and 10 ⁴ in active dry yeast. These {{lactic acid bacteria}} were identified by physiological and fermentation characteristics. Commercial yeast preparations were found to contain both homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Breads with or without lactic acid bacteria were prepared and analyzed by GLC for volatile compounds present. Lactic acid bacteria in <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> were found to contribute {{at least to the}} production of acetic acid. Dough like-preparations for conversion to pre-ferments were inoculated with combinations of yeast and different types of lactic acid bacteria to investigate the behaviors of these organisms. The pre-ferments were considered useful flavor enhancers for bakery products. From results of GLC analyses, it was found that by adding certain lactic acid bacteria to the pre-ferment with yeast, the content of volatile compounds produced was changed dramatically. Pre-ferments inoculated with different lactic acid bacteria but without yeast also were examined for volatile compounds produced. Each strain produced characteristic metabolites in the pre-ferment. Lactococcus diacetylactis 18 - 16, which produced an elevated amount of diacetyl in the pre-ferment without yeast, did not produce a significant amount of the compound in pre-ferment with yeast. Cells of the bacterium added directly to sponge dough of bread increased the concentrations of acetoin and acetic acid present, but not diacetyl. Since the column packing material used in this study was found to be very suitable for the analysis of volatile compounds, direct injection of cultures on GLC column was carried out to determine the compounds produced by Leuconostoc strains. Most citrate-utilizing strains of Leuconostoc did not produce diacetyl or acetoin in modified MRS or acidified milk cultures, but did in citrate solutions.

Because the cell {{volume of the}} diploid strain was three times as large {{as that of the}} parental haploid strain, collection and subsequent dehydration to make <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> cakes were greatly improved with the diploid YL 3. The time required for dehydration of the diploid strain was shortened to 1 / 2. 5 that of the parent strain under conventional conditions. Moreover, for the diploid cells frequent filter changes for dehydration were not required, which was the case with parental cells. Fermentation activity and tolerance to freeze-thawing in dough were succesfully inherited by the diploid strains. The diploid YL 3 showed nearly the same activity as the diploid F 31 in bread making. However, the endurance period of yeast cakes when stored at 30 °C without softening to lead to liquefaction was much longer in YL 3 (199 h) than in F 31 (132 h). This superiority was ascribed to the fact that YL 3 was induced through direct diploidization and had no genetic defect on chromosomes because the wild-type strain was employed as the parent, whereas F 31 was obtained through protoplast fusion from two auxotrophic mutants and carried at least two mutagenized genes that were masked by heterolallelism...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{years have}} seen a huge growth in the market of {{industrial}} yeasts {{with the need for}} strains affording better performance or to be used in new applications. Stress tolerance of commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts is, without doubt, a trait that needs improving. Such trait is, however, complex, and therefore only in-depth knowledge of their biochemical, physiological and genetic principles can help us to define improvement strategies and to identify the key factors for strain selection. Results We have determined the transcriptional response of commercial baker's yeast cells to both high-sucrose and lean dough by using DNA macroarrays and liquid dough (LD) model system. Cells from <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> blocks display a reciprocal transcription program to that commonly reported for laboratory strains exposed to osmotic stress. This discrepancy likely reflects differences in strain background and/or experimental design. Quite remarkably, we also found that the transcriptional response of starved baker's yeast cells was qualitatively similar in {{the presence or absence of}} sucrose in the LD. Nevertheless, there was a set of differentially regulated genes, which might be relevant for cells to adapt to high osmolarity. Consistent with this, overexpression of CAF 16 or ORC 2, two transcriptional factor-encoding genes included in this group, had positive effects on leavening activity of baker's yeast. Moreover, these effects were more pronounced during freezing and frozen storage of high-sucrose LD. Conclusions Engineering of differentially regulated genes opens the possibility to improve the physiological behavior of baker's yeast cells under stress conditions like those encountered in downstream applications. </p...|$|E

Sourdough (SD) {{has been used in}} bread manufacture since ancient times because its beneficial effects on dough leavening. SD is a symbiotic culture of lactobacilli (LAB) and yeasts, giving a distinctively tangy or sour taste, due mainly to the lactic and acetic acid produced by the LAB. The presence in Sardinia of a big number and types of breads lead to consider the cycle of the bread as a phenomenon characterizing the Sardinian traditional culture. A commercial blend of semolina and re-milled semolina of Sardinia were used in this study. Commercial <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> (L) (1010 cells/g, dry matter) and sourdough (6 x 108 cells/g of Lactobacillus and 3 x 107 cells/g of yeasts) were used as a starter. Unfermented bread doughs were prepared by mixing ingredients in a 10 kg mixer at 60 turns/min up to optimum dough development. Fermented doughs were obtained after bulk fermentation (30 min), dividing (600 g doughs), rounding, resting (5 min) panning and proofing up to maximum volume increment. Fermented doughs were baked at 185 °C for 25 min to make pan breads. After 2 h of cooling, fresh breads were packaged in coextruded polypropylene bags and stored for 10 days at 20 ± 1 °C.

40|$|Author {{also know}} as SM LovedayFresh bakery {{products}} {{have a very}} short shelf life, which limits {{the extent to which}} manufacturing can be centralised. Frozen doughs are relatively stable and can be manufactured in large volumes, distributed and baked on-demand at the point of sale or consumption. With appropriate formulation and processing a shelf life of several months can be achieved. Shelf life is limited by a decline in proofing rate after thawing, which is attributed to a) the dough losing its ability to retain gas and b) insufficient gas production, i. e. yeast activity. The loss of shelf life is accelerated by delays between mixing and freezing, which allow yeast cells the chance to ferment carbohydrates. This work examined the reasons for insufficient gas production after thawing frozen dough and the effect of pre-freezing fermentation on shelf life. Literature data on yeast metabolite dynamics in fermenting dough were incomplete. In particular there were few data on the accumulation of ethanol, a major fermentation end product which can be injurious to yeast. Doughs were prepared in a domestic breadmaker using <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> from a local manufacturer and analysed for glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose and ethanol. Gas production after thawing declined within 48 hours of frozen storage. This was accelerated by 30 or 90 minutes of fermentation at 30;C prior to freezing. Sucrose was rapidly hydrolysed and yeast consumed glucose in preference to fructose. Maltose was not consumed while other sugars remained. Ethanol, accumulated from consumption of glucose and fructose, was produced in approximately equal amounts to CO 2, indicating that yeast cells metabolised reductively. Glucose uptake in fermenting dough followed simple hyperbolic kinetics and fructose uptake was competitively inhibited by glucose. Mathematical modelling indicated that diffusion of sugars and ethanol in dough occurred quickly enough to eliminate solute gradients brought about by yeast metabolism...|$|E

The problem of providing the population with functional products can be solved by enriching the recipes with vitamins, dietary fiber, micro and macronutrients. At the chair of "Technology of baking, confectionery, pasta and grain processing" of Voronezh State University of Engineering Technologies the recipe of no-salt bread from mixture of baker’s first grade wheat flour and whole-grain wheat with adding buckwheat bran flour, that increases the nutrition value of the product, has been developed. Flour from buckwheat bran {{is characterized by a}} high-scale balance of the content of essential amino acids, good digestibility, rich in vitamins (especially B vitamins, PP), dietary fiber, minerals (potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron). The use of buckwheat flour from the bran in bread production stimulates the creation of favorable intestinal microflora, normalizes blood sugar level, and excretes toxins, toxic salts and heavy metals from the body. We have conducted a research on how to make the rational choice of method of adding buckwheat bran flour enricher into dough from a mixture of first grade wheat flour and whole-grain wheat, <b>compressed</b> <b>yeast</b> and potable water, thus ensuring high and stable physical and chemical characteristics {{and the quality of the}} end product. Also, we have discovered that the bakery product prepared on tight sponge with addition of enricher has much better organoleptical properties in comparison with the others. Bread is characterized by a pleasant taste and flavour, elastic porous crumb. It has been found that the consumption of 100 g of a mixture of no-salt bread from first grade wheat flour and whole-grain with adding buckwheat bran flour will provide enough daily intake of protein 10. 7 %, fat 1. 5 %, carbohydrates 10. 4 % dietary fiber 16. 3 %, amino acids 2. 5 14. 0 %.
