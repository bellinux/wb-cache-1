5|$|Just {{as it is}} {{possible}} for a <b>circle</b> <b>to</b> be surrounded by six congruent circles that touch it, it is also possible to arrange seven congruent Reuleaux triangles so that they all make contact with a central Reuleaux triangle of the same size.

5|$|Viète {{used this}} {{approach}} to shrink one of the given circles to a point, thus reducing the problem to a simpler, already solved case. He first solved the CLL case (a circle and two lines) by shrinking the circle into a point, rendering it a LLP case. He then solved the CLP case (a circle, a line and a point) using three lemmas. Again shrinking one <b>circle</b> <b>to</b> a point, Viète transformed the CCL case into a CLP case. He then solved the CPP case (a circle and two points) and the CCP case (two circles and a point), the latter case by two lemmas. Finally, Viète solved the general CCC case (three circles) by shrinking one <b>circle</b> <b>to</b> a point, rendering it a CCP case.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the new era until 140 AD two local groups existed in northwest Poland. The Gustow group (named after Gustow on Rügen) people lived in the area settled in the past by the Oder group, and south of there, by the middle section of the Oder River was the Lubusz group, in the area previously inhabited by the Gubin group. Those were of an intermediate character, between the Elbe cultural <b>circle</b> <b>to</b> the west, and the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures to the east (the last one replaced the Oksywie culture after 30 AD).|$|E

5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into algebraic equations. These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a <b>circle</b> <b>to</b> simplify {{the configuration of the}} given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.|$|E
5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder {{moves the}} torch {{in a small}} <b>circle</b> <b>to</b> create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current. While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator then moves the torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as it is needed.|$|E

5|$|Royal {{government}} in England had traditionally centred on several great offices of state, filled by powerful, independent {{members of the}} baronage. Henry abandoned this policy, leaving the post of justiciar vacant and turning the position of chancellor into a more junior role. A small royal council was formed but its role was ill-defined; appointments, patronage, and policy were decided personally by Henry and his immediate advisers, rather than through the larger councils that had marked his early years. The changes made it much harder for those outside Henry's inner <b>circle</b> <b>to</b> influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances, particularly against the King's friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-speed}} freeway {{connection was}} completed {{with the opening}} of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932. The Pulaski Skyway ramp at its eastern terminus was eventually replaced with two long outside ramps that were dedicated for eastbound and westbound traffic from the cut in Bergen Hill just west of JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard. On September14, 1938, a direct ramp, known as the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, opened over Tonnele <b>Circle</b> <b>to</b> connect westbound traffic with southbound U.S.Route1/9 Truck, which quickly connects to Route7 that leads to Interstate280.|$|E

5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion <b>circle</b> <b>to</b> be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E
5|$|From 1 August 1872, the Middle Circle service {{also began}} {{operations}} through South Kensington, running from Moorgate along the MR's tracks {{on the north}} side of the Inner <b>Circle</b> <b>to</b> Paddington, then over the Hammersmith & City Railway (H) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, on the WLEJR to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H and the DR. On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was shortened to terminate at Earl's Court, and, on 31 December 1908, the Outer Circle service was withdrawn from the DR tracks. As part of efforts to improve competitiveness, the DR's tracks were electrified during 1905 and new electric rolling stock was brought into use. In 1907, the station was given its present name, Westminster.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the <b>circle</b> <b>to</b> Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to provide all the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E
