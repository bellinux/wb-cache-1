25|$|Each LSI <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> {{the faint}} {{outline of the}} nearest ship ahead, as the convoy furtively sailed forwards. Navigation marker-lights {{appeared}} marking the swept channel. The night was silent save the low throb of ships' engines, the churning of water, and the explosion of two swept mines (one at 03:00 and the other at 03:15).|$|E
2500|$|I {{had taken}} perhaps {{four or five}} steps when I felt that old mill {{building}} quiver. [...] I turned {{and ran for the}} door and stepped out on solid ground, and then turned around {{to see what was going}} to happen, but folks, it had already happened. [...] The mill wasn't there. [...] I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> pieces of planking and timbers going over the falls and rushing on down into the valley of Cane Creek below.|$|E
2500|$|Diệm {{went on to}} make sensational {{claims against}} the Buddhist {{majority}} that had his visitors taken aback. He asserted that his kindness towards Buddhists had helped to cause the civil unrest by encouraging them to seek what he felt were special rights. He claimed {{that the number of}} Buddhist pagodas in the country had doubled during his rule and said that it was due to his government's funding. For twenty minutes he repeatedly charged the Buddhists of partaking in orgies in the pagodas on a regular basis, without offering proof. He then alleged that [...] "some American services in Saigon" [...] were plotting against him. Taylor later noted that Diệm had not realised the seriousness of the meeting and the warnings of the American delegation, recalling that [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> it bouncing off him." ...|$|E
60|$|Nares <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the negro, who was {{probably}} attempting to recover his senses, for he said nothing.|$|R
60|$|Christian {{had come}} close to them. Her pale face and great shining eyes <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be <b>seen</b> through the gloom.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} held a strip so {{that she}} <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>see</b> 'Dolores M. Mohun,' and she unhesitatingly answered 'Yes'--very much surprised.|$|R
2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about political stuff so that's what inspired me." ...|$|E
60|$|It was Elizabeth's voice. He <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> her, {{framed in}} the doorway.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} they <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the schooner's boats in the dim light, about half-musket range astern.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should smile you didn't," [...] {{retorted}} Bo. [...] "Wish you <b>could</b> <b>just</b> have <b>seen</b> your eyes. Nell, do {{you want}} me to tell you something? ...|$|R
60|$|So he told her, and {{she told}} him of herself, and they talked and talked till the shadows of {{advancing}} night began to close around them. Suddenly Godfrey looked at his watch, of which he <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they don't}} send the boat at once, you'll {{have to spend}} the night with us, Jim," [...] said the mate, looking anxiously in the {{direction}} of the sloop belonging to Morley Jones, the dark outlines of which <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be <b>seen</b> looming of a deeper black against the black sky.|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} getting darker and darker. We <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the {{crouching}} figure of Miserrimus Dexter at the expiring fire--and that was all.|$|E
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the Ripton {{instructor}} signalling violently to his opponent, and, {{in reply}} to the signals, Peteiro came on again with another fierce rush.|$|E
6000|$|... "Read this, Bertie!" [...] I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> that he {{was waving}} a letter or {{something}} equally foul in my face. [...] "Wake up and read this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, we belong--for ever. It's very nice.' She {{squeezed}} his arm. The kindly darkness hid them both, and, emboldened because he <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>see</b> {{the profile of}} Maisie's cheek with the long lashes veiling the gray eyes, Dick {{at the front door}} delivered himself of the words he had been boggling over for the last two hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{here is the}} church," [...] said Henrietta, in a subdued voice, as {{they came}} to the low flint wall that fenced in the {{slightly}} rising ground occupied by the churchyard, surrounded by a whole grove of noble elm trees, amongst which <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be <b>seen</b> the small old church, with its large deep porch and curious low tower.|$|R
50|$|Murray {{received}} {{orders from}} Flinders 'to proceed to Port Jackson with the Lady Nelson {{as fast as}} circumstances would allow', and a letter to deliver to Governor King. Investigator headed north and Lady Nelson headed south. By 10.40 am, on 18 October, Investigators topsails <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be <b>seen</b> from Lady Nelson, disappearing over the horizon. This {{was the end of}} Lady Nelsons voyages of discovery.|$|R
6000|$|Mercy <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the letter-case as Grace {{held it up}} in the {{deepening}} obscurity of the room. [...] "Have you got money in it?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|There {{through the}} glass Anna indeed <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the boy's quaint creations huddling in the dark on a bare floor, a {{grotesque}} company of small monsters. She murmured: ...|$|E
60|$|We went {{close and}} peered into the old trees. We <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the dark bush of the {{mistletoe}} between the boughs of the tree. Lettie began to laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan hasn't {{done much}} {{fighting}} {{when you come}} to count up," [...] said Faith. [...] "I believe he's really a coward. He didn't think Walter would fight, or he wouldn't have called names before him. Oh, if you <b>could</b> <b>just</b> have <b>seen</b> Walter's face when he looked at him, Una! It made me shiver--with a nice shiver. He looked just like Sir Galahad in that poem father read us on Saturday." ...|$|R
60|$|Jeanne, of course, hardly counted--she was dazed into semi-imbecility by {{the renewed}} terrors {{she had just}} gone through: so for the moment Victor felt that Crystal was {{isolated}} from the others. She stood a little to one side--he <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>see</b> her, as the sergeant was holding up the lanthorn for Mme. la Duchesse to see {{her way into the}} coach. M. le Comte went on to give a few directions to the coachman.|$|R
60|$|The {{staircase}} was so dark, at first, that I <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>see</b> {{the forms}} of the children, as, hand-in-hand, they groped their way down after their guide: but it got lighter every moment, with a strange silvery brightness, that seemed {{to exist in the}} air, as there were no lamps visible; and, when at last we reached a level floor, the room, in which we found ourselves, was almost as light as day.|$|R
60|$|Alban's first {{impression}} {{was that she}} might have fainted. He looked closer, and <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> her shadowy figure still seated in the chair. He asked if she was ill. No.|$|E
6000|$|The light flickered, he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> {{her head}} appear, with hair all loose, {{and her face}} turning up to him. He could only half see, half imagine it, mysterious, blurry; and he whispered: ...|$|E
60|$|How she bore it I am {{not able}} to say. My foolish old eyes were filling with tears. I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> plainly enough to find {{my way to the}} door, and leave them together.|$|E
50|$|When {{comparing}} KrioRus and Alcor, journalists {{call the}} first company Lada {{of the world}} of cryonics, and the second one — Mercedes-Benz. Alcor cryonics is the largest cryonics company in the world, twice a week it conducts tours of its premises, demonstrating the operating room (where vitrification and freezing are conducted), as well as long-term cryopatients' storage facilities, where they <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be <b>seen</b> through bulletproof glass. On the other side, KrioRus does not offer any such services.|$|R
5000|$|The battery was {{reportedly}} well preserved in 2006 as {{it still had}} the main wall, expense magazines, parapet and embrasures <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>just</b> off a road to the Moorish Castle Estate.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{should have}} had to wait till they had caught you. But nobody {{conceived}} that to be possible. The President of a republic never runs away in his own person. There will be {{a cup of tea}} in the officers' mess-room at five o'clock. I will leave you till then, as you may wish to employ yourself." [...] I went up immediately afterwards on deck, and looking back over the tafferel, <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the glittering spires of Gladstonopolis in the distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Things are {{not right}} with Quinton," [...] said the doctor, quite white. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> {{him through the}} glass, and I don't like the way he's lying. It's not as I left him, anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Eudena and Ugh-lomi {{stepped back}} from the cliff until they <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the bears over the verge. Then Ugh-lomi stopped. Eudena pulled his arm, but he turned with a forbidding gesture, and her hand dropped. Ugh-lomi stood {{watching}} the bears, with his axe in his hand, until they had vanished into the cave. He growled softly, and shook the axe at the she-bear's receding quarters. Then to Eudena's terror, instead of creeping off with her, he lay flat down and crawled forward into such a position that he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the cave. It was bears--and he did it as calmly {{as if it had been}} rabbits he was watching! ...|$|E
60|$|The wedge, {{which had}} scattered, was reuniting. He <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> it dotted upon the sky, but he fancied that one dark object had come {{whirling}} down and struck the flats outshore of {{him a few}} seconds earlier.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{with a sigh}} I stood erect, and {{contemplated}} the lonely peace of that last wonderful night. The meteor had now trailed its shining nets across the whole space {{of the sky and}} was beginning to set; in the east the blue was coming to its own again; the sea was an intense edge of blackness, and now, escaped from that great shine, and faint and still tremulously valiant, one weak elusive star <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be <b>seen,</b> hovering on the verge of the invisible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear no! Ox-eyes aren't like wrens; I go to {{them every}} day. See!" [...] and he took up in his hand a {{creature}} that <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be <b>seen</b> to be intended for a bird, though the long skinny neck was bare, and the tiny quills of the young wings only showed a little grey sprouting feather, as did the breast some primrose-coloured down. Miss Fosbrook had to part with some favourite cockney notions of the beauty of infant birds, {{and on the other}} hand to gain a vivid idea of what is meant by [...] "callow young." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{drew her}} to him and she laid {{her head on his}} shoulder, murmuring, 'Ah! father, father, were you but here to see it. So desolate yesterday, so ineffably blest today. Oh! I cannot even grieve for him now, save that he <b>could</b> not <b>just</b> have <b>seen</b> us; yet I think he knew it would be so.' ...|$|R
