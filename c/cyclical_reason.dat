Experience with {{deregulation}} in the telecommunications and electricity sectors is encouraged. With strong economic growth and expansionary monetary conditions from an Austrian perspective, Executive Directors judged that <b>cyclical</b> <b>reasons</b> would support a front-loaded approach to fiscal consolidation. Strong external demand and continued economic liberalization should contribute to sustaining economic expansion at a rate of close to 3 percent per year in 2001 – 02. ...|$|R
5000|$|This kind of {{underemployment}} {{may exist}} for structural or <b>cyclical</b> <b>reasons.</b> In many economies, some firms become insulated from fierce competitive pressures and grow inefficient, {{because they are}} awarded a government monopoly (e.g., telephone or electrical utilities) or due to a situation of abuse of market power (e.g., holding a monopoly position in a certain industry). As such, if they may employ more workers than necessary, {{they might not be}} getting the market signals that would pressure them to reduce their labour force, and they may end up carrying the resultant excess costs and depressed profits.|$|R
40|$|In 2009 the German {{budget was}} {{clearly in the}} red, and in 2010 {{prospects}} are even worse. Deficits are such impressive that consolidation became a top subject in general publicity. To provide a sound basis for this discussion the IWH presents its second midterm projection of German economic development and public finances. While economy will improve slowly in the medium term and the output gap will be closed {{in the end of}} the projection period public finances will deteriorate until 2011. Thereafter the situation will improve but only due to <b>cyclical</b> <b>reasons.</b> In 2014 structural budget balance will have reached 2 ½% of nominal GDP. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the aggregate demand for {{private health insurance}} coverage in the U. S. using an error-correction model and by recognizing that people are without private health insurance for voluntary, structural, frictional, and <b>cyclical</b> <b>reasons</b> and because of public alternatives. Insurance coverage is measured both by {{the percentage of the}} population enrolled in private health insurance plans and the completeness of the insurance coverage. Annual data for the period 1966 - 1999 are used and both short and long run price and income elasticities of demand are estimated. The empirical findings indicate that both private insurance enrollment and completeness are relatively inelastic with respect to changes in price and income in the short and long run. Moreover, private health insurance enrollment is found to be inversely related to the poverty rate, particularly in the short-run. Finally, our results suggest that {{an increase in the number}} cyclically uninsure...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the existing statistical evidence on corporate loan growth {{for signs of}} a credit crunch in Austria. With regard to banks’ loan supply, the Austrian results of the bank lending survey show that since {{the onset of the}} crisis in summer 2007 lending has been affected by deteriorated refinancing conditions in the interbank market and has become more restrictive. Loan demand, which {{in the first half of}} 2008 was still fairly brisk based on expanding investment and a sound earnings situation in the corporate sector, is likely to sag in the near future as a decrease in the willingness to invest is to be expected. The credit standing of firms is expected to deteriorate for <b>cyclical</b> <b>reasons</b> in the near future, too, which would also contribute to a slowdown in lending. As it seems to be relatively likely that loan supply will decline more strongly than loan demand, the emergence of a credit crunch cannot be ruled out in Austria. bank lending, credit crunch, corporate finance...|$|R
40|$|Konjunkturprognosen werden sinnvollerweise auf der Grundlage saisonbereinigter Daten erstellt, damit jahreszeitlich Schwankungen ausgeschaltet werden. Kommt es aber zu extremen Witterungslagen, wenn etwa ein Winter besonders heftig oder aber auch besonders mild ausf 4 llt, dann spiegeln die saisonbereinigten Daten nicht mehr den Verlauf wider. Der Konjunkturanalytiker kann dann nicht erkennen, ob eine Ver 4 nderung konjunktur- oder witterungsbedingt war. Certainly, {{economic}} activity {{is influenced by}} weather conditions. In short term economic forecast, normal weather fluctuations over the year are covered by using seasonally adjusted figures. However, they are calculated by time series methods and do {{not take into account}} specific weather conditions such as unusually mild or cold winters. In particular {{in the first quarter of}} a year, it is often difficult to identify whether short term shifts in {{economic activity}} are due to <b>cyclical</b> <b>reasons</b> ore merely reflect specific weather conditions. The paper shows that this uncertainty leads to biased forecast. After mild winters forecasts of GDP and investment in construction tend to be over optimistic whereas they are too pessimistic after atypically cold winters...|$|R
40|$|In our analysis, {{we examine}} the effects of {{emigration}} from Hungary on the labour market and its other economic implications. Since 2008 the number of emigrants has been rising significantly faster than the previous trend, and thus it is important to assess the possible consequences of higher mobility in the Hungarian economy. We focus primarily on the effects on wages, for which it is indispensable to give an overview of the productivity effects as well. To that end, we need to gain a deeper insight into the characteristics of emigrants. As the information in the database available to us is limited to a single segment of those working abroad, namely cross-border commuters, this is the only group for which we can provide a detailed description. We find that the number of cross-border commuters is growing especially rapidly among skilled workers with secondary qualifications and among those employed in the sectors of construction, accommodation and food service activities. As regards age groups, younger generations account for a dominant portion of commuters. Based on the individual characteristics of commuters we assume that <b>cyclical</b> <b>reasons</b> may have contributed significantly to the rise in emigration. At this time, it is difficult to gauge the full impact of emigration on wages, productivity, growth and sustainability, as these factors depend partly on future growth rate of emigration and {{on the extent to which}} those working abroad return to the Hungarian labour market...|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} insecure work in NZ {{from four}} perspectives. It is {{a collaborative effort}} to increase {{our understanding of the}} insecure work landscape in NZ by utilising two waves of the Survey of Working Life (2008 and 2012). While we acknowledge that the perception of job insecurity and precarity in general could also apply to permanent workers, data availability means we restrict our forthcoming analysis to often equating insecure work to temporary employment. Over the last two decades, insecure work has gained increasing currency in the OECD countries. There are many reasons for this. This includes free choice whereby workers choose temporary work due to its preferable characteristics, such as flexibility, shorter hours, based on childcare arrangements, etc. Apart from free choice there are often three drivers identified in terms of rising levels of ‘non-standard’ work. First, globalisation has forced a greater worldwide division of labour, more volatile international market conditions, and employers forced to become more flexible in a bid to remain competitive. Second, demographic forces have resulted in rising female labour force participation rates and a growing motivation for new working arrangements that are compatible with childcare responsibility. Thirdly, <b>cyclical</b> <b>reasons</b> – policy makers often bid for greater labour market flexibility when unemployment is high. NZ is an interesting case study for more research on temporary employment. According to the ‘OECD indicators on employment protection legislation’, NZ has the third lowest level of protective regulation for temporary workers, with a score of 0. 92 compared to an OECD average of 2. 07 (with 0 equating to least restrictions and a score of 6 indicating most restrictions). Nevertheless, empirical research on the experiences of insecure workers and the links that can be established with their employment conditions remains negligible in NZ. Thus, a group of researchers from three universities in NZ was supported by Industrial Relations Fund (MBIE) to attempt to address this research gap. This report presents a range of perspectives and latest research on insecure work. A variety of angles are explored – from investigating the existence of an unexplained wage gap between temporary and permanent workers; to better understanding the contributing factors towards precarity (in a bid towards constructing an index of job precarity); to assessing the association between precarious employment and employer-provided training; and then finally to understanding {{the nature of the relationship}} between job insecurity and satisfaction at work. The data mainly came from the 2008 and 2012 Survey of Working Life, which represents a rich source of information on the employment conditions, working arrangements, and job quality of employed New Zealanders...|$|R
30|$|Based on this assumption, {{since the}} 1990 s many European governments have {{followed}} this tax reform path, cutting social security payroll taxes for <b>cyclical</b> and structural <b>reasons.</b> For instance, since 1997 Spain has cut social security payroll taxes for permanent contracts and for population groups affected by long-term unemployment. Recently, {{the new government}} has announced a reduction in employer social contributions (1 p.p. in 2013 and another point in 2014), compensated {{by an increase in}} value added taxation. Since 2000, France encouraged the transition to the 35 -hour week with lower employer social security contributions. In 2007 and 2008 Germany introduced cuts in unemployment insurance contributions, financed by a higher value added tax rate. Finally, {{in the midst of the}} recent international crisis, the US Congressional Budget Office (2008), for instance, considered the reduction in social contributions to be one of the most effective measures for responding to short-term economic weakness, albeit subject to lags and uncertainty.|$|R
30|$|What about {{activation}} {{strategies in}} disability insurance (DI) programs? Since an important aim {{of these strategies}} is to raise the overall level of labor supply, it may be argued that such policies should be scaled down in periods of insufficient labor demand. Why make costly efforts to provide job opportunities for workers with disabilities when even persons without health problems cannot find work? There is an important caveat to this argument however, namely that the moral hazard problems in disability insurance programs probably become more severe in <b>cyclical</b> downturns. The <b>reason</b> is that they then serve as an alternative channel for downsizing (Rege et al. 2009), particularly in welfare states with strong employment protection legislation. It may of course be argued that it doesn’t really matter whether redundant workers receive unemployment or disability benefits. However, {{in the long term}} it may matter quite a lot, since disability insurance programs – in contrast to unemployment insurance programs – tend to be absorbing. Due to the lack of incentives and the almost complete lack of eligibility reconsiderations, very few workers return to the labor market after having claimed time-unlimited disability benefits. Hence, the adverse long-term effects of a cyclical downturn is likely to be larger the more redundant workers were channeled into disability insurance rather than unemployment insurance during the crisis.|$|R
