We report that BPA at 100 nM induced cytotoxicity to HepG 2 cells as determined by MTT assay at 0 – 72 h. The toxicity was result of reduced oxygen consumption and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential associated with decreased ATP production. The BPA treatment resulted in increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) content with decreased glutathione and other antioxidant enzymes.

This may happen due to situations which could include wasting peoples time or not conforming to societal norms, such as in 'breaching' experiments. The visual offers a range of exciting possibilities for social research but it also brings an array of challenges and ethical difficulties. Visual Ethics can now {{be regarded as a}} specialist area within visual methodologies. Much mainstream engagement with the ethics of visual ethnography focuses on issues of anonymity of place and participants so that the focus is on who is taking the picture, who is in the picture; and what else can be known from the geography or materiality of the image. Thus, the moral maze of image ethics has been centrally concerned with the creator of images in relation to informed consent and the tension between revealing and concealing the contents of visual images; and who has ‘the right’ to claim ownership of images to in turn edit their content and show them to others (Mannay 2016).Once a visual image is created it becomes very difficult to control its use or remove it from the public arena if participants decide that they no longer want to be represented in a fixed visual trope <b>for</b> <b>time</b> <b>immemorial.</b> Even if images are successfully anonymised, acts to disguise images can be seen as tantamount to silencing the voice of research participants.

Rapid agricultural expansion in since 1970 {{has led to}} widespread cultivation of alluvial fan soils. This trend is projected to intensify as irrigated soils near the coast become increasingly salinized. Land use planners need {{to decide whether to}} encourage farming activities on either alluvial fans or in wadi areas. Two transects were selected across examples of both these areas, commencing beyond the area of cultivation inland and terminating at the coast. Soils along the transects were described and classified according to Soil Taxonomy. The objectives were to 1) assess the presence of a wadi on soil properties, 2) determine pattern of soil organic carbon and sand particle size distributions with depth, and 3) identify characteristics of soils in the interaction zone where fan and plain soils meet. Soils of the alluvial fans were Gypsids and Orthents, whereas in the wadi and the coastal plain Fluvents and Salids dominated. Distinguishing between Orthents and Fluvents on the basis of regular or irregular decreases in organic carbon with depth was not satisfactory, since organic carbon contents were very low and there was no consistent patterns of accumulation between soil types. Soils showed a high proportion of fine and very fine particles in the sand fraction, especially when capped by a desert pavement, suggesting that sand deposition was more related to dust entrapment than the action of flowing water.
