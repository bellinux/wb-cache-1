[...] Burlingame was not only made a member but one of its vice-presidents. She continued a member until the F. M. S. was merged into the General Conference Board. About the time, the Methodists refused Frances Willard a seat in their General Conference, Free Baptists decided to grant women representation in their highest legislative body.

Burlingame was one of these and from that time until 1904, when she resigned because of <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> she was a member of each General Conference.

30|$|The {{primary source}} of data on {{migration}} flows in Ukraine is administrative data on in-migration (inflows), out-migration (outflows) and net migration (inflows minus outflows) based on population registration of the place <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> (see the details in Section 4.1). This administrative data refers to those <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> that are registered with the State Migration Service and published by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. Therefore, these data refer mainly to residential mobility, but many moves of workers and their families might go unregistered. This means that administrative internal migration data is likely to underestimate actual migration, as corroborated by the survey of labor market experts conducted for this report. However, we complement this source of data with additional microeconomic sources based on household surveys to get a more complete picture of migration patterns.|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} few {{longitudinal}} studies {{on the effect of}} within-country mobility on patterns of mortality in deceased foreign-born individuals. The results have varied; some studies have found that individuals who move around within the same country have better health status than those who do not <b>change</b> their place <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> Other studies have shown that changing one’s place <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> leads to more self-reported health problems and diseases. Our aim was to analyze the pattern of mortality in deceased foreign-born persons living in Sweden during the years 1970 – 1999 in relation to distance mobility. Data from Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare was used, and the study population consisted of 281, 412 foreign-born persons aged 16 years and over who were registered as living in Sweden in 1970. Distance mobility did not {{have a negative effect on}} health.
