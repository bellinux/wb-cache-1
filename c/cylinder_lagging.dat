50|$|These {{locomotives}} were to {{form the}} basis for further development of the Pacific type, which was to become the standard express passenger steam locomotive type in South Africa. They were handsome locomotives and their appearance was enhanced by the use of planished steel plates to cover the boiler and <b>cylinder</b> <b>lagging.</b> They were equipped with two whistles of different tones and a steam turbine generator, mounted on the smokebox between the headlight and the chimney, to power the Edwards headlight.|$|E
5000|$|By {{moving the}} airflow {{measurement}} sensor from the intake plumbing {{to a point}} closer to the <b>cylinders,</b> the time <b>lag</b> from air moving past the sensor to reaching the cylinder can be reduced, thereby possibly improving throttle response.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} a {{horizontal}} (the cylinders are horizontal) cross-compound (high-pressure plus a low-pressure cylinder, side by side) stationary steam engine. It was once {{fitted with a}} tailrod extension on the low-pressure cylinder, and the tailrod crosshead casting has since been broken off. The high- and low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> were originally <b>lagged</b> with timber strips held on by brass bands, {{but most of the}} timber has rotted away. The high-pressure cylinder bore is about 15 inches (381 mm) in diameter while the low-pressure cylinder bore is about 24 inches (610 mm) in diameter. The stroke of both cylinders was 36 inches (914 mm), while the flywheel is 10 feet (3048 mm) in diameter, and 21 inches (533 mm) wide. The engine is mounted on a concrete base, with a concrete trough for the flywheel.|$|R
50|$|The company rapidly {{developed}} {{a range of}} traction engines, steam rollers, ploughing engines, agricultural implements and stationary engines. One of their forgotten achievements is the invention (see British Patent 763 of 1880) of the traction-centre engine, for driving steam-powered fairground roundabouts. This is often wrongly attributed to Savage of King's Lynn. In the 1890s, McLaren {{developed a}} range of vertical triple-expansion engines for the new industry of electricity generation. The zenith of this effort {{was a pair of}} 3000 ihp engines for Leeds Corporation’s Whitehall Road Power Station. After the start of the 20th century, the company introduced a tractor for direct haulage and a range of powerful direct-ploughing engines. The largest of these, rated 125 ihp, was fitted with superheater, feedwater heater and fully <b>lagged</b> <b>cylinders.</b> This provided a very efficient engine, which won many awards both at home and abroad. Other minor products were, showmen's engines, crane engines, portable engines, railway locomotives and Darby Steam-Diggers.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{particle}} response in a decelerating flow {{and a highly}} turbulent two-phase flow were obtained. Simultaneous measurements of {{the particle}} size and velocity served to quantify the particle response to the prevailing flow field. In {{the case of a}} flow incident upon a <b>cylinder,</b> the particle <b>lag</b> for a range of size classes was recorded. Results were also obtained in the flow generated by an atomizer operating on the leeward side of a flat disk bluff body in a coflowing air stream. Measurements of the mean axial, mean radial, and rms velocities and angles of trajectories were obtained for representative particle size classes. The air velocity and turbulence intensity were inferred from the seed particles on the order of one micrometer in diameter. Particles 9 micrometers and larger showed significant differences with respect to the gas phase mean velocity and turbulence intensity even at low velocities. In two-phase flows, reliable measurements of the continuous phase velocity and turbulence parameters requires the simultaneous measurement of particle size as a means for rejecting readings from large particles from the velocity pdf's...|$|R
40|$|Most lost-foam casting {{processes}} involve non-equilibrium solidification {{dominated by}} kinetic factors, while {{construction of a}} common dynamic solidification curve is based on pure thermodynamics, not applicable for analyses and research of non-equilibrium macro-solidification processes, and the construction mode can not be applied to non-equilibrium solidification process. In this study, {{the construction of the}} dynamic solidification curve (DSC) for the non-equilibrium macro-solidification process included: a modified method to determine the start temperature of primary austenite precipitation (TAL) and the start temperature of eutectic solidification (TES); double curves method to determine the temperature of the dendrite coherency point of primary austenite (TAC) and the temperature of eutectic cells collision point (TEC); the “technical solidus” method to determine the end temperature of eutectic reaction (TEN). For this purpose, a comparative testing of the non-equilibrium solidification temperature fields in lost-foam casting and green sand mold casting hypoeutectic gray iron was carried out. The thermal analysis results were used to construct the DSCs of both these casting methods under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. The results show that the transformation rate of non-equilibrium solidification in hypoeutectic gray cast iron is greater than that of equilibrium solidification. The eutectic solidification region presents a typical mushy solidification mode. The results also indicate that the primary austenite precipitation zone of lost-foam casting is slightly larger than that of green sand casting. At the same time, the solid fraction (fs) of the dendrite coherency points in lost-foam casting is greater than that in the green sand casting. Therefore, from these two points, lost-foam casting is more preferable for reduction of shrinkage and mechanical burnt-in sand tendency of the hypoeutectic gray cast iron. Due {{to the fact that the}} solidification process (from the surface to center) at primary austenite growth area in the lost-foam <b>cylinder</b> sample <b>lags</b> behind that in the green sand casting, the mushy solidification tendency of lost-foam casting is greater and the solidification time is longer...|$|R
40|$|Inertia of the {{electric}} carrier in metals. — Although Tolman and Stewart had apparently demonstrated that the carriers in metals have approximately the same ratios of mass to charge as an electron, it was desirable to verify this result and if possible obtain a more accurate value for m/e by using an entirely different method. An oscillating apparatus was constructed, consisting of a copper cylinder 91 / 8 ″ long, 4 ″ outside diameter and 3 ″ inside diameter, attached to a brass torsion rod {{in such a manner}} that it could be oscillated about its axis with a frequency of about 20 cycles per second. Surrounding this copper cylinder was a coil, containing about 60 miles of No. 38 copper wire, which acted as the secondary of a transformer, and was connected to a vibration galvanometer through a specially designed three-stage amplifier. The tendency of the electrons in the oscillating copper <b>cylinder</b> to <b>lag</b> behind because of their inertia leads to an electromotive force, the effects of which were finally measured by the deflection of the vibration galvanometer, tuned to the frequency of the mechanical oscillations. This galvanometer deflection was then compared with that produced by the known electromotive force accompanying a transverse oscillation of the cylinder across the earth's magnetic field. The apparatus was mounted on a massive concrete pier in a special location 150 yards from the nearest electrical circuits, was constructed without the use of magnetic materials, and was driven by compressed air. The axis of the oscillating cylinder was set parallel to the earth's magnetic field to reduce accidental effects. The apparatus avoids the direct electric connections between moving and stationary parts, and the sudden stopping of a coil of wire, with the attendant chance of buckling and slipping of the wire, which were present in the apparatus used by Tolman and Stewart. The fact that the vibration galvanometer will respond only to the frequency of the desired effect is also important in eliminating accidental effects. Mass of carrier in copper. The average of 86 determinations of m/e is 5. 2 × 10 ^- 8. However since the means of the first 42 determinations and of the last 44, obtained with the cylinder earthed only through the concrete pier and specially earthed, respectively, are 5. 97 and 4. 35, and since the corrections for zero amplitude were large, these preliminary results are not regarded as demonstrating a difference between the ratio m/e of the carrier in copper and of an election in free space, 5. 66 × 10 ^- 8...|$|R
