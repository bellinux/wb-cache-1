6000|$|England--all {{stuffed with}} soft {{feathers}} ... under one's ear. A pillow--with soft, kind Corners ... Beautiful rounded Corners.... Dear, dear Corners. Cissie Corners. Corners. <b>Could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better family? ...|$|E
6000|$|Hatteraick's genius here deserted him. 'Der deyvil!' {{he broke}} out, 'how <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{footmark}} on the ground, {{when it was}} a frost as hard as the heart of a Memel log?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Von Bork {{shook his}} head. [...] "I don't {{see how that}} <b>could</b> <b>be.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{definite}} treaty <b>there.</b> She <b>could</b> never recover from such a humiliation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! that's {{a bitter}} jest," [...] said Sybil. [...] "England, Wales, Scotland {{will be forced}} to work as they were forced before. How can they subsist without labour? And if they <b>could,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{organised}} power that will subdue them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jimmy; [...] "one of the epics {{nobody has}} ever written, perhaps because nobody really <b>could.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> good many of them. As you say, when one has to fight to windward, things {{generally}} happen more or less that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose it}} was his own," [...] said Lord Warburton; [...] "and in that case <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better proof of wealth? Let not a public benefactor talk of one's being too fond of pleasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{thought it}} was possible. When they came out through the French window, there was the pond with one tempting little hole in the ice, {{right in front of}} their noses. <b>Could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better hiding-place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shure thin, {{and your}} honour's the thrue fisherman, and understands it all like a book. Why, ye spake as if ye'd known the wather a {{thousand}} years! As I said, how <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fish here at all, just now?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{aging process}} in humans leaves a dilemma in that females live past {{their ability to}} reproduce. The {{question}} poised to evolutionary researchers then becomes, why do human bodies live on so robustly and for so long past their reproductive potential, and <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> adaptive benefit to abandoning one's own attempts at reproduction to assist kin? ...|$|R
60|$|And then Fate {{came to her}} rescue. Before she <b>could</b> speak, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> interruption.|$|R
60|$|A. Ah! well, I suppose so. We never <b>could</b> tell. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{great mystery}} about it.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more simple Tyrtaeus? and {{who that}} reads him {{will not be}} ambitious of falling in a glorious war? Bayly, indeed, is always simple. He is [...] "simple, sensuous, and passionate," [...] and Milton asked no more from a poet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] {{she replied}} very gently. [...] "Why, how <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> vow between us? I go, and return. You await me--me, Criseyde, Traveller, the lonely-hearted. That {{is the little}} all, O much-surrendering Stranger! Would that long-ago were now--before all chaffering!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better time," [...] he argued. [...] "You have {{naturally}} {{a gathering}} of clergy--people ought to be liberal on such an occasion, and, as Cocksmoor is provided for, why not give the benefit to the missions, in their crying need!" ...|$|E
60|$|Before Jevons <b>could</b> answer, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> rush of dark figures {{toward the}} office, and a hoarse shout.|$|R
60|$|The {{action of}} the young woman on {{entering}} was somewhat suggestive of the cause of her haste. Without a moment's delay, she seized a powder-horn and bullet-pouch, and began to charge the guns, some with ball, others with slugs, as fast as she <b>could.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cool, quiet celerity in her proceedings which proved that she was accustomed to the handling of such weapons.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. He's an ugly customer. That's all I <b>could</b> see. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little carpet bag in his hand.|$|R
60|$|Had he done right? How <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{doubt about}} it? How <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} about it? Which {{of them had}} loved him, or was capable of loving him as Mary loved him? What girl was ever so sweet, so gracious, so angelic, as his own Mary? He swore {{to her that he}} was prouder of winning her than of anything he had ever done in all his life, and that of all the treasures that had ever come in his way she was the most precious. She went to bed that night the happiest girl in all Connaught, although when she parted from him she understood that she was not to see him again till Christmas-Eve.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hear what}} you are talking about," [...] said the wife. [...] "But you will make no {{impression}} on Humphrey. As long as the fish rise to his bait, everybody is what he ought to be. Bless you, Casaubon has got a trout-stream, and does not care about fishing in it himself: <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better fellow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{have been}} greater Poets than Voltaire; {{there was never}} any so well recompensed: and why? Because Taste (GOUT, inclination) sets no limits to its recompenses. The King of Prussia {{overloads}} men of talent with his benefits for precisely the reasons which induce a little German Prince to overload with benefits a buffoon or a dwarf."

5000|$|This theory {{explained}} why all elements react {{in the way}} they do and why some formed the compounds they do, while others did not. It also {{explained why}} elements had the physical properties they did, which in turn explained why the periodic table had the shape it did. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one fundamental question left unanswered: how many elements <b>were</b> <b>there</b> - <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> infinite number of elements between Hydrogen and Uranium? ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> crisis, for instance, in the {{financial}} area, the stock market could take <b>a</b> tumble, <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> failure of a major financial institution.

60|$|Before Anne <b>could</b> answer, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{knock at}} the door, and Lady Merton's maid appeared, ready to dress her young lady for the evening; and thus the {{conversation}} ended.|$|R
60|$|Nor <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{home for}} her father there as long as old Mr. Jones was alive, nor {{possibly}} when his son should come to the throne. For a time he must go to America, and she must go with him. She had declared to herself {{that she could not}} go back to the United States unless she could go back as a successful singer. For these reasons she resolved that she would face Mr. Moss bravely and all his horrors.|$|E
6000|$|This plea decided Anne, who {{had been}} on the point of declaring that she should have an {{excellent}} view {{from the top of the}} keep. However, not only did she long to see Lucy again, but the enthusiasm was contagious, and there was an attraction in the centre of popular rejoicing that drew both her and her uncle, nor <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> doubt of her being sufficiently protected when among the Archfield ladies. So the arrangement was accepted, and then there was the cry-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it weren't {{for that}} I shouldn't {{have come here}} to meet you. My gift {{is the thing that}} takes you: <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better proof than that it's to-night's display of it that has brought you to this unreason? It's indeed a misfortune that you're so {{sensitive}} to our poor arts, since they play such tricks with your power to see things as they are. Without my share of them I should be a dull, empty, third-rate woman, and yet that's the fate you ask me to face and insanely pretend you're ready to face yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{understand}} thee, my precious one," [...] said Licinia whose turn it was now to be deeply puzzled; [...] "what greater punishment <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> for <b>a</b> traitor than that of death?" ...|$|R
60|$|Before he <b>could</b> reply <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> distant report, {{followed}} almost {{directly by}} another. With {{a movement of}} irritation {{he walked to the}} window, turned and looked at her--bolted it, and came back.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> freeman {{with the}} spirit of the slave, and <b>there</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> slave with a spirit full of freedom; whoever is {{faithful}} to himself – he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> freeman, and whoever fills his life only with what is good and beautiful in the eyes of others – he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> slave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never <b>could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more bloody engagement, or men of more invincible {{spirits and}} prudent conduct, {{according}} to their manner and way of fighting. It lasted near two hours, till the party which was nearest our castle began to decline, and at last to fly from their conquerors. We were undoubtedly put into a great consternation on this account, lest they should run into our grove, and consequently bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we resolved to kill the first that came, to prevent discovery, and that too with our swords, and the butt end of our muskets, for fear the report of our guns should be heard.|$|E
60|$|That these {{stand in}} {{something}} like their true order of subordination, it needs no long consideration to show. The actions and precautions by which, from moment to moment, we secure personal safety, must clearly take precedence of all others. <b>Could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> man, ignorant as an infant of surrounding objects and movements, or how to guide himself among them, he would pretty certainly lose his life {{the first time he}} went into the street; notwithstanding any amount of learning he might have on other matters. And as entire ignorance in all other directions would be less promptly fatal than entire ignorance in this direction, it must be admitted that knowledge immediately conducive to self-preservation is of primary importance.|$|E
6000|$|It was in {{the middle}} of this country, not very far from Evesham, that Sir John Bollamore lived in the old ancestral home of Thorpe Place, and thither it was that I came to teach his two little sons. Sir John was a widower--his wife had died three years before--and he had been left with these two lads aged eight and ten, and one dear little girl of seven. Miss Witherton, who is now my wife, was governess to this little girl. I was tutor to the two boys. <b>Could</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more obvious prelude to an engagement? She governs me now, and I tutor two little boys of our own. But, there--I have already {{revealed}} what it was which I gained in Thorpe Place! ...|$|E
6000|$|It struck Thorne that Nevis started, {{but before}} any of those most {{concerned}} <b>could</b> speak <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> rapid thud of horse-hoofs approaching down the street. Then {{a man on the}} steps cried out: ...|$|R
60|$|Marston saw Wyndham understood; he {{need not}} labor his explanation, but he wished Harry <b>could</b> talk. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> {{assurance}} {{he wanted his}} comrade to give; Harry knew how he had felt about Rupert.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was as far}} as she <b>could</b> get. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pause; his intellect was {{struggling}} to comprehend; presently it did manage to catch the idea in time to save embarrassment all around, and he said gratefully-- ...|$|R
