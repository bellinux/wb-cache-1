40|$|Abstract A {{sentence}} {{is the most}} complete syntactic unit of a language. The construction of a {{sentence is}} the most comprehensive, controversial and fascinating syntactic issue in the language grammar. The message or intention is usually conveyed through a sentence. In fact, the communicative function of a language is carried out via a sentence. A sentence can be classified in to different categories from different perspectives: semantically, constructively or performatively either with a verb or without a verb and also {{with regard to the}} construction. With regard to the construction, a sentence is either simple or <b>compound.</b> A simple <b>sentence</b> is the one with a complete meaning which only has one verb. It must be born in mind that a sentence is a complete unit whit meaning and there can be a hesitation after that. There for units of speech that have a verb without a complete meaning and there can be no silence or hesitation after them cannot be regarded as a sentence. Since they are dependent upon another sentence to be completed. They are called phrases. Such phrases can be incorporated in <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> make main and subordinate clauses. <b>Compound</b> <b>sentences</b> are widely discussed whit in grammatical constructions, but their types and that how have been built their various constructions are less adequately discussed. With regard to the manner of construction of <b>compound</b> <b>sentences,</b> the widest linguistic amenities can be observed in the sentences. There is not such complexity or disagreement over simple <b>sentences</b> but <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> have been less adequately investigated and there is room for more discussion and debate. Because, in some grammars, without considering the construction criteria, all sentences that are connected to one another, whit connectives are called <b>compound</b> <b>sentences.</b> This paper has precisely investigated <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> and has elaborated on the construction criteria of <b>compound</b> <b>sentences.</b> The study has also pointed to the mistakes of some of the grammars. This research project has for the first time introduced constructive models of <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> in a comprehensive research taking in to account the tense of the verbs. The primary question in this research project is which kind of sentences can be considered as compound and what is the constructive of such a sentence? When defining a <b>compound</b> <b>sentences,</b> grammarians either shave the same beliefs or differ in their ideas. But all grammarians agree to the fact that a <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> has more than one verb. Different definitions are due to different criteria adapted in constructing a <b>compound</b> <b>sentences.</b> To construct a noun, and adjective, a verb and a sentence we should take similar and precise criteria to our consideration. In the grammatical units of noun, adjectives, and verbs construction means connecting two or more parts that can convey one similar meaning and its parts are dependent upon one another.  In the construction of <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> there must be the same criteria so that its applications can be truly recognized and identified just like the previously mentioned grammatical units. The first step to arrive at a criterion in defining and identifying <b>compound</b> <b>sentences,</b> is to separate this discussion from connective sentences that are relate to each other with connectives are called connective sentences. But sentences which are constructed with dependent making connectives and their parts are dependent upon one another are called <b>compound</b> <b>sentences.</b> Therefore the signs of <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> with regard to constructions and the meaning of criterion are as follows: 1) They have more than one verb. 2) The consistence of two or more dependent phrases. 3) Phrases construct a complete sentences all together and convey one similar message. 4) One of the phrases is the main clause and the other one is the subordinate one. 5) The phrases or subordinate clauses can be related to one of the major parts and they can take a syntactic role as for the subordinate clause. 6) In <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> there are dependent connectives sentences, such as until, however, if, that. 7) The sign of dependence or being subordinate clauses is the existence of connectives. 8) Phrases or clauses in the <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> have no authority or independence and there is a pause {{at the end of the}} <b>sentence.</b> Therefore, a <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> consist of two or more dependent clauses and conveys one similar meaning or message. <b>Compound</b> <b>sentences</b> are so wide and various in Persian. What we mean by wide is their multiplicity and what is meant by various is that there are too many variants construction of different verbs. That’s why they are called dangling. Contrary to the construction model of simple sentences that is few than 30. Construction models of <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> are too many. This paper has investigated the constructions of modern Persia sentences and some sentences from ancient text that’s are similar to todays’ sentences. 193 models for the construction of <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> are extracted and introduced. They has been called floating because of their multiplicity and variety of the construction of models and verb tense use. The results indicate that there are different kinds of verb in the construction of <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> and the construction model for <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> is so fluid and flouting. These construction can be used according to purpose, use, message, semantic value variety and the tonality. In some <b>compound</b> <b>sentences</b> and the variety in the construction of such sentences indicated that Persian language enjoys great. Capacity and capability in the construction sentences. Such sentences are indicative of the flexibility, volatility, and wide amenity of Persian language in sentences construction...|$|R
