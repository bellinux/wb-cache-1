25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, cores {{are usually}} supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means {{are required to}} support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied {{in the form of}} <b>chaplets.</b> These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the <b>chaplets</b> become part of the casting, the <b>chaplets</b> must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create a weak spot in the casting. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper <b>chaplets</b> are stronger than the lower ones because the core will want to float up in the molten metal.|$|E

The allegorical designs of Hindoos and sorrowing soldiers with reversed arms, which decorate {{two sides of}} the enclosed tomb, though perhaps as good as can be, are under any treatment unclassical and uncouth. The simple laurel and oak-leaf <b>chaplets</b> on the alternating faces are far more suitable and suggestive.|$|E

She used at times to gather berries and thread them for <b>chaplets</b> to sell at the holy wells; but I trow sheer beggary throve better!" ...|$|E

The clergy succeeded to the Brotherhood, and walked immediately before the corpse, which was carried by the fathers of the Society. The viceroy, with his court, closed up the ceremony, which was followed by an innumerable multitude of people. All the streets were hung with tapestry; and when the blessed corpse appeared, flowers were thrown upon it from all the windows, and from the tops of houses.|$|E

50|$|Faustina {{stated that}} she {{received}} the prayer through visions and conversations with Jesus, who made specific promises regarding the recitation of the prayers. Her Vatican biography quotes some of these conversations. As a Roman Catholic devotion, the <b>chaplet</b> is often said as a rosary-based prayer with {{the same set of}} rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the <b>Chaplet</b> of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the <b>chaplet</b> can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads. The <b>chaplet</b> may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips, and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.|$|R
50|$|Praying the <b>chaplet</b> is said {{to provide}} the {{assistance}} from Saint Michael the Archangel and the company of one angel {{from each of the}} nine celestial choirs when approaching Holy Communion. In addition, for those who would recite the <b>Chaplet</b> daily, he promised his continual assistance and that of all the holy angels during life. Praying the <b>chaplet</b> is also believed gradually to defeat demons and grant a Pure Heart thus delivering from Purgatory. These blessings extend to the direct family.|$|R

[...] The praise is [...] in {{the seventh}} season, not in [Greek: sporêtos], nor in [...] [Greek: phytalia], but in [Greek: opôra]. It is strange [...] that men always praise enthusiastically any person who, [...] by a {{momentary}} exertion, saves a life; but praise very [...] hesitatingly a person who, by exertion and self-denial [...] prolonged through years, creates one. We give the crown [...] "ob [...] civem servatum,"--why not [...] "ob civem natum"? Born, I mean, to [...] the full, in soul as well as body.

60|$|There {{is also a}} most {{delicate}} and beautiful rite observed {{in some of the}} remote villages of the south at the funeral of a female who has died young and unmarried. A chaplet of white flowers is borne before the corpse by a young girl nearest in age, size, and resemblance, and is afterwards hung up in the church over the accustomed seat of the deceased. These <b>chaplets</b> are sometimes made of white paper, in imitation of flowers, and inside of them is generally a pair of white gloves. They are intended as emblems of the purity of the deceased, and the crown of glory which she has received in heaven.|$|E
