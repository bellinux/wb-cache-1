40|$|Abstract — The Fisher {{information}} matrix (FIM) is a <b>critical</b> <b>quantity</b> in {{several aspects of}} system identification, including input selection and confidence region calculation. Analytical determination of the FIM in a general system identification setting may be difficult or almost impossible due to intractable modeling requirements and/or high-dimensional integration. A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation-based technique was introduced by the second author to address these difficulties [1]. This paper proposes {{an extension of the}} MC algorithm in order to enhance the statistical qualities of the estimator of the FIM. This modified MC algorithm is particularly useful in those cases where the FIM has a structure with some elements being analytically known from prior information and the others being unknown. The estimator of the FIM, obtained by using the proposed MC algorithm, simultaneously preserve...|$|E
