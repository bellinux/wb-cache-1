40|$|Hospital visitations of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate in 1999 {{showed the}} {{cleaning}} and disinfection procedures in endoscopy departments to be neither completely validated nor integrated {{as a part of}} a quality system. One reason that insufficient attention was paid to the validation of the cleaning proces was the nonavailabilityof a standard validation test for measuring cleaning efficiency. A cleaning test needs to be simple and easy to perform in hospital practice. This report describes a test using a surrogate device to mimic the channelsystem and valves of a real endoscope. In the test the surrogate endoscope was soiled with an compound mixture of blood proteins and mucus, which served as a model for practical conditions. Tests showed that preparation, application and verification of the test soil needed a thorough validation. The application of the method in 17 hospitals proved to be feasible and showed that it was able to discriminate between different washing procedures such as those using a precleaning step and warm or <b>cold</b> <b>cleaning</b> processes.

He invented devices for monitoring {{the efficiency of}} kidney stone therapy, an invention that won the 2008 ‘Medical & Healthcare’ award from ‘The Engineer’ (key collaborator: Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust). His scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needle-free injectors for migraine sufferers (over 1 million sold). He assisted the Institute of Cancer Research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring (2010). He was a co-author of the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning, since which time 2 billion mothers and children have been scanned. He identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces, and placed this {{in the context of}} inadequate current guidelines for public protection, and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them. He advises the Health Protection Agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection.Leighton is currently developing several inventions to achieve <b>cold</b> water <b>cleaning</b> (cleaning without heat or additives), saving water, energy and cost, and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking water. When <b>cleaning,</b> <b>cold</b> water without chemicals might also be required by the target (transplant organs, microchips etc.) which could not withstand heat or chemicals. Most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currently confidential as a result of patenting restrictions, but StarStream [...] is securely patented in many countries. It cleans down a stream of water, and in tests cleans whilst saving up to 80% water and electricity costs, with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water.

40|$|Effective high {{temperature}} ceramic filters are indispensable in the advanced, coal based power systems (IGCC and PFBC). To meet the environmental particulate emission requirements and improve thermal efficiency, ceramic filters are utilized to cleanup the hot gas particulate to protect downstream heat exchanger and gas turbine components from fouling and corrosion. The mechanical integrity of ceramic filters and an efficient dust cake removal system {{are the key}} issues for hot gas cleanup systems. The filters must survive combined stresses due to mechanical, thermal, chemical and steam attack throughout normal operations (<b>cold</b> back pulse <b>cleaning</b> jets), unexpected excessive ash accumulation, and the start up and shut down conditions. To evaluate the design and performance of ceramic filters, different long term filter testing programs were conducted.

40|$|Syngas {{coming out}} of a {{gasifier}} is usually very hot. Cooling is necessary to allow this syngas to be transported without damaging downstream piping or equipment. Furthermore, the existing <b>cold</b> syngas <b>cleaning</b> technology also requires that the syngas temperature to be reduced below 600 oF. Direct water quenching of syngas is one of the cooling schemes that can not only provide the necessary cooling, but also help to drive the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction to convert steam and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which is an important process for systems implementing carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). To assist designing an adequate syngas quench cooling section, this study has employed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the performance of a preliminary design of a water quench system in a downdraft entrained flow coal gasifier. The preliminary quench system design consists of a primary water curtain section located in the main entrance of the quench section and a secondary water spray section distributed in the outer annular passage with a counter-flow arrangement. The bottom water bath level can be adjusted to change the syngas’s local speed over the water surface to fine-tune the WGS reaction without using more sprayed water.

40|$|A {{detailed}} thermo-economic model considering different technological {{alternatives for}} the ther-mochemical production of fuels from biomass (i. e. wood) is presented. Energetic and economic {{models for the}} production of Fischer-Tropsch fuel (FT), methanol (MeOH) and dimethyl ether (DME) by the means of different options of wood drying (flue gas and steam), gasification (di-rectly and indirectly heated, fluidized bed and entrained flow), gas <b>cleaning</b> (hot and <b>cold),</b> synthesis and upgrading are reviewed and developed. Based on these models, the process is integrated and the optimal utility system is computed. Furthermore, economic models are elab-orated and the competitiveness of the different process options is compared {{on the basis of the}} energetic, economic and environmental performance. The recommended technical alternatives for the production and treatment of producer gas are: air drying, indirectly heated fluidized bed gasification followed by steam methane reforming and <b>cold</b> gas <b>cleaning.</b> For the three different synthesis processes, the total energetic efficiencies are 59. 8 % (FT), 52. 5 % (MeOH) and 53. 4 % (DME), and the production costs are 126. 6, 184. 8 and 163 US$/MWh with investment costs of 24. 6, 35. 9 and 31. 1 MUS $ for a plant capacity of 20 MWth nominal power based on LHV.

40|$|Aims: The study {{describes}} {{the effects of}} heating temperature and exposure time on the thermal stability of cereulide under different conditions (pH, presence/absence of oil phase and cereulide concentration). Methods and Results: Cereulide heat inactivation was investigated at 100, 121 and 150 degrees C under different alkaline pH values (8. 6 - 10. 6) and {{in the presence of}} oil phase (0. 6 - 1. 4 %). Three different cereulide concentrations (0. 5, 5 and 6 mu g ml(- 1)) were used. Cereulide detection was performed with computer-aided semen analyzer and with HPLC-MS. Highly alkaline pH was needed to achieve inactivation. At lower cereulide concentrations less drastic conditions were needed. Removal of alkaline buffer after the heat treatment resulted in the recovery of toxic activity. Conclusions: Heat stability of cereulide has been proved to be remarkable, even at highly alkaline pH values, at all temperatures tested. The loss of activity appeared to be reversible. Significance and Impact of the Study: The study demonstrates the inability of any heat treatment used in the food industry to inactivate cereulide.

To fulfill this purpose, two Advanced Particle Filter (APF) systems were complete at Tidd PFBC Demonstration Plant, in Brilliant, Ohio in late 1990 {{as part of the}} Department of Energy's (DOE) Clean Coal Technology Program. But the most undesirable thing ever happened was the sudden functional and physical failures of filters prior to its designed life time. In Tidd APF filter vessel, twenty eight (28) filters failed one time. Significant research effort has been carried out to find out the causes that led to the early failure of filters. In this work, the studies are emphasized on the possible failure causes analysis of rigid ceramic candle filters. The objectives of this program were to provide an systematic study on the characterization of filters, material laboratory analysis on filter micro-structure, the dust cake dislodging mechanism and possible causes led to failures of ceramic filters. These research work includes 1) characterization on filter properties, 2) material laboratory investigation on cracked and un-cracked filter batches, 3) a thermal numerical simulation, 4) various physical testing on filter mechanical integrity and 5) the back pulse cleaning mechanism.

To characterize the physical properties of used and unused ceramic filters, filter permeabilities and the pressure field of the gas stream were measured within a filter chamber with the use of fast response pressure transducers and an automatic data acquisition system.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> plasma (CP) <b>cleaning</b> is a dry, non-thermal process, {{which can}} provide broad-spectrum {{antimicrobial}} activity yet reportedly causes {{little to no}} damage to the object being sanitized.

This paper will present results on an effort to use low pressure CP to disinfect or sterilize materials for in space applications.

40|$|Present {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) systems demonstrate high system efficiency and impressive environmental performance, giving them {{an edge over}} conventional pulverised fuel power stations. A key area {{in the development of}} IGCCs is hot fuel gas clean-up (HGCU). Fuel gas cleaning at elevated temperatures reduces thermal efficiency losses associated with gas quenching in conventional <b>cold</b> gas <b>cleaning</b> methods. Current hot gas desulphurisation techniques focus on the use of regenerable metal oxide sorbents, however the long-term sorbent performance issues have yet to be fully addressed. A fresh and radical approach may provide the key to overcoming the inherent limitations associated with metal oxide sorbents. A molten tin irrigated packed bed scrubber adopted in this research project is one such innovative way forward in HGCU. The hot scrubber offers the prospect of a multicomponent clean-up device. High-temperature sulphur removal takes place via absorption of H 2 S (and COS) into molten tin whilst discrete molten tin droplets and rivulets on the packing surface act as solid particulate collectors. The primary aim of this research project was to investigate the workings of a small-scale room temperature packed bed scrubber operating under non-wetting flow conditions analogous to the molten tin irrigated scrubber. Water irrigation of low surface energy packings simulated the nonwetting flow of liquid metals. The air-water analogue of the liquid metal scrubber provided the platform for hydrodynamics (flow visualisation, flooding and liquid holdup), particulate removal and mass transfer studies under non-wetting flow conditions. The performance of a small air lift for water circulation through the column was also investigated. These cold studies offered insight into the operation and performance of the liquid metal hot scrubber. Prior to the cold gas scrubber studies, preliminary small-scale gasification tests on petroleum coke samples were performed to investigate the effect of molten tin on H 2 S in the product fuel gas. The tests provided actual experimental evidence of the possibility of sulphur removal by molten tin in a gasification environment. It was shown that the maximum possible size of a liquid droplet hanging from a non-wetting spherical solid surface could be predicted from the liquid surface tension and density based on force balance. The mobility of static holdup in a non-wettable packed bed has been demonstrated, this being due to the tendency for the liquid to form discrete droplets rather than spreading films. Existing flooding and liquid holdup correlations that hold for conventional wettable packed beds were shown to be inadequate where non-wetting systems were concerned. Summary hence alternative methods applicable to the latter were sought. The introduction of a non-wetting tendency factor based on the ratio of the solid critical surface tension to the liquid surface tension, enabled the flooding capacities of non-wetting systems including those of this study to be predicted using Sherwood et al. 's graphical flooding correlation. The total volumetric liquid holdup was well correlated against the bed pressure drop, true gas velocity and gas density, offering the prospects of predicting holdup for systems using the same spherical packing. In general, the water-irrigated packed bed showed good hydrodynamic similarities to liquid metal systems, suggesting a dominating influence of liquid-solid contact angle which overrides striking differences in liquid physical properties. The performance of the small air lift pump was unaffected by varying the number of gas ports on the injector without any change to the hole size. The operating curve of the air lift pump could be predicted with good accuracy using momentum balance and two phase flow theory, provided that all major pressure losses in the system were accounted for, including notably the downcomer friction losses and accelerative effects. The non-wetting packed bed scrubber demonstrated impressive dust removal performance. Total separation efficiencies as high as 99. 6...|$|R
