In the described investigations coated <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> cemented carbide inserts were variously rounded by grinding. The coating thickness distributions in the transient region between tool flank and rake were determined by an appropriate evaluation of ball cratering tests using confocal microscopy.

The results demonstrated that even <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> with slightly revealed substrate can effectively withstand the cutting loads...|$|R
