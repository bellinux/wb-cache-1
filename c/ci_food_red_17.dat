Despite some {{friction}} by Bryce and JJ where JJ believed he was left out of the conversation, Michelle decided the black team would have the white food, blue team to have the <b>red</b> <b>food</b> and <b>red</b> team to have the green food because Sam (who she didn't mention his name earlier) wasn't going to cope with green food and having her revenge on the red team after Nicole's elimination.|$|R

40|$|Acid fuchsin and phloxine B are {{commonly}} used to stain plant-parasitic nematodes in roots and egg masses on root surfaces, respectively. Both stains can be harmful to both the user and the environment and require costly waste disposal procedures. We developed safer methods to replace both stains using McCormick Schilling <b>red</b> <b>food</b> color. Eggs, juveniles, and adults of Meloidogyne incognita stained in roots with <b>red</b> <b>food</b> color were equally as visible as those stained with acid fuchsin.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK pilus adhesin moiety resides in an epithelial cell-binding domain located in the C-terminal region of the PAK pilin structural protein. Synthetic peptides Ac <b>17</b> <b>red</b> (a synthetic peptide with a sequence identical to that of PAK pilin residues 128 to 144, with the Cys- 129 and Cys- 142 residues being in the reduced state) and Ac 17 ox (a synthetic peptide with a sequence identical to that of PAK pilin residues 128 to 144, with a formed disulfide bridge between the amino acid residues Cys- 129 and Cys- 142), which should contain the epithelial cell-binding domain, were synthesized. Ac <b>17</b> <b>red</b> and Ac <b>17</b> ox both bound to buccal epithelial cells (BECs) and to ciliated tracheal epithelial cells (TECs). Ac 17 ox had a Km of 6. 40 microM for binding to BECs, while Ac <b>17</b> <b>red</b> had a Km of 9. 87 microM. Ac <b>17</b> <b>red</b> bound to the same receptor sites that purified pili did and competitively inhibited the binding of purified PAK pili to BECs. BEC glycoproteins with molecular masses of 82, 55 to 51, and 40 kilodaltons immobilized on nitrocellulose exhibited periodate-sensitive receptor activity for Ac 17 red; similar activity has been found for PAK pili. Ac <b>17</b> <b>red,</b> Ac <b>17</b> ox, and PAK pili bound to the cilia and luminal portions of the cytoplasmic membrane of human TECs, the same regions to which P. aeruginosa whole cells bind.

40|$|Abstract: Gelatin {{microspheres}} (GMSs) {{prepared by}} the inverse suspension cross-linking reaction, was characterised by scanning electron microscopy. The influence of pH on kinetics and mechanism was verified. The kinetic models such as pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion models were selected to understand the reaction pathways and mechanism of adsorption process. Adsorption of <b>food</b> <b>red</b> 7 (FR 7) and food yellow 2 (FY 2) onto GMSs occurred by chemisorption. For both dyes, adsorption occurred by film and intraparticle diffusion, and the pH increase caused an increase in film diffusion resistance.
