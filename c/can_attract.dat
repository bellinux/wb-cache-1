5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical {{discussion about}} the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles. He argues in favour of reincarnation; a collective consciousness that has intentionality; modal realism (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (that good and bad thoughts <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> experiences).|$|E
5|$|Holkham's north-facing coastal {{location}} <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> {{large numbers}} of migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with a north to north-east wind. The common species may {{be accompanied by a}} wryneck, red-backed shrike or greenish warbler in August, with goldcrests, thrushes and finches later in the season, and perhaps red-breasted flycatchers and yellow-browed warblers. Vagrant rarities such as Pallas's, Radde's or dusky warblers may occur; a red-breasted nuthatch in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Scent plays a {{significant}} role in olfactory communication. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behaviour but less prominently than the males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> males from far off.|$|E

50|$|ALLA {{acts as a}} news portal and {{a source}} of {{information}} about industry developments for Australian legal professionals. It also organises and runs the regular Australian Law Librarians Conference, held every two years. This conference is rotated around the country's Capital cities, and <b>can</b> <b>attracts</b> up to 300 information professionals and industry representatives from all around Australia.|$|R
5|$|Koalas are {{seasonal}} breeders, and births {{take place}} {{from the middle}} of spring through the summer to early autumn, from October to May. Females in oestrus tend to hold their heads further back than usual and commonly display tremors and spasms. However, males do not appear to recognise these signs, and have been observed to mount non-oestrous females. Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force himself on a female, mounting her from behind, and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant or is more familiar. The bellows and screams that accompany matings <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. These fights may allow the female to assess which is dominant. Older males usually have accumulated scratches, scars, and cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E
5|$|Urban red foxes {{are most}} active at dusk and dawn, {{doing most of}} their hunting and {{scavenging}} at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, {{but they can be}} caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas {{as well as on the}} edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.|$|E

25|$|There are few food wastes that {{vermicomposting}} cannot compost, although meat {{waste and}} dairy products are likely to putrefy, and in outdoor bins <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> vermin. Green waste should be added in moderation to avoid heating the bin.|$|E
25|$|FeTNA organizes {{an annual}} North American Tamil convention. Established in 1988, the {{conventions}} are held during the 4th of July weekend, {{in a different}} city every year. Conventions <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> over two thousand attendees from all over North America.|$|E
25|$|One {{application}} of this is Ampère's force law, which describes how two current-carrying wires <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: Ampère's force law.|$|E
5000|$|Decoy (DECOY)-The player acquires this {{weapon in}} the middle of the game. HIRO's {{hologram}} <b>can</b> actually <b>attract</b> the enemy to the optical illusion.|$|R
30|$|The modal ki’i behaves like an {{auxiliary}} verb {{and is thus}} unmarked for TAM or voice marking. It <b>can</b> only <b>attract</b> clitic pronouns, such as =su’ in (12).|$|R
50|$|Baitfish <b>can</b> be <b>attracted</b> either via scent, or {{by using}} light which {{actually}} works by attracting zooplankton, a primary food source for many baitfish, {{which are then}} drawn to the light.|$|R
25|$|Sea cages <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> {{a variety}} of wild predators which can {{sometimes}} become entangled in associated netting leading to injury or death. In Tasmania, Australia salmon farming sea cages have entangled white-bellied sea eagles. This has prompted one company, Huon Aquaculture to sponsor a bird rehabilitation centre and trial more robust netting.|$|E
25|$|The tomb of Sarah {{is located}} in the Cave of Machpela in Hebron along with that of Abraham and the other Biblical Matriarchs and Patriarchs. Every year on the Shabbat in which Parashah Chayei Sarah is read in synagogue services, {{thousands}} of people visit the site. Known as Shabbat Hebron, the weekend <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> over 20,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Portland also hosts {{numerous}} cycling {{events and}} has become an elite bicycle racing destination. The Oregon Bicycle Racing Association supports hundreds of official bicycling events every year. Weekly events at Alpenrose Velodrome and Portland International Raceway allow for racing nearly every {{night of the week}} from March through September. Cyclocross races, such as the Cross Crusade, <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> over 1,000 riders and spectators.|$|E

25|$|The Broads {{national}} park extends to Lowestoft on Oulton Broad. Water activities and boat tours {{can be taken}} here. Powerboat racing takes place throughout the summer period, mainly on Thursday evenings. Fixtures are organised by the Lowestoft and Oulton Broad Motor Boat Club and <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> up to 1500 spectators. The Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club has its club house in Lowestoft harbour.|$|E
25|$|In many ways, the Office of Financial Research {{is to be}} {{operated}} without {{the constraints of the}} Civil Service system. For example, it does not need to follow federal pay scale guidelines (see above), and it is mandated that the office have workforce development plans that are designed to ensure that it <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> and retain technical talent, which it is required to report about Congressional committees for its first 5 years.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all high}} structures, {{cellular}} antenna masts pose a hazard to low flying aircraft. Towers over a certain height or towers that {{are close to}} airports or heliports are normally required to have warning lights. There have been reports that warning lights on cellular masts, TV-towers and other high structures <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> and confuse birds. US authorities estimate that millions of birds are killed near communication towers in the country each year.|$|E
50|$|Using {{the spray}} {{improperly}} can have undesirable effects. Because the deterrent effect {{depends on the}} bear receiving a concentrated dose of spray, using bear spray on objects or clothing is not effective, and <b>can</b> actually <b>attract</b> bears.|$|R
50|$|Spray {{lubricants}} {{may contain}} wax or PTFE. While these lubricants use tack additives {{to stay on}} the chain they <b>can</b> also <b>attract</b> dirt and sand from the road and over time produce a grinding paste that accelerates component wear.|$|R
30|$|Through the {{quantity}} mechanism, banks with higher capital ratios (CAPITALR) attract more deposits, {{as the market}} discipline hypothesis predicts. However, banks with low efficiency (MANAGEMENT 1 - 2) and liquidity problems (LIQUIDITY 1 - 2) <b>can</b> also <b>attract</b> more deposits.|$|R
25|$|Ethylene glycol is {{moderately}} toxic, with an oral LDLo = 786mg/kg for humans. The major {{danger is}} due to its sweet taste, which <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> children and animals. Upon ingestion, ethylene glycol is oxidized to glycolic acid, which is, in turn, oxidized to oxalic acid, which is toxic. It and its toxic byproducts first affect the central nervous system, then the heart, and finally the kidneys. Ingestion of sufficient amounts can be fatal if untreated. Several deaths are recorded annually in the U.S. alone.|$|E
25|$|Vancouver has {{a vibrant}} nightlife scene, {{whether it be}} food and dining, or bars and nightclubs. The Granville Entertainment District has the city's highest {{concentration}} of bars and nightclubs with closing times of 3am, in addition to various after-hours clubs open until late morning on weekends. The street <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> large crowds on weekends and is closed to traffic on such nights. Gastown is also a popular area for nightlife with many upscale restaurants and nightclubs, {{as well as the}} Davie Village which is centre to the city's LGBT community.|$|E
25|$|Bristol {{is home to}} many {{live music}} venues {{including}} the 2000-seat Colston Hall, named after Colston Street and the Colston School that once occupied the site, which <b>can</b> <b>attract</b> big names, the Trinity Centre (a community-run converted Church in the Old Market area of Bristol), the O2 Academy {{which is part of}} the national touring circuit for rock bands, the Anson Rooms (part of the University of Bristol Union), the Mothers Ruin, The Thekla, Fiddler's, the Bristol Folk House, Start the Bus, the Hatchet, the Fleece, the Croft, the Cooler and the Louisiana.|$|E
40|$|Normatively, media {{functions}} {{as a means of}} conveying information, education, and entertainment as well as controlling and relating the society. On the basis of its function, media has a chance to build a direct communication with the society so that it has a strategic position that may give benefits not only to the social aspect, but also to economic and political aspects. One way to develop communication with the public is through soap opera program. This TV program is chosen since it <b>can</b> highly <b>attract</b> public interest. In {{the point of view of}} media industry, public or audience are considered as customers who have to be served by the producer. The more the customers are satisfied, the more the producer gets benefit. One theme of soap operas that <b>can</b> highly <b>attract</b> public interest is religion-related theme. It reflects the normative society understanding of religion. As a result, the religious message contained in the soap operas is very formal. Moreover, since it <b>can</b> highly <b>attract</b> public attention, it can be utilized by media industry to get as much profit as they can and it does not function to give education and wholesome entertainment...|$|R
