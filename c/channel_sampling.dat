This technique, however, requires {{a large number}} of sniffers and generates a large amount of data. These challenges can be overcome by <b>channel</b> <b>sampling,</b> where each sniffer samples the network traffic by visiting multiple channels periodically. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, we address an important problem in <b>channel</b> <b>sampling,</b> namely, how to select channels for sniffers to reduce monitoring cost. Specifically, we study two channel selection problems. Both of them require that each AP be monitored by at least one sniffer, and in addition, one problem minimizes the maximum number of channels that a sniffer listens to, while the other minimizes the total number of channels that the sniffers listen to. We propose three algorithms, one based on integer program, LP-relaxation, and greedy heuristic, to solve each problem. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated extensively using real-world traces...|$|E

The basic operation mechanism of TIPADC is illustrated and the linear performance is analyzed in frequency domain. The mathematical expressions and {{the output of the}} system are presented in each processing step. We reveal that photonic sampling folds the whole spectrum of input signal in a narrow band, which enables the analog bandwidth of a TIPADC to be much higher than the bandwidth of back-end electronics. The feasible regions of the system is obtained in terms of system frequency response, and a set of sampling criteria determining the basic requirements to the system are summarized for typical applications. The results show that the global minimum feasible bandwidth of back-end electronics is the half of single <b>channel</b> <b>sampling</b> rate when the bandwidth of photonic sampling pulse is comparable to input signal frequency. The amplitude and phase noise of photonic sampling pulse train, the thermal noise and shot noise of photodetection, and the quantization noise and aperture jitter noise of EADCs are investigated. The nonlinearity of TIPADC is also analyzed. The effect of different factors, such as the single <b>channel</b> <b>sampling</b> rate, the average optical power and the bandwidth of back-end electronics, on the effective number of bits of TIPADC is qualitatively and quantitatively discussed. The results explicitly show that TIPADC can perform high fidelity conversion to ultra-high speed analog signal and overcome the major performance limitations existing in traditional ADCs such as aperture jitter and bandwidth. The criteria deduced will be an effective supplement to the generalized sampling theorem in designing TIPADC...|$|E

30|$|Time-varying {{channels}} can be fundamentally unidentifiable because {{requirements for}} the design of sounding signals can become contradictory[14]. According to (5) and (6), it is intractable when we select the correlator window N in (3). On one side, the time width TW−rep corresponding to N has to be chosen larger than the maximum excess delay τmax; On the other side, the repetition frequency frep has to fulfill TW[*]−[*]rep[*]≤[*] 1 [*]/[*] 2 fmax. The snapshot rate is inversely proportional to the correlator window width N. Consequently, if N is made as small as possible, then the <b>channel</b> <b>sampling</b> rate increases. This will enhance the capability of tracking Doppler characteristics. However, this narrow window will increase the noise floor when we gather CIR, which will compress the dynamical range. It will make a significant effect on the resolvability of multipath components in lower SNR regions. In the data post-processing, therefore, the window width N needs to be adjusted according to the measurement scenario.|$|E

Radio channel sounding is based on the estimation of the radio channel by use of maximum length sequence (m-sequence) as an effective sounding signal.

30|$|The wakeup radio-based MAC {{proposed}} {{in this study}} is an on-demand MAC. To evaluate and compare our work, we have chosen some of the well known and popular MAC protocols such as B-MAC, X-MAC, WiseMAC, and ZigBee. Berkeley MAC (B-MAC) is an asynchronous MAC protocol with an adaptive duty cycling mechanism. It duty cycles through a periodic <b>channel</b> <b>sampling</b> called low power listening (LPL). It uses the LPL or <b>channel</b> <b>sampling</b> scheme to link to a receiver. It employs an improved filtering mechanism to increase the reliability of channel assessment. Nodes periodically wakeup for a short time interval in each duty cycle to check for preamble. The preamble is long enough for a receiver to detect it. When a node wakes up, it turns on the radio and checks for activity in the channel. It uses the clear channel assessment (CCA) technique to detect activity. If any activity is detected, the node stays awake for the time period required to receive the packet or else a timeout puts it back to sleep state. Once the reception is completed, the node goes back to sleep mode. X-MAC is a low power, asynchronous MAC protocol. The primary goal of X-MAC is to overcome the extra latency and extra power consumption at non-target neighboring nodes unlike MACs that uses long preambles (e.g., B-MAC). It uses a preamble to inform the neighbor node about imminent data communication but avoids the long preamble through a concept of short strobe preambles. The strobe preambles contain the destination node ID. In between two strobe preambles, it awaits for an early acknowledgement from the receiver. WiseMAC is based on the preamble sampling to minimize idle listening and save power. It uses a CSMA base technique for multiple access. Nodes sample the medium with a constant period at a regular interval. They also listen to the channel for a short duration of time. The IEEE 802.15. 4 ZigBee network includes a central coordinator which acts as an access point. It is also considered as a candidate MAC for BAN. Authors of [16 – 18] have proposed and evaluated ZigBee for BAN.|$|E

Symbol-spaced TDL models are obtained by <b>sampling</b> the <b>channel</b> impulse response (CIR) at a rate equal to the reciprocal of the symbol duration. They were proposed {{more than three decades}} ago within the context of band-limited systems and their applicability seems to be un-questionable. Nonetheless, we show here that these TDL models should be used with care to model WSSUS channels within such a context, because that would violate the channel’s uncorrelated scattering (US) condition. We also show that symbol-spaced TDL models suffer from strong limitations in emulating the channel frequency correlation function (FCF). It is shown that this drawback leads to an inaccurate performance evaluation of wireless communication systems sensitive to the FCF.
