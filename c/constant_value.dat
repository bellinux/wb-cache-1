40|$|Eight radiation-based {{equations}} {{for determining}} evaporation were evaluated and expressed in five generalized forms. Five evaporation equations (Abtew, Hargreaves, Makkink, Priestley and Taylor and Turc), where each represents one generalized form, were then compared with pan evaporation measured at Changins station in Switzerland. The comparison was first made using the original <b>constant</b> <b>values</b> involved in each equation, and then using the recalibrated <b>constant</b> <b>values.</b> Evaluation of the Priestley and Taylor equation requires net radiation data as input, in this study, net radiation was estimated using Equation (16) {{owing to the}} lack of observation data. The results showed that when the original <b>constant</b> <b>values</b> were used, large errors resulted for most of the equations. When recalibrated <b>constant</b> <b>values</b> were substituted for the original <b>constant</b> <b>values,</b> four of the five equations improved greatly, and all five equations performed well for determining mean annual evaporation. For seasonal and monthly evaporation, the Hargreaves and Turc equations showed a significant bias, especially for cold months. With properly determined <b>constant</b> <b>values,</b> the Makkink and modified Priestley and Taylor equations resulted in monthly evaporation values that agreed most closely with pan evaporation in the study region. The simple Abtew equation can also be used when other meteorological data except radiation are not available. Copyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

25|$|The {{distance}} the insect falls between wingbeats {{depends on how}} rapidly its wings are beating. If the insect flaps its wings at a slow rate, the time interval during which the lifting force is zero is longer, and therefore the insect falls farther than if its wings were beating rapidly. One can calculate the wingbeat frequency necessary for the insect to maintain a given stability in its amplitude. To simplify the calculations, one must assume that the lifting force is at a finite <b>constant</b> <b>value</b> while the wings are moving down {{and that it is}} zero while the wings are moving up.

25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} a star, {{the mass of the}} star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter. The paths of all the star's satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter. Each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse. At any point along its orbit, any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter, and that energy is a <b>constant</b> <b>value</b> at every point along its orbit. As a result, as a planet approaches periapsis, the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases; as a planet approaches apoapsis, its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.|$|E

25|$|The mean {{inclination}} of {{the lunar}} orbit to the ecliptic plane is 5.145°.

This does not mean that, {{as a result of the}} precession of the Moon's orbital plane, the angle between the lunar equator and the ecliptic would vary between the sum (11.833°) and difference (1.543°) of these two angles, but, as was discovered by Jacques Cassini in 1722, the rotational axis of the Moon precesses with the same rate as its orbital plane, but is 180° out of phase (see Cassini's Laws). Therefore, the angle between the ecliptic and the lunar equator is always 1.543°, even though the rotational axis of the Moon is not fixed with respect to the stars.|$|E
25|$|A {{ventilator}} assists breathing {{using either}} pressure control or volume control {{based on the}} equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact {{is known as the}} equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: Pressure = (Elastance × Volume) + (Resistance × Flow)In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a <b>constant</b> <b>value</b> or it is proportional to the patient’s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in elastance and resistance.Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.|$|E
