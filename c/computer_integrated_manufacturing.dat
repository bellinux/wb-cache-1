In accordance to this, the present work reviews over 20 years of studies and materialisations of intelligent assembly systems, agile manufacturing and Artificial Intelligence tools applied to highly reconfigurable assembly systems.

40|$|<b>Computer</b> <b>integrated</b> {{manufacture}} {{has brought}} about great advances in manufacturing technology and its recognition is world wide. Cold roll forming of thin-walled sections, {{and in particular the}} design and manufacture of form-rolls, the special tooling used in the cold roll forming process, is but one such area where <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> manufacture can make a positive contribution. The work reported in this thesis, concerned with the development of an <b>integrated</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system for assisting the design and manufacture of form-rolls, was undertaken in collaboration with a leading manufacturer of thin-walled sections. A suit of computer programs, written in FORTRAN 77, have been developed to provide computer aids for every aspect of work in form-roll design and manufacture including cost estimation and stock control aids. The first phase of the development programme dealt with the establishment of CAD facilities for form-roll design, comprising the design of the finished section, the flower pattern, the roll design and the interactive roll editor program. Concerning the CAM facilities, dealt with in the second phase, an expert system roll machining processor and a general post-processor have been developed for considering the roll geometry and automatically generating NC tape programs for any required CNC lathe system. These programs have been successfully implemented, as an <b>integrated</b> <b>manufacturing</b> software system, on the VAX 11 / 750 super-minicomputer with graphics facilities for displaying drawings interactively on the terminal screen. The development of the integrated system has been found beneficial in all aspects of form-roll design and manufacture. Design and manufacturing lead times have been reduced by several weeks, quality has improved considerably and productivity has increased. The work has also demonstrated the promising nature of the expert systems approach to <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> manufacture...|$|R
40|$|As a very {{important}} material processing technology, plasma processing is able to modify sample surface through etching, deposition, activation, functionalization, polymerization, etc. However, the general plasma processing reacts on a large area of sample surface. Hence a mask is needed for selectively treating the sample surface. In this paper, a <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> plasma nano <b>manufacturing</b> workcell is developed, which consists of a micro plasma source and an integrated Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) nanomanipulation system. The miniature microwave plasma discharge applicator is {{able to create a}} miniature plasma stream with a diameter ranges from 2 millimeters down to micrometers. Hence the micro plasma will be able to locally treat a sample surface and has the potential to eliminate the requirement of masks. With the integrated AFM system, the sample surface is able to be inspected and further modified at nanoscale in the same chamber after machined by the micro plasma. The system design and implementation are presented in the paper. Experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system by locally etching a silicon substrate surface using the micro plasma source. Â© 2008 IEEE.

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} is {{a well-established}} decision support {{tool in the}} manufacturing industry. The rapid development and deployment of simulation models however, are inhibited by factors such as inefficient data collection, lengthy model documentation, and poorly planned experimentation.

Whilst most research work {{has been focused on}} statistical techniques for data analysis, less {{attention has been paid to}} the development of systematic approaches to input data gathering.
