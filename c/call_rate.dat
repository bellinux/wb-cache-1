The call data {{was used to}} be stored on magnetic tapes, sent to the United Kingdom for printing and bills were then dispatched to the customers after a delay of 45 days. This ensued in non-payments from many defaulters who fled away after using and receiving heavy bills. The <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> was charged to both the caller and the receiver alike.

40|$|Demand for {{emergency}} ambulance services has risen steeply over the recent years. This study examined differences in work-load of ambulance services across England and investigated factors linked to high demand. The number of emergency calls received by each ambulance service in 1997 and 2002 and population and area data {{were used to}} calculate <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> and population density for each of 27 service areas. Deprivation score and {{proportion of the population}} under age 15 and over age 65 were calculated for each service area. There was wide variation in emergency <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> across England, with London having the highest rate both in 1997 (125. 6 calls per 1000 persons) and in 2002 (140. 1 per 1000). Statistically significant positive associations were observed between <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> and deprivation (1997, r = 0. 49; 2002, r = 0. 53) and between <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> and population density (1997, r = 0. 70; 2002, r = 0. 68). Following multivariable regression, the effect of deprivation score was consistently weaker, but the effect of population density was virtually unchanged. We conclude that areas with higher population density have higher <b>call</b> <b>rates,</b> which is not explained by deprivation. Deprivation is associated with higher usage, but its effect is partly due to population density. There is no evidence that these relationships are confounded by age...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} energetic constraints on the breeding behaviour of male European treefrogs Hyla arborea and how calling males allocated additional energy supplied by feeding experiments. Results Presence in the chorus was energetically costly indicated by both fed and unfed males losing weight. Males that were supplied with additional energy did not show longer chorus tenure. Instead, fed males returned sooner to the chorus. Additionally, fed males called more often than control males, a novel response for anurans. A significantly higher <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> was noted from males even 31 nights after supplementary feeding. Conclusion This strategy of allocating additional energy reserves to increasing <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> is beneficial given the preference of female hylids for males <b>calling</b> at high <b>rates</b> and a female's ability to detect small incremental increases in <b>calling</b> <b>rate.</b> </p...|$|R

Muranjan commented that call loans in India are provided to the bill market, rendered between banks, and given for the purpose of dealing in the bullion market and stock exchanges. [...] Commercial banks, both Indian and foreign, co-operative banks, Discount and Finance House of India Ltd.(DFHI), Securities trading corporation of India (STCI) participate as both lenders and borrowers and Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Unit Trust of India(UTI), National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)can participate only as lenders.The interest rate paid on call money loans, known as the <b>call</b> <b>rate,</b> is highly volatile. It is the most sensitive section of the money market and the changes in the demand for and supply of call loans are promptly reflected in call rates. There are now two call rates in India: the Inter bank <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> and the lending rate of DFHI. The ceilings on the <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> and inter-bank term money rate were dropped, with effect from May 1, 1989. The Indian call money market has been transformed into a pure inter-bank market during 2006-07.The major call money markets are in Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad.|$|E

40|$|The vocal {{behaviour}} {{of birds}} {{may be influenced}} by many factors, including the risk of being detected by a predator. In Doñana Protected Area, the tawny owl co-exists alongside its intraguild predator, the eagle owl Bubo bubo. We considered four scenarios to study the vocal behaviour of tawny owls at dusk by analysing: A) the <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> of all males in 29 sites; B) the <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> at dusk of males living within the home range of the intraguild predator; C) the <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> of males living within the home range of the intraguild predator between 60 and 90 min after sunset; and D) the duration of male vocal bouts in visits where eagle owls have called. In scenario A we found that only the number of conspecific males affected the <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> of tawny owls. In scenario B we observed that the presence of an eagle owl calling constrained the <b>calling</b> <b>rate</b> of the intraguild prey. In scenario C we found that this effect seemed mostly associated to a contemporaneous detection of the intraguild predator’s calls. Finally, in scenario D we found no significant effects on bout duration. These results seem to indicate that tawny owls use their intraguild predator’s calls as a cue to assess predation risk, and then adjust their vocal behaviour in order to minimize predation risk by a predator that may locate its prey by its vocalizations...|$|R
