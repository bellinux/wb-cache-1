In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration <b>cooling.</b> <b>Film</b> cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

The original R-4D's combustion chamber was formed from an alloy of molybdenum, coated in a layer of disilicide. Later versions switched to a niobium alloy, for its greater ductility. Beginning with the R-4D-14, the design was changed again to use an iridium-lined rhenium combustion chamber, which provided greater resistance to high-temperature oxidization and promoted mixing of partially reacted gasses.|$|E

Detailed distributions of heat transfer and pressure are {{obtained in the}} incident shock/wall jet interaction region {{for a series of}} shock strengths and impingement positions for two nozzle heights. The major result is that the <b>cooling</b> <b>film</b> could be readily dispersed by relatively weak incident shocks such that the peak heating in the recompression region was not significantly reduced by even the largest levels of film cooling. Regions of boundary layer separation were induced in the film cooling layer, the size of which first increased and then decreased with increasing film cooling.

The average life of non-hole specimens is four times of that of the three-row holes specimens under the same testing conditions. However, the distribution of <b>cooling</b> <b>film</b> holes has relatively less influence on fatigue life. The fracture of the specimens with non-hole is linear source by SEM analysis, but the cracks are found around the <b>cooling</b> <b>film</b> holes and the fracture of the specimens with single row to three rows is a typical multi-source rupture, and cracks all initiate from near film holes. According to fracture and crystallography theoretical conjecture, the cracks propagate along the { 001 } slip plane for non-hole, single-row holes and the middle location of the multi-row holes specimens. However, the cracks around the holes grow along the { 111 } slip plane for upper and lower holes of the specimens with multi-row holes.

Within this paper, calculations of a film-cooled duct wall and a film-cooled real blade with application of the adiabatic and a conjugate heat transfer condition have been performed for different configurations.

40|$|AbstractTo design more {{efficient}} film cooling geometries for gas turbines, non-intrusive {{measurements of the}} flow temperature, velocity and derived quantities like the turbulent heat flux are needed in well-defined, generic flow configurations. With this aim we have applied thermographic particle image velocimetry (thermographic PIV) to investigate the flow emanating from angled and trenched cooling holes in a closed-loop optically-accessible wind tunnel facility. BAM:Eu 2 + thermographic phosphor particles were seeded into the flow as a tracer. A pulsed high-speed UV laser was used to excite the particles and the luminescence was detected using two high-speed cameras to determine the temperature field by a two-colour ratiometric approach. The velocity field was measured using ordinary high-speed PIV. The simultaneously measured fields were sampled {{at a rate of}} 6 kHz in a vertical plane through the centreline of the symmetrical single-row cooling holes. The flowrate and temperature of the cooling air and heated main flow were chosen to achieve density and momentum flux ratios of 1. 6 and 8 respectively. For these conditions the average and RMS temperature fields show that for ordinary angled holes the jet is detached from the surface. In contrast, the trenched geometry leads to a <b>cooling</b> <b>film</b> attached to the surface. However, time-resolved image sequences show instances where hot air breaks through the <b>cooling</b> <b>film</b> and almost reaches the surface. Similar image sequences for the angled holes show that the detached coolant jet becomes unstable downstream and pockets of cold air are ejected into the main flow. This intermittency may in part explain the observation that the measured turbulent heat flux is oriented towards the cold core, but deviates {{from the direction of the}} mean temperature gradient, thereby contradicting the simple gradient diffusion hypothesis commonly used in RANS simulations...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to examine slot film cooling effectiveness and the interaction between the <b>cooling</b> <b>film</b> and an incident planar shock wave in turbulent hypersonic flow. The experimental studies were conducted in the 48 -inch shock tunnel at Calspan at a freestream Mach number of close to 6. 4 and at a Reynolds number of 35 x 10 (exp 6) based on the length of the model at the injection point. The Mach 2. 3 planar wall jet was generated from 40 transverse nozzles (with heights of both 0. 080 inch and 0. 120 inch), producing a film that extended the full width of the model. The nozzles were operated at pressures and velocities close to matching the freestream, as well as at conditions where the nozzle flows were over- and under-expanded. A two-dimensional shock generator was used to generate oblique shocks that deflected the flow through total turnings of 11, 16, and 21 degrees; the flows impinged downstream of the nozzle exits. Detailed measurements of heat transfer and pressure were made both ahead and downstream of the injection station, with the greatest concentration of measurements in the regions of shock-wave/boundary layer interaction. The major objectives of these experimental studies were to explore the effectiveness of film cooling in the presence of regions of shock-wave/boundary layer interaction and, more specifically, to determine how boundary layer separation and the large recompression heating rates were modified by film cooling. Detailed distributions of heat transfer and pressure were obtained in the incident shock/wall-jet interaction region for a series of shock strengths and impingement positions for each of the two nozzle heights. Measurements were also made {{to examine the effects of}} nozzle lip thickness on cooling effectiveness. The major conclusion from these studies was that the effect of the <b>cooling</b> <b>film</b> could be readily dispersed by relatively weak incident shocks, so the peak heating in the recompression region was not significantly reduced by even the largest levels of film cooling. For the case studies in the absence of film cooling, the interaction regions were unseparated. However, adding film cooling resulted in regions of boundary layer separation induced in the film cooling layer [...] the size of which regions first increased and then decreased with increased film cooling. Surprisingly, the size of the separated regions and the magnitude of the recompression heating were not strongly influenced by the thickness of the <b>cooling</b> <b>film,</b> nor by the point of shock impingement relative to the exit plane of the nozzles. The lip thickness was found to have little effect on cooling effectiveness. Measurements with and in the absence of shock interaction were compared with the results of earlier experimental studies and correlated in terms of the major parameters controlling these flows...|$|E

When the radius of curvature is large, the boundary layer remains thin and the core is long.
