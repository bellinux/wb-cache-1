40|$|Research {{evidence}} suggests that motivation is an important consideration for online learners. Notably, existing research has frequently focused {{on the design of}} motivating online learning environments. Alternatively, motivation has been viewed as a collection of relatively stable personal characteristics of learners. In contrast, a contemporary view that acknowledges the complexity and dynamic interplay of factors underlying and influencing motivation to learn (e. g., Turner & Patrick, 2008) is adopted here. From this „person in context‟ perspective, this study investigates the nature of motivation to learn in online distance learning environments. The study explores how student motivation relates to online participation in these contexts. In addition, social and contextual factors that foster and undermine motivation are identified. The research design utilises a case study approach which focuses on learners in two separate online distance courses within the same university programme. The boundary for each <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> by one piece of assessed work and the associated activities within each course. Interview and questionnaire data, supported by archived online data and course resources, were collected. Analysis of the data were made using the three conceptual lenses of self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and the continuum of human motivation encompassed within this theoretical framework. Findings indicate that the motivation of learners in online environments was multidimensional. Intrinsic motivation and various types of extrinsic motivation were shown to co-exist. Complex relationships were also shown to exist between motivation and participation that were sensitive to situational influences. Multiple factors fostered the expression of high quality (i. e. more self-determined) motivation. Most prominent among these were the relevance of the learning activity, the provision of clear guidelines, and ongoing support and feedback from the teacher that was responsive to learners‟ needs. Supportive caring relationships were also important. A range of factors also undermined the motivation of learners; most notably high workload, assessment pressure, and the perception that the learning activity lacked relevance...|$|E

For the purposes of creating such mobile hydrogen production facilities, a small-scale hydrogen production system based on renewable energy sources needs to be developed and modelled. This system is to serve as a pilot plant for further development of a large scale mobile hydrogen production facility. This work focuses on the characterisation of sizing algorithms for renewable energy sources which can determine component configurations that satisfy power requirements of the system. Additionally, optimal sizing techniques must be developed which can output an optimal plant configuration to a user based on cost and efficiency. To this end, a literature <b>study</b> <b>was</b> done on all the components that make up a renewable energy hydrogen system.

Land authorities in the international context recognizes 3 D cadastres {{as a solution to}} efficiently manage these developments in complex cities. Although a 2 D cadastre does not efficiently register these developments, it is currently being used in many jurisdictions for registering land and property information. Limitations in analysis and presentation are considered as examples of such limitations. 3 D neighbourhood analysis by automatically finding 3 D spaces has become an issue of major interest in recent years. Whereas the neighbourhood analysis has been in the focus of research, the idea of 3 D neighbourhood analysis has rarely been addressed in 3 dimensional information systems (3 D GIS) analysis. In this paper, a novel approach for 3 D neighbourhood analysis has been proposed by recording spatial and descriptive information of the apartment units and easements.

40|$|Introduction: Part of risk based {{control is}} the {{prioritization}} of hazard-food combinations for monitoring food safety. There are currently many methods for ranking microbial hazards ranging from quantitative to qualitative methods, {{but there is}} hardly any information available for prioritizing chemical hazards. However, ranking chemical hazards may be performed along the same lines. Purpose: The aim of the current <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to develop a method for risk ranking of chemical food safety hazards using a structured and transparent approach. Methods: A semi-quantitative method was used, consisting of three steps. First, the <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined,</b> determining the food groups/products {{to be included in}} the study as well as the (group of) chemical hazards. Then, scores were attributed to severity and probability of the hazard. Finally, these scores were multiplied to determine which food-hazard combinations have the highest priority for monitoring. Results: The method was tested in a <b>case</b> <b>study</b> on antibiotics. Severity of the hazard was scored using the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) as well as a score on the severity of antimicrobial resistance. Probability of the hazard depended on the amount of product consumed and on the amount of antibiotics used in animals as well as evidence of residues found. Based on the scoring of these elements, antibiotics could be ranked for the products studied. The method showed that antibiotics most relevant for monitoring were product specific. Overall, nitrofurans were amongst the most important antibiotics to be included in monitoring. Significance: The developed method is a transparent and objective method for prioritizing chemical hazards. The method has been applied for antibiotics, but may be applicable for other hazard-food combinations as well...|$|R

According latest European policy and programs focus the research field is into retrofit and refurbishment of existing building. The building stock in industrial sector in Italy is rather obsolete, with low comfort conditions and high energy consumption. In Italy, only few studies deal with this topic to support assessments about average actual or potential energy saving quality of industrial buildings. This study, based on selected case-studies, aimed to establish general background and effective criteria for refurbishment actions. One “key factor” for energy saving in prefabricated industrial building is the thermal performance of the envelope (walls, roofs and windows), where reduction of energy consumption, for full air conditioning, {{is directly related to}} envelope thermal performance. Energy building design tools have been used, such as Ecotect Analysis, Heat 2. 0 and Wufi Pro, to investigate how different envelope assemblages affect the energy consumptions in industrial buildings with different size starting on common scenarios. Proceeding from statistic data of existing common buildings in Italy, and most diffused building elements, like concrete prefabricated wall panels etc, some general <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> and used to run energy simulations.

It  devises methodology for integrated landscape management as a basic tool for the implementation of its sustainable development in actual practice. The main objective of this <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> to <b>define</b> the socio-economic and environmental problems, to design measures to eliminate these problems and/or to prevent new problems arising. The ultimate goal is to achieve management practices which are in harmony with this area’s potential, to the greatest possible extent. Thus, basic principles are applied to landscape-ecological optimization of  landscape organisation, including nature protection, biodiversity, landscape stability and the protection of its natural resources. These involve its water and soil and the air/atmosphere in its forests. The protection of its cultural-historical resources is extremely important, including, inter alia, the protection of cultural monuments, protection of historical landscape structures and protection of the entire environmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Africa’s agriculture {{to climate change}} is complex. It is shaped by biophysical, economic, socio-cultural, geographical, ecological, institutional, technological and governance processes that interact in intricate ways, and can together reduce farmers’ adaptive capacity. Women farmers with few resources are particularly vulnerable. This working paper highlights the array of adaptation strategies that exist across Africa’s diverse farming systems and climatic conditions. These strategies can provide the impetus for transforming Africa’s agriculture. The <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> show how farmers are already adapting to climate change, what kinds of investment {{and how much is}} needed, and what local and national leadership is necessary to increase adoption and scale up. Successful <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> <b>are</b> broadly <b>defined</b> as those that identify, test and implement climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and institutions, counter the impacts of climate change and offer the highest returns on investments. These CSA practices offer the best chance of food security and many other benefits for the people of Africa in the long term...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} social pressure to train medical students {{with a level of}} competency sufficient to face clinical practice already {{at the end of their}} curriculum. The case-based learning (CBL) is an efficient teaching method to prepare students for clinical practice through the use of real or realistic clinical cases. In this regard, the Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) could be a good source of real patient stories that can be transformed into educative cases. In this paper a formal approach to generate Health <b>Case</b> <b>Studies</b> from EHR <b>is</b> <b>defined...</b>|$|R
