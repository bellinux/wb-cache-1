When the young men arrived at the first <b>camps,</b> they started a six-month experiment that would extend to six years.|$|E

5|$|A decree in April 1919 {{resulted}} {{in the establishment of}} concentration <b>camps,</b> which were entrusted to the Cheka, later administered by a new government agency, Gulag. By the end of 1920, 84 <b>camps</b> had been established across Soviet Russia, holding about 50,000 prisoners; by October 1923, this had grown to 315 <b>camps</b> and about 70,000 inmates. Those interned in the <b>camps</b> were used as slave labour. From July 1922, intellectuals deemed to be opposing the Bolshevik government were exiled to inhospitable regions or deported from Russia altogether; Lenin personally scrutinised the lists of those to be dealt with in this manner. In May 1922, Lenin issued a decree calling for the execution of anti-Bolshevik priests, causing between 14,000 and 20,000 deaths. The Russian Orthodox Church was worst affected; the government's anti-religious policies also impacted on Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, Jewish synagogues, and Islamic mosques.|$|E
5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal {{policies of}} the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and death marches, and those that had remained {{in the occupied territories}} were transported to extermination <b>camps.</b> From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration <b>camps</b> then moved to larger <b>camps</b> in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination <b>camps</b> where the survivors were killed. One of the two groups of workers numbered 2,500, but only a few survived.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933, nine <b>camps</b> and eight subcamps were set up in Boise National Forest, but the number of <b>camps</b> was reduced from 1934 until the program was closed in 1942. Work conducted by the CCC included fire suppression, fish habitat improvement, and construction of guard houses, fire lookouts, campgrounds, roads, and trails, among other facilities.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that most holiday <b>camps</b> in Britain had been damaged by troop occupation, and the situation was so bad that questions were raised in parliament.

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration <b>camps</b> in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination <b>camps</b> in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the <b>camps,</b> partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration <b>camps,</b> making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|By this time, on {{both the}} Eastern and Western Front, the {{activities}} of the SS were becoming clear to the Allies, as the concentration and extermination <b>camps</b> were being overrun.
