40|$|Abstract In this paper, an Instant Goal {{approach}} is proposed for collision-free boundary following of obstacles of arbitrary shape and globally <b>convergent</b> <b>path</b> planning in unknown en-vironments. Firstly, for effective knowledge representation and manipulation, a vector representation is presented, {{which not only}} saves much space but also conforms to the physical properties of range sensors. Secondly, the concept of instant goals is introduced enabling the robot to perform boundary following in a natural human-like manner, with additional measures taken {{to ensure that the}} robot is moving forward along the boundary, even if the obstacle is of arbitrary shape and disturbing obstacles are present. Collision checking is performed simultaneously and, when needed, collision avoidance is efciently incorporated in. Based on the approach of boundary following, a realistic sensor-based path planner with global convergence property is designed for the robot capable of acquiring discrete, and noisy range data. Realistic simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

One of the major issues is whether the industrialization paths in various countries have become divergent or convergent. In this paper, we attempt to compare South Korea and the United States. Research questions raised are: first, what are the main characteristics of the structural change in the market; and second, whether the evolving Korean industrial structure is converging toward the structure exhibited by advanced economies such as the United States? Because of active interventions of the Korean government in industrial development, we originally expected that the Korean Industrial Input/Output structures would differ from those of the United States. However, we found that Korean I/O structures are moving towards the U. S. structure as the Korean economy develops. We interpreted that the <b>convergent</b> <b>path</b> may have resulted from technological imperatives of inter-industry relations.

40|$|In a {{standard}} two-sector neoclassical model with distortions, capital mobility can render the steady state indeterminate, {{in the sense}} that there exist infinitely many <b>convergent</b> <b>paths.</b> In the closed economy with no international capital mobility, the utility function must be linear or close to it for indeterminacy to occur, while in the open economy the shape of the utility function makes no difference. The reason is that in the no mobility case changes in aggregate investment must be matched by changes in aggregate consumption, while in the case of full capital mobility they can simply be financed by borrowing abroad. The paper provides some solid theoretical underpinnings to the concerns that de-regulating the capital account may be destabilizing. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the global dynamics of financial integration by constructing a two-country model of overlapping generations {{in the presence}} of financial market frictions. The inversed U-shaped relation between the interest rate and the capital stock brought about by imperfect enforcement becomes the source of the destabilizing behavior of the world financial market. We characterize the global dynamics that allow us to answer when and how the globalization magnifies and lessens symmetry-breaking. We observe symmetry-breaking accompanied by continued capital flows from the poor to the rich when there are stable asymmetric steady states. However, when the stable symmetric steady state coexists with asymmetric ones, we observe either convergence or symmetry-breaking, depending on developing stages when financial integration occurs. There are threshold levels of wealth only above which financial integration leads to convergence. Even when there is the unique stable steady state, we observe the short-run symmetry-breaking accompanied by the endogenous reversal of capital flows. We have cases when early financial integration leads to symmetry-breaking, but late one attains convergence. Emerging market countries can go on the <b>convergent</b> <b>path</b> by delaying the timing of opening capital accounts until they have reached some threshold level of wealth. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} in image processing based on a vector image model. A major advantage of the model {{is that it allows}} vector operations to be performed on an image. An example of a vector operation is the computation of mechanical moments for detecting inhomogeneities in an object or equivalently edges in an image. A new edge operator derived from a vector image model yields an edge vector field analogous to the Hamiltonian gradient field of the image. The distinct feature of the edge vector field is that edge vectors form current loops encompassing the objects. This feature is exploited to develop a new boundary extraction algorithm based on particle motion in a force field. The edge vector field forces a particle to move along the edges while an orthogonal normalized Laplacian-gradient vec-tor field guarantees that the particle will not drift away from the edges. The object boundary can be obtained from the <b>convergent</b> <b>path</b> of the particle trajectory. Using a fine stepping factor, the extracted boundary can achieve subpixel accuracy. The proposed algorithm has major advantages over the conventional edge-detection, edge-thinning, and edge-linking techniques in that it effectively utilizes both direction and magnitude of edges. The algorithm is simple, robust and performs very well even on high curvature objects. Index Terms—Boundary extraction, edge operator, image mo-ment, particle motion, vector model. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{evolution}} of environmental performance {{in the context of}} the European Union (EU), over the period 1993 – 2010. The context is particularly relevant, due to the traditionally high concerns of the EU about these issues, which has triggered off several initiatives and regulations on environmental protection. In this setting, we conduct a two-stage analysis which develops environmental performance indicators in the first stage for each pair country-year, and evaluates its evolution in the second. More specifically, in the first stage we estimate specific efficiencies for three air-pollutants (CO 2 e, SO 2, NOx), along with an eco-efficiency indicator, for which we use the slack-free directional distance functions in the Data Envelopment Analysis framework (as opposed to the more extended intensity ratios), whereas in the second stage we propose to using a model of explicit distribution dynamics which takes into account how the entire distributions of these indicators evolve. Our results indicate that the dynamics underlying {{the evolution of}} the indicators analyzed are indeed remarkable. Although the eco-efficiency indicator has improved over the last two decades, it has been during the last decade when performance has shown a more <b>convergent</b> <b>path.</b> However, in the case of the more traditional indicators (CO 2 e, SO 2, NOx) the abatement opportunities are still remarkable, especially in the case of SO 2.

This paper addresses this issue by exploring the role of such non-fundamental factors in improving open-economy real business cycle (RBC) models.

40|$|LATDYN is a {{computer}} code for modeling the Large Angle Transient DYNamics of flexible articulating structures and mechanisms involving joints about which members rotate through large angles. LATDYN extends and brings together some of the aspects of Finite Element Structural Analysis, Multi-Body Dynamics, and Control System Analysis; three disciplines that have been historically separate. It combines significant portions of their distinct capabilities into one single analysis tool. The finite element formulation for flexible bodies in LATDYN extends the conventional finite element formulation by using a convected coordinate system for constructing the equation of motion. LATDYN's formulation allows for large displacements and rotations of finite elements subject to the restriction that deformations within each are small. Also, the finite element approach implemented in LATDYN provides a <b>convergent</b> <b>path</b> for checking solutions simply by increasing mesh density. For rigid bodies and joints LATDYN borrows extensively from methodology used in multi-body dynamics where rigid bodies may be defined and connected together through joints (hinges, ball, universal, sliders, etc.). Joints may be modeled either by constraints or by adding joint degrees of freedom. To eliminate error {{brought about by the}} separation of structural analysis and control analysis, LATDYN provides symbolic capabilities for modeling control systems which are integrated with the structural dynamic analysis itself. Its command language contains syntactical structures which perform symbolic operations which are also interfaced directly with the finite element structural model, bypassing the modal approximation. Thus, when the dynamic equations representing the structural model are integrated, the equations representing the control system are integrated along with them as a coupled system. This procedure also has the side benefit of enabling a dramatic simplification of the user interface for modeling control systems. Three FORTRAN computer programs, the LATDYN Program, the Preprocessor, and the Postprocessor, make up the collective LATDYN System. The Preprocessor translates user commands into a form which can be used while the LATDYN program provides the computational core. The Postprocessor allows the user to interactively plot and manage a database of LATDYN transient analysis results. It also includes special facilities for modeling control systems and for programming changes to the model which take place during analysis sequence. The documentation includes a Demonstration Problem Manual for the evaluation and verification of results and a Postprocessor guide. Because the program should be viewed as a byproduct of research on technology development, LATDYN's scope is limited. It does not have a wide library of finite elements, and 3 -D Graphics are not available. Nevertheless, it does have a measure of "user friendliness". The LATDYN program was developed {{over a period of several}} years and was implemented on a CDC NOS/VE & Convex Unix computer.

With {{the emergence of}} combinatorial chemistry and high-speed parallel synthesis, MCR chemistry has experienced a resurgence {{of interest in the}} past two decades. However, the application of MCRs is still largely limited by the relatively small number of such reactions. As part of our effort to synthesize new molecular frameworks by using the “single reactant replacement ” (SRR) strategy to evolve existing MCRs, we have explored the chemistry and reactivity of several α-substituted ketones (sulfonyloxy, acyloxy, azido, halo, hydroxyl and sulfonyl) in the two most utilized isonitrile-based multicomponent reactions, the Passerini and Ugi reactions. Guided by SRR, highly convergent routes to oxazoline, β-lactam, di-O-acylglyceramides, and other molecular frameworks were developed. In a relative rate study, each of the α-substituted ketones underwent Passerini condensation more rapidly than the parent ketone, which was consistent with the expected enhancement of carbonyl electrophilicity caused by electronegative substituents. Using the Passerini reaction, a multicomponent approach was developed leading to photolabile caged neurotransmitter, 7 -(N,N-diethylamino) - 4 -(hydroxymethyl) coumarin (DECM) caged gamma-aminobutyric acid.

We focus on the calculation of Green's functions {{under the condition that}} both the detector and the source are situated in the innermost layer, since the Green's functions are used to form the impedance matrix of the antenna.

40|$|Background: Many facultative {{bacterial}} pathogens {{have undergone}} extensive gene decay processes, possibly {{due to lack}} of selection pressure during evolutionary conversion from free-living to intracellular lifestyle. Shigella, the causative agents of human shigellosis, have arisen from different E. coli-like ancestors independently by <b>convergent</b> <b>paths.</b> As these bacteria all have lost large numbers of genes by mutation or deletion, they can be used as ideal models for systematically studying the process of gene function loss in different bacteria living under similar selection pressures. Methodologies/Principal Findings: We compared the sequenced Shigella genomes and re-defined decayed genes (pseudogenes plus deleted genes) in these bacteria. Altogether, 85 genes are commonly decayed in the five analyzed Shigella strains and 1456 genes are decayed in at least one Shigella strain. Genes coding for carbon utilization, cell motility, transporter or membrane proteins are prone to be inactivated. Decayed genes tend to concentrate in certain operons rather than distribute averagely across the whole genome. Genes in the decayed operon accumulated more non-synonymous mutations than the rest genes and meanwhile have lower expression levels. Conclusions: Different Shigella lineages underwent convergent gene decay processes, and inactivation of one gene would lead to a lesser selection pressure for the other genes in the same operon. The pool of superfluous genes for Shigella may contain at least two thousand genes and the gene decay processes may still continue in Shigella until a minimum genom...|$|R

Results : While initial diversity level and subsequent pace of change vary widely, every state has increased in diversity magnitude since 1980. A dramatic {{decline in the number}} of predominantly white states has been accompanied by the rise of states with multigroup structures that include Hispanics. These diverse states are concentrated along the coasts and across the southern tier of the country.

40|$|Canid brain {{evolution}} followed three independent, yet <b>convergent</b> <b>paths.</b> Each of {{the three}} canid sub-families (Hesperocyoninae, Borophaginae and Caninae) started with a simple brain, which gradually became more complicated as the cerebral cortex became larger and more fi ssured, the cerebellar hemi-spheres became larger and the vermis more twisted. The {{extent to which these}} evolutionary changes took place diff ers between the three canid subfamilies. Caninae, the living group, has the most ad-vanced external brain anatomy. This is related to the general tendency of the carnivore brain to become more convoluted through geological time. A parallel development of similar sulcal patt erns took place in independent lineages within the Canidae. As a result, some sulci appeared independently several times during canid evolution. The cruciate sulcus appeared four times; the Sylvian, endolateral, ectola-teral and ectosylvian sulci appeared three times. The skulls of species with short rostra have a more posteriorly placed posterior border of the palate than those of their close relatives with long rostra. This arrangement aff ects the position of the cribriform plate (posterior to which the olfactory bulbs are housed), which is also moved backwards and, as a result, the frontal lobes appear more massive. Some canid lineages evolved large size and certain craniodental characters (e. g., deep jaws and large canines), which allowed them to prey on large-bodied animals.

In the meanwhile, distinct proton ring distributions with peaks at energies of ∼ 10 keV, were also observed in L = 3. 2 - 4. 6 and L = 5. 0 - 5. 6. Using a subtracted bi-Maxwellian distribution to model the observed proton ring distribution, we perform three-dimensional ray tracing to investigate the instability, propagation, and spatial distribution of MS waves. Numerical results show that nightside MS waves are produced by proton ring distribution and grow rapidly from the source location L = 5. 6 to the location L = 5. 0 but remain nearly stable at locations L 3 ̆c 5. 0. Moreover, waves launched toward lower L shells with different initial azimuthal angles propagate across different MLT regions with divergent paths at first, then gradually turn back toward higher L shells and propagate across different MLT regions with <b>convergent</b> <b>paths.</b> The current results further reveal that MS waves are generated by a ring distribution of ∼ 10 keV proton and proton ring in one region can contribute to the MS wave power in another region.

The results were compared with predictions from Johansson's frontal-parallel principle. The principle was confirmed for dots moving on <b>convergent</b> <b>paths,</b> the results were inconclusive for straight paths, and the principle was disconfirmed for divergent paths. Key words: motion, depth, frontal-parallel principle, dots-configurations A person lives in the 3 -D world with senses that enable him to survive in such an environment. Sight is the sense that contributes the most to perception of the world. Although a 3 -D space is projected on the retina as a 2 -D picture, we have excellent depth perception since {{there are a number}} of cues for the 3 -D configuration. Cues for depth perception can be divided into two major groups: monocular (overlap, pictorial size, linear and atmospheric perspective, etc.) and binocular (disparity, convergence, etc.). In addition, depth can be perceived through motion as well. There are three possible situations where motion can be perceived: a) mobile object and static observer, b) mobile observer perceiving either mobile or immobile objects, and c) static observer observing static objects (e. g. motion aftereffect) (cf. Goldstein, 1980). Stimulus motion is sometimes essential for the emergence of a 3 -D percept. There are some stimulations that, when motionless, appear planar, but as soon as they start moving, the effect of depth emerges. This phenomenon was described by Wallach and O'Connel as the Kinetic Depth Effect (Wallach & O'Conell, 1953). Wallach projected static wire Figures on a screen and subjects experienced a 2 -...|$|R
