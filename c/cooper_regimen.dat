40|$|PurposeThe {{correlation}} between chemotherapy-induced toxicity and treatment outcome in cancer patients {{has not been}} thoroughly studied. Our aim was to evaluate whether leukopenia following primary chemotherapy may be predictive for response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Patients and MethodsThe records of 164 breast cancer patients administered primary chemotherapy between 1985 and 1995 were analysed. Most of the patients presented with locally advanced disease, however included were also patients with large operable tumours. Chemotherapy included {{one of the three}} combinations: CMF; modified <b>Cooper</b> <b>regimen</b> (CMFVP); 31 patients (19 %), anthracycline-based regimens (FAC and FEC); 16 patients (10 %) and 118 patients (71 %). ResultsThe objective response rate in the entire group was 58 %; 75 % in patients who developed grade 2 â€“ 3 leukopenia during induction chemotherapy, and 52 % in those who had no or grade 1 leukopenia (p < 0. 01, multivariate analysis). No other patient- or treatment-related factor including age, performance status, T stage, N stage, supraclavicular Iymph node involvement, inflammatory carcinoma or chemotherapy regimen correlated with response to chemotherapy. There was no {{correlation between}} treatment-induced leukopenia and overall survival. ConclusionsThese findings suggest a relationship between chemotherapy induced leukopenia and tumour response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The prognostic impact of leukopenia is negliglble...|$|E

Of 40 evaluable patients, complete response (CR) occurred in one patient, partial response (PR) in 20 (CR + PR 53 %), stable in eight, progression in 11 and five were unevaluable for response. The median relapse-free survival for responders was 25 weeks and median survival for all patients was 31 weeks. The mean dose intensity relative to the <b>Cooper</b> <b>regimen</b> fell from 1. 02 to 0. 6 within the first 4 weeks of treatment and the median dose intensity achieved for all patients on study was only 0. 52. Eighty-seven per cent of patients had treatment delays {{with a mean of}} 3. 9 delays per patient and 71 % had dose reductions. Neutropenia was the major toxicity with WHO grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (less than 1. 0 x 10 (9) l- 1) in 62 % of patients and three septic deaths while neutropenic. Dose-intense weekly CMFVP in this schedule cannot be delivered to previously untreated outpatients with advanced breast cancer...|$|E

This study suggests that dox confers advantages on all of these endpoints and that the size of such benefits needs {{to be taken into account}} when deciding whether to use dox. The primary aim of chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer is improvement in quality of life and in clinical trials the duration of successful palliation is assumed to be the time to treatment failure. Response rate, duration of response and toxicity are considered to be secondary endpoints which have traditionally been emphasised in the assessment of treatment value, but though linked to quality of life they are not reliable surrogate measures. Survival has been an endpoin...|$|R
