25|$|After the {{founding}} and development years {{as well as}} its conversion into a joint-stock company, VP Bank’s size and profitability grew significantly between 1963 and 1969. By 1969 its total assets stood at CHF 150 million, while revenues continued to rise during that period and <b>client</b> <b>assets</b> under management had increased from 19 million to 134 million Swiss francs. That growth was attributable to the fact that, since 1963, the bank was allowed to conduct all banking activities not subject to official rules and regulations. In December 1967, parliament abrogated the contingency of the banking concession on the founder and hence the related time limitation for VP Bank. In return, VP Bank committed to keeping at all times a minimum of 60 per cent of its voting rights and 51 per cent of its share capital legally and beneficially in the hands of Liechtenstein citizens.|$|E

25|$|The bank, {{which had}} {{established}} a number of foreign subsidiary companies {{in the years after}} 1988, published its first consolidated financial statements for the 1995 business year. Over the two decades of this boom phase, its total assets increased from 530 million (end-1979) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (end-2000), reported total net income rose from CHF 2.9 million to 197 million, and the workforce more than sextupled from 86 to 563. The main book turnover (single-sided) of the parent bank alone surged from 6.7 to 77.3 billion Swiss francs between 1980 and 1989. Business for VP Bank Group flourished {{in the second half of}} the 1990s: total Group assets grew from 6.3 billion (1995) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (2000) and gross income (revenues less operating expenses) from CHF 94 million to 254 million, whereas the commission and services business overtook the interest-differential business in 1997 as the major pillar of the income statement. In the years between 1996 and 2000, there was also a doubling of <b>client</b> <b>assets</b> under management from CHF 15 billion (end-1995) to 31 billion. Consolidated net income increased from 48 million (1995) to 197 million (2000) Swiss francs. As the significance of VP Bank Group’s foreign subsidiary companies grew, the proportion of investments attributable to them (assets held in non-CHF regions) increased as well, from 22 per cent (1996) to 40 per cent (2000) and ultimately to a high of 58.3 per cent at the end of 2005. As always, VP Bank placed those funds only with top-rated banks. The progressively internationalised bank redoubled its risk management efforts in the late 1990s and introduced an Asset and Liability Committee.|$|E

2500|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission is {{responsible}} for interpreting and enforcing Section 28(e). In Section 28(e) the definition of qualifying services is detailed and explicit, but Section 28(e) is not a rule {{it is just a}} [...] "safe harbor". The use of client commissions to pay for services which are not within the safe harbor of Section 28(e) is not within the safe harbor. A fiduciary who [...] "pays up" [...] in client commissions to receive non-qualifying services must be able to defend this practice under applicable law. [...] For pension plans subject to ERISA, a fiduciary can use <b>client</b> <b>assets</b> only for the exclusive benefit of clients and cannot use the <b>client</b> <b>assets</b> for the fiduciary's benefit. [...] Most public pension plans have similar prohibitions. [...] For registered investment companies (such as mutual funds), Section 17(e)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 generally prohibits a fund affiliate—such as the fund adviser—receiving compensation when purchasing or selling property for a registered fund. [...] As a result, for all practical purposes, brokerage arrangements for pension plans and registered investment companies must come within the Section 28(e) safe harbor or run afoul of these restrictions.|$|E
