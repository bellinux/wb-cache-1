Originally titled Hear No, See No, Speak No, Coulter spent three months in Los Angeles and New York recording 40 songs for the album. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled for release in November 2009, but was later pushed back to January 2010. However, following the two unsuccessful singles [...] "Don't Miss You" [...] and the title <b>track,</b> <b>Coulter</b> told her record label Shock Records to cancel the album's release. She explained, [...] "They label got a lukewarm reaction to the singles they chose to put out, so it made sense not to release the album. I said I'd prefer the album not to go out than {{to go out and}} fail. It's my reputation on the line." ...|$|R

[...] In 2010, Coulter took a break from her music career as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. In May 2011, Coulter ended her contract with Shock Records. In an interview with Auspop, she stated that [...] "Raining Diamonds" [...] was originally planned to be released through the label, but they [...] "fell into financial trouble." [...] As a result, Coulter asked to be released from her contract. She then signed with major label EMI. [...] "Raining Diamonds" [...] was released digitally and sent to Australian contemporary hit radio stations on 18 October 2011. A week later, it became the most added song to radio.|$|R
