5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} Source engine, the designers found that the game's scope exceeded their resources. Bloodlines has several styles of gameplay, requiring different interfaces, animations and artificial intelligence for stealth and melee combat, and first- or third-person capability. Compared to contemporary first-person shooters, with 10 to 20 animated character models, Bloodlines had over 150 <b>characters</b> <b>with</b> 3,000 unique animations, in {{addition to}} boss <b>characters,</b> <b>with</b> their own styles of movement. The designers underestimated {{the length of time}} required to develop and improve these systems. The game's scope suffered from content not being removed when necessary; other components would be endlessly refined without being finalized, preventing the developers from focusing on other parts of the game system. All content additionally required approval by White Wolf and Activision.|$|E
5|$|A furry {{convention}} (also furry con or fur con) is {{a formal}} gathering {{of members of}} the furry fandom — people who are interested in the concept of fictional non-human animal <b>characters</b> <b>with</b> human characteristics.

Originating in California, United States, during the mid-1980s, there are now over 40 annual furry conventions worldwide, mostly in North America and Europe. The largest furry convention is Anthrocon which is held each year in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|E

The first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in Beijing was in 1582; by 1638 the Beijing Gazette switched from using woodblock print to movable type printing.

The addition of this glyph did not catch on among his contemporaries, however, and no document outside of ones penned by Shelton makes use of it.
