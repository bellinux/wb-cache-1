5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
5|$|Red Cap Garage, {{sometimes}} abridged as Red <b>Cap,</b> <b>was</b> a gay bar and nightclub that {{operated in}} Portland, Oregon from 1987 to 2012.

5|$|During World War II, <b>CAP</b> <b>was</b> {{seen as a}} way to use America's {{civilian}} aviation {{resources to}} aid the war effort instead of grounding them. The organization assumed many missions including anti-submarine patrol and warfare, border patrols, and courier services. During World War II CAP's coastal patrol flew 24 million miles, found 173 enemy U-boats, attacked 57, hit 10 and sank two, dropping a total of 83 bombs and depth charges throughout the conflict. By the end of the war, 64 CAP members had lost their lives in the line of duty.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{tuition fee}} caps rose with the Higher Education Act 2004. Under the Act, {{universities}} in England {{could begin to}} charge variable fees of up to £3000 a year for students enrolling on courses as from the academic year of 2006-07 or later. This was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006-07 and introduced in Wales in 2007-08. In 2009-10 the cap rose to £3225 a year {{to take account of}} inflation. Following the Browne Review in 2010, the <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> controversially raised to £9,000 a year, sparking large student protests in London.|$|E

5|$|The CAP National History {{project and}} National Museum most {{recognize}} CTWG for {{their involvement in}} coastal patrol missions during World War II, shortly after the creation of CAP. Since <b>CAP</b> <b>was</b> created {{in a time of}} crisis, when Brigadier General Billy Mitchell was warning the country of impending attack and less than a week before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, coastal patrol and submarine searching became the prime missions of CAP.|$|E
5|$|The RTV-A-2 Hiroc (high-altitude rocket) was the United States' {{first attempt}} at an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM). The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and leftover funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The design included several innovations; the gimballed engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the nose <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> separable. All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> pulled down, {{and while}} he was praying the trap was pulled. Death was not instantaneous. Louis Riel's pulse ceased four minutes after the trap-door fell and during that time the rope around his neck slowly strangled and choked him to death. The body was to have been interred inside the gallows' enclosure, and the grave was commenced, but an order came from the Lieutenant-Governor to hand the body over to Sheriff Chapleau which was {{accordingly}} done that night.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Hipper {{was ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine from the Blohm & Voss {{shipyard}} in Hamburg. Her keel was laid on 6 July 1935, under construction number 246. The ship was launched on 6 February 1937, and was completed on 29 April 1939, {{the day she was}} commissioned into the German fleet. The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine, Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder, who had been Franz von Hipper's chief of staff during World War I, gave the christening speech and his wife Erika Raeder performed the christening. As built, the ship had a straight stem, though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow. A raked funnel <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> also installed.|$|E
5|$|CAP {{is active}} in {{disaster}} relief operations, especially {{in areas such as}} Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana that are frequently struck by hurricanes as well as Oklahoma and Texas which are frequented by large, damaging tornadoes. CAP aircrews and ground personnel provide transportation for cargo and officials, aerial imagery to aid emergency managers in assessing damage, and donations of personnel and equipment to local, state and federal disaster relief organizations during times of need. In 2004, several hurricanes hit the southeast coast of the United States, with Florida being the worst damaged; <b>CAP</b> <b>was</b> instrumental in providing help to affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Gunn made six full {{international}} appearances for Scotland, conceding 10 goals. He was {{a member}} of the squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, but played in none of Scotland's three matches at the tournament, as he was third-choice goalkeeper behind Jim Leighton and Andy Goram. He made his Scotland debut in a pre-tournament friendly match against Egypt, but was at fault for two Egyptian goals, resulting in a 3–1 defeat for Scotland. The embarrassment was made worse by the fact that his parents were watching. Gunn made four appearances for Scotland in 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. His last <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> as a second-half substitute in a 3–1 friendly defeat by the Netherlands in May 1994.|$|E
5000|$|For females: a red swim <b>cap</b> must <b>be</b> worn {{under the}} goalie cap, a team's dark swim <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> no longer {{acceptable}} {{as it is}} hard to distinguish a goalie from field players if official <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> off.|$|R
50|$|New <b>cap</b> rules <b>were</b> also enacted. A goalie <b>cap</b> {{must now}} <b>be</b> in {{quarters}} alternating red/dark for home and red/white for away. The goalie must be number 1,or 13.

5|$|Headgear {{was either}} the SS M43 fez {{which was to}} be worn by all ranks, while German {{officers}} had the option to wear the mountain cap (Bergmütze). The fez was chosen by Himmler because it had been worn by the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry regiments of the Austro-Hungarian army from 1894 to 1918, {{as well as by the}} Austro-Hungarian Albanian Legion from 1916 to 1918. There were two versions of the fez: a field gray model to be worn in combat and while on duty and a red model for parades, marching exercises and while off duty. Both the fez and mountain cap bore the death's head and eagle of the SS. The mountain <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> also adorned with an Edelweiss flower patch, worn on the left side of the cap.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{an island}} {{was found in}} {{the central part of the}} lake. Then, in January 2006, the {{discovery}} of two nearby smaller lakes under the ice <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> published; they are named 90 Degrees East and Sovetskaya. It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial lakes may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling glaciologists propose that many of the subglacial lakes of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of water through the solid ice.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 May, both sides spotted each other {{about the same time}} and began {{launching}} their aircraft about 09:00. The Japanese carriers launched a total of 18 Zeros, 33 D3As and 18 B5Ns. Yorktown was the first American carrier to launch her aircraft and Lexington began launching hers seven minutes later. These totaled 9 Wildcats, 15 Dauntlesses and 12 Devastators. Yorktowns dive bombers disabled Shōkakus flight deck with two hits and Lexingtons aircraft were only able to further damage her with another bomb hit. None of the torpedo bombers from either carrier hit anything. The Japanese <b>CAP</b> <b>was</b> effective and shot down 3 Wildcats and 2 Dauntlesses for the loss of 2 Zeros.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the cyclase-associated protein family (<b>CAP)</b> <b>is</b> {{a family}} of highly conserved actin-binding proteins present {{in a wide range}} of organisms including yeast, flies, plants, and mammals. <b>CAPs</b> <b>are</b> multifunctional proteins that contain several structural domains. <b>CAP</b> <b>is</b> involved in species-specific signalling pathways. In Drosophila, CAP functions in Hedgehog-mediated eye development and in establishing oocyte polarity. In Dictyostelium discoideum (social amoeba), <b>CAP</b> <b>is</b> involved in microfilament reorganisation near the plasma membrane in a PIP2-regulated manner and is required to perpetuate the cAMP relay signal to organise fruitbody formation. In plants, <b>CAP</b> <b>is</b> involved in plant signalling pathways required for co-ordinated organ expansion. In yeast, <b>CAP</b> <b>is</b> involved in adenylate cyclase activation, as well as in vesicle trafficking and endocytosis. In both yeast and mammals, <b>CAPs</b> appear to <b>be</b> involved in recycling G-actin monomers from ADF/cofilins for subsequent rounds of filament assembly. In mammals, there <b>are</b> two different <b>CAPs</b> (CAP1 and CAP2) that share 64% amino acid identity.|$|R

5|$|Shooting of {{the film}} began on May 13, 1957, with the newly created choreography. Presley's {{characteristic}} hairstyle and sideburns were covered with a wig and makeup for the scenes in musical number and those set in the jail. During the performance, one of Presley's dental caps fell out and became lodged in his lung. He {{was taken to the}} Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, where he spent the night after the <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> removed. Shooting was resumed the next day. Throughout the film, Presley mimed the songs, which had been previously recorded in the studio and were added to the finished scenes.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol was {{conceived}} {{in the late}} 1930s by aviation advocate Gill Robb Wilson, who foresaw general aviation's potential to supplement America's military operations. With the help of New York Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, {{in his capacity as}} then-Director of the Office of Civilian Defense, <b>CAP</b> <b>was</b> created with , signed by LaGuardia on 1 December 1941 and published 8 December 1941. The Civil Air Patrol had 90 days to prove themselves to Congress. Major General John F. Curry was appointed as the first national commander. Texas oilman David Harold Byrd was a co-founder of CAP.|$|E
5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress cap that was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design <b>cap</b> <b>was</b> sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> kidney shaped. The <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> white when it {{is young}} and when it gets older, it turns ochre. The flesh of the <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> white and can be broken easily. The gills are pale brown and soft. [...] The <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> flabby and has brown spores. [...] The upper layer of the <b>cap</b> <b>is</b> elastic and can be {{stretched}} slightly at the margin. The spores are short elliptic and smooth. The spore print is snuff brown. The stalk is rudimentary or lacking. Crepidotus crocophyllus looks similar to this species and is sometimes confused with it. The species resemble a globe in moist weather. The species has a relative large size compared to other species in the genus Crepidotus. The fungus Hypomyces tremellicola is a parasite that deforms this species' cap.|$|R
