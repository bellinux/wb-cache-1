2500|$|The Brights held {{in their}} house <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> <b>essays</b> <b>written</b> by John Stuart Mill, and young Helen Bright became {{especially}} interested in Mill's advocacy of the [...] "enfranchisement of women"—the idea {{that the right to}} vote should be extended to women. In 1861 she wrote to her step-cousin Agnes McLaren, [...] "how absurd to talk of repression and taxation going hand in hand, and all the while excluding wholly the one half of the population from the franchise." [...] In 1866 as Helen Bright she signed the [...] "Ladies' Petition" [...] on suffrage being circulated by Elizabeth Garrett and Emily Davies, as did her former teacher Hannah Wallis. The petition with its 1,499 signatures was presented by Mill to the House of Commons in June 1866. Later that year, Helen Bright married William Stephens Clark (1839–1925) of Street, Somerset. William Clark was a liberal Quaker, the owner of C. & J. Clark the shoe makers, and member of a family friendly to the idea of women's rights: his sister and niece had also signed the suffrage petition.|$|R
