5|$|Maryland and Delaware plan to {{continue}} to upgrade US 113 to introduce freeway elements and access control to improve service on the U.S. Highway. MDSHA has a Phase 5 in its US 113 divided highway project {{for the construction of}} an interchange between US113 and MD12 in Snow Hill. As of 2007, the interchange was planned to be a dumbbell interchange, a variation on the diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad. The work would include adding service roads to improve access among US 113, MD 12, Washington Street, and Brick Kiln Road. , Phase 5 was stalled in the design stage with no estimated completion date. The state has long-term plans to establish partial <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> on US 113 between Pocomoke City and {{the south end of the}} Snow Hill bypass. Once that project is complete, the only remaining stretch of US 113 in Maryland without access controls will be from Hayes Landing Road to the south end of the Berlin bypass.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{economic}} performance of the application of the policy for negotiating discounts on drug products and agreements on the <b>controlled</b> <b>access</b> <b>of</b> patients in Bulgaria. Methods: The methodology involves comparison of the amounts of public spending on medicines in two periods – during the course of the analyzed drug policies (January 2007 – June 2009), and the period in which negotiations on the price of medicines and programs for the <b>controlled</b> <b>access</b> <b>of</b> the patients was discontinued (July 2009 – December 2012). Results: In Bulgaria, the government did not apply methods for controlling public expenditure on medicines bargaining price concessions from manufacturers and implementing agreements on <b>controlled</b> <b>access</b> <b>of</b> patients after June 2009. This led to an annual increase in the expenditures on drug products for home treatment (on average, 17 % for the period 2009 - 2012).
