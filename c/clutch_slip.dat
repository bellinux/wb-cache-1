Pitt quickly closed in on Geoghegan, setting another lap record of 2:03.7, before passing him for the lead on lap 5.

50|$|During a shift, {{power is}} lost in the clutch (for {{automatic}} transmissions the clutches are usually internal) due to <b>clutch</b> <b>slip</b> {{and the difference between}} the current and final output shaft speeds. This makes a quick shift more desirable when towing, to reduce clutch wear and heat developed in the transmission. Balancing this, too quick a shift increases peak mechanical loads on the transmission, engine and drive train; an instant shift would cause impact loads and lead to early mechanical failure, as well as an unpleasant driving experience.|$|E
50|$|Many {{believed}} that Fitzpatrick had nursed home the Torana {{after it had}} suffered a broken axle, and indeed this was reported {{as the reason for}} the car almost failing to finish. Fitzpatrick later set the record straight when he revealed that a leaking oil seal (which was the cause of the smoke) was making the <b>clutch</b> <b>slip</b> badly.

5000|$|Between these {{extremes}} of engagement and disengagement the <b>clutch</b> <b>slips</b> to varying degrees. When slipping it still transmits torque despite {{the difference in}} speeds between the engine crankshaft and the transmission input. Because this torque is transmitted by means of friction rather than direct mechanical contact, considerable power is wasted as heat (which is dissipated by the <b>clutch).</b> Properly applied, <b>slip</b> allows the vehicle to be started from a standstill, {{and when it is}} already moving, allows the engine rotation to gradually adjust to a newly selected gear ratio.|$|R
5000|$|Reverse: The car reverses as in an {{automatic}} car. To reverse, depress brake pedal, {{and change the}} gear to R. Gradually lift off the brake pedal to allow the car to creep backwards. On a down-sloping incline, the creep function, simulated using the <b>slipping</b> <b>clutch,</b> {{is not sufficient to}} prevent the car from rolling forward. In this case, the car must not be held still using the accelerator pedal, as the excessive <b>clutch</b> <b>slipping</b> will lead to clutch damage. Handbrake should be instead applied, and the accelerator pedal should be depress slightly.|$|R
50|$|Above {{a certain}} engine speed - when the bike is {{properly}} in motion, so the gearbox input shaft is also rotating quickly and so allowing {{the engine to}} accelerate further by way of <b>clutch</b> <b>slip</b> - the outward pressure of the weighted friction plates is sufficient that the clutch will enter full lock-up, {{the same as a}} conventional plate-clutch with a fully released lever or pedal. After this, there is no <b>clutch</b> <b>slip,</b> and the engine is locked to and providing all of its available power to the transmission; engine rpm is now dependent on the road speed and the current gear ratio (under either user control in a semi-auto, or reliant on road speed (and sometimes load/throttle position) in a CVT setup). In a typical CVT, the gear ratio will be chosen so the engine can reach and maintain its maximum-power speed as soon as possible (or at least, when at full throttle, in a partially load-dependent system), but in a semi-auto the rider is responsible for this choice, and they can ride around all day in top gear (or first) if they so prefer. Also, when the engine is turning fast enough to lock the clutch, it will stay fully engaged until the RPMs fall below that critical point again, even if the throttle is fully released. Below the lock-up point, partially or fully releasing the throttle can lead to the RPM falling off rapidly, thanks to the feedback loop of lower engine speed meaning less friction pressure. This toggle-like mode of operation can lead to certain characteristic centrifugal-clutch-automatic behaviour, such as being able to freewheel rapidly downhill from a standstill, with engine braking only being triggered by turning the throttle briefly (and not then cancellable without braking to quite a slow, gear-dependent pace), and lockup triggering at a lower speed with full versus minimal throttle.|$|E
50|$|Wrap-spring clutches: These have a helical spring, {{typically}} wound with square-cross-section wire. These {{were developed}} in the late 19th and early 20th century. In simple form the spring is fastened at {{one end to the}} driven member; its other end is unattached. The spring fits closely around a cylindrical driving member. If the driving member rotates in the direction that would unwind the spring the spring expands minutely and slips although with some drag. Because of this, spring clutches must typically be lubricated with light oil. Rotating the driving member the other way makes the spring wrap itself tightly around the driving surface and the clutch locks up very quickly. The torque required to make a spring <b>clutch</b> <b>slip</b> grows exponentially with the number of turns in the spring, obeying the capstan equation.|$|E
50|$|When {{trying out}} this {{relatively}} expensive 5-seater tourer the correspondent of The Times reported {{he thought the}} car's design had much to recommend it but could be improved. A four-door five-seat car it is comfortable but the front cushion tends to obstruct the front door. The seat is adjustable. He noted the test car had already travelled 8,000 miles. Its high-speed type engine with only four bearings, he said, is remarkably smooth, it runs sweetly up to 4,000 rpm yet picks up easily in top from almost a standstill. Over 55 mph increased speed takes time to build. The indirect gears were noisy. Except for some <b>clutch</b> <b>slip</b> when climbing hills under a heavy load all controls worked well and smoothly. He also reported that the suspension let the car bounce too much suggesting slacker tyres and softer shock absorbers might be a useful improvement.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to develop a {{calculation}} method for slipping parameters of friction <b>clutches</b> (of the <b>slipping</b> work and time) in tractor gearboxes at various gear overlaps and for different friction clutches installation on the shafts. The work has used theoretical and experimental research methods: the former were based on methods of analytical mechanics and motion theory of wheeled and tracked vehicles, while the latter assumed testing full-sized prototypes of friction clutches and friction clutches in gearboxes. The work has brought the following results: a universal acceleration diagram has been offered for a tractor unit at shifting gears with different overlaps, valid for any relation between the gearing time and friction clutch slipping; based on the mathematical models of acceleration of the tractor unit, we have developed a generalized calculation method for parameters of the friction <b>clutch</b> <b>slipping</b> (of the slipping work and time), when shifting gears with different overlaps, at starting off a tractor unit and at bench tests of friction clutches and friction clutches in gearboxes. The scientific novelty {{of the work is}} in development of the following: - A theoretical acceleration diagram of a tractor unit with gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps; - A mathematical acceleration model of a tractor unit and friction <b>clutch</b> <b>slipping</b> in the gearbox at gear shifting with different overlaps, and when starting a tractor unit off; - A generalized calculation method for parameters of the friction <b>clutch</b> <b>slipping</b> (of the slipping work and time), when shifting gears in the gearbox with different overlaps, when starting a tractor unit off and at bench tests of friction clutches and friction clutches in the gearbox. Conclusions: The developed universal acceleration mathematical model for a tractor unit at gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps, and of its acceleration at starting off, allows defining – at the designing stage of gearboxes with friction clutches – their work and slipping time, and the acceleration time of a tractor unit, which may lead to designing reliable friction clutches and gearboxes with friction clutches. The proposed calculation method of the work of the friction <b>clutch</b> <b>slipping</b> in the gearbox at bench tests allows transferring test results into the operation loading mode, and, therefore, to perform fine-tuning of gearboxes with friction clutches at bench tests. </p...|$|R

Grosjean then speared into the back of Pérez and became airborne, crashing heavily into Alonso, missing Alonso's head by a few inches. Grosjean came to rest at the outside wall. Hamilton crashed into Kobayashi as well as Alonso after Grosjean's heavy impact. Pérez lost his rear wing from Grosjean's hit and touched Maldonado when the accident happened, making Maldonado spin. Only the latter two emerged from the crash, Kobayashi with a substantial hole in the side of his car. Kobayashi who had started on the front row for Sauber, pitted after the accident and resumed in last place. Once Maldonado recovered from his spin he hit Timo Glock after the safety car restart.

The 1983 Honda Interceptor was given high praise by industry sources: [...] "The handling is a treat, the power more than adequate and the appearance, the Interceptor's primary thrust, spells out its job: To boldly go where only race bikes have gone before.". “On tight, twisty mountain roads the Honda does everything you ask of it; flick it from side to side, up hills or down, with the brakes on or off, and it responds willingly, instantly and precisely. The Interceptor's front bank was moved from the Magna's 23.5 degrees to 30 degrees to tuck the Comstar 16-inch front wheel closer to the engine which improved the handling now the bike had a 58.9 inch wheelbase. The front and rear wheels were controlled by fully adjustable Showa suspension. The front suspension was equipped with 39mm forks with the TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control) anti-dive system to stabilize the ride on the track and on the road. The rear suspension used a sand cast swing-arm. The [...] engine had an [...] boost from the Magna's V4 because of a newly designed air-box which forced cold air onto the cylinder heads. Along with the air-box, the engine was liquid-cooled with two radiators. The Interceptor was equipped with a [...] "Slipper Clutch" [...] which made the <b>clutch</b> <b>slip</b> on hard braking to stop the rear tire from bouncing.

This system can provide a continuous change of propeller revolution even in a lower revolution zone of prime mover. However, it hardy make the decelerating condition, because the <b>slipping</b> <b>clutch</b> itself can not make the negative torque. In this paper, the authors have designed a push-pull control system using two <b>slipping</b> <b>clutches</b> {{in order to improve}} the above disadvantage of the conventional <b>slipping</b> <b>clutch.</b> For the evaluation of this system, the whole propulsion system including prime mover, clutches, propeller and ship are numerically simulated using the precise mathematical model described here. From several accelerating and decelerating simulations, the following results are pointed out. 1) FPP’s revolution can be easily changed in the slipping zone by using this system, although the main engine is governed constant revolution. 2) Astern and ahead maneuvering is also performed by this system. 3) The mathematical model for this simulation including engine, clutch, propeller and ship is useful for the design and evaluation of the whole propulsion system. As the result, this push-pull controlled <b>slipping</b> <b>clutch</b> system will be very useful for a marine propulsion system. 第 6 回舶用機関国際シンポジウム ISME (International Symposium on Marine Engineering) Tokyo 2000, 場所：日本都市センター会館, 会期： 10 月 23 日- 27...|$|R

50|$|The clutch {{is located}} between {{the engine and}} the gearbox, as {{disengaging}} it is usually required to change gear. Although the gearbox does not stop rotating during a gear change, there is no torque transmitted through it, thus less friction between gears and their engagement dogs. The output shaft of the gearbox is permanently connected to the final drive, then the wheels, and so both always rotate together, at a fixed speed ratio. With the clutch disengaged, the gearbox input shaft is free to change its speed as the internal ratio is changed. Any resulting difference in speed between the engine and gearbox is evened out as the <b>clutch</b> <b>slips</b> slightly during re-engagement.|$|R

The clutch was envisaged to have the possibility to disengage the vacuum pump in diesel engine vehicles, in order to increase the overall vehicle efficiency. A large set of test was carried out following different proto- cols in order to obtain a detailed characterization of the clutch. Results showed how, due to the characteristics of MR fluids and to the complex mechanism of torque transmission, the torque characteristics (both the yield torque and the torque-slip behaviour) is function of the relative speed between the primary and secondary clutch groups and also function of the dissipated energy during the <b>clutch</b> <b>slip</b> and of the rest time between consecutive slippages. The data acquired during all tests were used to train a neural network with five input elements and one output element.

40|$|The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) {{requested}} a two-axis pan tilt mechanism be designed, built, and tested for shipboard deployment of a sensor payload. Of paramount consideration to this design was the robustness {{of the system}} {{in the face of}} wave impact loading from "green water" taken over the superstructure of naval vessels. Central to providing such a system is the prevention of drive train failures given wave or other forms of impact loading. Through the course of work completed for his Master's thesis, Nathan M. Mills brought the design effort through initial bench testing. Several failures were experienced due to minor design flaws and mechanical component selection. One component selection that required improvement was the torque limiting <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> used in both the pan and tilt drive sections. The unit selected induced positioning errors resulting from backlash inherent to its design. The backlash encountered is unavoidable when using the type of <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> selected, as it is with many of the <b>slip</b> <b>clutches</b> available to the machine designer. <b>Slip</b> <b>clutches</b> are available that have limited backlash, but the majority of these are friction based and have setpoints that either do not have tight tolerances or change as the component is cycled. The goal of the present work was to design a <b>slip</b> <b>clutch</b> that maintains its setpoint and minimizes backlash to allow for its shipboard use in the NRL sponsored pan tilt system.

5000|$|How {{it works}} [...] - Multiple disk {{clutches}} operate via an electrical actuation but transmit torque mechanically. When current is applied through the clutch coil, the coil becomes an electromagnet and produces magnetic lines of flux. These lines of flux are transferred {{through the small}} air gap between {{the field and the}} rotor. The rotor portion of the clutch becomes magnetized and sets up a magnetic loop, which attracts both the armature and friction disks. The attraction of the armature compresses (squeezes) the friction disks, transferring the torque from the in inner driver to the out disks. The output disks are connected to a gear, coupling, or pulley via drive cup. The <b>clutch</b> <b>slips</b> until the input and output RPMs are matched. This happens relatively quickly typically (0.2 - 2 sec).|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{integrated}} powertrain control for gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions is developed. First, a detailed model of an automotive powertrain featuring a twin clutch transmission is developed in Matlab/Simulink®. This model includes detailed friction {{models for the}} twin clutch that enable {{an investigation into the}} effects of different friction materials on the performance of the gearshift controller. The transmission model also includes detailed models of the synchronisers and thus allows a simulation of synchroniser-to-synchroniser shifts. A simplified phenomenological model, derived from a more complex non-linear model, is employed to model the hydraulic actuation of clutches and synchroniser. The thesis finds that the dependency of the friction coefficient on the sliding speed has an important influence on the gearshift quality and the performance of gearshift controller, while the absolute level of the friction coefficient is less important. Based on this powertrain model the key problems of gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions were identified and a control that overcomes these problems was developed. The first stage was to devise a gearshift control algorithm that handles single clutch-to-clutch shifts without a oneway (freewheeler-, overrunning-) clutch. This basic gearshift control algorithm featured a control of <b>clutch</b> <b>slip</b> for the engine torque transfer and a control of engine speed through engine torque manipulation (plus clutch pressure manipulation for downshifts). In a second stage, an optional transmission output torque control was developed that could be integrated in the basic control. The thesis shows that these control strategies are superior, in terms of shift quality, to conventional gearshift controls as used on planetary-type transmissions and are also robust against variations in the powertrain parameters (including friction coefficient) and sensor noise. The control strategies developed for single clutch-to-clutch shifts were extended to handle double and other multiple gearshifts that take place in the same transmission half. The thesis also investigates the other main part of gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions, the gear pre-selection. The thesis shows that, on power-on gearshifts, the torque reactions at the transmission output due to the gear pre-selection with conventional hydraulically actuated synchronisers can be effectively compensated for by a simple manipulation of engine torque.

With increased complexities in heavy duty machines today, up-time is considered {{an important aspect of}} the construction equipment business because it reduces warranty and service cost, while increasing sales and overall customer satisfaction. Therefore, a substantial amount of research is directed towards the development of intelligent machines which are capable of automatically monitoring the health of different components in the machine. Heavy duty construction equipment is often equipped with automatic transmissions, with multiple disc wet clutches, transferring torque from the engine to the gearbox enabling automatic gear ratio changes. The wet clutches in Volvo Construction Equipment vehicles may be considered as a crucial component of the driveline and failure may result in costly downtime. The frictional characteristics of wet clutches are crucial for the ultimate performance because they define <b>clutch</b> <b>slip</b> time during engagement. Furthermore, a wet clutch is considered to have failed when it can no longer transmit the desired torque. The level of torque transfer in wet clutches is controlled by the generated friction. Hence, clutch slippage is the result of diminishing frictional characteristics of wet clutches. Accurately monitoring slippage in wet clutches provides an indication of the health of the clutch material. However, many of the factors that influence the frictional characteristics of the wet clutch are only possible to measure in a test rig and not in actual machines. In this thesis the gap in condition monitoring of automatic transmission clutchesin an actual machine is addressed. A methodology for monitoring the health of the clutch material on-board the machine using the available CAN-bus signals via an on-board Data Stream Management System (DSMS) has been developed. The feature extraction methods utilized in the condition monitoring are based on Moving Average Square Value Filtering (MASVF) and a measure of the fourth order statistical properties of the CAN-bus signals implemented as continuous queries over data streams. Results show that the feature extraction methods provide an indication of clutch slippage deviations. This thesis also includes an investigation of clutch slippage detection from driveline vibrations based on spectrogram and spectral Kurtosis methods.
