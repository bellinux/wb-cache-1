Conical mills are available in Ex- execution {{with a variety of}} sieves and impellers.

The mill head is dismounted from a lifter for easy cleaning.|$|E
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and Quality by Design (QbD) concepts by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the pharmaceutical industry is thriving towards improved process understanding. Subsequently, the pharmaceutical industry shifted {{the focus on the}} implementation of new technologies for real-time process control of various unit operations. Enhanced process understanding will result in a robust process and eventually enable quality by design into the product. Inline with this PAT concept of improving process understanding and enhancing manufacturing efficiency, the objectives of this research work were to introduce and implement novel technologies of dynamic image analysis (DIA). The novel DIA approaches would allow for real-time (on-line) particle size and shape monitoring in a pharmaceutical dry milling unit operation and subsequently flowability characterization (at-line) of the milled material for pharmaceutical powders and granules. For the first objective we employed a pilot-scale <b>conical</b> <b>mill</b> and investigated two DIA sensors, one as on-line mode and the other as in-line mode, for real-time particle size and shape monitoring. We selected different pharmaceutical excipients and placebo granulates, spanning a wide range of particle characteristics, for milling. Various mill parameters such as feeder speed, impeller speed, and screen sizes were considered. The particle size distribution results obtained from both the on-line and in-line modes were compared with a commercially available DIA instrument, which served as an at-line reference. Additionally, the data was also compared with the traditional sieve analysis. The results from the on-line, in-line and at-line DIA measurement modes showed similar particle size distributions for the various materials studied. However, few differences among the different DIA modes were observed that were mainly attributed to sampling and particle dispersion. A high correlation of 0. 975 (p< 0. 001) was observed between on-line d 50 and at-line d 50 when compared to 0. 917 (p< 0. 001) between in-line d 50 and at-line d 50. Finally, the on-line sensor was chosen as it provided robust results. A novel concept of time evolving size and shape analysis (TESSA) was successfully proposed {{for the first time in}} dry milling. The TESSA approach was found to be useful in detecting changes in milling conditions including the successful detection of a damaged screen when intentionally introduced in the milling process. In the second objective we introduced a modern instrument, which combines powder avalanching with DIA to enable a comprehensive understanding of the flow behaviour of pharmaceutical powder formulations. The flow characterization of such formulations is essential as they can pose a challenge for upstream solid dosage manufacturing such as tabletting (die filling) and capsulation (weight variation). A commercial powder avalanching instrument existed earlier, but it lacked dynamic image analysis and further provided very few avalanching parameters such as mean time to avalanche and scatter values. The novel instrument used in this study provides image analysis of the motion of a powder inside a rotating drum and results in several parameters associated with powder avalanching such as avalanche time, avalanche angle, and avalanche power in addition to several other parameters. We initially tested the suitability of this modern instrument for flow characterization of binary blends, comprising of a coarse excipient and fine drug particles, and further introduced the concept of critical flow concentrations (CFCs). At least three drug concentrations were identified for which the flow behaviour, of the binary blends, essentially changed. Accordingly, different flow regions were identified, which were explained on the basis of changed particle packing configurations. A theoretical model successfully provided a first estimate of the initial two CFCs. The novel avalanche testing instrument used in this work provided complementary information to conventional flowability methodologies such as flow through an orifice. A thorough assessment of pharmaceutical blends is needed to avoid CFCs in view of a robust formulation development and hence with respect to building quality into the design of the solid dosage forms. Later, we used the powder avalanching instrument for characterizing the flow behaviour of the milled materials produced from the <b>conical</b> <b>mill.</b> In the third objective we implemented the on-line DIA sensor in the <b>conical</b> <b>mill</b> and further tested the feasibility of the avalanching instrument as a potential at-line PAT tool for powder flow characterization. We conducted a response surface design in combination with robustness testing (Taguchi design). Both of these designs employed the <b>conical</b> <b>mill,</b> together with the on-line DIA sensor and the powder avalanching instrument. The mill process parameters, namely impeller speed and screen sizes significantly affected the particle size distribution and flow rate of the milled placebo granules. Feeder speed did not affect the particle size, but displayed a statistically significant influence on the flow responses. Robustness testing was able to capture the effect of assigned noise factors (different placebo lots and temperature conditions) on the responses and showed clear differences between different lots of the placebo granulates in addition to temperature-dependent changes in flow behaviour. Eventually, the powder avalanching instrument was proved to be a successful at-line PAT tool. The dynamic image analysis PAT tools investigated in this research work provided a novel source of understanding the particle characteristics (size and shape) and flow behaviour of pharmaceutical powders and dry milled granules. Adequate characterization of particle size as well as shape and flowability is essential for upstream solid dosage form manufacturing. Thus, on-line particle size monitoring and at-line flowability characterization using the presented novel DIA techniques together, as complementary process analytical tools, provides valuable information for industrial characterization of pharmaceutical dry particulate systems, namely powders and granules...|$|E

50|$|In {{the centre}} of the village is North Leigh windmill. It is a tower mill built in 1833 by Joseph Shepherd, who was a baker as well as a miller. It had four common sails and a <b>conical</b> cap. The <b>mill</b> was {{restored}} in 1881 and 1933, but during the Second World War the cap was removed in 1940 to make an observation post. This led the interior of the building to fall into decay, and in the 1980s West Oxfordshire District Council tried to compel the owner to repair it. The mill still lacks sails, but it now has a new cap to make it weatherproof.|$|R

During the primary transformation in wood industry, logs are faced with <b>conical</b> rough <b>milling</b> cutters commonly named slabber or canter heads. Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Numerical simulation of chip fragmentation can allow some useful chip thickness prediction. In this complex situation in wood cutting, the utilization of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is relevant. In this method, solids are modeled with spherical discrete elements linked by cohesive bonds. However the Discrete Element Method requires a previous calibration step with simple mechanical loading. For example the nature and the mechanical properties of the cohesive bonds must be determined. After an analysis of the different mechanical loadings in green wood milling, a complete study of green wood compression is carried out. This experimental study covers the strain rates range of 10 - 3 to 103 s- 1 using a hydraulic compression machine and the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar technique. Wood specimens at different moisture content states are compressed longitudinally. This study enables us to observe the viscoelastic and hygroscopic behaviour of wood. The experimental and qualitative simulation results show that elastic brittle beams are not well adapted to be used in quantitative green wood milling simulations.

Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Thus, this study aims at better understanding and predicting chips production in wood milling. The different mechanisms of their formation are studied through orthogonal cutting experiments at high cutting speed for beech and Douglas fir. Within these conditions, ejection of free water inside wood can be observed during fragmentation, particularly on beech. As previously seen in quasi-static experiments, chip thickness {{is proportional to the}} nominal cut thickness. Moreover, the grain orientation has a great influence on the cutting mechanisms, so as the nominal cut and the grows rings widths. This chip fragmentation study finally allows the improvement of the cutting conditions in rough milling. In order to optimize machine design as well as cutting geometry, a geometrical model of a generic slabber head is developed. This model allows the study of the effective cutting kinematics, the log-cutting edges interactions and the effective wood grain direction during cutting. This paper describes the great influence of the carriage position on cutting conditions. The results obtained here can be directly used by milling machine manufacturers.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The wear of {{telescopic}} crowns is {{a common}} problem often reducing the patient's satisfaction with the denture and resulting in a renewal of the denture. The study aims to compare the wear behavior of conical crowns using electroplated copings (group E) with standard telescopic crowns with cast female parts (group C). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 10 <b>conical</b> crowns were <b>milled</b> for each group of a cast gold alloy. The specimen of group E had a conicity of 2 º. The cast secondary crowns of group C had a 0 º design. The electroplated coping was established by direct electroforming. An apparatus accomplishing 10, 000 wear cycles performed the wear test. The retentive forces and the correlating distance during insertion and separation were measured. The wear test was separated in a start phase, an initial wear phase and the long term wear period. The retention force value and the force-distance integral of the first 0. 33 mm of each cycle were calculated. RESULTS: The retentive forces were significantly higher for group E and the integrals were significantly lower for this group except the integral at cycle 10, 000. The changes of retention force and integral {{did not differ significantly}} between both groups in all phases. The change of the integrals as well as the integral at the particular cycles showed higher interquartile distances for group C. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study the tested conical crowns showed clinically acceptable retentive properties. The values reached a range comparable to retentive elements tested in recent literature. The values of group C showed higher ranges. The force measured for group E was significantly higher than for group C but the integrals showed an opposite tendency. The results indicate that an exclusive analysis of the force is not sufficient as the integral is not equivalent to the force although it describes the retentive property of the system in a better way than the force over a distance is described. Both systems seem to be suitable for clinical practice...|$|R
