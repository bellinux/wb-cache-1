40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with strength analysis of multi-clip joints. Such structures enable visible growth of the carrying capacity and make them elements easily assembled by the clamping jaws and a single-clamp press. Each joint exerts an appreciable in uence upon the safety level of the whole structure. A numerical analysis was performed to assess the eect of clearance between a sleeve and rope upon the joint quality. Phenome-na emerging in the area between the clips were analysed as well. Some strength tests related {{to the process of}} drawing the wire rope out of the sleeve were also investigated. Changes in the stiness of the <b>clamping</b> <b>sleeve</b> were analysed in view of the in uence of the aforementioned fac-tors upon the carrying capacity of joints and the sleeve material eort. Experimental investigations were conducted as well aiming at the deter-mination of the smallest possible number of clips or the eective length of joints necessary for carrying the loads higher than the admissible load of the wire rope...|$|E

The <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> presses the crimping tong containing aluminium can to crimp {{the body with}} head. Due to the continuous action of the <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> to the crimping tong the inner surface of the <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> get corroded. The <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> is replaced when crimping appearance fails to meet compliance. In this Research an experimental work relating to improve the mechanical properties of locally available low carbon steel material by heat treatment process {{have been carried out}} to replace the spare parts of <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> which is collected from foreign countries. The mechanical properties have been studied on before and after heat treatment. After heat treatment, it is found that hardness, impact and compressive strength of heat treated specimen has been developed drastically as compared to that of before heat treatment. Finally, the properties of improved material has been determined and used to the machine functional area to check the performance of the <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve.</b> After consecutive operation of the machine it can be concluded that the improved <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> meets the user requirement with compliance of smooth crimping quality and locally available low carbon steel material can be used for the preparation of <b>clamp</b> <b>sleeve</b> spare parts of crimping machine for pharmaceutical industry using the proper heat treatment process which might be helpful to save huge cost and time rather than collected from foreign countries...|$|R
40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} is {{an attractive}} production method for complex-shaped NiTi parts. Pre-alloyed NiTi powders are preferred as a starting material for achieving an essentially one-phase homogeneous structure. This work describes in detail how complex-shaped components with fully expressed shape memory properties can be produced from pre-alloyed NiTi powders by means of P/M technologies. The metal injection moulding (MIM) technique was chosen for near-net-shape forming. Simple-shaped components were also produced by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) as a reference. Considering {{the basic principles of}} the shape memory effect, this paper provides {{a detailed description of the}} process technology factors to be considered for obtaining components with reproducible mechanical properties and fully expressed shape memory properties. Three case studies illustrate the potential of powder metallurgy for processing shape memory alloys: a biomedical foot staple for stabilizing toe fractures, <b>clamping</b> <b>sleeves</b> for domestic engineering and highly porous NiTi components for implants and damping applications...|$|R

50|$|An {{advantage}} of flexible rubber fittings {{is that they}} can accommodate small misalignments, and can be flexed slightly for installation in tight locations. If necessary, the joints can be disassembled later, and the fittings and pipe may be reconfigured; however, it is often not customary to re-use the <b>clamps</b> and rubber <b>sleeves.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding Process is a {{solid state}} joining process {{manufacturing}} excellent mechanical properties of the joint. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the influence of the tool wear on selected quality criteria such as the lap shear strength and the surface quality of the joint as well as the required electric current that is an indicator for the process forces and torques. Based on the result of 22 duration tests with 3, 500 welding points the sleeve can be identified as the most stressed tool part with a maximum wear of 0. 3 mm. The tool wear depends on the gap size between the tool parts that are loaded with plasticized work piece material. The volume of the material influences the required torque of the main spindle and the tool temperature. At reaching 70 % to 80 % of the maximum tool wear the process temperature rapidly increases. Another result is the independence of lap shear strength of the joints on tool wear. But within the duration tests the mechanical characteristics were increased (about 7, 000 N before and 8, 300 N after one duration test in average) by achieving larger temperatures. The surface quality is slightly influenced by the tool wear. The height of the surrounding burr that occurs at the boundary of <b>clamping</b> ring and <b>sleeve</b> is 0. 25 mm for a worn out tool. Furthermore key indicators that were developed in past studies are validated to be useful for a condition monitoring approach by showing significant changes for increasing tool wear...|$|R
