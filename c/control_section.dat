The computation section performed 64-bit scalar, floating point and vector arithmetic.

5|$|The War Department envisaged {{that the}} Manhattan Project would be {{superseded}} by a statutory authority. Legislation {{to create it}} was drafted by two War Department lawyers, Kenneth C. Royall and William L. Marbury. Their draft bill ran into strong opposition, particularly from the influential Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian <b>control.</b> <b>Section</b> 10 assigned the patent for any invention related to atomic energy to the commission.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{was first}} designated in 1956 {{as a business}} route of US112. At that time, US112 and M-60 were transferred to a bypass south of Niles. When US112 was decommissioned in January 1962, Bus. US112 was redesignated Bus. US12 to match the new US12 designation. In 1986, US33 was truncated in Michigan to end at US12. Bus. US12 was rerouted in Niles to replace US33 through town; Bus. US31 was added a year later when the signage was updated in the area. In 1998, US33 was removed from Michigan completely. At this time, M-51 was extended over former US33 and replaced part of the Bus. US31 designation in Niles. On March 5, 2010, the segment of Bus. US12 between Bus. US31 and M-51 {{was turned over to}} local control. In April 2010 the Bus. US12 designation was retired when an extended M-139 replaced it from the local <b>control</b> <b>section</b> southwestward prior to maps and signage being changed. The concurrent segment along M-51 became M-51 only.|$|E

40|$|Clay {{content of}} Peorian loess and of <b>control</b> <b>sections</b> in soils formed from this loess was {{determined}} along transects perpendicular to loess sources in southeastern Nebraska. Maps showing geographic location of areas of equal clay {{content in the}} loess and in the control sec· tions were constructed to show relationships. In the parent loess, clay content and distance from source were significantly linear in relationship. In coarser·textured loess relatively near the source, clay content of <b>control</b> <b>sections</b> of soils formed in the loess were also linear. In loess more distant from the source, little relationship between clay content in <b>control</b> <b>sections</b> and distance of parent loess from source was evident. The overall relationship between clay content of <b>control</b> <b>sections</b> and distance was quadratic. Apparently in more clayey loess farther from the source, pedogenic factors other than parent-material clay content dominates the reasons why clay content in loessial soils differs. The maps are useful in development of soil surveys within the study area of southeastern Nebraska...|$|R

25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Wilson was called up to a full-time position in the Army and resigned from her position at The Alfred Hospital. She served {{on the staff of}} the Director-General of Medical Services, Major General Rupert Downes, in Army Headquarters as the Army's matron-in-chief. She became a member of the Second AIF in September 1940, and served in the Middle East as the matron-in-chief of its nursing service. Wilson remained in this position until May 1941, when she was forced to return to Australia due to health problems. She arrived back in Australia in August and left the AIF the next month. Annie Sage replaced her as the AIF's matron-in-chief. Wilson was subsequently attached to the Australian Red Cross Society and oversaw an expansion of its activities. She was appointed the executive officer of the Department of Manpower Directorate (Victoria)'s nursing <b>control</b> <b>section</b> on 15September 1943. In this role she controlled the staffing of all hospitals in the state of Victoria, and had a personal staff of four trained nurses and eleven office workers.|$|E
