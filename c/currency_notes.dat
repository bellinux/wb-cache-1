5|$|The Portrait Series of <b>currency</b> <b>notes</b> is {{the fourth}} and current set of notes to be issued for {{circulation}} in Singapore. It was first introduced on 9 September 1999 by the Board of Commissioners of Currency Singapore (BCCS), whose role was since {{taken over by the}} Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) post-merger.|$|E
5|$|By 1883, most coins on {{the islands}} were American, due to the close {{economic}} integration between islands and mainland. The laws of Hawaii reflected this, making gold American coins legal tender for an unlimited amount and American silver coins legal tender to $50. In 1879, the kingdom issued its first <b>currency</b> <b>notes,</b> technically certificates of deposit, redeemable in silver coin and with denominations ranging from $10 to $500.|$|E

5|$|The Standard Chartered {{series was}} a series of {{emergency}} bearer cheques issued by the Standard Chartered Bank (hence the title on the top of these cheques) and the Cargill Cotton Group. They were authorised by the Reserve Bank as legitimate issues and were valid for six months from the date of issue, the first <b>currency</b> <b>notes</b> of the Zimbabwean dollar to have a time limit. They carry the signature of the company's finance director Priscilla Mutenbwa and operations director Stephen Newton-Howes.|$|E
5|$|The three-cent nickel {{piece was}} very popular when it entered {{circulation}} in mid-1865. More convenient than the larger two-cent bronze piece, it largely replaced that coin, starting the two-cent {{on its way}} to decreased popularity and abolition in 1873. The hard alloy, though, caused high levels of die breakage. Between 1865 and 1876, some 17 million three-cent pieces were used by the government to redeem the three-cent fractional <b>currency</b> <b>notes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2003 {{bearer cheque}} series {{was a series}} of {{emergency}} <b>currency</b> <b>notes</b> of the first dollar which were in circulation between 15 September 2003 and the withdrawal of the first dollar on 21 August 2006. The $5000, $10000 and $20000 denominations were issued from 15 September 2003, whilst the $50000 and $100000 denominations, depicting Victoria Falls on reverse, were introduced on 1 October 2005. Following the redenomination of August 2006, bearer cheques that were originally scheduled to expire on 31 December 2006 were demonetised early.|$|E

5|$|After the {{partition}} of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in East Bengal, the non-contiguous {{eastern part of the}} Dominion of Pakistan, made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan's 69 million people. The Dominion of Pakistan's government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan. In 1947, a key resolution at a national education summit in Karachi advocated Urdu as the sole state language, and its exclusive use in the media and in schools. Opposition and protests immediately arose. Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of Abul Kashem, the secretary of Tamaddun Majlish, a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal. However, the Pakistan Public Service Commission removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from <b>currency</b> <b>notes</b> and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Public outrage spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the First Issue (postage currency) was {{directly}} based on Spinner’s original handmade examples. Some varieties even had perforated stamp-like edge. While not actually legal tender, postage currency could be exchanged for United States Notes in $5 lots and were receivable in payment of all dues to the United States, up to $5. Subsequent issues would no longer include images of stamps and were referred to as Fractional Currency. Despite the July 1862 legislation, postage stamps remained a form of currency until postage currency gained momentum {{in the spring of}} 1863. In 1863, Secretary Chase asked for a new fractional currency that was harder to counterfeit than the postage currency. The new fractional <b>currency</b> <b>notes</b> were different from the 1862 postage currency issues. They were more colorful with printing on the reverse, and several anti-counterfeiting measures were employed: experimental paper, adding surcharges, overprints, blue end paper, silk fibers, and watermarks to name a few. Fractional currency shields which had single sided specimens were sold to banks to provide a standard for comparison for detecting counterfeits. Postage and fractional currency remained in use until 1876, when Congress authorized the minting of fractional silver coins to redeem the outstanding fractional currency.|$|E

25|$|In 1904, the <b>Currency</b> <b>Notes</b> Law was passed, “constituting a Board of Commissioners {{to issue}} notes called <b>currency</b> <b>notes</b> {{for the value}} of 10 shillings each,” {{although}} no such notes were issued at that time. This law was amended by Law 17 of 1918 which authorized “the issue of <b>currency</b> <b>notes</b> for such denominations as may be approved.” The Commissioners of Currency issued the first notes under these laws on 15 March 1920, in the denominations of 2 shillings 6 pence, 5 shillings, and 10 shillings, with each note carrying the inscription that they were “Issued under the authority of Law 27 of 1904 & Law 17 of 1918.” Only these three smaller denominations were issued by the Board of Commissioners; 1- and 5-pound notes were issued by the chartered banks operating in Jamaica. In 1940, the government bank began producing £1 and £5 notes.|$|E

25|$|In September 1987, Burma's {{de facto}} ruler U Ne Win {{suddenly}} cancelled certain <b>currency</b> <b>notes,</b> which caused a great down-turn in the economy. The {{main reason for}} the cancellation of these notes was superstition on U Ne Win's part, as he considered the number nine his lucky number—he only allowed 45 and 90 kyat notes, because these were divisible by nine. Burma's admittance to Least Developed Country status by the UN the following December highlighted its economic bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|Before the crisis, Burma {{had been}} {{ruled by the}} repressive and {{isolated}} regime of General Ne Win since 1962. The country had a national debt of $3.5 billion and currency reserves of between $20 million and $35 million, with debt service ratios standing at half of the national budget. In November 1985, students gathered and boycotted the government's decision to withdraw Burmese local <b>currency</b> <b>notes.</b> Economic problems coupled with counter-insurgency required continuous involvement in the international market.|$|E
