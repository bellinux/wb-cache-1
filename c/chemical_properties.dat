40|$|In this study, {{we provide}} a {{strategy}} to control morphology {{as well as physical}} and <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> of mesoporous composites materials (MCM). SEM, TEM, XRD and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were used to characterize the morphology and physical and chemical performance of MCM. Low surfactant concentration results in fabrication microspheres with 5  gm in average diameter and smooth surface. Long ultrasonic irradiation results displayed the same size microspheres that were made up of smaller particles. Longer ultrasonic irradiation brought about more diversified morphology. In the synthesis system, the introduction of a variety of inorganic salts leads to great changes in morphology and physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> of mesoporous composites materials.

5|$|Initial {{predictions}} of the <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves {{like the rest of}} the group 4 elements.|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic and <b>chemical</b> {{transport}} <b>properties</b> {{are required}} to predict movement of water and chemicals through soils. Field methods used to determine such properties are often hampered by extensive time and energy constraints. The objectives {{of this study are}} to present an experimental setup and a procedure for rapid and simultaneous measurements of hydraulic and <b>chemical</b> transport <b>properties</b> of a field soil. Hydraulic properties are saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary length. <b>Chemical</b> transport <b>properties</b> are immobile water fraction and mass transfer coefficient. A total of 15 sites of a field soil are evaluated for hydraulic and <b>chemical</b> transport <b>properties.</b> The setup allows simultaneous measurements to be made at multiple locations with minimum labor requirements.

5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and <b>chemical</b> <b>properties,</b> the elements {{can be classified}} into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E
5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{discovered}} {{alkali metals}} occur in nature as their compounds: {{in order of}} abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), {{which is likely to}} be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> of superheavy elements; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> from its lighter homologues.|$|E

40|$|Process for {{preparing}} {{the production of}} structured metal layers on substrate surfaces comprises: (a) applying protein-containing layers on the substrate surface, where the protein forms under the action of light a vectoral slope of a physical or <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> between two compartments formed by the layer and the change of physical or <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> is effected in one or both compartments so that metal ions or compounds are reduced to the metal or are accessible for a later reaction; and (b) partially irradiating the substrate.

5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups.

Neutrinos stream throughout the Universe but rarely interact with normal matter.|$|E
40|$|Here we have {{developed}} cellulosic materials (cotton fabric or paper) with differential superhydrophobicity and hydrophilicity {{on each side of}} the surfaces by coating with polyvinylidene fluoride and fluorinated silane molecules using electro-spraying. Such materials are advantageous in various textile and medical applications. Analysis of surface morphology indicated that, not only surface <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> and roughness, but also particle diameter affects surface superhydrophobicity. Smaller particle diameter enhances superhydrophobicity, if the surface roughness and surface <b>chemical</b> <b>property</b> remain constant. By controlling these three factors, superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of more than 160 ° can be achieved at one side of a thin cellulosic material while maintaining the hydrophilicity (contact angle is 0 °) at the opposite side.

5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested {{that this could be}} explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>properties</b> of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.|$|E
