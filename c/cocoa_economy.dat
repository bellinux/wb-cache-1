50|$|The 19th {{century was}} marked by {{instability}} for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born Juan José Flores, who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as Vicente Rocafuerte; José Joaquín de Olmedo; José María Urbina; Diego Noboa; Pedro José de Arteta; Manuel de Ascásubi; and Flores's own son, Antonio Flores Jijón, among others. The conservative Gabriel Garcia Moreno unified {{the country in the}} 1860s {{with the support of the}} Roman Catholic Church.

The second part desribes the cocoa as an agricultural product and as a trade commodity. The third part continues with analysis of economic development and economic structure of Ivory Coast, from which follows the enormous economic importance of cocoa for this poor country. In conclusion of my thesis the social and economical aspects of the cocoa production are mentionned: child labour, low incomes of cocoa farmers, knowledge of inhabitants or Fair Trade...|$|R

40|$|After {{the events}} which have prevailed in Cote d'lvpire during the 1988 / 89 cocoa campaign, the {{president}} of the National Assembly stated: 'Manipulation of the market economy prepares the end of the trade of unprocessed products. Tomorrow, only raw materials which are consumed in raw state will be sold in that state. The unequal exchange of finished products against raw materials tell us, as well as, to our partners, investors and friends, to mobilize all human, financiand technical resources in order to realise these transforinations'. (translated from JeUne Afrique Economique, June 1989, p. 133 - 162) This statement shows the crucial dilemma in which most developing countries evolve. As many producing countries of raw materials, the cocoa producing countries (App. I) face the same dilemma. The weight of <b>cocoa</b> in the <b>economy</b> of some countries, make such a product vital for their development. The establishment of a performing industry based upon the systematic processing of some raw materials and of cocoa inparticular,is yet to come. That is why, the marketing or commercialization of cocoa beans and products, being an important aspect of the cocoa industry and, cocoa as all raw materials, being subject to the law of supply and demand, the marketing should be performed i n a reasonable manner but aggressively and efficiently. The marketing of cocoa beans and products and of their transport, offer one alternative for the producing countries to indirectly participate in the market economy. However, their effective involvement in the market (Futures) is alo wished. The f i r s t chapter deals with some specific features of cocoa cultivation and with the main producing and consuming countries of cocoa beans and its derived products. Followed in the second chapter by the market for cocoa beans and products, and the market structure of the major consuming countries. The marketing systems i n place in some countries are briefly tackled. As {{it is not possible to}} review the major cocoa producing countries so as to show the distance covered by each of them in the developing process of their individual cocoa industry, the third chapter considers the case of Cote d'lvoire and the problem faced by t h i s country. The fourth chapter deals with the world cocoa market and analyzed some of the reasons of the slump and puts forward some recommendations. Finally, the fifth chapter looks at the transport inland and at sea, also at some aspects of the different modes of transport used (container or conventional) and the damages which can occur during the transportation chain. I would like to remind readers that most examples are based on the West Africa-North Europe trade but with special references to Cote d'lvoire, Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany...|$|R

As a last resort, some programs will help farmers to access pest control products such as biocides {{as an alternative to the}} harmful pesticides being used. Other programs promote proper irrigation, composting, suitable soil management, and intercropping, meaning planting other trees and fruit crops in the surrounding land of the Cacao trees. [...] Some farmers will burn old, fermented pods and place them back on the soil as a form of composting and fertilizer. [...] To stop the process of deforestation, it is suggested that farmers replant on their current land while using the practices previously mentioned.|$|E
50|$|The Golden Harvest {{is one of}} Amado's works set in the cocoa-growing {{areas of}} the Thai state of Bahia and {{concerning}} the society that grew up around this crop. Others are Cacau (1933), The Violent Land (1943), Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon (1958), and Showdown (1984). It is essentially a continuation of The Violent Land but in the 1930s, when the novel is set, the <b>cocoa</b> <b>economy</b> is already showing signs of civilization, with greater respect for the law and commercial contracts. On the strength of cocoa, the town of Ilhéus {{in the state of}} Bahia has been transformed into a major city. Whilst in The Violent Land disputes were resolved with a bullet, in The Golden Harvest they are now behind closed office doors. Nevertheless, although Ilhéus is experiencing rapid urban and social reform, some of the old ways endure alongside modernization, including arduous toil, exploitation, greed and violence. The novel tells of the boom when cocoa was more valuable than gold and the subsequent bust and the effect of both boom and bust on the people of Ilheus.|$|E
50|$|The {{pests and}} {{diseases}} to which cacao is subject, along with climate change, mean that new varieties {{will be needed}} to respond to these challenges. Breeders rely on the genetic diversity conserved in field genebanks to create new varieties, because cacao has recalcitrant seeds that cannot be stored in a conventional genebank. In an effort to improve the diversity available to breeders, and ensure the future of the field genebanks, experts have drawn up A Global Strategy for the Conservation and Use of Cacao Genetic Resources, as the Foundation for a Sustainable <b>Cocoa</b> <b>Economy.</b> The strategy has been adopted by the cacao producers and their clients, and seeks to improve the characterization of cacao diversity, the sustainability and diversity of the cacao collections, the usefulness of the collections, and to ease access to better information about the conserved material. Some natural areas of cacao diversity are protected by various forms of conservation, for example national parks. However, a recent study of genetic diversity and predicted climates suggests that many of those protected areas will no longer be suitable for cacao by 2050. It also identifies an area around Iquitos in Peru that will remain suitable for cacao and that is home to considerable genetic diversity, and recommends that this area be considered for protection.|$|E

30|$|This {{research}} is {{a contribution to}} the economic literature on the merits of cocoa production. It specifically targets the case study of the <b>cocoa</b> <b>economy</b> of Cote d‘Ivoire, the leading world producer of cocoa. The study will augment existing knowledge on the determinants of insufficient production of the cocoa industry in Cote d’Ivoire. Given the ongoing discussion on the factors which decrease production globally, this conducted research aims at bridging the existing global supply gap, so as to enable Cote d’Ivoire to take advantage of future price hikes to increase its revenue. It looks forward to giving a broader perspective on the advantage of such research.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{looks at}} the degree of state {{involvement}} and the modes of market governance in the cocoa value chains of Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, and Ecuador, in order to document the institutional blending of private and public economic governance. Liberalization in the cocoa sectors transformed the role of public policy but did not eradicate the public sector. The state continued to play a mediating role, which is an important lesson for contemporary sustainability initiatives in tropical commodities, which rely exclusively on private governance arrangements, such as standards. Finding ways to connect different governance structures and policy measures situated in specific historical conditions may enhance sustainability, rather than opting for either a fully privatized and deregulated sector or complete public control over the <b>cocoa</b> <b>economy...</b>|$|E

For this reason, {{is divided into two}} parts. The first is dedicated to Ezequiel’s perspectives on S. Tomé e Príncipe. This study presents the ideas developed by the author on the <b>cocoa</b> <b>economy</b> of the islands, but also the characteristics of the society; the population of the islands, their activity, livings conditions on the territory. These aspects lead the author on the characterization of a development model based on decentralization and financial management but also the adoption of a transport network to improve the economic performance of the islands and reduce the cost of cocoa produced in S. Tomé. These ideas were followed by a structural change in agriculture, industrial and social development in the province, aimed to produt diverfication, development of industries and increase people’s skills. The second part examines the economic and social concepts developed by Ezequiel de Campos after the established the republican regime in Portugal. In particular, analyses the contributions of the author to the Portuguese agrarian restructuring, the development of the industry, energy problems, the implementation of land transport network and equipping the country’s ports. It also explains the impact of First World War in the author’s thought.

40|$|The {{chemical}} control is the widely control method applied in Cameroon for pests and diseases {{by all the}} cocoa producers without technical suitable assistance by the State as before 1980 'S. However, {{it is known that}} farmers have less knowledge on the good pesticides use for the control of a specific pest. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide insight in current pesticide use in the cocoa sector in Cameroon. A stratified sampling scheme was used. A total of 251 cocoa farmers, 20 post-harvest cocoa traders and 37 chemical retailers were randomly selected and interviewed. The study showed that 35 different chemicals were marketed in Cameroon for use in cocoa: 4 herbicides, 11 fungicides and 20 insecticides. Of 251 farmers consulted, 96. 8 % said that they use pesticides on their farms while 3. 2 % did not. Fungicides were used most often by farmers 61. 8 %) followed by insecticides (38. 2 %). Eight active ingredients although, officially banned, were still being used on cocoa farms. Over 77 % of farmers do not respect the official spray recommendations for chemicals. Moreover, 64 % do not respect recommended doses. Two main pesticide-supply-pathways exist in Cameroon: a legal and illegal supply chain, which provides 51 % of pesticides to cocoa farmers, resulting in an estimated loss of value added tax for the Cameroonian government of about 550 000 to 2. 4 million Euros per year. These results suggest that improved pests and diseases control by the State and raising farmer awareness about pesticide use in cocoa could greatly attribute to more sustainable <b>cocoa</b> <b>economy</b> in Cameroon.
