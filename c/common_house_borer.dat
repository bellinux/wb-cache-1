40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{experiment}} was to establish how exposure to a constant magnetic field of 98 mT affects behavior in terms of viability and larval mass of the old <b>house</b> <b>borer</b> (Hylotrupes bajulus L.). It is demonstrated that larvae exposed to this magnetic field show statistically significant higher viability, {{as well as a}} tendency of mass increase in comparison with the control group. These results {{can be attributed to the}} modulatory effect of the employed external magnetic field on metabolism and neurohumoral regulation in the insects...|$|R
