40|$|During high {{pressure}} die casting (HPDC) of aluminium alloys {{there is a tendency}} for the molten alloy to react with the steel die, <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> and inserts. This occurrence within the HPDC industry is referred to as ‘soldering’. This is of concern to {{high pressure}} die casters because of down-time, due to regular removal of the soldering, reduced die life and degradation of casting quality. The reaction between the tool steel (usually H 13) and the molten aluminium involves inter-diffusion and the formation of intermetallic phases. To remove this problem the possibility exists of applying a surface treatment to act as a barrier between molten alloy and the die. During the course of this research project several surface treatments were investigated namely PVD (TiN, CrN, TiCN), Duplex PVD (TiN, CrN, TiCN) and Gas Nitriding for soldering prevention during HPDC with aluminium alloy, and their results are compared to uncoated <b>core</b> <b>pins.</b> The coating selection criterion was based on commercial availability of surface treatments in Australia and suitability of coating properties with H 13 tool steel used in molten aluminium alloy (ADC- 12). One of the most important findings made during these experiments was the distinction and characterization of build-up on the surface of PVD coatings. It was found that build-up did not necessarily represent formation of intermetallics (soldering) for PVD surface engineered <b>core</b> <b>pins.</b> It addition build-up did not grow in thickness as previously thought and that build-up was influenced by high fluid flow and temperature during HPDC. The characterization of build-up was a fundamental important step in prolonging the performance of PVD surface engineered <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> in HPDC. The experimental results were confirmed by conducting in-plant HPDC trials at Nissan Casting Plant Pty Ltd Australia. The results demonstrate that PVD coatings can improve the resistance to soldering compared to conventional nitrided and un-coated <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> and the need for polishing was eliminated. Knowledge gained during this research program was transferred to NCAP and a guideline for using PVD coatings in HPDC was prepared.

This occurrence within the high pressure die casting (HPDC) industry is referred to as ‘soldering’. It is of concern to high-pressure die casters because of down-time due to the regular removal of the soldered layer and its detrimental affect on die life and casting quality. In this investigation, several physical vapour deposited (PVD) coatings, namely, TiN, CrN and TiCN, were evaluated for their ability to eliminate soldering during HPDC of aluminium alloys.

Thus the problem of soldering on such tools as <b>core</b> <b>pins</b> can be eliminated in high HPDC of aluminium alloys. In the accelerated trials, it was found that soldering was replaced by a built-up layer of cast aluminium alloy, which was less detrimental to tool life and reduced machine down-time due to the reduced need for tool polishing.

40|$|Soldering of core pins {{is one of}} {{the major}} issues {{limiting}} the productivity of aluminum castings using high pressure die casting process. This issue is associated with the failure of the ceramic coating, chemical reactions between the molten aluminum and the matrix metal and the dissolution of the pin matrix metal. Methods that prevent coating failure, retard dissolution rates of the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> materials in molten aluminum can be used for reducing soldering tendency of core pins. As a result, a ceramic coating is usually applied to the core pins in order to reduce soldering tendency, because the coating prevents severe reactions between the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> material and the molten alloy. Therefore, the coating lifetime governs the soldering process and the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> lifetime. The purpose of this study is 1) the mechanism of soldering formation, 2) the performance of coatings when contacting with molten alloys, 3) the in-depth analysis of the starting up coating failure, and 4) an ultrasonic method that is used for accelerating testing processes. ^ Results show that the soldering process starts from a local coating failure, involves a series of intermetallic phase formations from reactions between molten aluminum alloys and the H 13 steel pin, and accelerates when the aluminum-rich phase is formed between the intermetallic phases. It is the formation of the aluminum-rich phase in the reaction region that joins the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> with the casting, resulting in the sticking of the casting to the <b>core</b> <b>pin.</b> When undercuts are formed on the <b>core</b> <b>pin,</b> the ejection of castings from the die will either lead to a <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> failure or damages to the casting be ejected. High intensity ultrasonic vibration was applied on H 13 coupons to accelerate the experiments. Results obtained using the accelerated testing method were then validated using in a high pressure die casting machine under production conditions. These results indicate that coating detachment from the steel substrate is the main failure mechanism of the coatings when tested in water, oil, molten salt, or molten zinc at low temperatures. Coating failure accelerates as the temperature of the melt is increased. At high temperatures, coating fragmentation, as well as detachments, occurs on coupons tested in molten salt. Therefore, the coverage percentage and quality of coatings play an important role in retarding coating failure. As soon as coating failure occurs, the dissolution rate of H 13 steel is extremely high. The affinity, between the <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> material and the molten alloy, plays an important role in the later soldering process. The dissolution rate of H 13 steel in molten zinc is much higher than that in molten A 380 at the same experiment conditions. The dissolution rate of niobium in molten aluminum is at least 300 times slower than that of H 13 steels. It is suggested that Nb alloys have good potential to be used as soldering resistant <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> materials. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Introduction: The {{restoration}} material {{commonly used}} as core material for pulpless posterior teeth is mostly amalgam {{due to its}} high strength and low cost {{and it can be}} used with or without pin. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of post material on stress distribution in mandibular second premolar tooth by finite element analysis. Method: The stress distribution was analyzed in amalgam core supported with and without pin. Three dimensional plane strain models of the human mandibular second premolar were first made with pin amalgam and then with post amalgam. After applying the loading force at 45 degree angel, the stress distribution was analyzed in models. Results: Maximum stress in pin amalgam was more than that in post amalgam. The area of maximum stress in pin amalgam was at pin and core interface but in post amalgam it was at the margin of core in the side of applied force. The least stress was at the margin of core opposite to the side of force in both models and was more in pin amalgam than post amalgam. Conclusion: As the stress was more in pin amalgam than post amalgam so it can be said that the fracture strength of post amalgam is more than pin amalgam. Since crown increases fracture resistance of post and core, further studies for analysing stress distribution of amalgam core with crown is recommended.

The lack of scaling of F_p(H) suggests the presence of 10 to 20 % of nonsuperconducting regions inside the grains, which are smaller than the diameter of fluxon cores 2 xi at high temperature and become effective with decreasing temperature when xi(T) approaches the nanostructural scale.

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The {{clinically}} {{most widely}} used devices (Porstmann-plug, Rashkind-umbrella, Botallooccluder) have inherent specific limitations (eg, transarterial approach, residual shunts, limited retrieval). The authors assess practicability, efficacy, and tissue reaction of the new retrievable transvenous plug device for {{the occlusion of the}} persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). METHODS: A foam plug (polyvinyl alcohol) is mounted on a titanium <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> where, at both ends, small legs (titanium nickel alloy) with titanium heads are anchored, to ensure safe fixation in the ductus. The device is introduced transvenously through a long sheath (Mullins sheath) and held by a modified biopsy forceps allowing complete retrieval until final release. A common lamb model of large PDAs (n = 11) was used to test for practicability and the histomorphologic outcome. Clinical results were obtained from a consecutive series of 16 patients (aged 13 to 71 years). RESULTS: In all lambs, placement of the plug within the PDA was possible. Histopathology (follow-up 10 to 215 days; mean 112 days) revealed an adequate ingrowing of the device and no pathologic foreign body reaction. The diameter of the human PDAs ranged from 3 to 7 mm (mean 5 mm). The size of the sheath used for introducing the plug (diameter 8 to 16 mm) ranged from 8 to 16 French. Fourteen of 16 PDAs were closed immediately after or on day 1 after implantation, 1 was closed after the 12 -month follow-up, and 1 needed an additional plug after 30 months for definitive closure. CONCLUSIONS: The device demonstrated practicability and biocompatibility in our experimental lamb model and effectively closed the PDA in a consecutive series of 16 patients.

40|$|In high {{pressure}} die casting (HPDC) cooling time greatly affects the total cycle time. As thermal conductivity is the main governing factor, a higher thermal conductive die material allows faster extraction of heat from the casting, thus resulting in shorter cycle time and higher productivity. This thesis presents a novel approach to replace a conventional steel die by a bi-metallic die made of copper alloy in which the cavity surface is coated with a protective layer of tool steel using laser based additive manufacturing technology, Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) for {{high pressure}} die casting application. Results obtained from the finite element heat transfer analysis showed that bi-metallic die offered superior thermal performance compared with monolithic steel die. However, the main challenge lies in the deposition of tool steel on copper alloy due to the very different material properties of these two materials. Over the past decade, researchers have demonstrated interest in tribology and prototyping by the laser aided material deposition process. Laser aided DMD enables formation of a uniform clad by melting the powder onto a substrate material to form desired bimetallic component. Thus, the principal objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the feasibility of deposition of a protective tool steel layer on copper alloy substrate material to form bi-metallic structure using DMD technology for HPDC tooling. Heat transfer analysis, process and material characterization, tooling fabrication and industry evaluation have been investigated in this research to attain the stated aim. The following outcomes have been achieved from this thesis in order to develop an effective bi-metallic tooling for HPDC industries- Reduction of cycle time by employing bi-metallic die compared to that of tool steel for improvements to productivity of existing processes in HPDC; Establishment of feasibility of the application of DMD technique to deposit protective tool steel clad on completely different material i. e. copper alloy substrate; Investigation of microstructural characteristics of the DMD deposited tool steel clad on copper alloy substrate; Evaluation of mechanical properties namely, bond strength and fracture toughness of the bi-metallic structure; Analysis of thermal fatigue behaviour of the bi-metallic structure under conditions analogous to high {{pressure die casting}} environment; and Fabrication and performance evaluation of bi-metallic <b>core</b> <b>pin</b> in a semiindustrial high pressure die casting machine.

40|$|The general {{aim of this}} PhD {{project is}} to advance the science and {{technology}} of zpinned sandwich composites by performing an in-depth investigation into their mechanical properties, strengthening mechanisms and damage modes. The PhD thesis presents a comprehensive and critical review of the published scientific literature into z-pinned sandwich composites. While past studies often report large improvements to the mechanical performance of sandwich composites due to zpinning, the research is incomplete and gaps exist in the characterisation of these materials. The identification of these gaps in the characterisation of z-pinned sandwich composites provides {{the basis for the}} original research work performed in this PhD project. The PhD thesis presents a study into the through-thickness compression properties, strengthening mechanisms and damage modes of a sandwich composite structure reinforced with orthogonal z-pins. It was found that less than 4 % in z-pin volume content was required to increase greatly the compression modulus (up to 300 %), strength (700 %) and strain energy absorption capacity (500 %). While the compression properties were found to be highly sensitive to the z-pin content, the properties were much less dependent on the end constraint (i. e. built-in column or unsupported column) and diameter of the pins. An investigation into the compressive failure mechanisms of the z-pins within the foam core using acoustic emission monitoring, scanning electron microscopy and x-ray computed microtomography revealed {{for the first time that}} the fibrous z-pins failed during both elastic and plastic deformation of the core foam via a complex damage process involving splintering, kinking and fragmentation. It is shown that existing models fail to accurately determine the compression properties due to the complex failure mechanism of the zpins, which are not accounted for in the existing models. The PhD thesis presents a comprehensive experimental study into the impact damage resistance, post-impact mechanical properties of z-pinned sandwich composites and localised loading behaviour, which has not been previously investigated to any great detail. The research showed that there was no improvement to the impact damage resistance of the z-pinned sandwich composite at low impact energies (when damage was confined to the impacted face skin). The post-impact compressive stiffness and failure load for the z-pinned sandwich composite remained the same (within experimental scatter) as the unpinned material. Z-pinning was found to be only marginally effective at increasing the damage resistance when the impact energy was high enough to cause core crushing. This study showed that under a localised impact load, z-pins were not particularly effective at increasing the damage resistance or post-impact mechanical properties of sandwich composites and this is attributed to the small number of pins available to resist a localised (point) impact load. It was discovered that increasing the loading area improved the indentation stiffness and crush strength, and this was due to the increased number of z-pins resisting indentation. The experimental indentation results were further analysed against predictions using an indentation model for z-pinned sandwich composites. As a final novel study, the effect of z-pinning on the mechanical performance of Tshaped bonded sandwich joints was investigated. Experimental testing revealed that the stiffness, ultimate load and absorbed energy capacity of the sandwich composite joint was improved by z-pinning. The failure load and energy absorption were increased by the z-pins suppressing skin-to-core failure by generating bridging traction loads through the foam <b>core.</b> <b>Pin</b> pull-out tests revealed that z-pins generated high mode I bridging traction loads during frictional pull-out from the face skins, and this increased the load capability and stabilised the fracture process of the sandwich joint. The improvements to the mechanical properties of the T-joint are discussed using mechanical models for the bridging laws of z-pins in composite materials. This research revealed for the first time that z-pinning could be used an as alterative to mechanical fastening for the high strength joining of T-section sandwich composite components. The PhD thesis concludes with a summary of the major research findings, a discussion of future research directions into z-pinned sandwich composite panels and joints, and the remaining challenges in the certification of z-pinned sandwich composites for use in aircraft structures...|$|E

50|$|Students {{of bronze}} casting will usually work in direct wax, where {{the model is}} made in wax, {{possibly}} formed over a core, or with a core cast in place, if the piece is to be hollow. If no mould is made and the casting process fails, the artwork will also be lost. After the metal has cooled, the external ceramic or clay is chipped away, revealing {{an image of the}} wax form, including <b>core</b> <b>pins,</b> sprues, vents, and risers. All of these are removed with a saw and tool marks are polished away, and interior core material is removed to reduce the likelihood of interior corrosion. Incomplete voids created by gas pockets or investment inclusions are then corrected by welding and carving. Small defects where sprues and vents were attached are filed or ground down and polished.|$|R
40|$|Amorphous Fe 64 Gd 36 {{thin film}} square {{elements}} are investigated by imaging in the Fresnel mode of a {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM). The equilibrium state without an applied field shows the well-known four-domain flux closure pattern with in-plane magnetization. However, the vortex is displaced {{from the center of}} the square element and the domain walls are curved. In a reference measurement of a thin Ni 81 Fe 19 element, the vortex core is perfectly centered and the domain walls straight. When an increasing external field is applied in-plane, the vortex core can be moved. While this motion of the vortex core is linear in NiFe elements, in the ferrimagnetic FeGd squares the vortex core moves by sudden jumps. Micromagnetic simulations show that the asymmetry of the domain patterns as well as the vortex <b>core</b> <b>pinning</b> and depinning can be attributed to random anisotropy and a patchy microstructure in amorphous films...|$|R
25|$|The {{surface of}} the ball is {{required}} to include markings to indicate the manufacturer's brand name, {{the name of the}} ball, the center of gravity (before drilling), the orientation of the <b>core</b> (the <b>Pin),</b> and the axes of the high and/or low radius of gyration (as applicable). Additionally, markings must include an individual serial number and the logo of the USBC.|$|R
