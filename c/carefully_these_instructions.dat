40|$|Authors are {{requested}} to follow <b>carefully</b> <b>these</b> <b>instructions.</b> Manuscripts not prepared accordingly {{will not be}} considered. General BAM will mainly cover skeletal muscle basic research and its applications. Special attention will be paid to reports of experimental studies in large mammals to test the hypotheses of muscle and non-muscle diseases management’s. Myocardium and smooth muscle studies will also be considered. Basic and Applied Myology and BAM On-Line are multidisciplinary Journals, which publish basic and clinical research studies {{in the fields of}} anatomy, physiology, cell biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, gene mapping, comparative biology, development, differentiation, and regeneration, pathology, epidemiology, engineering, bioengineering, testing, pharmacology, toxicology, surgery, medicine. Non-medical studies in field such as veterinary, breeding and biotechnology will also be considered, if they concern muscle at molecular, cellular or organism levels. The journal publishes: 1. Review Articles, invited or submitted, on currents topics; 2. Perspectives, they will present opinions on future trends in basic and applied Myology; 3. Main Articles, they will present original laboratory and clinical research and related topics. They will b...|$|E
40|$|Authors should <b>carefully</b> review <b>these</b> <b>instructions</b> and the Call for Papers. They {{should also}} {{feel free to}} contact the Editor-in-chief, Ken Peffers to discuss {{questions}} or problems they may have with a submission. Submission and review process objectives To select papers for publication that are novel, state-of-the-art, and exciting, that IS researchers and professionals will want to read, and that {{will have an impact}} on research and/or professional practice in IS. To publish papers very quickly with an engineered review and publication process designed to provide moderate development assistance to authors who have submitted papers that are ready to be peer reviewed. • To help authors finish very high potential papers as concisely written articles of the highest quality by providing precise editorial direction. JITTA’s goal is that review and publication of successful papers should average 16 weeks from the date of submission. Of course, individual times vary, however, JITTA expects that most successful papers will be published within six months, including author revision time. This compares with an average of 2 - 5 years for traditional academic IS journals. Submission system JITTA has implemented a new paper submission and review system. It is perhaps the best and easiest to use of those in use among IS journals. It is found a...|$|R
