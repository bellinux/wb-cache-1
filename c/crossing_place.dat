25|$|The zoo is {{bisected}} by {{a public}} bridleway, Flag Lane. For many years, a single bridge (now called Elephants' Bridge), drivable by zoo vehicles and powered wheelchairs, near the elephant exhibit was the only <b>crossing</b> <b>place</b> within the grounds. A second crossing, passable by pedestrians and mobility scooters, called Bats' Bridge, opened in April 2008 near the Twilight Zone, has improved the ability of visitors to circulate.|$|E
25|$|Fords of Beruna: The {{location}} of the shallows in the Great River at the town of Beruna in Narnia. They were a strategic <b>crossing</b> <b>place</b> {{for the people of}} the country. In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, it was the site of the battle between the forces of Aslan and Jadis. In the time of Prince Caspian, the Telmarines who conquered Narnia centuries earlier had bridged the river at Beruna. The bridge was destroyed and the original crossing restored when Aslan returned to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian in his campaign to reclaim the throne from his uncle, the usurper Miraz.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{advanced}} north {{along the}} western bank of the Jordan River to reach the southern shore of Lake Huleh, searching of a suitable <b>crossing</b> <b>place.</b> In the vanguard the 9th Light Horse Regiment fired on the rearguard from the western bank, while the 10th Light Horse Regiment succeeded in crossing the river during twilight, when a squadron captured a strong rearguard position, 50 prisoners and three guns. The 8th Light Horse Regiment followed the 10th Light Horse Regiment across the Jordan at 19:00 leaving guides and a signal lamp to show the 9th Light Horse Regiment and Brigade Headquarters the place to cross the river.|$|E

25|$|The first European {{buildings}} erected at the <b>crossing</b> <b>place</b> were a provisions {{store and}} some small huts. A survey for a town was commissioned in 1838 by Assistant Surveyor Thomas Townsend who mapped out Wodonga Place (the present Wodonga Place) as the western boundary, Hume Street as the northern boundary, Kiewa Street {{to the east}} and Nurigong to the south, with Townsend Street being the only other north-south road, and Ebden and Hovell Streets being the other two east-west roads. Townsend proposed the settlement be named 'Bungambrewatha', the Aboriginal name for the area, but when his plan was eventually approved and published in the Government Gazette on 13 April 1839 the name had been changed to Albury.|$|E
25|$|The name Stoke {{is taken}} {{from the town of}} Stoke-upon-Trent, the {{original}} ancient parish, with other settlements being chapelries. Stoke derives from the Old English stoc, a word that at first meant little more than place, but which subsequently gained more specific – but divergent – connotations. These variant meanings included dairy farm, secondary or dependent place or farm, summer pasture, <b>crossing</b> <b>place,</b> meeting place and place of worship. It is not known which of these was intended here, and all are plausible. The most frequently suggested interpretations derive from a crossing point on the Roman road that ran from present-day Derby to Chesterton or the early presence of a church, said to have been founded in 670 AD. Because Stoke was such a common name for a settlement, some kind of distinguishing affix was usually added later, in this case the name of the river.|$|E
25|$|Sullivan's {{division}} {{held the}} right flank {{with the two}} Maryland brigades. He deployed 1,100 troops and two artillery pieces from both de Borre's and Smallwood's brigades at Brinton's Ford. The 250-man Delaware Regiment from the 1st Brigade was detached to hold Jones's Ford, the next <b>crossing</b> <b>place</b> to the north. Moses Hazen's 400-strong 2nd Canadian Regiment defended Wister's and Buffington's Fords, which were even more distant. American reconnaissance that day was woefully deficient. Howe divided his 18,000 British and Hessian troops into two wings. He sent the right wing under Wilhelm von Knyphausen to advance directly on Chadds Ford. Meanwhile, the more powerful left wing under Howe and Lord Charles Cornwallis marched north. About noon, Howe's wing crossed the Brandywine at undefended Jefferis's Ford, which was north of Buffington's. Howe's column veered to the southeast past Strode's Mill toward Osborne's Hill where the footsore troops were permitted to rest. At this location they were finally spotted by American cavalrymen and Theodorick Bland quickly notified both Washington and Sullivan of the danger.|$|E

25|$|Hood {{departed}} from Gadsden on October 22, {{en route to}} Guntersville, Alabama, where he planned to cross the Tennessee River. Learning that that <b>crossing</b> <b>place</b> was strongly guarded, and concerned that Federal gunboats could destroy any pontoon bridge he might deploy, he impulsively changed his destination to Decatur, 40 miles west. When Hood arrived at Decatur on October 26, he found that a Federal infantry force of 35,000 men was defending an entrenched line that included two forts and 1,600 yards of rifle pits. Two Federal wooden gunboats patrolled the river. On October 28, Confederate skirmishers advanced through a dense fog to a ravine within 800 yards of the main fortifications. Around noon, a small Federal detachment drove the sharpshooters and skirmishers out of the ravine, capturing 125 men. Hood, concluding {{that he could not}} afford the casualties that would ensue from a full-scale assault, withdrew his army. He decided once again to move to the west, to attempt another crossing near Tuscumbia, Alabama, where Muscle Shoals would prevent interference by Federal gunboats.|$|E
25|$|However, Archduke Charles was {{not quite}} {{finished}} with Switzerland. The Austrian general tried to gain a bridgehead across the Aare River at Döttingen. Success here would {{drive a wedge between}} Masséna's left wing and his center, compelling the French commander to withdraw from his position facing Zürich. On the morning of 17 August, Charles massed 35,000 troops and battery of 40 cannons opposite his intended <b>crossing</b> <b>place.</b> The Austrians were favored by good luck because Masséna was visiting his right wing that day and the defending 5th Division was under a temporary commander, Étienne Heudelet de Bierre. Also, there was an early fog to hide the bridge builders from French view. As it happened, Michel Ney was nearby and by noon he and Heudelet assembled 12,000 men in the vicinity. The Austrian engineers blundered by selecting a poor site for their bridge and there was no covering force to protect the crews from French snipers. By 6:30 pm the effort failed and the Austrians asked for a truce so they could take up their bridge, which Ney granted. On 22 August, Ney transferred to the Army of the Rhine.|$|E
500|$|Bridgwater is at {{the mouth}} of the River Parrett, [...] inland and the lowest <b>crossing</b> <b>place</b> above the estuary. It was {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book and was once a major port and trading centre, and is still a mainly industrial town. Yeovil is in the middle of the Yeovil Scarplands, an upland area on the southern borders of the county. It was settled in prehistoric times and Yeovil is also mentioned in the Domesday Book. The town is a centre for the aviation and defence industries and a major employer is the helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland. Frome, another ancient settlement, occupies a site at the foot of the Mendips overlooking the River Frome. The town was dependent on the woollen industry, but is now associated with metal-working and printing, and large numbers of residents commute to Bristol and Bath.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} {{established}} {{with a limited}} number of <b>crossing</b> <b>places</b> for trains on the single line. Now that the route had trunk status by virtue of the steamer connections, delays to one train could expand into serious delays elsewhere. The staff and ticket system was rather inflexible, and it was replaced by the Tyers train tablet system, with additional <b>crossing</b> <b>places</b> at Glenlochy (between Tyndrum and Dalmally), Awe Crossing between Lochawe and Taynuilt, Glencruitten Summit between Connel Ferry and Oban, and St Brides between Callander and Strathyre.|$|R

5|$|There are exits at {{both ends}} to the full length {{mezzanine}} along with evidence of removed center exits; since this station was built, the area now known as Cadman Plaza was completely rebuilt. Cadman Plaza East, the short one-block street outside the Red <b>Cross</b> <b>Place</b> exit, was previously called Washington Street; the Washington Street moniker still applies to the road north of Prospect Street. High Street is not directly accessible from the station, as the short one-block street is interrupted by a parking lot. However, Red <b>Cross</b> <b>Place,</b> which was once a part of High Street, is directly accessible.|$|R
500|$|The Grande Armée d'Allemagne {{was now in}} {{a perilous}} {{position}} of two wings separated by [...] and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Berthier, the French marshals, and the rank-and-file were all evidently frustrated at the seemingly pointless marches and counter marches. On the 16th, the Austrian advance guard had beaten back the Bavarians near Landshut and had secured a good <b>crossing</b> <b>place</b> over the Isar by evening. Napoleon finally arrived in Donauwörth on the 17th after a furious trip from Paris. Charles congratulated himself on a successful opening to the campaign and planned to destroy Davout's and Lefebvre's isolated corps in a double-pincer manoeuvre. When Napoleon realised that significant Austrian forces were already over the Isar and were marching towards the Danube, he insisted that the entire French army deploy behind the Ilm River in a bataillon carré within 48 hours, all in hopes of undoing Berthier's mistakes and achieving a successful concentration. His orders were unrealistic because he underestimated the number of Austrian troops that were heading for Davout; Napoleon believed Charles only had a single corps over the Isar, but in fact, the Austrians had five corps lumbering towards Regensburg, {{a grand total of}} 80,000 men. Napoleon needed to do something quickly to save his left flank from collapsing.|$|E
