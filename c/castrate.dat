5|$|An {{examination}} of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, {{this time with}} cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, <b>castrate</b> and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted {{to be sold to}} zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.|$|E

In the first experiment, we compared pairs of intact and <b>castrated</b> males: intact males urinated earlier when exposed to a new environment, with a greater number of drops that were smaller than those of <b>castrated</b> males. In the second experiment, groups of intact males, <b>castrated,</b> testosterone-supplemented <b>castrated,</b> and isolated intact males were compared. The micturition pattern of isolated intact males consisted of numerous small droplets of urine, with a high volume of urine retained in the bladder after voiding. This also applied to grouped intact males and testosterone-treated <b>castrated</b> mice, while <b>castrated</b> mice voided a larger fraction of bladder content. Bladder weight was higher in intact males and testosterone-treated <b>castrated</b> males, as compared to <b>castrated</b> males. In the third experiment, ovary-intact and testosterone-treated intact females were compared. Testosterone-treated ovary-intact females retained a larger quantity of urine in the bladder and also had a larger bladder compared to ovary-intact females. Testosterone thus induces the morphological modifications of the urinary tract necessary for the dominant male urination pattern, which is an increase in postvoid urinary residual volume and bladder weight.

25|$|In 1905, Sigmund Freud {{presented}} {{his theory of}} psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an Oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to <b>castrate</b> the child's power to appease sexual impulses.

Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens.

Although the most commonly employed estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain estrogens, namely polyestradiol phosphate, have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various estrogens on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|E

Although entire males had higher gross margins compared to <b>castrates</b> during the finishing phase, {{they were unable to}} make up the earlier losses of $ 24. 04 /AE at weaning. There were no differences in performance between entire males and <b>castrates</b> prior to the onset of puberty in the on-farm experiment. Following the onset of puberty and combined with an energy dense finishing ration, entire males grew 27 % faster than <b>castrates.</b> There were no differences in temperament between the <b>castrates</b> and entire males (P > 0. 05). Entire males produced carcasses that were heavier (P = 0. 005), had less marbling (P = 0. 001) and were more mature (P = 0. 007) compared to carcasses from <b>castrates.</b> Both entire males and <b>castrates</b> that were negatively homozygous or heterozygous produced carcasses that were heavier than carcasses from animals that were positively homozygous for the calpastatin gene (P < 0. 05). All but one entire male carcass qualified as gain fed yearling beef (GFYG) under the Ausmeat selection criteria and consequently were awarded a similar price per kg compared to <b>castrates.</b> The price combined with the heavier carcass weights resulted in entire males being $ 50 more profitable per carcass compared to <b>castrates.</b> Entire males produced tougher samples of the M. Longissimus dorsi after aging for 14 days (P = 0. 001) and 28 days (P = 0. 005) compared to <b>castrates.</b> Selecting animals that were either positively or negatively homozygous or heterozygous for the calpastatin gene didn't affect M. Longissimus dorsi meat tenderness. In conclusion entire male cattle can be managed and produced for the domestic trade, profitably, in accordance with Ausmeat selection criteria. In addition, meat tenderness in Bos indicus <b>castrated</b> or entire male cattle was unable to be improved by selecting against the calpastatin gene...|$|R
50|$|To {{replicate}} the hallmark shift of PCa cells to AI, LNCaP host mice were <b>castrated</b> {{by way of}} midscrotal incision at approximately 8 weeks post injection. Tumors were maintained in <b>castrated</b> hosts for 4 to 5 weeks at which time remaining tumors were harvested. In total, two subsets of cells were collected from <b>castrated</b> hosts: C4 and C5, collected at 4 and 5 weeks respectively.|$|R
