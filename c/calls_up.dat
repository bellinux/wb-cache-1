500|$|Greg Edmonson {{composed}} the musical {{score for the}} series. He stated that he wrote for the emotion of the moment. However, one reviewer averred that he also wrote for the characters, stating: [...] "Edmonson has developed a specialized collection of musical symbolism for the series". To help illustrate the collection, the reviewer gave key leitmotifs, or [...] "signatures", various names, noting that [...] "Serenity" [...] recalls {{the theme of the}} show and is used when they return to the ship, or when they were meeting clandestinely; it was [...] "the sound of their home". The slide guitar and fiddle used in this piece are portable instruments which fit the lifestyle of the crew: [...] "the music they make <b>calls</b> <b>up</b> tunes played out in the open, by people who were hundreds of miles away yesterday. 'Serenity' conjures the nomadic lifestyle the crew leads and underlines the western aspect of the show." [...] Another emotional signature was [...] "Sad Violin". It was used {{at the end of the}} Battle of Serenity Valley, but also helped set up the joke for when Mal tells Simon that Kaylee is dead in the episode [...] "Serenity". The most memorable use of [...] "Sad Violin", however, is at the end of [...] "The Message", when the crew mourned the death of Tracey. This was also the last scene of the last episode the actors shot, and so this was seen by them, and Edmonson, as Firefly farewell. To denote impending danger, [...] "Peril" [...] was used, which is [...] "a low pulse, like a heartbeat, with deep chimes and low strings". The reviewer also noted character signatures. The criminal Niska has his own signature: Eastern European or Middle Eastern melodies over a low drone. Simon and River's signature was a piano played sparsely with a violin in the background. This is in contrast to the portable instruments of [...] "Serenity": the piano is an instrument that cannot be easily moved and evokes the image of [...] "the distant house and family they both long for". The various signatures were mostly established in the first pilot, [...] "Serenity", and helped enhance the narrative.|$|E
