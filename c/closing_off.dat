5|$|Between {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Cumaná {{experienced}} an increase in population. The areas around the castles and the Manzanares River became densely populated. New buildings were constructed that were attached to the castle walls, completely <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the perimeter and making direct access impossible. Another earthquake in 1929 left the structure in ruins and rendered it unusable. The offices of the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná were moved elsewhere and the building was abandoned. The castle was declared a Cultural and Municipal Asset in May 2005 by the state Cultural Assets Institute.|$|E
5|$|Dolphin drive hunting, {{also called}} dolphin drive fishing, {{is a method}} of hunting {{dolphins}} and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving them together with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat; some end up in dolphinariums.|$|E
5|$|The west façade of {{the castle}} has square towers {{flanking}} the central bay, with others at the south west and north west, all topped with octagonal, machicolated turrets. The north and south façades are relatively simple. The east façade has a central projection in the centre rising a storey above the parapet, to form a tower. The tower's south angle is splayed to accommodate the main staircase and only the corbels of its parapet survive. The screen <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the east entrance has a three-bay cusped arcade {{on the ground floor}} and three ogee arches on the shafts above.|$|E

5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E
5|$|The crestless {{skull of}} Eolambia {{has a similar}} overall shape to those of Equijubus and Probactrosaurus. The front of the snout is highly roughened, being punctuated by many foramina. At the tip of each premaxilla, there are two tooth-like {{structures}} known as denticles, which is also seen in its closest relative Protohadros. Further back, the rear portion of the lower branch of the premaxilla abruptly projects upwards, <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the nostril at the rear as in Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids. This part joins with the two finger-like processes of the maxilla, {{which is similar to}} Protohadros. The body of the maxilla itself does not bear a recess or any indication of an antorbital fenestra, like Equijubus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids. One of the characteristics used to distinguish Eolambia is the concave profile of the tooth row of the maxilla when viewed from the side, which is like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and several other hadrosauriforms but unlike Protohadros.|$|E

25|$|In September 2015, {{stage three}} of the Tour of Britain ran along {{the entire length of}} the B5300 as part of its route from Cockermouth to Floors Castle. The road was closed in stages as police {{officers}} on motorcycles rode ahead of the peloton, <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> side roads and stopping traffic. Silloth-on-Solway in particular made a big fuss about welcoming the riders from the Tour.|$|E

25|$|The Tokyo {{market was}} open during the speech and {{immediately}} moved down sharply after this comment, <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> 3%. Markets {{around the world}} followed. The prescience of the short comment within a rather dry and complex speech would not normally have been so memorable; however, it was followed about three years later by major slumps in stock markets worldwide, particularly the Nasdaq Composite, provoking a strong reaction in financial circles and making its way into colloquial speech. Greenspan's comment was well remembered, although few heeded the warning.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the city tried to revive its {{downtown}} by <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the two blocks of Main Street {{west of the}} store to create Main Mall, a pedestrian mall that would offer shoppers a comparable experience to the suburban malls. Since {{it was necessary to}} raze some other adjacent stores and buildings to create parking lots, the plan actually exacerbated the neighborhood's decline. Seven years after the mall was created, in 1981, Luckey Platt closed both its main store and the Dutchess Mall branch.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{entering}} the war, the Navy had immediately established a blockade of Germany. The Navy's Northern Patrol closed off {{access to the}} North Sea, while the Dover Patrol closed off access to the English Channel. The Navy also mined the North Sea. As well as <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the Imperial German Navy's access to the Atlantic, the blockade largely blocked neutral merchant shipping heading to or from Germany. The blockade was maintained during the {{eight months after the}} armistice was agreed to force Germany to end the war and sign the Treaty of Versailles.|$|E
25|$|The French {{fortified}} a loop in the Pasłęka {{that formed}} a re-entrant {{toward the west}} bank of the stream. By <b>closing</b> <b>off</b> the east end of the loop with a central redoubt connected by earthworks to the river banks on each side, the French held a well-protected east bank bridgehead. A second redoubt near the bridge provided a back up position. Villatte deployed the 27th Light in the bridgehead, with the 63rd Line and 17th Dragoons in direct support on the west bank. His second brigade under General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Girard held the line of the Pasłęka farther north with the 94th and 95th Line Infantry Regiments. The 18th, 19th, and 20th Dragoon Regiments were with Girard.|$|E
