5000|$|ROLAP is {{generally}} more scalable. However, large volume pre-processing {{is difficult to}} implement efficiently so it is frequently skipped. ROLAP query performance <b>can</b> therefore <b>suffer</b> tremendously.|$|R
5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E
5|$|Bees <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> serious {{effects from}} toxic {{chemicals}} in their environments. These include various synthetic chemicals, such as insecticides and fertilizers, {{as well as}} a variety of naturally occurring chemicals from plants, such as ethanol resulting from the fermentation of organic materials. Bee intoxication can result from exposure to ethanol from fermented nectar, ripe fruits, and manmade and natural chemicals in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants {{are among the}} most toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% of the human {{population}} are allergic to the venom of M. pilosula and <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung; many human deaths have been recorded. People prone to severe allergic reactions can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E

5|$|The {{interactions}} of hydrogen with various metals {{are very important}} in metallurgy, as many metals <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to store it {{for use as a}} fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.|$|E
5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E
5|$|Emus <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> {{from both}} {{external}} and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.|$|E

5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E
5|$|Pugs <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> from necrotizing meningo{{encephalitis}} (NME), {{also known}} as Pug dog encephalitis (PDE), an inflammation {{of the brain and}} meninges. NME also occurs in other small dogs, such as the Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, and Chihuahua. There is no known cure for NME, which is believed to be an inherited disease. Dogs usually die or have to be put to sleep within a few months of onset, which, in those susceptible to this condition, is typically between six months and seven years of age.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but some <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they {{are prone to}} ear infections such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E

25|$|Vizslas <b>can</b> also <b>suffer</b> from hypothyroidism, dwarfism, {{persistent}} right aortic arch, {{tricuspid valve}} dysplasia, and progressive retinal atrophy. Major risks include epilepsy and lymphosarcoma. Vizslas {{can also be}} prone to skin and food allergies.|$|R
5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the breed is {{uncertain}} prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent. Clumber Spaniels have been kept and bred by various British Monarchs, including Prince Albert, King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced into Canada in 1844, and in 1884 {{became one of the}} first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club. The breed <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary lameness due to bone growth whilst young to hip dysplasia or spinal disc herniation.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas were {{regularly}} captured and kept as pets {{until the early}} 20th century. The species {{is reported to be}} hardier and easier to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the aviary trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large aviary of at least 5m (15ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no sunflower seeds. As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> as a result.|$|E

30|$|Finally, mirror neurons, {{a type of}} neuron that is {{fundamental}} to feelings of empathy which {{is located in the}} frontal and the insular regions, <b>can</b> also <b>suffer</b> functional alterations in psychopaths (Alcázar-Córcoles et al., 2008).|$|R
50|$|Purebred Poodles and Cocker Spaniels <b>can</b> also <b>suffer</b> from {{a number}} of eye disorders, {{including}} progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). A CERF (Canine Eye Registration Foundation) exam and DNA test for PRA should, therefore, be performed before breeding.|$|R
5|$|RPGs <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> in {{the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every detail of the game world, and provide for a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal logic of the game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E
5|$|Their sting {{generally}} only {{causes a}} mild local reaction in humans; however, {{it is one}} of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus Myrmecia. The ant venom is particularly immunogenic for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant allergies. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population has developed an allergy to the venom and about half of these allergic people <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> from anaphylactic reactions (increased heart rate, falling blood pressure, and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, there were four deaths due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E
5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they <b>can</b> <b>suffer</b> from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E
