5|$|Turning {{towards the}} Houses of Parliament, Livingstone and Christine moved to West Hampstead, north London; in June 1977 he was {{selected}} by local party members as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the Hampstead constituency, beating Vince Cable. He gained notoriety in the Hampstead and Highgate Express for publicly reaffirming {{his support for the}} controversial issue of LGBT rights, declaring he supported the reduction of the age of consent for male same-sex activity from 21 to 16, in line with the different-sex age of consent. Becoming active in the politics of the London Borough of Camden, Livingstone was elected Chair of Camden's Housing Committee; putting forward radical reforms, he democratized <b>council</b> <b>housing</b> meetings by welcoming local people, froze rents for a year, reformed the rate collection system, changed rent arrears procedures and implemented further compulsory purchase orders to increase <b>council</b> <b>housing.</b> Criticised by some senior colleagues as incompetent and excessively ambitious, some accused him of encouraging leftists to move into the borough's <b>council</b> <b>housing</b> to increase his local support base.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Livingstone and {{his comrades}} {{developed}} a new strategy for obtaining political power in Lambeth borough. Focusing on campaigning for the marginal seats {{in the south of}} the borough, the safe Labour seats in the north were left to established party members. Public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of Prime Minister Edward Heath led to Labour's best local government results since the 1940s; Labour leftists gained every marginal seat in Lambeth, and the borough returned to Labour control. In October 1971, Livingstone's father died of a heart attack; his mother soon moved to Lincoln. That year, Labour members voted Livingstone Vice-Chairman of the Housing Committee on the Lambeth London Borough Council, his first job in local government. Reforming the housing system, Livingstone and Committee Chairman Ewan Carr cancelled the proposed rent increase for <b>council</b> <b>housing,</b> temporarily halting the construction of Europe's largest tower blocks, and founded a Family Squatting Group to ensure that homeless families would be immediately rehoused through squatting in empty houses. He increased the number of compulsory purchase orders for private-rented properties, converting them to <b>council</b> <b>housing.</b> They faced opposition to their reforms, which were cancelled by central government.|$|E
