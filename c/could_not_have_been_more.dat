25|$|The timing {{for these}} performances, {{not just for}} Berlioz' career but also for French Romanticism in general, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> apt. Berlioz {{was on the verge}} of {{producing}} his most Romantic works—as were the writers Vigny, Dumas, Gautier and several others in attendance that night. Shakespeare served as a model for French Romanticism, with Hugo extolling Shakespeare as a challenge to French classicism and the model for the new Romantic theater.|$|E
25|$|Besides Plato himself, Ariston and Perictione {{had three}} other children; these were two sons, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and a daughter, Potone, {{the mother of}} Speusippus (the nephew and {{successor}} of Plato as head of his philosophical Academy). According to the Republic, Adeimantus and Glaucon were older than Plato; the two brothers distinguished themselves in the Battle of Megara, when Plato <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 5 years old. Nevertheless, in his Memorabilia, Xenophon presents Glaucon as younger than Plato.|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} {{was also}} reported by a Bengali sea captain, who {{wrote of the}} event later, but who had not recorded {{it at the time}} in the ship's log. Neither Vogel nor Hesse mention Krakatoa in any real detail in their other passages, and no other travelers at the time mention an eruption or evidence of one. (In November 1681, a pepper crop was being offered for sale by inhabitants.) In 1880, Verbeek investigated a fresh unweathered lava flow at the northern coast of Perboewatan, which <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than two centuries old.|$|E

25|$|Still, the {{recalcitrant}} Burmese king {{tried to}} hold on to all his gains. To reinforce the Chinese front, he recalled from Siam a major portion of the army, which arrived back to Ava with the Siamese captives in July 1767. As it turned out, the remaining Burmese forces in Siam, which <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 10,000 at most, were too scattered among many garrisons, and too small to hold the conquered kingdom together. Indeed, the Burmese had little control outside their garrisons, and no control over the Siamese countryside where gangs of bandits roamed.|$|E
25|$|The {{size and}} {{dimensions}} of the treasures are heavily debated. According to British scientist, historian and sinologist Joseph Needham, the purported {{dimensions of the}} largest of these ships were 137m (450ft) by 55m (180ft), which would make them {{at least twice as}} long as the largest European ships {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century. These dimensions have been challenged on engineering grounds and on the reliability of their sources; some have claimed they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 61–76 m (200–250 feet) or that they could only have been used on special occasions in the relative safety of the lower Yangtze River. However, in 1962 a large rudder was unearthed in the Treasure Ship Yard in Nanjing with dimensions corresponding with a 600-ft long ship.|$|E
25|$|Miss Anderson's {{debut as}} Gilda, {{although}} belated, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> welcome. The Metropolitan is not rich in artists of this caliber. The tall soprano left America {{a decade ago}} to build a phenomenal European career, chiefly in the florid works of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. She demonstrated in a Caro nome of exquisite taste, effortless fluidity and pinpoint precision {{that she is a}} master of the bel canto style. She is comfortable above high C, but the lower ranges do not suffer in quality or power. The wide leaps of the Caro nome coda were taken effortlessly and squarely on the note. The Met audience does not often hear a trill as thrushlike and as precise as Miss Anderson's, nor a soprano who can soar as grandly over the ensemble in the quartet.|$|E
6000|$|On October 10, 1856, {{about four}} hundred people were camped in Tasajara Valley, California.

It was simply a religious revival of one or two denominational sects, known as a [...] "camp-meeting." ...|$|R

25|$|United's next {{match was}} on the road, against Montreal Impact, and the game <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> {{different}} than the nearly record-setting 6-4 shootout in United's prior game at home against RSL. The surprising, quick return from injury by goalie Bill Hamid and the sprained knee injury suffered by Fabian Espindola during training {{the day before the}} match virtually guaranteed that United would play a cautious, defensive-minded game. Statistics from the game bore that out, as United was outshot 25–1 by the home team, and possession was more than 2–1 in the Impact's favor. Amazingly though, United emerged with a 1–0 victory, thanks to strong goalkeeping and a first-half goal by Rolfe that finished off a play assisted by Arrieta's high pressure. Arrieta forced a turnover by the Montreal defense and directed the ball to Rolfe who scored what proved to be the game-winner on United's only shot of the game. United became the first team ever to win an MLS match having recorded only one shot all game.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's keenness {{to record}} his new {{material}} for Freewheelin paralleled a dramatic power {{struggle in the}} studio: Albert Grossman's determination to have John Hammond replaced as Dylan's producer at CBS.

Hammond was a WASP, so relaxed during recording sessions that he sat with feet up, reading The New Yorker. Grossman was a Jewish businessman with a shady past, hustling to become a millionaire." ...|$|E

500|$|Having won {{the league}} {{championship}} and the FA Cup respectively in 1973–74, Revie and Shankly both left their clubs. On 4 July 1974, Revie was appointed {{as manager of}} the England national team in succession to Sir Alf Ramsey. Only eight days later, on 12 July, Shankly announced his retirement from football management {{in a press conference}} at Anfield. There was much speculation about how two such high-profile jobs would be filled. In one case, at Liverpool, there was a straightforward solution which resulted in their young team taking, in the words of Leeds United's own website, [...] "a vice like grip on the English game". At Leeds, however, the succession to Revie <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> controversial, especially when, as the Leeds website itself says of the club's ageing team, [...] "Leeds were on the wane".|$|E
500|$|The Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) {{are among}} the first groups of work {{completed}} after Van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, {{a strong sense of}} personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found [...] "a world of motifs that <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> Japanese". Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and [...] "one big [...] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled".|$|E

Ketchum is devastated at {{having failed to}} protect his friends and takes his own life at Twisted River. Danny, who has now lost his mother, father, son and their friend, tries to focus on writing his next book, a follow-up to his previous eight semi-autobiographical novels. Then his last hope, Amy ("Lady Sky"), arrives on his doorstep. When Joe was 2, Amy had parachuted naked onto a pig farm Danny and Joe were visiting. Danny rescued Amy from the pig pen and Joe, awe-struck by this event, called her [...] "Lady Sky". Amy in turn offered to help Danny whenever he needed it. Having read all about the famous writer and his misfortunes, Amy tracks Danny down and moves in with him. Happy now, Danny finds the opening sentence of his new book: [...] "The young Canadian, who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than fifteen, had hesitated too long." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] was {{originally}} meant {{to serve as}} the second season finale, but NBC decided to make it the season premiere with the hopes of getting increased ratings from a guest appearance by Robin Williams. Williams portrayed Robert Ellison, the husband of a slain woman tourist. Several news sources indicated Williams took on the role as a favor to Homicide executive producer Barry Levinson, who directed Williams in the films Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Toys (1992). But Fontana said Williams agreed to take the part based on the actor's positive impression of both the show in general and the [...] "Bop Gun" [...] script in particular. Fontana said of Williams, [...] "He read the script, responded instantly and said, 'When do you want me there?'. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> prepared or more of a gentleman to everyone, and he worked his tail off. That whole experience was a joy." [...] Williams himself said of the show, [...] "Visually, it was just so different from anything else on television." [...] Although Williams was primarily known for his comedic work, the Homicide producers and Williams himself consciously decided to remain true to the original script, rejecting the idea of adding humor or jokes to the episode. Williams' scenes were filmed over three days, and the actors found the part emotionally draining. Fontana said, [...] " [...] worked like a dog. It was quite a special event for all of us. It's very intense." ...|$|E

This grew as her performances became better known and she was also expected to appear at the Theatre Royal, King Street, in Bristol, which now houses the Bristol Old Vic which was also run by John Palmer. She lived with her husband and children at number 33 The Paragon until her final performance in May 1782. Having gradually built up a reputation, her next Drury Lane appearance, on 10 October 1782, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> different.
