The standardized <b>costing</b> <b>methodology</b> was developed on the basis of the availability of data at the seven ICU departments. It entailed the application of the bottom–up approach for “hotel and nutrition” and the top–down approach for “diagnostics,” “consumables,” and “labor. ”ResultsDirect costs per ICU day ranged from € 1168 to € 2025. Even though the distribution of costs varied by cost component, labor was the most important cost driver at all departments. The costs for “labor” amounted to € 1629 at department G but were fairly similar at the other departments (€ 711 ± 115). ConclusionsDirect costs of ICU days vary widely between the seven departments.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} {{theoretical}} and empirical analysis of the EU research policy and its impacts. The aim of the thesis is to evaluate effects of this policy on the financial management of universities, or more precisely the impact of financial rules defined by the European Commission (EC) in the 7 th Framework Programme (FP 7) {{on the development of}} full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> at universities in the EU 27. The thesis also analyzes the process of the preparation of the new FP 8 HORIZON 2020 financial rules and asses if feedback and needs of participating universities are reflected and thus principles of European good governance are applied. In order to meet its goals, the thesis states three hypotheses: Hypothesis 1 : Universities from the EU 27 that participate in FP 7 develop full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies.</b> Hypothesis 2 : EC requirements in FP 7 are one of the main drivers to implement full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> for universities form EU 27. Hypothesis 3 : Universities from the EU 27 communicate development of their full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> with the EC. The thesis is organized into four chapters. The first one characterizes the concept of European good governance and one of its instruments, i. e. policy evaluation and its use in the thesis (including the analysis of performed questionnaire research). Second chapter defines the term of financial management and its use in the thesis. Third chapter describes the EU research policy, its historical development, main instruments (FPs), role of European institutions and attitude to full costing. The last forth chapter analyzes in details experience of universities form EU 27 with development of full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies.</b> Within its conclusions, the thesis proves that the EU research policy significantly influences the financial management of universities from EU 27 and implementation of full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> by them. It is inter alia proved, that 70 % of universities from the EU 27 that do not implement full costing in FP 7 yet plan to introduce such methodologies in the future; that FP 7 financial rules are drivers to implement full <b>cost</b> <b>methodologies</b> for almost 2 / 3 universities from the EU 27 participating in FP 7 and that 3 / 4 of universities form EU 27 applying full costing in FP 7 consulted on their methodologies with the EC. All three hypotheses thus were verified. Nevertheless, it was concluded that principles of European good governance are not satisfactory applied by the EC, because it does not support the use of full costing in HORIZON 2020 anymore...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} builds upon {{a body of}} work on {{the development}} and introduction of information systems in the UK National Health Service following the implementation of the White Paper 'Working for Patients'. None of the earlier studies examined the use of the information from those systems for costing health care services, the methodologies used by hospitals for costing their products or the comparability of the output from the costing methodologies used, thereby making this study different from prior work. Costing methodologies cited in the literature are described from the perspective of single organisations. This research analyses the development of an aggregated costing approach, focusing on the issues laced when trying to develop a <b>costing</b> <b>methodology</b> that will be applied to a group of autonomous organisations. The research provides a comparison of health care costing methodologies in both the United Kiiigdom and Ontario, Canada. Collected through interviews and a postal survey tool, data from NHS hospital care providers are analysed to identify both the conformity of the approach and the results of the costing methodologies eniployed. Information from an extended field study is used to review the development of a micro-costing framework in Ontario for radiation therapy services. These findings are then synthesised into a generic framework applicable within other health care organisations seeking to implement a comparative <b>costing</b> <b>methodology.</b> This lramcwork is used to identify possible causes of variance in health care costing approaches. Elements of the framework requiring modification to account for local conditions, such as salary rates or provider availability, are identified and suggestions are made for further work resulting from this research to increase understanding about variability in health care costing methodologies and test the implementation of the generic <b>costing</b> <b>methodology...</b>|$|E

Essa metodologia de custeio abrange uma estimativa inicial de custos e a {{posterior}} aferição desses custos, decorrentes da ausência de Ergonomia no delineamento das situações em estudo; num outro momento, são feitos os cálculos dos custos das correções, ou investimentos necessários e a avaliação dos benefícios aportados pela nova concepção. A aplicação dessa metodologia é exemplificada em um estudo de caso de uma cozinha industrial, onde foi realizada uma Análise Ergonômica do Trabalho. No estudo de caso, a ausência de ergonomia é caracterizada por indicadores econômicos de efetividade na empresa. Conclui-se que essa metodologia de custeio mostra como problemas no desempenho impactam no negócio, economicamente, caracterizados em saúde, qualidade de vida e produtividade no trabalho. Nesse sentido, acredita-se ter contribuído com o estado da prática, contabilizando os custos e avaliando a viabilidade da solução. This paper discusses an ergonomics-based <b>costing</b> <b>methodology,</b> {{in which}} the costing process and the ergonomic work analysis are realized at the same time.

40|$|This {{research}} project applies a hybrid energy-economy model {{to compare the}} cost-effectiveness of different climate change mitigation policies for the United States. Five policies are compared: (1) a technology regulation phasing out coal and natural gas generation, (2) Clean Electricity Standard, (3) Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standard, (4) Vehicles Emissions Standard, (5) economy-wide GHG tax. The cost of these policies is estimated using three different methodologies. The first methodology is the techno-economic cost (TEC) measure, representing a ‘bottom-up’ or engineering <b>costing</b> <b>methodology.</b> The second methodology is the perceived private cost (PPC) measure, representing the ‘top-down’ or economist <b>costing</b> <b>methodology.</b> The third methodology uses the previous two methods to make a “best estimate” of welfare costs, called the expected resource cost. Going by the expected resource cost measure, the study finds an economy-wide GHG tax is {{a quarter of the}} cost of two policy scenarios that implement tradable performance standards in the electricity and transportation sectors. For the electricity sector policies, the study finds that the clean electricity standard is 50 % less costly than a technology regulation phasing out conventional coal and natural gas generation. For the transportation policies, the study finds that the Vehicle Emissions Standard is 15 % less costly than the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standard...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction In {{the context}} of the current human {{resources}} for health (HRH) crisis, the need for comprehensive Human Resources Development Plans (HRDP) is acute, especially in resource-scarce sub-Saharan African countries. However, the financial implications of such plans rarely receive due consideration, despite the availability of much advice and examples in the literature on how to conduct HRDP costing. Global initiatives have also been launched recently to standardise <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies</b> and respective tools. Methods This paper reports on two separate experiences of HRDP costing in Mozambique and Guinea Bissau, with the objective to provide an insight into the practice of costing exercises in information-poor settings, as well as to contribute to the existing debate on HRH <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies.</b> The study adopts a case-study approach to analyse the methodologies developed in the two countries, their contexts, policy processes and actors involved. Results From the analysis of the two cases, it emerged that the costing exercises represented an important driver of the HRDP elaboration, which lent credibility to the process, and provided a financial framework within which HRH policies could be discussed. In both cases, bottom-up and country-specific methods were designed to overcome the countries' lack of cost and financing data, as well as to interpret their financial systems. Such an approach also allowed the costing exercises to feed directly into the national planning and budgeting process. Conclusions The authors conclude that bottom-up and country-specific <b>costing</b> <b>methodologies</b> have the potential to serve adequately the multi-faceted purpose of the exercise. It is recognised that standardised tools and methodologies may help reduce local governments' dependency on foreign expertise to conduct the HRDP costing and facilitate regional and international comparisons. However, adopting pre-defined and insufficiently flexible tools may undermine the credibility of the costing exercise, and reduce the space for policy negotiation opportunities within the HRDP elaboration process. </p...|$|R
