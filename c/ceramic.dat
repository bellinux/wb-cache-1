5|$|Although the Ocosito <b>ceramic</b> {{tradition}} {{continued in}} use, the Late Preclassic ceramics in Takalik Abaj were {{strongly related to}} the Miraflores <b>Ceramic</b> Sphere that included Escuintla, the Valley of Guatemala and western El Salvador. This <b>ceramic</b> tradition consists of fine red wares that are particularly associated with Kaminaljuyu and are found throughout the southeastern Guatemalan highlands and the adjacent Pacific slope.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{bearings}} {{are both}} full <b>ceramic</b> bearings and <b>ceramic</b> hybrid bearings with balls in ceramics and races in steel. Silicon nitride ceramics have good shock resistance {{compared to other}} ceramics. Therefore, ball bearings made of silicon nitride <b>ceramic</b> are used in performance bearings. A representative example is use of silicon nitride bearings in the main engines of the NASA's Space Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Edward Everard's {{printing}} works with its detailed <b>ceramic</b> frontage {{was constructed in}} 1900.|$|E
5|$|I {{believe that}} my large statue in <b>ceramic,</b> the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the <b>ceramic</b> piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca {{constructed}} <b>ceramic</b> pottery for cooking, {{the extraction}} of salt from brines, as decorative ritual pieces and for the consumption of their alcoholic beverage; chicha. Large <b>ceramic</b> jars were found around the sacred archaeoastronomical site of El Infiernito, used for massive rituals where the people celebrated their festivities drinking chicha. Also musical instruments such as ocarinas were made of ceramics. The <b>ceramic</b> pots and sculptures were painted with zoomorphic figures that were common in the Muisca territory; frogs, armadillos, snakes and lizards. Main <b>ceramic</b> production centres were located close to the abundance of clays, in Tocancipá, Gachancipá, Cogua, Guatavita, Guasca and Ráquira.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church was {{unmatched}} in its <b>ceramic</b> decoration by any {{church in}} Preslav, {{and was the}} only known building {{in the city to}} rely heavily on polychrome <b>ceramic</b> tiles. <b>Ceramic</b> and mosaic icons were a highlight of the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the <b>ceramic</b> images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some of the images were enclosed in ellipses.|$|E
5|$|The alloy Al20Li20Mg10Sc20Ti30 is {{as strong}} as titanium, light as aluminium, and hard as <b>ceramic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>ceramic</b> waste forms offer higher waste {{loadings}} {{than the}} glass options because ceramics have crystalline structure. Also, mineral analogues of the <b>ceramic</b> waste forms {{provide evidence for}} long term durability. Due to this fact {{and the fact that}} they can be processed at lower temperatures, ceramics are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms. <b>Ceramic</b> waste forms offer great potential, but a lot of research remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|The {{site had}} a long and {{continuous}} settlement history, with the period of principal occupation stretching from the Middle Preclassic down to the Postclassic. The earliest known occupation at Takalik Abaj dates {{towards the end of}} the Early Preclassic, ca. 1000 BC. However, it was not until the Middle to Late Preclassic that its first real florescence began with a noted surge in architectural constructions. From this period onwards a continuity of culture and population settlement is in evidence, as represented by the persistence of a local <b>ceramic</b> style (called Ocosito) that remained in use until the Late Classic. The Ocosito style was typically made with red paste and pumice and extended westwards at least as far as Coatepeque, southwards to the Ocosito River and eastwards to the Samalá River. By the Terminal Classic, pottery associated with a highland K'iche' <b>ceramic</b> style had begun to appear intermixed with Ocosito <b>ceramic</b> complex deposits. Ocosito ceramics were replaced entirely by the K'iche' <b>ceramic</b> tradition by the Early Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{ceramics}} on the Altiplano {{started in the}} Herrera Period, with the oldest evidences of <b>ceramic</b> use dated at 3000 BP. The many different clays of the rivers and lakes of the valleys on the high plateau made a variety of <b>ceramic</b> types possible.|$|E
5|$|An Early Classic tomb was {{inserted}} under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; {{it had been}} tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 <b>ceramic</b> vessels. These were crushed when {{the roof of the}} tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones of four or more individuals. The <b>ceramic</b> offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One <b>ceramic</b> bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.|$|E
5|$|Burial 1 is a tomb in the Lost World complex. A fine <b>ceramic</b> bowl was {{recovered}} from the tomb, with the handle formed from three-dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two-dimensional body painted on the lid.|$|E
5|$|By 2012 {{the latest}} version had seen many {{improvements}} to the design, the engine and the overall driving experience. It now had 517 PS and 620 Nm of torque from the engine and came with carbon <b>ceramic</b> brakes as standard.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ceramic</b> finds at {{the site}} include {{frequent}} finds of incense-burners with handles and molded decoration. The most common domestic ceramics are of a micaceous ware and include <b>ceramic</b> comals (a type of griddle). Imported ceramics include Chinautla Polychrome and White-on-red, they are reasonably common {{at the site}}. Brown bowls are of a type also found in Zaculeu and Mixco Viejo, both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation. Three-legged metates (a kind of mortar) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black obsidian blades were found in great quantities. Simple jade jewellery was also found.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ceramic</b> {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in <b>ceramic</b> glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and <b>ceramic</b> formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ceramic</b> remains {{from the}} site include pieces that date {{as far back as}} the Preclassic Period but the {{majority}} of finds date to the Late Postclassic and the height of the K'iche' kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Copper oxide and {{carbonate}} {{are used}} add color in stain glass works, in glassmaking, and in <b>ceramic</b> glazes to impart turquoise blue, green, and brown colors.|$|E
5|$|During {{excavation}} of the site, four <b>ceramic</b> sherds {{were found in}} the vicinity which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 <b>ceramic</b> sherds dating from Roman Britain; although most of these were dated to the fourth century, the sherds reflected all four centuries of this period. Dated to the fourth century was a hut that had been erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Evidence of human activity at this hut was found in the form of 750 <b>ceramic</b> sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, thus suggesting that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.|$|E
5|$|Early Classic <b>ceramic</b> finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de San José {{and those that}} have been found were a minor {{component}} in mixed fill deposits. This suggests that Motul de San José was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San José itself, with several complete <b>ceramic</b> vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.|$|E
5|$|Ferrite, {{a type of}} {{sintered}} <b>ceramic</b> {{composed of}} Iron Oxide (Fe2O3) and barium oxide (BaO), is both electrically nonconductive and ferrimagnetic, and can be temporarily or permanently magnetized.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{there were}} still in {{existence}} the forest zone cultures, representing the <b>ceramic</b> phase of hunting and gathering communities. Some of them lasted into the early Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|Helen and Edward Mardigian Museum of Armenian Art and Culture {{was opened}} in 1969. Its {{exhibits}} consist of historical and religious artifacts, such as rugs, coins, copper cauldrons, <b>ceramic</b> tiles, a map, {{a replica of}} Johannes Gutenberg's printing press, etc.|$|E
5|$|High {{temperature}} parts such as combustors, blades, and vanes in {{jet engines}} and stationary gas turbines {{are increasingly being}} protected by thin <b>ceramic</b> layers, usually composed of a mixture of zirconia and yttria.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to painting and stained glass, Burne-Jones {{worked in a}} variety of crafts; including designing <b>ceramic</b> tiles, jewellery, tapestries, mosaics and book illustration, most famously designing woodcuts for the Kelmscott Press's Chaucer in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Like other hard {{ceramics}} (namely alumina and boron carbide), {{silicon carbide}} {{is used in}} composite armor (e.g. Chobham armor), and in <b>ceramic</b> plates in bulletproof vests. Dragon Skin, which was produced by Pinnacle Armor, used disks of silicon carbide.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) is an {{electrically}} conducting <b>ceramic</b> {{with primary}} use in heating elements operating at temperatures above 1500°C in air.|$|E
5|$|Pits sunk {{within the}} {{courtyard}} of the acropolis revealed 5425 <b>ceramic</b> fragments, 22 fragments of zoomorphic figurines, together with stone and shell artefacts, animal bones and waste flint chips, all dated to the Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|Postclassic Period {{occupation}} of El Chal {{has been identified}} from <b>ceramic</b> fragments recovered from Structure 1 in the Northwest Plaza. A few Postclassic potsherds were also excavated from Group 15 in the Central Sector.|$|E
5|$|Shin used archival {{photographs}} of the 2nd and 3rd Avenue Elevated train (El) to create compositions in <b>ceramic</b> tile, glass mosaic, and laminated glass. The imagery is manipulated and re-configured with each level having a different design. On the south east-corner entrance at Third Avenue, there are <b>ceramic</b> tiles depicting construction beams and the cranes that dismantled the El in the 1940s. At the mezzanine, a mosaic reveals the sky where the train had previously been present. The platform level features semi-transparent and reflective glass depicting vintage scenes of the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Silver is very {{important}} in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. Printed circuits and RFID antennas are made with silver paints, Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, <b>ceramic</b> capacitors, and other <b>ceramic</b> components.|$|E
5|$|The Ik-style <b>ceramic</b> corpus {{includes}} {{a set of}} features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life, {{something that is very}} rare in Mesoamerican art. The corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels, the majority of unknown provenance, which have been compared to <b>ceramic</b> fragments recovered from Motul de San José and its satellite sites. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic representations, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage {{includes}} a spring-mounted wooden pitch stick, and a <b>ceramic</b> mod wheel, {{similar to the}} Nord Lead and Nord Modular synthesizers.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} {{house is}} {{the most common type of}} home portrayed in Han artwork. <b>Ceramic</b> architectural models of buildings, like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife. These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture. The artistic designs found on <b>ceramic</b> roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{period was}} also renowned for {{ceramics}} and porcelains.The major production centers for porcelain were the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province and Dehua in Fujian province. The Dehua porcelain factories catered to European tastes by creating Chinese export porcelain by the 16th century. Individual potters also became known, such as He Chaozong, who became {{famous in the}} early 17th century for his style of white porcelain sculpture. In The <b>Ceramic</b> Trade in Asia, Chuimei Ho estimates that about 16% of late Ming era Chinese <b>ceramic</b> exports were sent to Europe, while the rest were destined for Japan and South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|There are 9 Bawang Assan Iban longhouses {{which are}} 40 {{minutes away from}} the town of Sibu. The longhouses can be dated back from 18th century {{traditional}} longhouses to present day modern longhouses. Visitors can enjoy traditional rice wine tuak and other delicacies such as sarang semut, kain kebat, and pansuh. These Iban longhouses showcase their lifestyles, customs, traditional dance, and music. Homestays are also available at these longhouses. There are 3 <b>ceramic</b> factories in Sibu. <b>Ceramic</b> designs mainly depicts traditional culture of the natives.|$|E
5|$|Though Han wooden {{structures}} decayed, some Han-dynasty ruins made of brick, stone, and rammed earth remain intact. This includes stone pillar-gates, brick tomb chambers, rammed-earth city walls, rammed-earth and brick beacon towers, rammed-earth {{sections of the}} Great Wall, rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood, and two rammed-earth castles in Gansu. The ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang'an and Luoyang still stand, along with their drainage systems of brick arches, ditches, and <b>ceramic</b> water pipes. Monumental stone pillar-gates, twenty-nine of which survive from the Han period, formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites. These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and <b>ceramic</b> building components such as roof tiles, eaves, and balustrades.|$|E
