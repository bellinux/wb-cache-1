Analysed the contribution {{to the development of}} research hegemony in international relations, which has made the school world-system analysis. According to its founder F. Braudel, the hegemony of the world is a manifestation of inequality, the latter reveals the structural realities that are approved very slowly, very slowly disappear. The concept of a follower of Fernand Braudel, Emmanuel Wallerstein, according to which the hegemony reflects the ability of a particular state to make one part of the international system to its customers, and the second - to drive into a defensive position. The development of the «modern world-system» is defined by Wallerstein changes hegemony. Wallerstein argues that the State has the ability to create a stable geopolitical system of unequal social division of powers, which are part of the normal functioning of the capitalist world-economy. It is also noted that the pattern of ups and downs of world leaders - hegemony - are considered in the research of many scientists, including George Modelski. He develops a theory about hundred-year cycle of global leadership, using the term «selection» to describe the process of competition and the adoption of this role. Among the concepts of hegemony also highlighted the <b>Charles</b> <b>Krauthammer’s</b> conception of monopolarity, on which the present geopolitical structure of the world after the «cold war» - one pole of world power, consisting of the United States as the top of the industrial West. Analyzed the  Piter Taylor’s conception of global hegemony, which distinguishes the competitive and non-competitive era, successive, and the Nail Ferguson’s conception of imperialism. The paper shows that the problem of hegemony in the 70 -th years passed from the purely theoretical plane into practical politics, becoming an important component of foreign policy studies major powers...|$|R

Conservative commentator <b>Charles</b> <b>Krauthammer</b> has referred to the statement in at least three of his columns, making an analogy to negotiating with China in 1989, with North Korea in 1994 and with Iran in 2006, and it was cited disparagingly in a 2006 speech by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E
500|$|Ehsan Ahrari of Asia Times accused some European {{countries}} of double standards in adopting laws that outlaw Holocaust denial but still defended {{the concept of}} freedom of speech in this case.

However, Denmark has no such laws and there wasand still isno EU-wide law against holocaust denial. Randall Hansen said that laws against holocaust denial were not directly comparable with restrictions on social satire, so could not be considered a double standard unless one believed in an absolute right to freedom of speech, and that those who do would doubtless oppose holocaust denial laws. Columnist <b>Charles</b> <b>Krauthammer</b> wrote that there was a double standard in many protesters' demands for religious sensitivity in this case, but not in others.

[...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies.

2500|$|Babies {{exposed to}} crack in utero were {{written off as}} doomed to be {{severely}} disabled, and many were abandoned in hospitals.

Crime rates were predicted to rise when the generation of crack-exposed infants grew up (instead they dropped). It was predicted that the children would be difficult to console, irritable, and hyperactive, putting a strain on the school system. <b>Charles</b> <b>Krauthammer,</b> a columnist for The Washington Post wrote in 1989, [...] "heirs will be a life of certain suffering, of probable deviance, of permanent inferiority." [...] The president of Boston University at the time, John Silber, said [...] "crack babies ... won't ever achieve the intellectual development to have consciousness of God."

[...] He argued that it was based on moral [...] "equivalences [...] been revealed as the cheap rhetorical tricks they always were", a [...] "pretense that this 'endless loop' of sermon excerpts being shown on 'television sets and YouTube' had been taken out of context" [...] that had now been destroyed, and an assertion that white surprise at Wright's anger was based on ignorance, rendered inoperative by Obama's own new admission of surprise.|$|E

[...] However, some Republicans did not receive the choice favorably. <b>Charles</b> <b>Krauthammer</b> of the Washington Post wrote, [...] "The Palin selection completely undercuts the argument about Obama's inexperience and readiness to lead....

[...] David Frum of National Review wrote: [...] "The longer I think about it, the less well this selection sits with me....

In the context of the Gulf War, on September 15, 1990, Buchanan appeared on The McLaughlin Group and said that [...] "there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East – the Israeli defense ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. They want us to finish them off. They don't care about our relations with the Arab world."

2500|$|In April 2010, Mearsheimer {{delivered}} the Hisham B.

[...] He argued that [...] "the two-state solution {{is now a}} fantasy" [...] because Israel will incorporate the Gaza Strip and the West Bank into a [...] "Greater Israel", which would become an apartheid state. This state, according to Mearsheimer, would not be politically viable, most American Jews would not support it, and it would eventually become a democratic bi-national state, politically dominated by its Palestinian majority.

He concludes that most of the [...] "great ambivalent middle" [...] would not defend an apartheid Israel because [...] "American Jews are among the staunchest defenders of traditional liberal values" [...] resulting in the [...] "new Afrikaners" [...] becoming increasingly marginalized over time. Mearsheimer stated that he [...] "would classify most of the individuals who head the Israel lobby’s major organizations as [...] "'new Afrikaners'" [...] and specifically listed Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, David Harris of the American Jewish Committee, Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Ronald Lauder of the World Jewish Congress, Morton Klein of the Zionist Organization of America, as well as businessmen such as Sheldon Adelson, Lester Crown, and Mortimer Zuckerman and [...] "media personalities" [...] like Fred Hiatt, <b>Charles</b> <b>Krauthammer,</b> Bret Stephens and Martin Peretz.|$|E
