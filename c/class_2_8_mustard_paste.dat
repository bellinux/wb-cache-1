40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{present a}} {{step-by-step}} {{example of the}} examination of heterogeneity within clinical trial data by using a growth mixture modeling (GMM) approach. MethodsSecondary data from a longitudinal double-blind clinical drug study were used. Patients received enalapril or placebo and were followed for 2 years during the drug component, followed by a 3 -year postdrug component. Primary variables of interest were creatinine levels during the drug component and number of hospitalizations in the postdrug component. Latent growth modeling (LGM) methods were {{used to examine the}} treatment response variability in the data. GMM methods were applied where substantial variability was found to identify latent (unobserved) subsets of differential responders, using treatment groups as known classes. Post hoc analyses were applied to characterize emergent subgroups. ResultsLGM methods demonstrated a large variability in creatinine levels. GMM methods identified two subsets of patients for each treatment group. Placebo <b>class</b> <b>2</b> (7. 0 % of the total sample) and enalapril <b>class</b> <b>2</b> (<b>8.</b> 5 %) include individuals whose creatinine levels start at 1. 114 mg/dl and 1. 108 mg/dl, respectively, and show worsening (slopes: 0. 023 and 0. 017, respectively). Placebo class 1 (43. 1 %) and enalapril class 1 (41. 4 %) individuals start with lower creatinine levels (1. 082 and 1. 083 mg/dl, respectively) and show very minimal change (0. 008 and 0. 003, respectively). Post hoc analyses revealed significant differences between placebo/enalapril class 1 and placebo/enalapril <b>class</b> <b>2</b> in terms of New York Heart Association functional ability, depression, functional impairment, creatinine levels, mortality, and hospitalizations.

40|$|Closed {{circular}} Moloney {{murine leukemia}} virus (M-MuLV) DNA was prepared from recently infected cells and cloned in a lambda vector. Four classes of cloned M-MuLV inserts were found: Class I, full length 8. 8 -kilobase (kb) inserts with two tandem long terminal repeats (LTRs) of 600 base pairs; <b>class</b> <b>2,</b> <b>8.</b> <b>2</b> -kb inserts with a single copy of a LTR; class 3, M-MuLV DNA inserts with various portions deleted; and class 4, an 8. 8 -kb insert with an internal sequence inversion. Determination of nucleotide sequence at the junction between the two LTRs from a class 1 insert suggested that circularization occurred by blunt-end ligation of an 8. 8 -kb linear DNA. The class 4 molecule had an inversion that was flanked by inverted LTRs, each of which had lost two terminal base pairs at the inversion end points. Also, four base pairs that were present only once in standard M-MuLV DNA were duplicated {{at either end of}} the inversion. This molecule was interpreted as resulting from an integrative inversion in which M-MuLV DNA has integrated into itself.

Long term follow up (30  (4) months, range 24 - 36 months) included symptoms, echocardiographic measurements of left atrial and left ventricular dimensions and function, and LVOTG.  RESULTS—Mean postinterventional creatine kinase rise was 780  (436)  U/l. During PTSMA 13  patents developed total heart block, permanent pacing being necessary in five of them. One 86  year old patient died from ventricular fibrillation associated with intensive treatment (β mimetic and theophylline) for coexistent severe obstructive airway disease. After three months, three patients underwent re-PTSMA because of a dissatisfactory primary result, leading to LVOTG elimination in all of them. During long term follow up, LVOTG showed sustained reduction (3  (6)  mm Hg at rest and 12  (19)  mm Hg with provocation) associated with stable symptomatic improvement (NYHA <b>class</b> 1. <b>2</b>  (1. 0)) and without significant global left ventricular dilatation.  CONCLUSIONS—PTSMA is an effective non-surgical technique for reduction of symptoms and LVOTG in HOCM.

The authors report a retrospective study of 35 patients who underwent partial cavo-pulmonary bypass between November 1985 and October 1999 at the Geneva Children's Hospital with an average follow-up of 4 years. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 6. 4 years. Fourteen per cent of patients had tricuspid atresia, 37 % had a single ventricle, 49 % had an irreparable biventricular cardiopathy and 71 % had already had a previous palliative procedure. There were 2 early and 6 late deaths. The 5 year survival was 71. 2 % and the 10 year survival: 62. 3 %. The commonest early complications were arrhythmias (11 / 35), chylothorax (9 / 35) and superior vena cava syndromes (9 / 35). The late complications observed were arrhythmias (4 / 35) and suboptimal function of the partial cavo-pulmonary bypass (7 / 35). Eighty eight per cent of patients were symornatically improved at one year (average NYHA <b>Class</b> <b>2.</b> <b>8</b> before and 1. 7 after one year), and 40 % of patients were asymptomatic at this time. The haematocrit decreased after partial cavo-pulmonary bypass but tended to rise again progressively to preoperative values after 9 years. Only 49 % of survivors had not been reoperated 10 years after partial cavo-pulmonary bypass. Partial cavo-pulmonary bypass is therefore associated with a temporary improvement of symptoms and polycythaemia in children with complex cyanotic heart disease: later reoperation is often required...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{contemporary}} risk of reoperative {{aortic valve}} replacement is ill-defined. We therefore compared the recent early results of reoperative and primary aortic valve replacement in our institution. MethodsBetween January 1993 and January 2001, {{a total of}} 162 patients underwent reoperative aortic valve replacement with or without coronary artery bypass grafting, and 2290 underwent primary aortic valve replacement with or without coronary artery bypass grafting. The reoperative and primary groups were similar with regard to gender (37 % female in both), preoperative New York Heart Association functional <b>class</b> (<b>2.</b> <b>8</b> ± 1 vs <b>2.</b> <b>8</b> ± 1), and ejection fraction (58 % ± 15 % vs 57 % ± 15 %). Patients undergoing reoperative aortic valve replacement were younger than those undergoing primary aortic valve replacement (64 ± 15 years vs 70 ± 13 years, P <. 001). Previous prostheses were xenografts in 77 patients (48 %), homografts and autografts in 25 (15 %), and mechanical prostheses in 60 (37 %). Mean time to reoperation was 9. 7 ± 6. 8 years. ResultsEarly mortality for reoperative aortic valve replacement (8 / 162, 5 %) was not statistically different from that for primary aortic valve replacement (71 / 2290, 3 %, P =. 20). Endocarditis was {{more common in the}} reoperative group (22 % vs 3 %, P <. 001); when endocarditis was excluded from the analysis, early mortality was 3 % in both groups. Multivariate predictors for early mortality were prosthetic valve endocarditis (P <. 001, odds ratio 9. 8), advanced preoperative functional class (P <. 001, odds ratio 2. 0), peripheral vascular disease (P =. 008, odds ratio 2. 0), preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (P =. 004, odds ratio 0. 98), and male gender (P =. 009, odds ratio 0. 49). After adjustment for these factors, {{there was no difference in}} early mortality between the groups (P =. 095).

The histopathological variables associated with improvement in ejection fraction 6 months after surgery were assessed. METHODS: This study comprised 24 patients indicated for coronary artery bypass grafting, ejection fraction < 35 %, functional class II-IV heart failure, and mean age 59 ± 9 years. Endomyocardial biopsies were performed during and 6 months after surgery. Extension of the fibrosis, number of cells with myocytolysis, and hypertrophy of the muscle fiber were quantified by using a system of image analysis. Clinical and functional review was repeated within 6 months. RESULTS: A significant improvement in heart failure functional class was observed in 16 patients after 6 months of follow-up (from NYHA functional <b>class</b> <b>2.</b> <b>8</b> ± 0. 7 to 1. 7 ± 0. 6; P < 0. 001), but the ejection fraction did not change (25 ± 6 % vs. 26 ± 10 %).

40|$|International audiencePurpose: Pre-implant {{predictors}} of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) {{are not fully}} investigated in patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). A sensitive marker of VA in these patients will be valuable for correct choice of CRT type, {{with or without a}} cardioverter defibrillator (CRT-D). We aimed to explore if assessment of left ventricular (LV) function by speckle tracking strain echocardiography could predict VA in heart failure patients eligible for CRT. Methods: We investigated heart failure patients with left bundle branch block treated with CRT. Echocardiography was performed before CRT-implantation and after 6 months (CRT turned on). Systolic myocardial function was assessed as LV ejection fraction (EF) by Simpson biplane method and global longitudinal strain (GLS) using speckle tracking technique. VA was defined as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia or appropriate anti-tachycardia pacing or shock during 2 years follow-up from CRT-implantation. Results: We included 73 heart failure patients (NYHA <b>class</b> <b>2.</b> <b>8</b> ± 0. 4, EF 28 ± 9 %), 44 % with ischemic and 56 % with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. VA was documented in 19 patients (26 %). LV function by GLS was lower in patients with VA compared to those without VA during 2 years follow-up, both at baseline (- 6. 3 ± 4 vs. - 8. 8 ± 4 %, p= 0. 03) and at 6 months (- 5. 9 ± 6 vs. - 9. 7 ± 5 %, p= 0. 01). EF was not a marker of VA during 2 years follow-up, neither at baseline (26 ± 10 vs. 29 ± 9 %, p= 0. 26) nor at 6 months (36 ± 8 vs. 41 ± 12 %, p= 0. 18). Conclusions: In our study LV function by GLS was a marker of subsequent VA in heart failure patients receiving CRT, while EF was not.

The {{purpose of the study was}} to prospectively analyze the results of early follow-up angiography of embolized ruptured aneurysms in an attempt to determine factors predicting the presence of residual flow. Material and Methods: Evaluation included 72 patients with 72 aneurysms, which were followed-up 3 months after the treatment. Analysis of residual flow predictors included: age and gender, clinical state in Hunt-Hess scale, aneurysm localization, aneurysm three dimensions and volume, neck width, sac-to-neck ratio, initial result of embolization, number of coils used and the use of hydrogel coils and stents. Results: Mean sac diameter was 6. 5 ± 3. 9 mm, and mean neck width was 2. 9 ± 1. 4 mm. Follow-up angiography presented residual flow in 26 aneurysms (36. 1 %) : <b>class</b> <b>2</b> in <b>8</b> aneurysms (11. 1 %), and class 3 in 18 cases (25. 0 %).

40|$|The {{structure}} of the Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste) ] locus on the Drosophila melanogaster Y chromosome was examined by restriction analysis of both native and cloned genomic DNA. The locus consists of short subarrays of tandem repeats separated by members of other moderately repeated families. Both size variants and restriction variants proved to be common. Most repeats fell into two size <b>classes</b> [...] <b>2.</b> <b>8</b> and <b>2.</b> 5 kb [...] but other size variants were also observed. Restriction variants showed a strong tendency to cluster, both at the gross level where some variants were present in only one of three subintervals of the locus, and at the fine level, where repeats from the same phage clone were significantly more similar than repeats from different clones. Restriction variants were shared freely among repeats of different size classes; however, size variants appeared to be randomly distributed among phage clones. These data indicate that recombination among tandem Su(Ste) repeats occurs at much higher frequencies between close neighbors than distant ones. In addition, they suggest that gene conversion rather than sister chromatid exchange may be the primary recombinational mechanism for spreading variation among repeats at the Su(Ste) locus...|$|R

Thus we evaluated clinical and functional response to CRT in HF patients (pts) after a longer follow-up period (up to 3 years, ys). We enrolled 75 HF outpts with CRT indication [30 % females, mean age 67. 9 ± 12. 6 ys, mean NYHA <b>class</b> <b>2.</b> <b>8</b> ± 0. 7, mean EF 25. 7 ± 8. 1, HF aetiology: 44 % coronary artery disease (CAD), 43 % dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 6 % hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HT), 7 % valvular disease (V) ]. All were evaluated by means of ECG, echocardiography, NYHA functional class before CRT device implant and re-evaluated after 1 (95 % of pts), 2 (80 % of pts), and 3 (45 % of pts) ys. After 1 y, NYHA significantly improved (from <b>2.</b> <b>8</b> ± 0. 7 to 2. 3 ± 0. 6, p< 0. 0001), as well as EF (from 25. 7 ± 8. 1 to 30. 1 ± 9. 0, p= 0. 005). This improvement was maintained after 2 ys (NYHA 2. 3 ± 0. 6, EF 31. 8 ± 9. 4) and 3 ys (NYHA 2. 2 ± 0. 6, EF 33. 4 ± 10. 2). Overall, we registered 8 deaths, of which 2 (2. 7 %) after 1 y, 3 (4 %) after 2 ys and 3 (4 %) after 3 ys. Dividing pts {{on the basis of}} HF aetiology, after 1 y all pts presented a significant improvement, while further on DCM pts showed a steady increase of EF (basal 22. 9 ± 7. 8, after 1 y 28. 8 ± 9. 5, after 2 ys 31. 3 ± 11. 1 and after 3 ys 35. 4 ± 13. 3), while CAD pts showed stabilization of EF on the first y values (basal 26. 3 ± 7. 3, after 1 y 29. 5 ± 7. 4, after 2 ys 29. 7 ± 6. 3 and after 3 ys 29. 9 ± 5. 2). Echocardiographic response to CRT in terms of EF is clearly evident after 1 y and remains improved after 2 and also 3 ys, with a not significant trend to further improve in DCM.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{filament}} eruption/coronal mass ejection (CME) event {{associated with a}} flare of GOES <b>class</b> M <b>2.</b> <b>8</b> that occurred on November 17, 2001. This event was observed by the Nobeyama RadioHeliograph (NoRH) at 17 and 34 GHz. NoRH observes the filament during its eruption both as a dark feature against the solar disk and a bright feature above the solar limb. The high cadence of the radio data allows us to follow {{the motion of the}} filament at high time resolution to a height of more than half a solar radius. The filament eruption shows a very gradual onset and then a rapid acceleration phase coincident with the launch of a fast halo CME. Soft X–ray and EUV images show heating in a long loop underneath the filament prior to the flare. The NoRH height–time plot of the filament shows a roughly constant gradual acceleration for an hour, followed by a very abrupt acceleration coincident with the impulsive phase of the associated flare, and then a phase of constant velocity or much slower acceleration. This pattern is identical to that recently found to occur in the motion of flare–associated CMEs, which also show a sharp acceleration phase closely tied t...|$|R

While a group comprising only clear or near knot-free boards was established for the validation sample as well, a good separation between boards with large sound knots and boards with smaller dead knots was not accomplished. As compositions 2 and 3 in Fig.  8 b illustrate, boards with predominantly large sound knots and boards with black knots were mixed in those groups with some near clear boards distributed over both.|$|R

All patients had their aortic valve replaced by Omniscience or Meditronic prosthesis; 112 formed the study group because they have complete follow up and cineangiocardiographic data. Based on pre-operatory left ventricular ejection fraction the patients were divided in two groups: Group 1 = 52 patients with LVEF > 40 %, 39 ± 12 years, NYHA functional <b>class</b> <b>2.</b> <b>8,</b> and EF 58 ± 10 %. Group 2 = 60 patients with LVEF < 40, 48 ± 17 years, NYHA functional class 3. 6, and LVEF of 27 ± 12 %. During surgery moderate hypothermia and hemodilution were utilized, with dubble oxygenator and cardioplegia With St. Thomas cardioplegic solution. Mean extracorporeal circulation and cardiac arrest time were respectively 82 ± 18 and 49 ± 7 minutes in Group 1 and 96 ± 11 and 55 ± 6 minutes in Group 2. The size of the prosthesis were 25. <b>2</b> ± 1. <b>8</b> mm in Group 1.

We aimed {{to assess the}} safety and efficacy of the Reducer in a real-world cohort of patients with refractory angina.  Methods  This is a single-centre retrospective registry. Patients with severe angina symptoms, objective evidence of myocardial ischaemia using any adequate non-invasive modality and without options for conventional revascularisation were regarded eligible for Reducer implantation.   Results Twenty-three patients (74 % male, mean age 70 ± 8 years, 91. 3 % previous bypass surgery, 82. 6 % previous percutaneous intervention, 47. 8 % previous myocardial infarction, 52. 2 % diabetes mellitus) underwent Reducer implantation. The safety endpoint (successful implantation of the first device without device-related adverse events) was met in all patients. After a median follow-up of 9 (8 – 14) months the efficacy (any reduction in Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class and revascularisation-free survival) was reached in 17 patients (74 %) : 8 patients (34. 8 %) improved by 1 CCS class, 7 (30. 4 %) by <b>2</b> CCS <b>classes</b> and <b>2</b> (<b>8.</b> 7 %) by 3 CCS classes.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Although cardiac {{transplantation}} {{has been}} performed for complete removal of ventricular tumors, complete surgical resection with ventricular reconstruction is desirable. Thus patients with benign tumors {{would probably be}} cured, and those with malignant tumors {{would have a better}} prognosis. In this study extensive and complete surgical resection of ventricular tumors is followed by anatomic and functional ventricular reconstruction with a dynamic cardiomyoplasty procedure. Methods: Seven patients (mean age, 32. 7 years) underwent complete resection of ventricular tumors. Histologic types were distributed as follows: fibroma in 2 patients and sarcoma, lymphosarcoma, hemangioma, lipoma, and metastatic angiosarcoma, respectively, in the remaining 5 patients. Six of the patients were considered candidates for heart transplantation because of the extent of tumor invasion. Surgery consisted of 4 steps: (1) tumor resection; (2) coronary artery resection (when invaded by the tumor) and coronary artery bypass grafting; (3) valvular reconstruction (when possible) or replacement; and (4) ventricular wall reconstruction with a pericardial patch for closure of the ventricular defect (neoendocardium) covered by the electrostimulated latissimus dorsi muscle flap (neomyocardium). Results: All patients survived surgical intervention, but 2 late postoperative deaths are reported. Among the surviving patients, early complications {{played a major role in}} their postoperative course and consisted of arrhythmias, atrioventricular block necessitating a dual-chamber pulse generator, respiratory insufficiency, and heart failure. Two patients were assisted postoperatively with an intra-aortic balloon pump. On postoperative follow-up (mean, 72. 4 ± 8. 5 months), an improvement in the patients' functional status was observed. Patients moved from a mean New York Heart Association functional <b>class</b> of <b>2.</b> <b>8</b> to a mean functional <b>class</b> of 1. <b>2.</b> Conclusions: The excellent long-term evolution without recurrence, ventricular dysfunction, and/or thromboembolic complications implies that cardiomyoplasty could be recommended as an alternative to heart transplantation for the therapy of large ventricular tumors.
