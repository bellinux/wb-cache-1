For the supply of railways with much rail traffic and in particular for the power supply of high speed railway lines such as the German ICE (Inter City Express) trains, conductors of two bundles are used.

50|$|Snubbers are {{frequently}} used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow {{leads to a}} sharp rise in voltage across the <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> device, in accordance with Faraday's law. This transient can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> device so that the inductive element may be discharged more safely and quietly. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While <b>current</b> <b>switching</b> is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in power supplies. Snubbers are also often used to prevent arcing across the contacts of relays and switches and the electrical interference and welding/sticking of the contacts that can occur (see also arc suppression).|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} approach {{based on an}} interferometer composed by two quantum dots asymmetrically coupled to isolated Majorana quasiparticles (MQPs), lying {{on the edges of}} two topological Kitaev chains, respectively via couplings (t+Δ) and (Δ-t). This setup enables us to probe MQPs in a quite distinct way from the zero-bias peak feature. Most importantly, the system behaves as a <b>current</b> <b>switch</b> made by two distinct paths: (i) for the upper dot connected to both chains, the device perceives both MQPs as an ordinary fermion and the current crosses solely the lower dot, since current in the upper dot is prevented due to the presence of the superconducting gap; and (ii) by suppressing slightly the hybridization of the upper dot with one chain, the <b>current</b> is abruptly <b>switched</b> to flow through this dot, once a trapped electron as a bound state in the continuum (BIC) (Phys. Rev. B 93, 165116 (2016)) appears in the lower dot. Such a <b>current</b> <b>switch</b> between upper and lower dots characterizes the Quantum Phase Transition (QPT) proposed here, being the ratio t/Δ the control parameter of the transition. This QPT is associated with a change from an ordinary fermionic excitation regime to a MQP in the interferometer, which enables not only the fundamental revealing of MQPs, but also yields a <b>current</b> <b>switch</b> assisted by them...|$|R
