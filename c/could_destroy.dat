5|$|Gliese 876 c lies at {{the inner}} edge of the system's {{habitable}} zone. While the prospects for life on gas giants are unknown, {{it might be possible}} for a large moon of the planet to provide a habitable environment. Unfortunately tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet, and the star <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> moons massive enough to be habitable over the lifetime of the system. In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The Special Operations Executive were {{approached}} {{to see if}} its agents <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> the dock gates. They decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them. The Royal Navy was also unable to mount an operation, as St Nazaire is 8km (5 miles) up the Loire estuary. Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} {{the events of the}} first film, Peter struggles to balance his superhero and private lives and still pines after Mary Jane Watson, who is now engaged. Harry Osborn {{continues}} to believe Spider-Man is responsible for his father Norman Osborn's death. Spider-Man contends with scientist Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), a.k.a. Dr. Octopus, who has four mechanical tentacles fused to his spine and sets out to recreate a fusion-based experiment that <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> much of New York City.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the demons}} learn {{of a giant}} {{structure}} {{on one of the}} moons orbiting the planet, Malduke, that was designed to be a space station for residential and military purposes, possessing a powerful weapon that <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> Filgaia. Inside the demons' newly-arisen tower Ka Dingel that connects with Malduke, Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia confront what remains of their adversaries before reaching the teleportation device to take them to Malduke. Within Malduke's deepest sanctum, they confront Zeikfried, who transforms into a revived Mother. This new being, Motherfried, confronts the heroes with the intent of using Malduke's primary weapon to destroy Filgaia, but is defeated.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, 1980, IAF guided {{missiles}} destroyed two armored cars carrying SA-9 batteries, {{manned by}} Libyan troops, near Sidon. The Israeli media declared that {{a solution to}} the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, said that this assessment was premature, and that the SA-9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> the SAM batteries in two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do nothing of the kind.|$|E

5|$|The king of {{one country}} {{threatened}} by the beast's arrival was advised to offer it a weekly sacrifice of seven virgins. In desperation the king eventually issued a proclamation offering his kingdom, his daughter's hand in marriage and a magic sword to anyone who <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> the monster. Assipattle, the youngest son of a local farmer, defeated the creature; as it died its teeth fell out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes, and its body became Iceland.|$|E
5|$|They {{encountered}} Native Americans, {{who would}} sometimes demand provisions for passage, but none were given {{and none of}} the incidents ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting bison, which roamed the Great Plains in huge numbers. Despite being a source of food, the bison were a danger as their stampedes <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> property and kill irreplaceable stock. In southeastern Idaho, the California Trail separated from the Oregon, and Buck and some {{of the rest of the}} party split off there; they settled in California and remained friends with Meeker until their deaths.|$|E
5|$|After Groenlo was secured, Mondragón marched {{south to}} Rheinberg {{to cover the}} town from a Dutch attack. He encamped his army near Wesel, at Dinslaken, while Maurice {{followed}} him and took up positions at Bislich, both armies being separated by the Lippe river. The Spanish position was strong; the rearguard and the left flank covered by the Rhine and the right flank by the Lippe {{and a range of}} moorland hills called Testerburg. For several weeks both armies looked at each other, often skirmishing when both cavalries sallied to forage. As time passed, the Spanish foragers were forced to look for victuals two or three leagues far away from their camp. Maurice took the opportunity to plan a mock ambush on Mondragón's foraging convoy aiming to lure him into a general action in which he <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> the Spanish army. Mondragón also hoped to lure his enemy into a trap.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{was highly}} {{alarmed by the}} Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the {{remaining}} months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile. In November 1906, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, , remarked that {{any one of the}} new Brazilian vessels <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. Despite the seeming hyperbole, his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets. With this in mind, the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers opined that maintaining the older Libertad class or Capitán Prat (respectively) was now a waste of money.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The other members hoped he would reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt and felt his {{departure}} <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split up on top of seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E

5|$|Only twelve {{men were}} picked up before the ship capsized and sank at 19:26, and five of them died after being rescued. Among the dead was one of Spee's sons, Otto von Spee. In total, 327 {{officers}} and men {{were killed in the}} battle. In the course of the engagement, Nürnberg had hit Kent thirty-eight times, but did not cause significant damage. One shell struck one of Kents casemate guns and ignited the propellant charges inside, but the magazine was flooded before the fire <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> the ship. The sinking was commemorated in a painting entitled The Last Man by Hans Bohrdt, which depicted a German sailor waving the Imperial ensign as Nürnberg slipped beneath the waves.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{personally}} pinned a Silver Star on Leclerc, {{and brought}} with him another six Silver Stars and 25 Bronze Star Medals for {{other members of the}} 2e DB. Patton then gave Leclerc his next objective: the town of Baccarat and the bridge there over the Meurthe River. The bridge was captured before the Germans <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> it. Haislip's XV Corps was transferred to the Seventh United States Army on 29 September, and Leclerc feared that 2e DB would be transferred to Général d'armée Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's French First Army. Leclerc regarded the First Army as being full of traitors who had supported Vichy France. Moreover, de Lattre had sacked Général de division Edgard de Larminat for Gaullist sentiments, and Leclerc had good reason to fear that he might meet a similar fate.|$|E
5|$|Redback spiders {{are also}} found in small colonies in areas of New Zealand. They are {{frequently}} intercepted by quarantine authorities, often among steel or car shipments. They were introduced into New Zealand in the early 1980s and now are found around Central Otago (including Alexandra, Bannockburn and near Wanaka) in the South Island and New Plymouth in the North Island. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates warn residents and visitors of redback spiders, which have been present since 1990. Colonies have also been established in greenhouses in Belgium, and isolated observations indicate possible presence in New Guinea, the Philippines, and India. Some redbacks were found in Preston, Lancashire, England, after a container of parts arrived from Australia; some may have escaped into the countryside before pest controllers <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> them. One redback {{was found in a}} back garden in Dartford in Kent. Two females were discovered in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The Persians had now {{captured}} most of Greece, but Xerxes had {{perhaps not}} expected such defiance; his priority was now {{to complete the}} war as quickly as possible. If Xerxes <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> the Allied navy, {{he would be in}} a strong position to force an Allied surrender; conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Allies could prevent conquest from being completed. The Allied fleet thus remained off the coast of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell, the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle. Partly because of deception by Themistocles, the navies met in the cramped Straits of Salamis. There, the Persian numbers became a hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the Allied fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships, therefore ensuring the safety of the Peloponnessus.|$|E
5|$|The {{allies were}} aware of Rupert's {{approach}} and had been hoping that reinforcements from the Midlands under Sir John Meldrum and the Earl of Denbigh could ward off this threat, but they learned that these forces could not intervene in time. The allied armies around York were separated from each other by rivers, and if Rupert attacked them in their siege lines he <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> any one army before the other two could come to its aid. Therefore, they abandoned the siege {{on the night of}} 30 June, and concentrated their forces near the village of Hessay before taking position on Marston Moor, where they blocked Rupert's expected direct march to York (along the old Roman road named Ermine Street, the modern A59), and could easily move to their left to prevent Rupert making any move to the south via Wetherby.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{years after}} the Falklands {{conflict}} Bravo November saw service in Iraq, being the first British helicopter to land Royal Marines ashore. After departing from , Bravo November landed the first Royal Marines on to the Al-Faw peninsula to seize oil-pumping facilities before Iraqi troops <b>could</b> <b>destroy</b> them. The second DFC for actions at the controls of Bravo November was awarded to Squadron Leader Steve Carr {{for his role in}} an operation in Iraq. Bravo November was tasked with delivering the Marines to the landing sites marked by US special forces before returning for more troops, guns and freight. The aircraft was being flown at an altitude of less than 100ft with restricted visibility due to dust clouds thrown up by American armoured forces.|$|E
