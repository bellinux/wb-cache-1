25|$|Physically, younger gymnasts, {{particularly}} {{those who have not}} yet gone through puberty, tend to be lighter, smaller, more pliable and flexible, which aids them in performing more <b>complex</b> <b>skills</b> and gives them a better strength-to-weight ratio. When a gymnast hits puberty, growth spurts and weight gain may affect her centre of gravity, causing mental and physical stress as she must adjust, and in some cases relearn, her moves to compensate. Smaller athletes have generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the evolving Code of Points after the 1960s. In addition, older gymnasts may be more prone to certain types of injuries caused by overuse of bones and muscles; younger gymnasts are less likely to have such problems, or more {{likely to be able to}} work through pain while injured.|$|E

25|$|Age {{and genetic}} factors {{influence}} {{the risk of}} developing alcohol-related neurotoxicity. Adolescence, especially early adolescence (i.e. before age 15), is a critical and delicate developmental stage for specialised neuronal and synaptic systems mature. This critical developmental stage is where lifelong adult traits e.g., talents, reasoning and <b>complex</b> <b>skills</b> mature; however alcohol and in particular binge drinking may disrupt and interfere with this developmental process. Adolescence is also a period of development characterised by a high level of novel seeking, thrill seeking and risk taking behaviour and thus alcohol and other drug experimentation and abuse is common. An adolescent rat study found that a relatively short exposure to high levels of alcohol resulted in long-lasting changes to functional brain activity with corresponding abnormalities in EEG brain waves that persisted into adulthood, including persisting disturbances in sleep EEG with a reduction in slow wave sleep. These EEG findings are similar to premature aging. According to one review of the literature, if the developmental stage of adolescence is similar to the developmental stage of the fetus with regard to sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol, and if long-lasting or permanent damage to the brain occurs similar to what animal studies suggest, then this represents a major public health issue due to the high levels of alcohol use by adolescents. Indeed, alcohol can affect the remodeling and functional changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity in different brain regions that occurs during adolescence (see this related article).|$|E

40|$|Autism is {{a life-long}} neurodevelopment {{disorder}} affecting 1 in every 150 {{children in the}} United States. Along with the three major hallmarks of autism; impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive and restricted stereotypes of behavior, individuals with autism face a variety of impairments that affect their everyday functioning. These impairments include, {{but are not limited}} to, impairments in motor skills, impairments in sensory-perceptual skills, and impairments in executive functioning (EF) skills. This dissertation explored these aforementioned impairments in individuals with high-functioning autism (IHFA) in three studies. The first study explored simple and complex motor and simple and <b>complex</b> sensory-perceptual <b>skills</b> differences between IHFA and typically-developing individuals (TDI) for different age groups extending from childhood to early adulthood. The study found IHFA to be impaired compared to TDI on simple and <b>complex</b> motor <b>skills</b> across the continuum of age. However, for sensory-perceptual skills IHFA impairments were found only for <b>complex</b> sensory-perceptual <b>skills</b> for an older group of IHFA. The second study explored factors that were associated with good and poor <b>complex</b> fine-motor <b>skills</b> for IHFA and TDI. Two models were generated utilizing Exhaustive Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). In this study, we found different factors to be associated with <b>complex</b> fine-motor <b>skills</b> for IHFA versus TDI. The patterns of association for IHFA were also different from TDI. In the third study, we explored the factors that were associated with good and poor EF skills by generating two models, one for IHFA and one for TDI, utilizing Exhaustive CHAID. In this study, we found similar factors to be associated with EF skills for both IHFA and TDI, however, the factors held different levels of association with EF in each group. Findings from the first study suggest the importance of early assessment and continuous re-assessment of simple and <b>complex</b> motor <b>skills</b> and <b>complex</b> sensory-perceptual <b>skills</b> for IHFA. Findings from the second and third study offer models that have the potential to establish priorities for assessment and intervention for IHFA...|$|R
40|$|We {{reported}} a computational model of <b>complex</b> <b>skill</b> learning that captures the differential effects of Fixed Priority (FP) and Varied Priority (VP) training on <b>complex</b> <b>skill</b> learning. The model is developed based on learning mechanisms {{associated with the}} modular circuits linking Basal Ganglia, the prefrontal association cortex, and the pre-motor cortex during skill learning. Two forms of learning occur simultaneously. In discrimination learning, goal-directed actions are selected through recognition of external stimuli through the connections between the frontal cortex and the striatum, and is mediated by dopaminergic signals through a reinforcement learning mechanism. With practice, skill learning shifts from discrimination learning to Hebbian learning, which directly associates stimuli to responses by strengthening {{the connection between the}} prefrontal and pre-motor cortex. The model shows that FP training, in which all task components are equally weighted during training, leads to less flexible discrimination learning than VP training. The model explains why VP training benefits lower performance participants more, and why learning was more strongly correlated with the size of the striatum in VP than FP training...|$|R

40|$|Skill {{shortages}} {{are often}} {{portrayed as a}} major problem for the economies of many countries including the Australian economy. Yet, there is surprisingly little evidence about their prevalence, causes and consequences. This paper attempts to improve our understanding about these issues by using econometric methods to analyse the Business Longitudinal Database, an Australian panel data-set with information about skill shortages in small- and medium-sized businesses during 2004 / 05. We use this information to: (1) explore the incidence of skill shortages and the business attributes that are associated with them; (2) identify which businesses face more <b>complex</b> <b>skill</b> shortages, as measured by the number of different causes reported simultaneously; and, uniquely, (3) examine how this complexity affects a business response to skill shortages and aspects of their subsequent performance. We show that <b>complex</b> <b>skill</b> shortages are more likely than simpler (single-cause) skill shortages to persist and to trigger defensive responses from businesses. We reject the conception of skill shortages as a homogenous phenomenon, and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between skill shortages according to whether they have simple or complex causes...|$|R
