5000|$|Irwin then {{announced}} that the <b>contact</b> <b>light</b> had illuminated, indicating one of the landing probes on the LM's feet had contacted the ground. Immediately Scott cut the engine. With the extended engine bell there was a fear that it could touch the ground and cause exhaust to travel back into the engine. It is estimated that they were travelling 6.8 ft/s (2 m/s) when they hit, {{twice as fast as}} previous missions. A few seconds later, Scott informed the ground that [...] "Okay, Houston. The Falcon is on the Plain at Hadley." [...] Falcon was tilted nearly 10 degrees to its back left, just 5° below the maximum acceptable angle. It set down on the rim of a crater such that its engine bell was damaged, and with one of the legs in the crater. They were about 600 meters north and about 175 meters west of the targeted landing site. This was of little concern though thanks to the capabilities of the rover.|$|E

40|$|Restricted area heterojunctions, {{an array}} of lead sulfide {{colloidal}} quantum dots (PbS-CQDs) and crystalline silicon, are studied with a non-destructive remote <b>contact</b> <b>light</b> beam induced current (RC-LBIC) technique. As well as getting good quality active area images we observed an anomalous unipolar signal response for the PbS-CQD/n-Si devices and a conventionally expected bipolar signal profile for the PbS-CQD/p-Si devices. Interestingly, our simulation results consistently yielded a unipolar and bipolar nature in the signals related to the PbSCQD/n-Si and PbS-CQD/p-Si heterostructures, respectively. In order to explain the physical mechanism involved in the unipolar signal response of the PbS-CQD/n-Si devices, we propose a model based on the band alignment in the heterojunctions, {{in addition to the}} distribution of photo-induced excess majority carriers across the junction. Given that the RC-LBIC technique is well suited to this context, the presence of these two distinct mechanisms (the bipolar and unipolar nature of the signals) needs to be considered {{in order to have a}} better interpretation of the data in the characterization of {{an array of}} homo/heterojunctions...|$|E

The cells are deposited in nip/nip configuration on the plastic substrate coated with a highly reflecting Ag-ZnO back <b>contact.</b> <b>Light</b> trapping is achieved by combining a periodically textured substrate and a diffusing ZnO front contact. Single junction microcrocystalline cell with a stable efficiency of 8. 6 % and 8. 4 % are achieved with i-layer thickness of 1. 8 and 1. 2 µm respectively. In tandem devices we obtain an efficiency of 10. 9 % (initial) with an open circuit voltage of 1. 35 V and a FF of 71. 5 %. These cells are slightly top limited with 11. 26 and 11. 46 mA/cm 2 in the amorphous (270 nm thick) and the microcrystalline sub-cells (1. 2 µm thick), respectively. We introduce an intermediate reflector between the bottom and the top cell because it allows increasing the top cell current without compromising stability by a thicker absorber.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the erosion {{potential}} of chlorine dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on bovine teeth. Methods: Sixty bovine crowns were ground and polished to give flat surfaces. The crowns were subjected to heavy staining cycles then equally divided into 3 treatment groups; chlorine dioxide (ClO 2), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), and deionised water (H 2 O). Specimens in each group were immersed in 150 ml of the treatment for seven 2 min cycle in addition to an extra 30 min cycle. Specimens were gently dried after each 2 min cycle to take quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images while non- <b>contact</b> <b>light</b> profilometry (NCLP) scans were performed at the end of the seven 2 min and the extra 30 min cycles. Results: ClO 2 specimens showed a significant increase in %ΔF only after the first 2 min cycle (p < 0. 05); however, a significant increase in %ΔF within H 2 O 2 specimens was found at the end of the seven recommended treatment cycles (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) {{represent}} approximately 13 % of all {{newly diagnosed}} lung cancers and {{are characterized by}} an aggressive coursewith early locoregional and distantmetastases. Prognosis is poor, ranging from 20 months in limited disease to 8 months in extensive disease. Various studies 1, 2 have shown that disease stage {{is the most powerful}} prognostic factor of SCLC. Therefore, different scoring systems that include physical, bio-chemical, and radiologic markers have been established. 1, 2 Despite ongoing developments in bronchoscopy, including innovative powerful endoscopes with new optical enhancement techniques such as narrow band imaging or autofluorescence bronchoscopy, final diagnosis of SCLC remained a field of histopathology. Recently, endocytoscopy was introduced, enabling micro-scopic imaging of themucosal layer of the gut at magnifications up to 1, 400. 3 Endocytoscopy is based on a <b>contact</b> <b>light</b> microscope which enables real-time visualization of cellular structures of the superficial epithelial layer. Currently, endoscopy-based and probe-based systems are available.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Endocytoscopy (EC) enables in vivo {{microscopic}} imaging at 1400 -fold magnification, thereby {{allowing the}} analysis of mucosal structures at the cellular level. In contrast to fluorescence imaging with confocal laser endomicroscopy which allows analysis of mucosal structures up to 250 µm in depth, EC {{is based on the}} principle of <b>contact</b> <b>light</b> microscopy and only allows visualization of the very superficial mucosal layer. Aim: To systematically review the feasibility and diagnostic yield of EC for in vivo diagnosis of diseases. Material and Methods: A systematic search of the literature on diagnostic interventions in the gastrointestinal tract using EC was performed by searches in MEDLINE, Current Contents, PubMed, cross references and references from relevant articles using the search terms "endocytoscopy", "endocytoscope", "magnification endoscopy", "endocytoscopic imaging", "virtual histology", and "optical biopsy". Only full manuscripts and case reports published in English were included. Results: Overall twenty-nine relevant reports were identified. EC was feasible to detect esophageal squamous cell cancer with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 95 %, 84 % and 82 %, respectively. Moreover, EC reached excellent sensitivity and specifity for in vivo diagnosis of colon polyps (91 % and 100 %, respectively). Other diagnostic applications of EC included diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus, Helicobacter pylori, celiac disease, and small cell lung cancer. No serious complications of EC have yet been reported. Conclusions: EC is a safe and effective new endoscopic imaging technique to obtain in vivo histology and guided biopsies with high diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, EC has the potential to facilitate both diagnosis and patient management...|$|E
