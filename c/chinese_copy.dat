The Soviet SKS carbine/semi-automatic rifle or its Chinese version (Type 56 Carbine) was also widely used. Compared {{to the early}} American M16 the rugged AK-47 in particular was, although less accurate, more reliable and easier to maintain. The American M16 also saw service, obtained through capture or black market purchase, the Viet Cong also used the Russian Mosin–Nagant rifle and captured German rifles, such as Mauser Kar98k and Sturmgewehr StG-44.|$|E

The upgrades Include the new fire control system Fotona EFCS-3B (with laser rangefinder, cross-wind sensor, ballistic computer and gunner's passive night vision device), a 105mm tank gun, side skirts, smoke grenade launchers, ERA package, a new power-pack with 780hp 12-cylinder V-46-6 diesel engine and new tracks.

25|$|Primary {{armament}} {{consists of}} 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun with fume extractor {{almost at the}} end of the barrel. It is the same gun as the one used in the Type 63 amphibious light tank and can fire AP, APHE, HE, Frag-HE, HEAT, APFSDF-T and smoke rounds. The gun has maximum range of 12,200 m and maximum aimed range of 1,870 m and has a rate of fire of 3 to 5 round per minute. The Type 62 light tank is characterized by having poor accuracy, given the primitive optical gun sights that the gunner has to use and lack of a gun stabilizer (which differs it from Chinese main battle tanks), a fire control system and night vision equipment. As a secondary armament the Type 62 light tank was given the 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun (<b>Chinese</b> <b>copy</b> of Soviet 12.7mm DShK 1938/46 heavy machine gun) mounted on a rotatable mount on top of the loader's hatch on the right hand side of the roof of the turret and two 7.62mm Type 59T medium machine guns, one mounted coaxially with the main gun and the other one mounted at the bow of the tank. Also a 7.62mm Type 59T anti-aircraft medium machine gun can be additionally fitted to left hand side turret hatch. The cast turret features the Soviet-style half-egg shape. The tank carriers 47 rounds for the 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun, 2,000 rounds for the two Type 59T medium machine guns and 1,250 rounds for 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun.|$|E

[...] The Ka-28 helicopter can operate in all weather conditions up to 200nbsp&km from the host ship, but its onboard dipping sonar only has half {{the range of the}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>copy</b> of the French dipping sonar on board Z-9, furthermore, it lacks the processing capability to process the information gathered, so the information has to be passed back to the host ship for processing via data links, while in contrast, Z-9 can process information gathered on board the helicopter, but with shorter range. [...] Z-9 can process information on board because it is equipped with IPS, short for Integrated Processing System, which is essentially an airborne version of combat data system, which also is a subsystem of the combat data system on board the mother ship. [...] Type 052C is the first warship in Chinese navy to be equipped with IPS, and after evaluation which judged to be successful, IPS is fitted to all other Z-9 helicopters in Chinese navy during scheduled upgrades.|$|E

2500|$|The J-11/J-11B's {{legitimacy}} remains unproven, {{despite a}} wealth of information coming to light since 2007. In the course of a press conference at the 2009 Farnborough Airshow, Alexander Fomin, Deputy Director of Russia's Federal Service for Military-Technical Co-operation, reported that Russia had not so far tabled any questions to China with regard to [...] "copying" [...] military equipment. Fomin reported that Russia handed China the licences to manufacture the aircraft and its components, including an agreement on the production of intellectual property rights. Details of intellectual property rights, however have not been disclosed, fuelling speculation about a [...] "secret" [...] contract or parts of the original contract. The licence, at least officially, did not include an aircraft carrier version- Sukhoi Su-33 nor any variant of it, such as the Shenyang J-15. At the MAKS 2009, Rosoboronexport's General Manager Anatoli Isaykin was quoted saying: [...] "Russia is going to investigate the J-11B, as a <b>Chinese</b> <b>copy</b> of the Su-27 and Sukhoi Company is partaking in the process." [...] In 2010, Rosoboronexport announced via their official website that it was in talks with the Chinese side, regarding the ongoing production of weapons that Russia considers as un-licensed. In light of the ongoing investigations, Rosoboronexport expressed its concern over future sales of advanced Russian systems and components to China.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{models of}} {{airborne}} dipping sonars {{can be carried}} by on board Ka-27 helicopters, both being the derivatives of Russian / Soviet V-3 medium frequency (MF) Ros' sonar (also known as Rys, with NATO reporting name Lamb Tail), with a range around 7nbsp&km. [...] Original sonars on board Ka-27 were Russian VGS-3K models marketed by Morfizpribor, while Chinese military enthusiasts have claimed (but yet to be confirmed) that H-3 models of Ukrainian firm Sokol is also purchased by China to diversify supplier sources. [...] Unconfirmed claims by Chinese military enthusiasts also suggest that Russian firm Morfizpribor is actively marketing its 180nbsp&kg class Vesta-K low frequency (LF) airborne sonar to China as an upgrade to the original VGS-3K Ros' sonar, which would significantly boost the performance by increasing the range by tenfold to 50nbsp&km, and with greater operating depth to 700 meters. [...] However, the drawback of Russian–Soviet airborne sonar is that the information gathered cannot be processed on board the aircraft, so the process in done on board the ship instead. [...] In contrast, the French Thomson-CSF-built HS-12 used on ASW-configured Harbin Z-9s has a range in excess of a dozen kilometers and information gathered can be processed directly on board the helicopter. [...] During upgrades, HS-12 sonar was subsequently replaced by the <b>Chinese</b> <b>copy</b> of French HS-312 sonar, which is an improvement of the original HS-12, with added capability of processing extra information of 4 to 8 sonar buoys, in addition to information of HS-12 sonar itself. [...] This Chinese version of HS-312 sonar was also installed on Changhe Z-8 during latter's upgrade.|$|E

Only by watching the efforts of the most skilful copyists--men who spend a lifetime, as some of them do, in multiplying copies of a single picture--and observing how invariably they leave out just the indefinable charm that involves the last, inestimable value, can we understand the difficulties of the task which they undertake.|$|E

In early 1988, it had more than 4,500 Soviet T-54s, 55s, 62s, and 72s, some 1,500 Chinese Type 59 and Type 69-II main battle tanks (copies/derivatives of the Soviet T-54A), 60 Romanian M-77s, and some captured Iranian British-made (30?)
