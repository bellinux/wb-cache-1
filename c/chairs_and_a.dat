5|$|The Great Hall is {{furnished}} with mostly 17th century oak furniture, including tables, coffers and wainscot <b>chairs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> great dining table, on which stand two {{blue and white}} late 17th century Delftware pyramidal tulip vases. One treasure of the home is the Lytes Herbal, a 16th-century botanical volume by noted horticulturist Henry Lyte, who was born and resided at the manor. Lyte's Niewe Herball was published in 1578 and was a translation and elaboration of the Cruydeboeck of Flemish herbalist Rembert Dodoens. The herbal was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. A copy is displayed in the Great Hall.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the swinging light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two <b>chairs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> cigar.|$|E

25|$|Frasier's {{apartment}} {{was designed to}} be ultra-modern in an eclectic style (as Frasier himself points out in the pilot). One of the show's signature elements that it became well known for was the apartment's design which included elements such as a slightly split-level design, doors with triangular wooden inlay features, numerous pieces of well-known high-end furniture pieces (such as a replica of Coco Chanel's sofa, and both Eames and Wassily <b>Chairs)</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> notable view from the terrace which was frequently complimented by visitors. The main set consisted of the open-concept living area with a sitting/TV space and dining area on the lower level and a piano exit to the terrace on the rear upper level. The set also included the kitchen through an open archway. A small section of the building corridor and elevator doors was built, as was a powder room near the front entrance. Two corridors off the living area ostensibly led to the apartment's three bedrooms. Sets for each of these rooms were built as separate sets on an as-needed basis.|$|E
25|$|An {{unveiling}} {{ceremony was}} held on Tuesday, July 1, 1890. Three of the association's executive committee members Edward Hawkins, Noble C. Butler, and John A. Holman, served as the Committee of Arrangements; a General Reception Committee was named and consisted of approximately one hundred Indianapolis citizens and two or more from each Indiana county. Indianapolis streets and buildings were decorated with lavish display of flags and bunting. A large, canvas-covered amphitheater with a stage, five hundred <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> raised pavilion for a large chorus of school children and other spectators was erected across Tennessee Street. The structure was elaborately decorated with bunting; the monument, which stood a few steps away, was covered in flags. Benches {{in front of the}} amphitheater supplied ticket-holder seating. Special invitations were sent to President Benjamin Harrison and ex-President Grover Cleveland and their cabinets, senators and congressmen, federal judges, and governors of other states. Governors from New York, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana attended the event. The ceremonies began with a parade, followed by a program of activities: a call to order by Alvin P. Hovey, governor of Indiana; an invocation by Rev. Joseph S. Jenckes, of St. Paul’s Church, Indianapolis; music; a historical statement by Frederick Rand, president of the monument association; unveiling of the monument by Eliza C. Hendricks; a nine-round salute from Indianapolis Light Artillery; a dedicatory poem by James Whitcomb Riley of Indiana, read by Rev. Dr. D. W. Fisher, president of Hanover College; and address by David Turpie, U. S. Senator from Indiana; and a benediction from Reverend Francis Silas Chatard, Bishop of Vincennes.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the rules}} and banishments, there were {{incidents}} which {{made their way into}} newspapers. Billingsley associate Steve Hannagan believed that one [...] "good fight" [...] a year was permissible for a respectable night club. Johnny Weissmuller accused a Navy lieutenant of using a lit cigarette to burn the clothing of dancers as they passed his table. The lieutenant advised Weissmuller to get a haircut; his wife told Weissmuller to go back to Hollywood with the other ape-men. The Navy man suffered two black eyes and complained that Weissmuller's friends held him as he was punched by Weissmuller. [...] Ernest Hemingway once took issue with a stranger who slapped him on the back; knocking him into three <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> table as he brushed him away. Billingsley contended that many of the incidents that appeared in print were minor disagreements which were inflated by the press.|$|E
500|$|He {{also built}} a roughly semi-circular, terraced amphitheater at the {{foundation}} of the Pyramid which he called the [...] "foyer". He intended to rent this out and use the revenue for the pyramid project. The land for the amphitheater was first dug in late 1923, and construction continued off and on {{for the next five years}} whenever financing, building materials, and labor were available. Unlike other Monte Ne building projects designed by architect A. O. Clark, the amphitheater apparently had no architectural input and was not built according to blueprints or a single design. Those who worked with Harvey noted that he seemed to just [...] "work it out in his mind from day to day". The result was a unique structure, irregular in formation, with seating capacity for anywhere from 500 to 1,000. The amphitheater averaged [...] high and [...] long. In the middle of the amphitheater was a small island with two concrete <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> concrete couch, intended for an orchestra to play or a speaker to make a presentation. Harvey dedicated the amphitheater before 500 people in 1928.|$|E
500|$|Following Wiens's defence statement, El-Sherbini {{testified to}} the court. After El-Sherbini had {{finished}} her testimony, the judge asked whether there were any further questions. Wiens replied and asked why above all El-Sherbini was in Germany. The question {{was rejected by the}} judge; Wiens responded with a further question to which the defence counsel motioned for recess. El-Sherbini was not intending to wait {{until the end of the}} hearing and tried to leave. When she, her husband, and their three-year-old son were at the door, Wiens suddenly attacked El-Sherbini with a kitchen knife with an [...] long blade, which he apparently had taken into the courtroom in a backpack. El-Sherbini received more than 15 stab wounds to the upper body and arm; the attack was carried out in such a forceful and sudden manner that it resulted in a notable absence of defence wounds. While trying to protect his wife, El-Sherbini's husband Okaz was stabbed at least 16 times to the head, neck, upper body and arm. Wiens's defence counsel tried to help El-Sherbini by obstructing Wiens with <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> table. The victim's three-year-old son was injured while being ushered to safety.|$|E

500|$|Billingsley's {{original}} {{plan for the}} Cub Room was {{for it to be}} a private place for playing gin rummy with his friends. The room was added to the club during World War II. Billingsley broke out a wall in the bar to create this private space, but it was Walter Winchell who began to call it the Cub Room. The Cub Room had no windows and was described in a Louis Sobol column as a [...] "lopsided oval". The room was lit with pink tones. [...] On the wood-paneled walls were paintings of beautiful women; Billingsley also had similar portraits by the same artist in the ladies' powder room. After the club's labor problems began in 1957, Billingsley redecorated the entire club, choosing emerald green for the carpet and <b>chairs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pinkish-red for the banquettes. The Cub Room's wood panels were replaced by beige burlap and the portraits of beautiful women were replaced by paintings of noted 19th-century race horses. As a concession to those who wanted to have a business lunch at The Stork, the Cub Room was for men only during lunch time. The sanctum sanctorum, the Cub Room ("the snub room"), was guarded by a captain called [...] "Saint Peter" [...] (for the saint who guards the gates of Heaven).|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} was substantially remodeled in 1924. In addition to new vestries beyond the old north exterior wall for the Minister and choir, {{the front of}} the church was fitted with beautiful oak furniture. This included choir stalls to right and left; a communion table, <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> memorial screen for the war dead; and a new pulpit between the table and the Minister's vestry. The cost of these works was over £3,000 [...] In 1932 a baptismal font was given to the church in memory of Br J J Lees. When Westwood closed in 2005, the communion table, memorial plaque and Lamb and Flag symbol from the pulpit were transferred to the new church in Royton along with the font.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{initially}} managed {{by a local}} tavern owner named Archibald Rhea, and was advertised as the largest in East Tennessee. [...] The three-story hotel featured 13 rooms, a bar, dining room, and ballroom, and had its own granary and stables. [...] Throughout much of the 1820s and 1830s, the hotel was managed by a local hotelier named Joseph Jackson, and developed into a popular gathering place for the city's elite. [...] Humes's children sold the hotel in 1837 to John Pickett and William Belden, who rechristened it the [...] "City Hotel." [...] During this period, each room in the hotel contained two feather beds, a table and <b>chairs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> washstand and looking glass. [...] The hotel also had its own library, a lounge with a piano, and a dining room that served meals on silver plates and china.|$|E

[...] Nine of the rooms sleep six people each and the tenth sleeps fourteen people. [...] All cooking gear, lighting, bedding and food must be brought to the island. [...] There is no electricity or running water in the rooms, but toilets, hot showers and barbecues are nearby. Many visitors also choose to camp in the camping area in Darlington - an advance booking is not necessary for this. The visitor will look in vain for a shop, hotel or restaurant, and anyone who travels to the island must be self-sufficient.|$|E
2500|$|The room's refurnishing {{was made}} around a small {{circular}} guéridon probably designed and manufactured by Lannuier. A family in New York, which had owned it since American colonial times, donated the piece. As of 1998, furniture historians James Abbott and Elaine Rice say, it [...] "is still {{considered the best}} example of American neoclassical furniture in the mansion." [...] Sofas which once belonged to Dolley Madison and Nelly Custis (granddaughter of Martha Washington) were donated and placed in the room, as was a sofa table which featured a sphinx as a base (also attributed to Lannuier). Two card tables with intricate wood inlays and sphinx-like legs; three French Empire armchairs with gilt-bronze frames; and a French Empire desk were also purchased and installed. Four gondola side chairs, a pair of early Rococo Revival side <b>chairs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> French Empire armchair already owned by the White House were removed from storage and placed in the room. A carpet woven in Aubusson, France, was selected by Kennedy for the floor of the Red Room. Too expensive to purchase outright, Boudin and his Maison Jansen associate Paul Manno approached financier André Meyer, who agreed to purchase and donate the carpet to the White House in exchange for a meeting with Mrs. Kennedy.|$|E
