Macdonald began his apprenticeship with George Mackenzie, a prominent young lawyer who was a well-regarded member of Kingston's rising Scottish community. Mackenzie practised <b>corporate</b> <b>law,</b> a lucrative speciality that Macdonald himself would later pursue.

5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Law</b> Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E

40|$|The {{corporate}} insolvency affects many {{parties that}} have {{interests in the}} continued existence of the company or business and those interests may conflict and cause tensions between them. The existence of <b>corporate</b> insolvency <b>law</b> is associated with an attempt to balance the interests of those who are ‘stakeholders’ in corporate insolvency, such as creditors, employees, local community and the public. Whether the role of insolvency law is to focus on the creditors’ interest or whether insolvency law has more roles to play and wider range of interests to be considered under insolvency laws has pointed to the debates on the underlying principles such as the objectives and theoretical foundations of <b>corporate</b> insolvency <b>law.</b> In view of the importance of theories underpinning <b>corporate</b> insolvency <b>law</b> to a proper understanding of the objectives and principles of the law, it is necessary to review various theories of corporate insolvency. These theories are mostly constructed by scholars in the US and UK in their pursuit of finding the objective of <b>corporate</b> insolvency <b>law.</b> In order to uncover the real objectives or purpose and principles of <b>corporate</b> insolvency <b>law</b> by reviewing <b>corporate</b> insolvency <b>law</b> theories, the authors collected information through secondary data analysis.

5|$|The {{legal system}} of Saudi Arabia {{is based on}} Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include Islamic {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia {{is influenced by the}} medieval (Islamic Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, and the lack of judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, but this is yet to be implemented. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and <b>corporate</b> <b>law.</b> Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature.|$|E
