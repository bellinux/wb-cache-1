Our aim was to investigate whether the SMART regimen would reduce the risk of overuse of β agonist, reduce the likelihood of patients to seek medical review when such episodes occurred, and if any reduction in severe asthma exacerbations would be at the cost of a higher burden of systemic corticosteroid. Methods In this 24 -week trial undertaken at four primary health-care practices and one hospital in New Zealand, patients (aged 16 – 65 years) with a recent asthma exacerbation were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to the SMART or standard fixed-dose regimen. Treatment in the SMART group consisted of two actuations of budesonide–formoterol (200 μg and 6 μg, respectively, per actuation) twice daily, delivered through a <b>combination</b> <b>metered</b> dose inhaler (MDI), with one extra actuation as needed for relief of symptoms; treatment in the standard group consisted of two actuations of budesonide–formoterol (200 μg and 6 μg, respectively, per actuation) twice daily through a combination MDI with one to two actuations of salbutamol (100 μg per actuation) by MDI as needed for relief of symptoms. MDIs were monitored electronically to measure actual use of medication. The allocation sequence for randomisation was computer generated, with a block size of eight per site. Participants, investigators, and the statistician were not masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with at least one high-use episode of β agonist (more than eight actuations per day of budesonide–formoterol in addition to the four maintenance doses in the SMART group or more than 16 actuations per day of salbutamol in the standard group). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN 12610000515099.

The ECM project is implemented in a selected plant in a ferrochrome production line in which three different types of loads are considered for retrofitting. The aim of this research is to minimize the metering costs associated with the measurement and verification process while satisfying the precision and accuracy requirements for the sampling and measurement plan. The metering costs are reduced by using two types of metering devices. One meter yields highly accurate data measurements, has superior functionality to the other meter and is consequently highly priced. Different sampling requirements for the ECM project are evaluated and an optimal solution is found by selecting a combination of inexpensive and expensive metering equipment.

The two main design challenges are catering to large overnight loads that outweigh all other energy use and working around the fact that five separate electricity meters supply the Reserve. The summary findings are that a wind power system is not feasible for the Reserve due to a combination of poor wind speeds and high capital costs, while certain small solar power systems across two buildings are considered good investments provided the Reserve remains eligible for the Renewable Energy Buyback Scheme offered by Synergy. Sensitivity analysis of the two solar systems show that they remain feasible even if capital cost is underestimated. None of the power systems analysed benefitted from the addition of a battery storage system, which not only was prohibitively expensive but also competed directly with cheap off-peak electricity rates in some cases.

As a new trend, automation of excavation helps improving productivity, safety, and reducing of operation costs, consequently, making construction works become feasible even in hostile environment. In traditional auto-operating methods, excavators are controlled by joysticks through a so-called virtual environment in which the excavation performance is determined by some sensors attached to the real machines. However, the control accuracy by using these methodologies is reduced proportionally to the number of used sensors.

The devices were tested using a five-stage liquid impinger and a unit dose sampling apparatus, operated under conditions specified in European Pharmacopoeia (2000). Fine-particle dose (FPD) {{was defined as the}} dose of the aerosolized drug particles with an aerodynamic diameter < 5 μm and fine particle fraction (FPF) was the ratio of FPD to the total recovered dose.

Further, the purpose was to evaluate the outdoor temperature during summer days and investigate how differences in size and placing of conifers, deciduous trees and bushes could affect the mitigation of the mean radiant temperature. The evaluation was based on three indicators; the maximum heat island, ground elevation and mean radiant temperature, using ArcMap 10 and SOLWEIG. The maximum heat island temperatures were highest in dense areas with tall buildings. The mean radiant temperature peaked in the high elevated areas and in the most open spaces. Preschool area 2 was evaluated to be in greatest need of temperature regulation and the mean radiant temperature was analyzed further.

The {{purpose of this study}} is developing a roundabout Signal Metering operation method by considering approach lanes degree of saturation. METHODS: A four-way-approach with one-lane roundabout is selected to compare the Signal Metering performance for the case of 16 different unbalanced flow conditions. Based on these traffic conditions, the performance is evaluated for 64 different cases of Signal <b>Metering</b> <b>combinations</b> by using SIDRA software. A degree of saturation(V/C ratio) sum for two adjoined approaches is used for the performance index of choosing Metered Approach and Controlling Approach. RESULTS: When the V/C ratio sum is 0. 29 ~ 0. 81 and Metered Approach flow is less than Controlling Approach flow, the average delay saving per vehicle is about 7 seconds; however, after this rage the delay saving decreases gradually until the V/C ratio sum reaches around 1. 0. The range of V/C ratio sum 0. 93 ~ 1. 09 provides average delay saving per vehicle about 3 seconds. In case of V/C ratio sum is grater than 1. 0 and the flows of Metered Approach is grater than Controlling Approach, the average delay per vehicle increases 3 ~ 11 times respectively.

Tariff design {{is the main}} tool for allocating these costs to customers who own and operate DG resources. Currently, however, either DG units are exempt from paying distribution tariffs or {{they are subject to}} tariffs originally designed according to a traditional pricing model without DG in the grids, also known as load-based pricing. Partial recovery of the allowed distribution company revenue requirements or cross-subsidies between customers may ensue from such tariff arrangements. In this article, pricing, as represented by a <b>combination</b> of net <b>metering</b> and pure volumetric tariffs, is applied in the context of increasing DG. The paper presents a methodology where a Reference Network Model (RNM) is used to investigate the effect of this pricing scheme on the magnitude of cross-subsidies from consumers towards the so-called prosumers for a set of twelve simulations based on real-size networks in the U. S. For the considered scenarios, the analysis reveals substantial cross-subsidies from consumers toward prosumers. The degree of subsidy varies with the amount of DG connected to the grid and network characteristics. The rate of cross-subsidy tends to be higher for low-density grids. This paper contributes to the net metering literature with a quantitative assessment of cross-subsidies by comparing allocated payments to different actors with the costs they impose on the system, estimated through an RNM. Moreover, the paper proposed a tariff structure based on cost causality by proposing a cost-reflective, volumetric tariff approach through which aggregate load-driven and DG-driven network costs are accordingly allocated to loads and DG units.

For example, for an abattoir that produces 3500 m 3 /day wastewater and uses around 200 L (3 %) acid and alkaline chemicals, the final concentration of these chemical will be around 0. 00017 %. For this reason, {{the effects of these}} chemicals on the treatment method and the environment are very limited. Chemical treatment is highly efficient in removing soluble and colloidal particles from the red meat processing industry wastewater. Actually, it is shown that, if chemical treatment has been applied, then biological treatment can only be included for the treatment of the solid waste by-product and/or for production of bioenergy. Chemical treatment is recommended in all cases and especially when the wastewater is required to be reused or released to water streams. This study also shows that energy consumption for chemical treatment units is insignificant while efficient compared to other physical or biological units. A combination of a main (ferric chloride) and an aid coagulant has shown to be efficient and cost-effective in treating abattoir wastewater. The cost of using this <b>combination</b> per cubic <b>meter</b> wastewater treated is 0. 055 USD/m 3 compared to 0. 11 USD/m 3 for alum and the amount of sludge produced is 77 % less than that produced by alum. In addition, the residues of these chemicals in the wastewater and the sludge have a positive or no impact on biological processes. Energy consumption from a small wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) installed to recycle wastewater for a meet facility can be around $ 500, 000...|$|R
5000|$|The Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra {{was also}} {{dedicated}} to Ulysse Delecluse and {{was published by}} Alphonse Leduc in 1953. Unfortunately, there is no commercial CD recording available with clarinet and orchestra and only one recording with piano reduction (Actually, the clarinet concerto was recorded with orchestra and released on the CD [...] "20th Century Clarinet Concertos" [...] by the Koch Schwann label). Undoubtedly the orchestration is colorful, although it retains its charm with piano. Tomasi composed in an economical manner, deriving thematic material from motivic cells. The first movement was chosen to be the Paris Conservatory Examination Solo in 1953. Later, {{the second and third}} movements were the Contest Solo at the Paris Conservatory in 1966. Delecluse observed that [...] "the concerto had gained enormous popularity throughout Europe; many critics consider it a masterpiece." [...] (qtd. in Gee 20) It deserves to have greater notoriety today. The first movement is in sonata form and starts with an E flat/D Major polychord. Usually a conventional concerto has an exposition in the orchestra, but here the clarinet starts unaccompanied with a similar figure to Bach's E Major Partita for Solo Violin (Lerner 7). The second theme is stated in the piano at rehearsal #11. A long cadenza connects back to the original theme and ends with rhythmic material in 7/8. There are traditional key centers in a flexible framework. The nontraditional elements include polychords, chords with added notes, clusters, and dissonance. The clarinet exhibits a freedom of key relationships and tonal centers. The second movement opens with a motive from the first movement. This introduction is followed with ternary form with return above an ostinato of Sicilian rhythm. The short development at rehearsal #10 is followed by a recapitulation at rehearsal #15. The virtuoso Scherzo finale is in a sonata rondo construction. A <b>combination</b> of <b>meters</b> is used: 4/4 12/8, 3/4 9/8, 2/4 6/8. The concerto comes to a blazing conclusion after the final statement of theme [...] "A". Henri Tomasi wrote his own notes on the concerto in 1957 and they are printed on the Tomasi Association of France website. He says of the first movement, [...] "of odd and burlesque pace, the principal topic must be interpreted like an improvisation, with some lyric and dark abandonments rather discrete. A significant rate of frightening difficulty will bring us back little by little to a tempo first more stressed, to lead to final giocoso…" [...] He says of the Nocturne (Night): [...] "Mysterious recalls of the first principal theme will be like a romantic daydream. The dialogue between soloist and orchestra will be increasingly pressing, to go towards a lyrical and impassioned exultation. The conclusion will be melancholy." [...] He describes the Scherzo-finale, [...] "Furious accents will disturb this quietude. Suddenly, it will be a romantic and fantastic escape; rides through landscapes of dream, continuations, etc. Then, a song of extreme softness, pointing out the atmosphere of night will rise out of this tumult to create an idyllic environment. The furious agreements of the beginning will bring back to reality soloist and orchestra for an increasingly disheveled final conclusion." [...] (Tomasi assoc.) ...|$|R
