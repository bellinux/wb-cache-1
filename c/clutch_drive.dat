40|$|Abstract. With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen friction plate of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied. It was selected for the resin-base fiber materials of <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen to be commonly used in auto mechanical manufacture. It was analyzed for the abrasion mechanism of the <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen friction plate between the flywheel and the pressure plate,and discussed for the relationship of driven platen friction-plate heat recession-performance and the driven plate material at high temperature. The results show that the friction factor of the optimized driven platen lining materials do not change. In the process of the frequent friction heating to high temperature, the stability of the optimized driven platen lining materials is strong, the wear of those is reduced, and the optimized driven platen lining materials have good performance of high temperature-thermal recession...|$|R

50|$|In 1961, the M-407 {{was further}} {{upgraded}} {{with an even}} more powerful M-407D1-D2 engine (allowing to handle the fourth speed on a manual transmission), self-adjusting brake cylinders and hydraulic <b>clutch</b> <b>drive,</b> improved front suspension for easier driving, and a completely restructured dashboard. This model, manufactured as the Moskvitch 403, served as a transition between the second and the third generation Moskvitches, debuting in 1964, with the mechanical components of the Moskvitch 408 (which had not yet appeared) and {{the body of the}} M-402. The M-403E and M-403IE were intended for export. In 1963, an estate variant, the 424, appeared (with the 424E the export model). The M-403 lasted only until July 1965, with 133,523 cars built (50,612 for export).|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha WR200 {{shown above}} {{has the same}} crank & Stroke as the DT200R & ATV Blaster. The WR200 crank cases {{are similar to the}} DT200R but with a bigger reed cage port and {{slightly}} revised induction port shapes in the crank cases. The WR200 has a larger cylinder bore size of 66.8mm diameter giving a displacement of 199cm with a standard compression of 6.3:1 in standard form. The standard cylinder is nickel plated and has slightly larger porting plus two boost ports ether side of the exhaust port. This in turn makes the WR200 power valve different in shape to allow three exhaust ports to be controlled. The WR200 has a direct cable <b>clutch</b> <b>drive</b> pinion in the clutch cover, where as the DT200R & Blaster use a conventional push rod through the clutch center. The WR200 also uses a larger Mikuni TM30SS Carburetor. The WR200 Frame, Tank, seat, plastics, forks, swingarm, airbox, rear shock and electrics differ from the DT200R.|$|E
50|$|This game {{marks the}} debut of 2013 second-round draft pick QB Geno Smith from West Virginia. However, Smith only stepped in as QB due to Mark Sanchez {{suffering}} an apparent shoulder injury. His first game didn't start off on the right foot, though. He fumbled after taking a sack from Buccaneers MLB Mason Foster, and threw an interception to Buccaneers linebacker Lavonte David. Smith eventually rebounded by throwing his first TD pass to Kellen Winslow Jr. to make the game close by halftime. The second half was a defensive struggle between both teams that wound up in both teams scoring in field goals. The biggest moment of the game came when Geno Smith scrambled out-of-bounds and Lavonte David (the same player who intercepted Smith earlier in the game) delivered a late hit to Smith, resulting in a 15-yard penalty against David. The Jets would fully use the penalty to their advantage, as a Geno Smith <b>clutch</b> <b>drive</b> {{in the final seconds}} of the game culminated in a successful 48-yard field goal from Nick Folk to win the game.|$|E

25|$|In DCTs {{where the}} two {{clutches}} are arranged concentrically, the larger outer <b>clutch</b> <b>drives</b> the odd-numbered gears and the smaller inner <b>clutch</b> <b>drives</b> the even-numbered gears. Shifts can be accomplished without interrupting torque distribution to the driven roadwheels, by applying the engine's torque to one clutch {{at the same time}} as it is being disconnected from the other clutch. Since alternate gear ratios can preselect an odd gear on one gear shaft while the vehicle is being driven in an even gear (and vice versa), DCTs are the fastest-shifting road car transmission available and are even able to shift faster than a professional racing driver using a manual transmission. DCTs can even shift more quickly than cars equipped with single-clutch automated-manual transmissions (AMTs), also called single-clutch semiautomatics. Also, with a DCT, shifts can be made more smoothly than with a single-clutch AMT, making a DCT more suitable for conventional road cars.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} is a summary of information was received from Limitorque via facsimile: "On August 2, 2011, Flowserve-Limitorque was notified by Browns Ferry Nuclear (BFN) Generating Station that a Limitorque SMB- 5 T valve actuator (1 -MVOP- 074 - 052) had failed to run open automatically during {{the performance of a}} stroke test. Electrical maintenance personnel working at the valve reported an abnormal mechanical noise. Upon disassembly, {{it was found that the}} driving lugs on both the sliding clutch gear and the flexible clutch were seriously worn with a significant amount of deformation. Further investigation by BFN showed that the declutch mechanism would not allow full engagement of the drive lugs on the sliding clutch and flexible clutch. These lugs must be engaged for motor operation to take place. The declutch mechanism required adjustment to allow full drive lug engagement. "Following reassembly of the SMB- 5 T on 1 -MVOP- 074 - 052, an inspection was performed of the SMB- 5 T on valve 1 -MVOP- 074 - 066 which was manufactured and supplied to TVA at the same time. This actuator was functioning normally at the time of the inspection. Disassembly of the clutch compartment revealed evidence of deformation of the <b>clutch</b> <b>drive</b> lugs.
