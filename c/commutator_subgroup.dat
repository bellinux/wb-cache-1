25|$|In mathematics, more {{specifically}} {{in the area of}} modern algebra known as group theory, a group is said to be perfect if it equals its own <b>commutator</b> <b>subgroup,</b> or equivalently, if the group has no nontrivial abelian quotients (equivalently, its abelianization, which is the universal abelian quotient, is trivial). In symbols, a perfect group is one such that G(1) = G (the <b>commutator</b> <b>subgroup</b> equals the group), or equivalently one such that Gab = {1} (its abelianization is trivial).|$|E
25|$|The binary {{icosahedral}} {{group is}} perfect, {{meaning that it}} is equal to its <b>commutator</b> <b>subgroup.</b> In fact, 2I is the unique perfect group of order 120. It follows that 2I is not solvable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} some applications of <b>commutator</b> <b>subgroups</b> to homotopy groups and geometric groups. In particular, {{we show that}} the intersection subgroups of some canonical subgroups in certain link groups modulo their symmetric <b>commutator</b> <b>subgroups</b> are isomorphic to the (higher) homotopy groups. This gives a connection between links and homotopy groups. Similar results hold for braid and surface groups. 1...|$|R

25|$|Most simply, a {{group is}} abelian if {{and only if}} the LCS terminates at the first step (the <b>commutator</b> <b>subgroup</b> is trivial) {{if and only if}} the UCS stabilizes at the first step (the center is the entire group). More generally, for a {{nilpotent}} group, the length of the LCS and the length of the UCS agree (and is called the nilpotency class of the group).|$|E
25|$|As the <b>commutator</b> <b>subgroup</b> is {{generated}} by commutators, a perfect group may contain elements that are products of commutators but not themselves commutators. Øystein Ore proved in 1951 that the alternating groups on five or more elements contained only commutators, and made the conjecture that this was so for all the finite non-abelian simple groups. Ore's conjecture was finally proven in 2008. The proof relies on the classification theorem.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{groups of}} a topological space X {{are related to}} its first singular homology group, because a loop is also a singular 1-cycle. Mapping the homotopy class of each loop at a base point x0 to the homology class of the loop gives a homomorphism from the fundamental group π1(X,x0) to the homology group H1(X). If X is path-connected, then this homomorphism is surjective and its kernel is the <b>commutator</b> <b>subgroup</b> of π1(X,x0), and H1(X) is therefore isomorphic to the abelianization of π1(X,x0). This is a special case of the Hurewicz theorem of algebraic topology.|$|E

25|$|More generally, a quasisimple group (a perfect central {{extension}} {{of a simple}} group) which is a non-trivial extension (i.e., not a simple group itself) is perfect but not simple; this includes all the insoluble non-simple finite special linear groups SL(n,q) as extensions of the projective special linear group PSL(n,q) (SL(2,5) is an {{extension of}} PSL(2,5), which is isomorphic to A5). Similarly, the special linear group over the real and complex numbers is perfect, but the general linear group GL is never perfect (except when trivial or over F2, where it equals the special linear group), as the determinant gives a non-trivial abelianization and indeed the <b>commutator</b> <b>subgroup</b> is SL.|$|E
