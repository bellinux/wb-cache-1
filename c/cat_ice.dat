50|$|In 1955, Shumway {{founded the}} Genesee Figure Skating Club after {{becoming}} active (and setting records) in the over-35 category of figure skating competition. Needing {{a place to}} train, he donated money to the Rochester Institute of Technology to add an ice rink to its downtown Rochester campus. The ice rink was later named for Shumway. When RIT was forced {{to move in the}} mid-1960s, he ensured that the new Henrietta campus would also have an ice arena. The new rink, the Frank Ritter Memorial Ice Arena, was named for Shumway's grandfather, a founder of one of RIT's forerunners, the Mechanics Institute. The Genesee Figure Skating Club also moved to the new arena when it was built in 1968. The Shumway arena is also home to the Rochester <b>Ice</b> <b>Cats,</b> a special needs hockey team.

50|$|Gomez' senior career {{would begin}} in the ECHL when he signed for the South Carolina Stingrays.

50|$|In December 2015, ICE {{acquired}} Trayport, {{a subsidiary}} of GFI Group, for $650 million. Trayport licenses its technology platform to serve brokers for electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the European over-the-counter (OTC) utility markets. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) subsequently called in the merger for review, and in October 2016 announced its decision to require ICE to sell Trayport, having ruled that the merger {{could lead to a}} substantial lessening of competition. On March 6, 2017, the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) upheld the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) decision that ICE should divest Trayport. Following careful consideration of the <b>CAT's</b> judgment, <b>ICE</b> requested permission from the CAT to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In the interim, Trayport will continue to be operated separately as it is today, and ICE will continue to engage with the CMA on the remitted issues regarding the new agreement between ICE and Trayport.|$|R

50|$|The episode commences at the La Brea Tar Pits in California, USA. Hundreds {{of bones}} from sabre-tooth cats (also known as Smilodon) {{and other animals}} are shown {{and the process of}} how they became stuck in the tar is explained. The program then {{describes}} how life was for the sabre-tooth <b>cat</b> in the <b>Ice</b> Age. It explains how the climate warmed up and the woodland forests that the sabre-tooth depended on for cover when stalking prey disappeared. It shows a mother sabre-tooth trying to hunt for her two cubs, but fails due to the open spaces and more numerous bison herds. Starving, she abandons her cubs (in doing so, will never reproduce again) and goes for the easiest prey, dead animals in the tar pit. Her hunger overpowers her sense of caution and drives her {{to the edge of the}} black abyss...|$|R
