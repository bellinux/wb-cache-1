The use of <b>cement</b> <b>grout</b> as one of repair materials for minor crack has been applied for many years. However, the natural sand as filler used in <b>cement</b> <b>grout</b> somehow needs another alternate material to substitute it due to depletion issue and has become expensive. Therefore, reuse of ceramic waste as substitute in natural sand has been proposed to minimise those problems.

40|$|Presented is a {{new type}} of a non-local {{continuum}} model which avoids problems of convergence at mesh refinement and spurious mesh sensitivity in a softening continuum characterized by degradation of the yield limit. The key idea, which has recently been proposed in a general context and has already been applied to softening damage due to stiffness degradation, is to apply the non-local concept only to those parameters which cause the degradation while keeping the definition of the strains local. Compared to the previously advanced fully non-local continuum formulation, the new approach has the advantage that the stresses are subjected to the standard differential equations of equilibrium and standard boundary or interface conditions. The new formulation exhibits no zero-energy periodic modes, imbrication of finite elements is unnecessary and finite elements with standard continuity requirements are sufficient.

For this study, twenty geophysical log data were utilized which are spread across Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki of Lagos metropolis. The study shows that the saline water extent in Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki occurs to an average depth of 146, 154 and 162  m, respectively. Relative variation in quality of water across the regions is because of the differences in the thickness of clay units serving as protective units separating the polluted zones from the unpolluted zones.
