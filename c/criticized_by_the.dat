These policies were <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> media, who especially noted that Microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware (particularly Intel's Skylake CPUs, which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted) on Windows 8.1, a version of Windows that is still in mainstream support until January 2018.|$|E
5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools.

Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E

Later in the month, Bayh was <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> video game industry for political posturing in his quest along with Senator Hillary Clinton to crack down on explicit content in video games. The manufacturers claimed that the movements were simply attempts to increase his appeal to values voters for his presidential run.|$|E

By the process of elimination, he attributes known queens to each king of the period, which leaves only Menkauhor {{as a candidate for}} her king. These arguments are <b>criticized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Egyptologist Michel Baud, who observes that pharaohs could have had more than one queen.|$|E
