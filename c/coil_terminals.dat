30|$|Preamplifiers for {{search coil}} magnetometers can be {{classified}} into two types: one uses a voltage amplifier with flux feedback (e.g., Matsumoto et al. 1994), and the other uses a current amplifier with an equalizer (e.g., Ozaki et al. 2014). While most preamplifiers used in previous missions were the voltage-sensing type, the current-sensing type was adopted for the MSC-PA to reduce the wire harness between the MSC-PA installed in the satellite body and the MSC-S {{at the top of}} the MAST. When an induction coil sensor is connected to an ideal current amplifier, the parasitic capacitance between the <b>coil</b> <b>terminals</b> is virtually shorted. This allows resonance to be effectively eliminated without the flux feedback coil that is used for damping in voltage-sensing type preamplifiers. As a result, the harness for the flux feedback coils can be eliminated in the current-sensing type.|$|E

40|$|RFX is {{a fusion}} machine {{based on the}} {{toroidal}} magnetic confinement. The Ohmic Heating (OH) coils of this machine are fed by a 50 kA current and produce a maximum induction value of 4. 5 Tesla. Four busbar systems feed these coils. Since the electrical terminals of the OH coils {{are located in the}} high field region of the machine, both the terminals and the feeding busbars are subjected to a high electromagnetic load, which involves severe mechanical problems. The requirement for a low stray field caused by the electrical connections has also to be taken into account.

The field configuration, together with the geometry of the busbars, gives rise to a very complex load distribution, which required the use of the finite element method to perform a more precise stress analysis.

40|$|International audienceThe {{performance}} of giant magneto-impedance (GMI) -based magnetometers is currently {{limited by the}} noise due to the electronic conditioning circuitry. We propose a simple model of this noise for a GMI sensor using a synchronous detection scheme. The GMI sensing element consists of a thin pick-up coil wound around a Co-rich amorphous micro-wire. It is fully described by a two port network model and associated impedance matrix. Noise and sensitivity behavior are studied for the four measuring configurations, corresponding to four terms of the impedance matrix. The model yields a good description of experimental data from noise measurements. The magnetic noise spectral density is dominated either by the excitation or detection stages, depending upon whether the excitation currents are high or low. The nontrivial noise behavior exhibited by each configuration leads to {{better understanding of the}} noise limitations of GMI magnetometers. The configuration in which the signal at the <b>coil</b> <b>terminals</b> is measured (often called offdiagonal) is the most efficient in decreasing the equivalent output magnetic noise spectral density.

40|$|The Q Meter has {{frequently}} {{been described as}} one of the most flexible instruments available with applications limited largely by the ingenuity of the person using it. It is our desire here to delineate some of those techniques, not normally encountered in everyday work, in the hope that wider dissemination of information gathered through many channels, will prove of some value. In order to approach our specific problems in a general way, it might be well to review some basic facts relative to the operation of the Q Meter. The Q Meter is always operated with-a coil connected to its <b>coil</b> <b>terminals.</b> If we are interested in measuring the Q of a coil, this coil will be connected to these terminals and it will be measured in one operation. If we are interested in making other measurements; (i. e., the Q of a capacitor, the impedance of a circuit, the parameters of a tuned circuit; etc.), we still need a coil, even though we are interested in that particular coil only as. a reference.

50|$|Traditional {{control valve}} sizing for {{constant}} flow systems involves a Kv calculation, actual pressure drop calculation and {{a check to}} ensure minimum valve authority is met. This method is complicated and inflexible, as the changes in design flow, circuit pressure, and required pressure drops can change the required valve, and reduce control-ability. This method also relies on having the correct design information. Pressure independent control valves are used to limit the flow to the fan <b>coil</b> <b>terminal</b> and air handling unit. This flow is not affected by changes in inlet pressure. A diaphragm within the valve keeps the outlet pressure constant, and this delivers a constant flow to the terminal. The added advantage of pressure independent control valves is that, when fitted with an actuator, they replace the manual balancing valve and motorized control valve with a single valve, thus reducing installation cost.|$|R

In each of the midbody ganglia there are four N cells (two on either side). Each N cell has a distinctive territory that it supplies in the periphery, on the surface or internally. 1. Both N cells respond selectively to noxious mechanical stimuli applied to the skin but not to touch, light, pressure or stretch. The receptive field of each cell is well defined and covers roughly the same area, extending from the dorsal midline to the ventral midline, with considerable overlap. 2. One of the N cells, situated more medially in the ganglion, also fires at high frequencies in response to mechanical stimulation, such as pinching or squeezing, of the connective tissue lining the viscera. In contrast, the other N cell (situated laterally in the ganglion) is activated by pressure or pinches applied {{to the opening of}} the excretory duct but not the gut. 3.

When motor is operated on sinusoidal supply, then during switching period voltage across motor phase becomes equal to supply line voltage and the maximum voltage across any of the coil obtained is 30 % more than the rated value. Unexpected behaviour was observed in variation of coil voltage (harmonic voltage after few cycle from starting) with sinusoidal supply during starting, however this is not producing large over voltages or high dv/dt. Voltage rise time when motor is supplied with converter is very small and is {{of the order of}} micro second. In some cases the peak voltage at motor terminals reaches to value which more than twice the value of dc link voltage and rated line to line voltage of the motor. The distribution of voltage during switching condition is not even among the coils of a winding and hence turns. The voltage drop in <b>coils</b> near the <b>terminal</b> is more than that of in other coils. The measured voltage drop across first <b>coil</b> from <b>terminal</b> of winding of four coils in series is varying 30 to 65. 8 % of the phase voltage against 25 % of the phase voltage. Comparison of wave forms for sinusoidal supply and inverter supply shows that distortions were very large with inverter supply which increases the losses and produces more stresses on the insulations.
