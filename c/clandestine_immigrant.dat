The son of a {{railroad}} engineer, he was fascinated {{as a young boy}} by the sight of a Greek biplane maneuvering over his head in Kolonos and became obsessed by the wish to become a flyer. [...] For the time being, he had to settle for frequent trips to a military aerodrome in the north of Athens, Dekelia (Tatoi), to watch the planes up close. Eventually, he became known to the personnel there who allowed him to wander in the hangars and sit in the planes. When he left school he searched for a chance to go to the United States where he knew he could take private flying lessons. In 1938 he was employed as a navy merchant seaman but at first chance he fled his ship to the docks of Baltimore and then to New York where he started working as a <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigrant</b> in US.|$|E
40|$|Euro-Mediterranean Consortium for Applied Research on International Migration (CARIM) At the {{crossroads}} of Asia, Africa and Europe, Turkey faces irregular migration flows, both as a country of destination and of transit: the irregular migration flows to the country consist mainly of transit migrants, <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigrant</b> workers, asylum seekers and refugees. In the last decade, the major migration flows into Turkey have come from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, while significant numbers have also arrived from Moldova, Romania, Ukraine, the Russian Federation and Georgia. Migrants from the former countries are mainly transients heading for Europe or other more developed parts of the world. They stay in Turkey only on a temporary basis. Migrants from the latter group of countries are foreign nationals who intend to work illegally in Turkey, for a limited period of time. Turkey’s position over the 1951 Geneva Convention, excluding non-European asylum seekers, further complicates the situation as non-Europeans account {{for the majority of}} asylum seekers in Turkey. Another feature of migration to Turkey is the national diversity of the immigrants: authorities in Turkey have identified 163 nationalities that have arrived in the country in the last decade. Clearly, Turkey has become a country with multiple roles in irregular migratory movements. Utilising a relatively revealing data set on the apprehending of irregular migrants provided by the security forces together with the findings of several surveys conducted in the country, this paper, first, documents the irregular migration experience in Turkey over the last 30 years. It also relates the phenomenon of irregular migration in Turkey to the wider context of European international migratory regimes. Then the paper outlines the developments associated with irregular migration in the country. The role of Turkey’s EU affairs within these changes is complex and contradictory, and not yet fully explored. After describing irregular migration, the paper explores, finally, {{the way in which the}} political construction of irregular migration is associated with the securitisation and economisation of international migratory regimes in Europe and around its peripheries...|$|E

40|$|For {{many aspects}} knowing {{the number of}} <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigrants</b> in the same country is very important. For this purpose {{literature}} has proposed a lot of methods, among these the latest and the most interesting, {{because it is a}} direct method, is called "center sampling", as the centers are any aggregation places where the immigrants necessarily go. In this paper center sampling is modified under particular hypotheses, so two different detectabilities of immigrants are defined. The first one is equal for all the immigrants; the second one is different and related to the number of centers they go to. So these two detectabilities are used for estimating the number of <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigrants.</b> The expected value and the MSE of the two estimators have been defined, but their performance are necessarily been valued by simulation...|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{the end of}} high {{economic}} growth in France caused immigration policies to be considerably tightened, starting with laws by Charles Pasqua passed in 1986 and 1993. New immigrants were allowed only through the family reunion schemes (wives and children moving to France to live with husbands or fathers already living in France), or as asylum seekers. Illegal immigration thus developed as immigration policy became more rigid. In 2006, The French Ministry of the Interior estimated <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigrants</b> in France amounted to anywhere between 200,000 and 400,000 and expected between 80,000 and 100,000 people to enter the country illegally each year.|$|R
40|$|The Survey {{on illegal}} {{migration}} in Italy (SIMI) focuses upon {{the reality of}} <b>clandestine</b> <b>immigrants</b> going through the country. SIMI provides data on the main demographic, economic and social features of a sample of 920 illegal migrants apprehended in 2003. Individual motivations to migrate, the intention of returning, expectations on income at destination, and intended remittance rates are collected. Evidence generally supports the presence of strong economic reasons behind the decision of migrating. Apprehended illegal migrants expected to earn at their final destination about 8 - 10 times their income at home. The median cost of the trip {{is more than a}} yearly average income. Finally, the survey leads to forecast massive migratory flows, as the people interviewed (tipically below 30) seem to be front-runners of a cohort of their nationals the same age...|$|R

40|$|Esta dissertação aborda o tema da imigração italiana à luz do imaginário daqueles que se dirigiam em massa para o Brasil, entre o final do século XIX e início do XX, em busca de um mundo novo, perseguindo o sonho de um Paraíso Terrestre, o país imaginário da Cocanha. O tema é abordado a partir de obras literárias, como o poema francês, datado do século XIII, o Fabliau da Cocanha e da narrativa Vita e Stòria di Nanetto Pipetta, que apresenta o jovem personagem imigrante clandestino vêneto, criado por Aquiles Bernardi, e cujas aventuras eram publicadas semanalmente em capítulos no jornal gaúcho Stafetta Riograndense, nos anos 1924 - 1925. A trama vivida pelo personagem que dá título à obra é fio condutor das reflexões apresentadas. Para o imigrante italiano, o imaginário sobre o Brasil como o país da Cocanha encontra neste personagem sua expressão fiel, mantendo acesa a chama da esperança de uma vida melhor para si e para as gerações futuras. This {{study is}} about Italian {{immigration}} {{and it gives}} light to the imaginary of those who came in mass to Brazil {{in search of a}} new world, pursuing the dream of a Terrestrial Paradise, the imaginary country of the Cocanha.
