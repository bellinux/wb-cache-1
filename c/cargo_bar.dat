60|$|To {{charge him}} with habitually rousing popular forces into {{dangerous}} excitement, is to ignore or misread his action {{in some of the}} most critical of his movements. “Here is a man,” said Huxley, “with the greatest intellect in Europe, and yet he debases it by simply following majorities and the crowd.” He was called a mere mirror of the passing humours and intellectual confusions of the popular mind. He had nothing, said his detractors, but a sort of clever pilot’s eye for winds and currents, and the rising of the tide to the exact height that would float him and his <b>cargo</b> over the <b>bar.</b> All this is the exact opposite of the truth. What he thought was that the statesman’s gift consisted in insight into the facts of a particular era, disclosing the existence of material for forming public opinion and directing public opinion to a given purpose. In every one of his achievements of high mark—even in his last marked failure of achievement—he expressly formed, or endeavoured to form and create, the public opinion upon which he knew that in the last resort he must depend.|$|R
