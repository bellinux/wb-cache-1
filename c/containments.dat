25|$|While the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant had {{operated}} safely since 1971, {{an earthquake}} and tsunami {{well beyond the}} design basis resulted in failure of AC power, backup generators and batteries which defeated all safety systems. These systems were necessary to keep the fuel cool after the reactor had been shut down. This resulted in partial or complete meltdown of fuel rods, damage to fuel storage pools and buildings, release of radioactive debris to surrounding area, air and sea, and resorting to the expedient use of fire engines and concrete pumps to deliver cooling water to spent fuel pools and containment. During the incident, pressure within the <b>containments</b> of reactors 1-3 rose to exceed design limits, which despite attempts to reduce pressure by venting radioactive gasses, resulted in breach of containment. Hydrogen leaking from the containment mixed with air into an explosive mixture which resulted in explosions in Unit 1,3 and 4, complicating attempts to stabilize the reactors.|$|E

25|$|The Asilomar Conference {{also gave}} {{recommendations}} for matching {{the types of}} containment necessary for different types of experiments. These recommendations {{were based on the}} different levels of risk associated with the experiment, which would require different levels of containment. These levels were minimal, low, moderate and high risk. The minimal risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which the biohazards could be accurately assessed and were expected to be minimal. Low risk containment was appropriate for experiments that generated novel biotypes but where the available information indicated that the recombinant DNA could not either alter appreciably the ecological behavior of the recipient species, increase significantly its pathogenicity or prevent effective treatments of any resulting infections. The moderate risk level of containment was intended for experiments in which there was a probability of generating an agent with a significant potential for pathogenicity or ecological disruption. High-risk containment was intended for experiments in which the potential for ecological disruption or pathogenicity of the modified organism could be severe and thereby pose a serious biohazard to laboratory personnel or to the public. These levels of <b>containments,</b> along with the previously mentioned safety measures, formed the basis for the guidelines used by investigators in future experiments that involved the construction and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules using DNA from prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, animal viruses and eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|The Mark I {{containment}} {{was used}} in those reactors at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant which {{were involved in the}} Fukushima I nuclear accidents. The site suffered from a combination of two beyond design-basis events, a powerful earthquake which may have damaged reactor plumbing and structures and 15 meter tsunami which destroyed fuel tanks, generators and wiring causing back up generators to fail, and battery-powered pumps also eventually failed. Insufficient cooling and failure of pumps needed to restore water lost to boiling off led to partial or possible complete meltdowns of fuel rods which were completely uncovered by water. This led to releases of significant amounts of radioactive material to the air and sea, and hydrogen explosions. However PWR reactors also require years of powered pumped cooling water. The thin secondary <b>containments</b> were not designed to withstand hydrogen explosions, and suffered blown out or destroyed roofs and walls, and destruction of all equipment on the refueling floor including cranes and refueling platform. Unit 3 suffered a particularly spectacular explosion which created a plume of debris over 300m high which resulted in a collapse of {{the north end of the}} top floor, and buckled concrete columns on its west side as can be seen by aerial photographs. Although they were fitted with modified hardened vent systems to vent hydrogen into exhaust stacks, they may have not been effective without power. Unit 2 had a large panel removed to vent gases, but suffered an explosion to the lower suppression area. Even before the Fukushima incident, Mark I containment had been criticized as being more likely to fail during a blackout.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To develop {{approaches}} to the evaluation of programmes whose strategic objectives are to halt or slow weed spread. Location: Australia. Methods: Key aspects {{in the evaluation of}} weed <b>containment</b> programmes are considered. These include the relevance of models that predict the effects of management intervention on spread, the detection of spread, evidence for <b>containment</b> failure and metrics for absolute or partial <b>containment.</b> Case studies documenting either near-absolute (Orobanche ramosa L., branched broomrape) or partial (Parthenium hysterophorus (L.) King and Robinson, parthenium) <b>containment</b> are presented. Results: While useful for informing <b>containment</b> strategies, predictive models cannot be employed in <b>containment</b> programme evaluation owing to the highly stochastic nature of realized weed spread. The quality of observations is critical to the timely detection of weed spread. Effectiveness of surveillance and monitoring activities will be improved by utilizing information on habitat suitability and identification of sites from which spread could most compromise <b>containment.</b> Proof of <b>containment</b> failure may be difficult to obtain. The default option of assuming that a new detection represents <b>containment</b> failure could lead to an underestimate of <b>containment</b> success, the magnitude of which will depend on how often this assumption is made. Main conclusions: Evaluation of weed <b>containment</b> programmes will be relatively straightforward if <b>containment</b> is either absolute or near-absolute and may be based on total <b>containment</b> area and direct measures of <b>containment</b> failure, for example, levels of dispersal, establishment and reproduction beyond (but proximal to) the <b>containment</b> line. Where <b>containment</b> is only partial, other measures of <b>containment</b> effectiveness will be required. These may include changes in the rates of detection of new infestations following the institution of interventions designed to reduce dispersal, the degree of compliance with such interventions, and the effectiveness of tactics intended to reduce fecundity or other demographic drivers of spread.
