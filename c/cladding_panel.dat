40|$|Abstract. To {{explore the}} {{performance}} of the flexible nodes between the precast concrete exterior wall <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> and the frame structure, a steel truss is used as an analogue of the frame structure to develop a test. In the test, one precast concrete exterior wall <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> was installed on the steel truss, and the connection nodes are designed to be able to slip vertically. Different horizontal forces were exerted on the steel truss to form certain drifts, and the deformation of panel and the slipping performance of the connection nodes were explored. It is found that precast concrete exterior wall <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> won’t deform {{under the influence of the}} drifts, while the connection nodes between the frame structure and the panel were found to slip.

The following is {{a report on the}} effects of cladding panels on the natural vibration frequencies of a structural frame. The microscopic effects of the panel's inclusion, i. e. the stresses internal to the panel itself, are not studied. A two story, one bay frame with a single <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> at mid-height was used throughout the analysis. The <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> was represented by five different models; 4 noded, 16 DOF (degrees-of-freedom) rectangular finite element, 4 noded, 12 DOF rectangular finite element, 4 and 8 noded quadrilateral plane stress elements with only two translational DOF at each node, and an analogous frame model. To analyze the effect of discretization on the results with each model, the <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> was subdivided into meshes varying from 1 to 16 elements. The results of each model with the various meshes were compared. Frame behavior as a function of panel height was also studied. Ratios of panel height to story height of 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % were used. The degree of fixity of the elements connecting the panel to the frame varied from a pinned connection to full fixity. The data indicates that incorporation of cladding panels results in a dramatic reduction in a structure's natural periods of vibration...|$|E

An experimental campaign including monotonic and cyclic tests on both silicone strips applied to small concrete blocks and two panel sub-assembly sealed with silicone, has been developed at Politecnico di Milano. Furthermore, cyclic and seismic pseudo-dynamic tests on a full-scale prototype of precast building with cladding panels sealed with silicone, have been performed at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{importance}} of cladding panels on mid-rise buildings in an earthquake-prone region is investigated. A <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> acts as a protective or an insulating layer to control weather infiltration. The Northridge Earthquake, which took place on January 17, 1994, caused numerous heavy cladding panels to fall off the walls of residential and commercial buildings. The failure of these panels {{was a result of}} an insufficient understanding of the cladding behaviors as a subsystem in the three-dimensional framing system. Cladding is designed to be isolated from the structural frame movement during an earthquake. However, numerous studies have concluded that cladding interacts with the structural frame in providing lateral resistance. The advantages and disadvantages of different cladding materials, cladding systems, and cladding connections are presented in this thesis. The effects of cladding on mid-rise buildings in the Northridge Earthquake in the Los Angeles area are simulated in this study. Motion resistance contributed from cladding in a particular mid-rise building, a 19 -story office building in downtown Los Angeles, is investigated. Analyses of clad models and unclad models are carried out, and clad models are discovered to displace less than unclad models. Therefore, cladding is able to contribute lateral motion resistance to a building during an earthquake, and structural engineers should include cladding in their analysis models when designing a building. by Chuan-Hua Kuo.

40|$|Structural {{engineering}} is facing an extraordinarily challenging era. These challenges {{are driven by}} the increasing expectations of modern society to provide low-cost, architecturally appealing structures which can withstand large earthquakes. However, being able to avoid collapse in a large earthquake is no longer enough. A building must now be able to withstand a major seismic event with negligible damage {{so that it is}} immediately occupiable following such an event. As recent earthquakes have shown, the economic consequences of not achieving this level of performance are not acceptable. Technological solutions for low-damage structural systems are emerging. However, the goal of developing a low-damage building requires improving the performance of both the structural skeleton and the non-structural components. These non-structural components include items such as the claddings, partitions, ceilings and contents. Previous research has shown that damage to such items contributes a disproportionate amount to the overall economic losses in an earthquake. One such non-structural element that has a history of poor performance is the external cladding system, and this forms the focus of this research. Cladding systems are invariably complicated and provide a number of architectural functions. Therefore, it is important than when seeking to improve their seismic performance that these functions are not neglected. The seismic vulnerability of cladding systems are determined in this research through a desktop background study, literature review, and postearthquake reconnaissance survey of their performance in the 2010 – 2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence. This study identified that precast concrete claddings present a significant life-safety risk to pedestrians, and that the effect they have upon the primary structure is not well understood. The main objective of this research is consequently to better understand the performance of precast concrete cladding systems in earthquakes. This is achieved through an experimental campaign and numerical modelling of a range of precast concrete cladding systems. The experimental campaign consists of uni-directional, quasi static cyclic earthquake simulation on a test frame which represents a single-storey, single-bay portion of a reinforced concrete building. The test frame is clad with various precast concrete <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> configurations. A major focus is placed upon the influence the connection between the <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> and structural frame has upon seismic performance. A combination of experimental component testing, finite element modelling and analytical derivation is used to develop cladding models of the cladding systems investigated. The cyclic responses of the models are compared with the experimental data to evaluate their accuracy and validity. The comparison shows that the cladding models developed provide an excellent representation of real-world cladding behaviour. The cladding models are subsequently applied to a ten-storey case-study building. The expected seismic performance is examined with and without the cladding taken into consideration. The numerical analyses of the case-study building include modal analyses, nonlinear adaptive pushover analyses, and non-linear dynamic seismic response (time history) analyses to different levels of seismic hazard. The clad frame models are compared to the bare frame model to investigate the effect the cladding has upon the structural behaviour. Both the structural performance and cladding performance are also assessed using qualitative damage states. The results show a poor performance of precast concrete cladding systems is expected when traditional connection typologies are used. This result confirms the misalignment of structural and cladding damage observed in recent earthquake events. Consequently, this research explores the potential of an innovative cladding connection. The outcomes from this research shows that the innovative cladding connection proposed here is able to achieve low-damage performance whilst also being cost comparable to a traditional cladding connection. It is also theoretically possible that the connection can provide a positive value to the seismic performance of the structure by adding addition strength, stiffness and damping. Finally, the losses associated with both the traditional and innovative cladding systems are compared in terms of tangible outcomes, namely: repair costs, repair time and casualties. The results confirm that the use of innovative cladding technology can substantially reduce the overall losses that result from cladding damage...|$|E

40|$|In the Ph. D. thesis, {{the seismic}} effect of {{cladding}} panels and steel shear panels on the reinforced concrete and steel frames is discussed. We limited {{the research of}} sandwich panels to single-storey steel frame buildings, where {{the use of the}} sandwich panels is common. Using multi-storey RC frame buildings, we examined the effect of shear panels, which have bigger shear capacity than the cladding panels. First, we performed extensive tests aimed at determining the capacity of the connection of two shear plates, then we performed nine tests of the systems of cladding panels with dimensions 3. 0 / 2. 6 m. The tests have been examined closely and based on their results we defined a bi-linear envelope for an equivalent diagonal. The diagonal is used to model the cladding panels in frame structures. The envelope is defined {{on the basis of the}} bearing resistance of the steel sheeting, which is a result of shear test of the connection of two steel sheetings. In the cases, where experimental results were not available, we applied the Eurocode 3 formulas for capacity. We used the American standard AISC instructions to define the properties of the equivalent diagonal. We presented the influence of sandwich panels on an industrial steel building of the manufacturer Trimo. Results of numerical analysis show that sandwich panels are able to ensure a proper lateral resistance. However, the measures that insure the proper behaviour of the panels are extremely expensive and therefore economically unjustified. These expenses could only be reduced by developing a new <b>cladding</b> <b>panel</b> with better frame-to-panel and panel-to-panel connections. We examined the influence of the steel shear panels on an old three-storey RC frame building (SPEAR). We also compared its behaviour with the behaviour of four buildings, that were designed in complete or in partial agreement with Eurocode 8. The main purpose was to investigate the possibility for strengthening older constructions that were not designed according to seismic codes. We found that it was possible to ensure the Eurocode 8 seismic resistance, even for older constructions, with relatively simple measures...|$|E
