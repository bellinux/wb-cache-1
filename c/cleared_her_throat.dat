6000|$|She <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> here, {{and looked}} earnest. Having thus reduced {{her husband to}} a state of the most solemn expectancy, she began in a low voice-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The Queen <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> huskily. [...] "Good advice, Monsieur le Duc," [...] she {{approved}} him. [...] "He will be wise {{to follow}} it." [...] Her voice strained, almost threatening. [...] "But in this matter I doubt wisdom and he have long since become strangers." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl at the}} far end stirred, <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> {{and settled}} down again; her {{movement}} disengaged a scent of frowsy clothes. The policeman had approached and scrutinised these ill-assorted faces; his glance was jovially contemptuous till he noticed Shelton, and then was modified by curiosity.|$|E
60|$|Clara saw {{his mouth}} shut hard. Again he glanced at her. It seemed like an agreement. She bent over the cards, coughing, to <b>clear</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{slightly}} <b>clears</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> {{and lays}} a voluptuous cud of chewing gum upon the piano {{as the first}} notes of the accompaniment ring through the salon.|$|R
5000|$|... "That I Would Be Good" [...] (including Morissette <b>clearing</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> in the beginning, {{a slight}} lyric change {{in one of}} the verses and a {{slightly}} longer flute solo).|$|R
6000|$|The ladies {{looked at}} one another, Miss Isabella <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> and he knew a warning was coming; so he quickly said, 'One of the ladies, a clergyman's widow, was very kind to my father in his illness, and is really the best friend we have left in England.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} and waited. Mrs. Jackson felt unaccountably nervous; it had never {{occurred}} to her that a mere soldier could be so hard to deal with, and it was she who hesitated now. Jamie's stern eyes made her feel singularly like a culprit; but she <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> and straightened herself.|$|E
6000|$|Corny seated {{herself on}} a little stool near the yellow-legged party, the men of which had put down their guns for a time. Rectus and I sat on the forward railing, near her. Directly she <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> and then, after looking about her on each side, said to me, in very {{distinct}} tones: ...|$|E
6000|$|Claire {{seemed to}} be trying to speak. She made a delicate, feminine, clairesque {{approximation}} to <b>clearing</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> But Jeff ignored her and with almost osculatory affection continued to Milt: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no!" [...] {{she said}} in the same voice, but <b>clearing</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> with a little cough. [...] "And why didn't you see this Mr. Horseley after all? Oh, I forgot!--you said you changed your mind from {{something}} you'd heard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{all went}} on so, and made so sure," [...] said Elvira, hanging her head, [...] "and I never did {{know the real}} way the will was found till Janet told me. Babie, if you had heard Lady Clanmacnalty <b>clear</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> when people talked about the will being found, you would have {{believed}} she knew better than anyone." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{eyes were}} now turned to Sorais, who stood {{with that same}} slow smile upon her {{beautiful}} face which I had noticed {{the first time that}} I ever saw her. She paused a little while, and <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> and then thrice she curtseyed low, once to Nyleptha, once to Curtis, and once to Good, and began to speak in measured tones.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned to}} the mantelpiece for his tobacco-jar, and Rosa, after {{standing}} for some time at the [...] "ready" [...] with a hostile stare, <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> noisily and withdrew. The voices in the kitchen broke out with renewed vehemence; Mr. Hartley coughed again—a cough lacking in spirit—and, going out at the front door, passed through the side-entrance to the garden and tended his plants {{with his back to}} the kitchen window.|$|E
60|$|She let Greta {{into her}} room after a time, for the child had begun sobbing; {{but she would not}} talk, and sat hour after hour at the window with the air fanning her face, and the pain in her eyes turned to the sky and trees. After one or two {{attempts}} at consolation, Greta sank on the floor, and remained there, humbly gazing at her sister in a silence only broken when Christian <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> of tears, and by the song of birds in the garden. In the afternoon she slipped away and did not come back again.|$|E
6000|$|As {{she stood}} there listening, there {{occurred}} a slight desire to <b>clear</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> and she almost coughed. The feeling came upon her like a shock--what if she had let it out! But a sneeze! It was well known that sneezes came even to people the most healthy, and at moments the most inopportune, and well she knew from experience that to repress a sneeze would ensure an explosion fit to blow the little nose off her face. If a sneeze should come at that moment, she was lost! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Letta, quite {{pleased with}} the request. <b>Clearing</b> <b>her</b> little <b>throat</b> with the {{emphasis}} of one who has a long story to tell, she began {{with the statement that}} [...] "mamma was a darling." ...|$|R
2500|$|A 2012 {{commercial}} for Capital One credit cards, for which Baldwin was a spokesperson, made a humorous {{reference to the}} event: a Viking character from the ad series asks about the phone Baldwin is using, to which Baldwin facetiously replies {{that it is not}} to be used on the runway, ending with a chiding [...] "No!" [...] A 2012 Super Bowl {{commercial for}} Best Buy also humorously referenced the event. In the commercial, Words With Friends co-creators Paul Bettner and David Bettner are on a plane, and are interrupted by a flight attendant who loudly <b>clears</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> to indicate to them to put their phones away.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of you to say so, Mrs. Merrill" [...] {{answered}} Miss Lucretia, in her full, deep voice. It was by no means an unpleasant voice. She settled herself, though she sat quite upright, in the geometrical centre of the horsehair sofa, and <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] "To be quite honest with you, Mrs. Merrill," [...] she continued, [...] "I came upon particular errand, though I believe {{it would not be a}} perversion of the truth if I were to add that I have had for a month past every intention of paying you a friendly call." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" [...] followed; also [...] "The Assyrian Came Down," [...] {{and other}} declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises, and a {{spelling}} fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The prime {{feature of the}} evening was in order, now--original [...] "compositions" [...] by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward {{to the edge of}} the platform, <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to [...] "expression" [...] and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades. [...] "Friendship" [...] was one; [...] "Memories of Other Days"; [...] "Religion in History"; [...] "Dream Land"; [...] "The Advantages of Culture"; [...] "Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted"; [...] "Melancholy"; [...] "Filial Love"; [...] "Heart Longings," [...] etc., etc.|$|E
60|$|I went {{straight}} from that house to Burry Mills Hydro, keen {{for the first}} time in my life on playing golf, which is guaranteed to occupy the mind. Baxter had taken me a room communicating with his own, and after lunch introduced me to a tall, horse-headed elderly lady of decided manners, whom a white-haired maid pushed along in a bath-chair through the park-like grounds of the Hydro. She was Miss Mary Moultrie, and she coughed and <b>cleared</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> just like Baxter. She suffered--she told me it was a Moultrie castemark--from some obscure form of chronic bronchitis, complicated with spasm of the glottis; and, in a dead, flat voice, with a sunken eye that looked and saw not, told me what washes, gargles, pastilles, and inhalations she had proved most beneficial. From her I was passed on to her younger sister, Miss Elizabeth, a small and withered thing with twitching lips, victim, she told me, to very much the same sort of throat, but secretly devoted to another set of medicines. When she went away with Baxter and the bath-chair, I fell across a major of the Indian army with gout in his glassy eyes, and a stomach which he had taken all round the Continent. He laid everything before me; and him I escaped only to be confided in by a matron with a tendency to follicular tonsilitis and eczema. Baxter waited hand and foot on his cousins till five o'clock, trying, as I saw, to atone for his treatment of the dead sister. Miss Mary ordered him about like a dog.|$|E
5000|$|This sketch {{features}} Graham Chapman as {{a television}} interviewer and John Cleese in drag as a palaeontologist, Anne Elk, appearing in a television talk show titled Thrust. The plot of the sketch is that the interviewee, Anne Elk, can hardly describe the basis of her supposed new paleontological theory on dinosaurs, specifically Brontosauruses. After several false starts during which she repeatedly and noisily attempts to <b>clear</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> Miss Elk spends most of the interview circuitously {{leading up to the}} 'theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets.' It turns out that in the end Miss Elk's new theory on brontosauruses is rather shallow: 'All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the far end.' Her true concern is that she receive full credit for devising this new theory: 'That is my theory, it is mine and belongs to me, and I own it and what it is, too.' ...|$|R
40|$|A 43 -year-old woman {{presented}} {{after a week}} {{of upper}} respiratory tract infection symptoms. She had been evaluated the week prior and treated with cephalexin. Since her initial evaluation she had complained of continued dry mouth, sore throat, diplopia, and episodes of slurred speech. On evaluation in a California emergency department, the patient complained of diplopia and trouble swallowing. She was noted to be “sleepy”, with drooping eyelids, but she was able to answer all questions appropriately and did not appear intoxicated. On careful questioning, the patient admitted to being an injection drug abuser. Past medical history was non-contributory. She used no medications and denied any surgical history. She had no history of drug allergies and family history was negative. Physical exam demonstrated a women sitting on a gurney with her eyes partially closed. She answered all questions without any sign of confusion. Airway was open, but the patient had to repeatedly <b>clear</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> Pulse was 105, BP 125 / 90 lying and 93 / 70 standing, and respiratory rate was 18. Temperature was 37. 1 and oxygen saturation was 98 % on room air. The patient’s pupils were equal at 7 mm and reacted to light. Bilateral ptosis was noted. Her soft palate was symmetrical. A mild facial asymmetry. Upper extremity strength was noted to be 4 +/ 5, while lower extremities were 5 / 5. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrically decreased...|$|R
60|$|Ben thanked his stars, as he {{had already}} done more than once, that {{he knew how to}} take care of a horse; for he delayed by the watering-place long enough to wash out Lita's mouth with a handful of wet grass, to let her have one swallow to <b>clear</b> <b>her</b> dusty <b>throat,</b> and then went slowly back over the breezy hills, patting and praising the good {{creature}} for her intelligence and speed. She knew well enough that she had been a clever little mare, and tossed her head, arched her glossy neck, and ambled daintily along, as conscious and coquettish as a pretty woman, looking round at her admiring rider to return his compliments by glance of affection, and caressing sniffs of a velvet nose at his bare feet.|$|R
60|$|She drew {{herself up}} and set back <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>her</b> eyes shining yellow and dangerous.|$|R
2500|$|... "After I stabbed Lauren, I ran up {{the bank}} to where I tied Nichole up. She must have heard what I had done to Lauren because when I got to her she said, 'you're going to kill me, aren't you.' I said 'shut up' and walked around to her left side and I cut <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> two or three times. This was across <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> The knife was in my left hand. Nichole was sitting down when I cut <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bowen {{could not}} turn paler than her {{headache}} had left her, and she now underwent no change of complexion. But <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> was not <b>clear</b> {{enough to say}} to the end, [...] "Allowed you to stay in--" [...] The trouble in <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> arrested <b>her</b> again.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl looked}} away over the shimmering lake of yellow-green corn. A choking came into <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> <b>Her</b> gloved hand trembled.|$|R
60|$|A choking lump rose to <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>her</b> head drooped {{in silent}} misery upon the little bundle {{that she had}} caught {{suddenly}} to her breast.|$|R

60|$|We took Lucy {{into another}} room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her {{in bed and}} forced {{a few drops of}} brandy down <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk {{handkerchief}} round <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.|$|R
6000|$|Her hands went to <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> <b>Her</b> {{eyes seemed}} as though they would devour me. Yet she was not wholly sure! I took her into my arms! ...|$|R
