40|$|The 20 known {{transforming}} (onc) {{genes of}} retroviruses {{are defined by}} sequences that are transduced from cellular genes termed protooncogenes or cellular oncogenes. Based on these sequences, viral onc genes have been postulated to be transduced <b>cellular</b> <b>cancer</b> genes, and proto-onc genes have been postulated to be latent cancer genes that can be activated from within the cell to cause virus-negative tumors. The hypothesis is popular because it promises direct access to <b>cellular</b> <b>cancer</b> genes. However, the existence of latent cancer genes presents a paradox, since such genes are clearly undesirable. The hypothesis predicts that viral onc genes and proto-onc genes are isogenic; that expression of proto-onc genes induces tumors; that activated proto-onc genes transform diploid cells upon transfection, like viral onc genes; and that diploid tumors exist. As yet, none of these predictions is confirmed. Instead: Structural comparisons between viral onc genes, essential retroviral genes, and proto-onc genes show that all viral onc genes are indeed new genes, rather than transduced <b>cellular</b> <b>cancer</b> genes. They are recombinants put together from truncated viral and truncated proto-onc genes. Proto-onc genes are frequently expressed in normal cells. To date, not one activated proto-onc gene has been isolated that transforms diploid cells. Above all, no diploid tumors with activated proto-onc genes have been found. Moreover, the probability of spontaneous transformation in vivo is at least 10 (9) times lower than predicted from the mechanisms thought to activate proto-onc genes. Therefore, the hypothesis that proto-onc genes are latent cellular oncogenes {{appears to be an}} overinterpretation of sequence homology to structural and functional homology with viral onc genes. Here it is proposed that only rare truncations and illegitimate recombinations that alter the germ-line configuration of cellular genes generate viral and possibly <b>cellular</b> <b>cancer</b> genes. The clonal chromosome abnormalities that are consistently found in tumor cells are microscopic evidence for rearrangements that may generate cancer genes.

We extended an established yeast two-hybrid system employing human protein kinases for the analyses of phospho-tyrosine (pY) -dependent PPIs {{in a direct}} experimental, large-scale approach.

Through treatment of cancer cell cultures with purified protease, {{it is possible to}} make preparations of cell-surface antigens that are free of intracellular content and contain two orders-of-magnitude less protein than the whole lysate of an equivalent number of cancer cells. Despite this difference in total protein content, protease-generated preparations stimulate anti-cancer responses from immune cells better those stimulated with cancer cells themselves. The composition of collected cell-surface antigens, prior to vaccination, can be directly compared with antigenic profile of target cancer cells by the proteomic footprinting. Any contaminates (cell parasites, viruses, toxins, prions, etc.) are easily separated from antigens by means of ultrafiltration. Thus, current cellular vaccines may be improved by replacing whole cancer cells with their isolated cell-surface antigens.

40|$|Plasmacytoid {{dendritic}} cells (pDCs) play {{a crucial}} role in initiating immune responses by secreting large amounts of type I IFNs. Currently, the role for human pDCs as professional APCs in the cross-presentation of exogenous Ags is being re-evaluated. Human pDCs are equipped with a broad repertoire of Ag uptake receptors and an efficient Ag-processing machinery. In this study, we set out to investigate which receptor can best be deployed to deliver Ag to pDCs for Ag (cross-) presentation. We show that targeting nanoparticles to pDCs via the C-type lectins DEC- 205, DC immunoreceptor, blood DC Ag- 2, or the FcR CD 32 led to uptake, processing, and (cross-) presentation of encapsulated Ag to both CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells. This makes these receptors good candidates for potential in vivo targeting of pDCs by nanocarriers. Notably, the coencapsulated TLR 7 agonist R 848 efficiently activated pDCs, resulting in phenotypical maturation as well as robust IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha production. Taken together, their cross-presentation capacity and type I IFN production to further activate components of both the innate and adaptive immune system mark pDCs as inducers of potent antitumor responses.

To this end, cell proteomic footprinting, which reflects the mass spectrometry profiling of cell surface proteins, {{was applied to}} breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF- 7), which were untreated or treated with doxorubicin, tamoxifen, or etoposide. The footprints of drug-treated cells were compared with the footprints of untreated cells and the footprint of a randomly selected control cancer cell culture. It was found that drug-treated cells have reproducible, pronounced, and drug-specific changes in cell surface protein expression. Cytotoxicity assays, which are an in vitro model of human antitumor vaccination, revealed {{that the degree of}} these changes correlates directly with the ability of the cancer cells to escape cell death induced by a cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response. Moreover, cancer cells escape from the immune response was linearly approximated (R 2 equal to 0. 99) with the degree by which their proteomic footprints diverged from the footprint of the targeted (native) cancer cells. From these findings, it was concluded that the design of anticancer vaccines intended to prevent cancer recurrence after primary treatment should consider the drug-specific changes in cancer cell-surface antigens.

40|$|IL- 2 and IL- 21 {{are closely}} related cytokines that might have arisen by gene duplication. Both cytokines promote the {{function}} of effector CD 8 + T cells, but their distinct effects on antigen-driven differentiation of naive CD 8 + T cells into effector CD 8 + T cells are not clearly understood. We found that antigen-induced expression of Eomesodermin (Eomes) and maturation of naive CD 8 + T cells into granzyme B- and CD 44 -expressing effector CD 8 + T cells was enhanced by IL- 2, but, unexpectedly, suppressed by IL- 21. Furthermore, IL- 21 repressed expression of IL- 2 Ra and inhibited IL- 2 –mediated acquisition of a cytolytic CD 8 + T-cell phenotype. Despite its inhibitory effects, IL- 21 did not induce anergy, but instead potently enhanced the capacity of cells to mediate tumor regression upon adoptive transfer. In contrast, IL- 2 impaired the subsequent antitumor function of transferred cells. Gene expression studies revealed a distinct IL- 21 program that was characterized phenotypically by increased expression of L-selectin and functionally by enhanced antitumor immunity that was not reversed by secondary in vitro stimulation with antigen and IL- 2. Thus, the efficacy of CD 8 + T cells for adoptive immunotherapy can be influenced by opposing differentiation programs conferred by IL- 2 and IL- 21, a finding with important implications {{for the development of}} <b>cellular</b> <b>cancer</b> therapies...|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a steadily growing number of tumor antigens (TAs) has made generic, cell-free, peptide-based cancer vaccines a possible alternative to cytokine-transfected autologous <b>cellular</b> <b>cancer</b> vaccines. The major drawback of peptide vaccines, however, is the poor immunogenicity of peptides. It is commonly thought that for the induction of an effective anticancer immune response, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have to display TA-derived peptides to T lymphocytes. Polycationic amino acids have been employed {{in the past to}} enhance transport of proteins into cells. In a systematic study, the ability of different cationic polymers to transfer fluorescence-tagged peptides to APCs was investigated. We were able to show that several compounds enhance uptake of fluorescence-labeled peptides by APCs to different degrees. The most efficient compound identified, polyarginine (pArg), enhanced peptide delivery by more than 2 logs as compared with cells treated with peptide alone, whereas polylysine (pLys) treatment resulted in approximately 10 -fold increased levels of fluorescence. Augmentation of peptide uptake was concentration-dependent, and the molecular weight of pArg or pLys also influenced peptide delivery. Furthermore, highly negatively charged peptides appear to be delivered with higher efficiency, although neutral peptides were also taken up at enhanced rates. Whereas peptide uptake mediated by pLys appears to be due to an at least transient permeabilization of cell membranes, peptide delivery in the presence of pArg may rely on endocytic processes.
