25|$|<b>Cakewalk</b> – a pre-ragtime {{dance form}} popular until about 1904. The music is {{intended}} to be representative of an African-American dance contest in which the prize is a cake. Many early rags are cakewalks.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, African-American dance {{began to}} appear in {{minstrel}} shows. These shows often presented African Americans as caricatures for ridicule to large audiences. The first African-American dance to become popular with white dancers was the <b>cakewalk</b> in 1891. Later dances to follow in this tradition include the Charleston, the Lindy Hop, the Jitterbug and the swing.|$|E

25|$|He {{wrote his}} famous Children's Corner Suite (1908) for his beloved daughter, Claude-Emma, whom he nicknamed Chouchou. The suite recalls classicism – the opening piece Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum refers to Muzio Clementi's {{collection}} of instructional piano compositions Gradus ad Parnassum – {{as well as}} a new wave of American ragtime music. In the popular final piece of the suite, Golliwogg's <b>Cakewalk,</b> Debussy also pokes fun at Richard Wagner by mimicking the opening bars of Wagner's prelude to Tristan und Isolde.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 19th century an {{increasing}} number of black musicians learned to play European instruments, particularly the violin, which they used to parody European dance music in their own <b>cakewalk</b> dances. In turn, European-American minstrel show performers in blackface popularized the music internationally, combining syncopation with European harmonic accompaniment. In the mid-1800s the white New Orleans composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk adapted slave rhythms and melodies from Cuba and other Caribbean islands into piano salon music. New Orleans was the main nexus between the Afro-Caribbean and African-American cultures.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} early {{computer-controlled}} sequencers such as <b>Cakewalk</b> (sequencer) {{has led to}} the design of native Digital Audio Workstation or DAW platforms. Native DAW platforms such as Performer and more recent Digital Performer by Mark of the Unicorn (MOTU), Steinberg's Cubase and Nuendo, Apple's Logic Pro and Cakewalk's Sonar now have significant market share as well as professional studio users, though the most broadly accepted system is currently Avid's Pro Tools. They are particularly popular with home recording enthusiasts and artists making demos that might in the past have required expensive studio time. Furthermore, mixes can be achieved using a computer only, otherwise known as in the box.|$|E
50|$|Sylvester Louis Ossman {{was born}} in Hudson, New York, and made his first {{recordings}} in 1893. He {{became one of the}} most recorded musicians of his day, recording marches, <b>cakewalks,</b> and rags. He also accompanied popular singers, such as Arthur Collins and Len Spencer.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{technology}} {{was added to}} <b>Cakewalk's</b> Sonar (calling it [...] "Groove Clips") and Cubase (calling it Audio Warp). Although the phrase [...] "acid loops" [...] technically is only associated with Sonic Foundry, some people use the term {{to refer to the}} technique even when used with other software packages.|$|R
50|$|There is {{also the}} VSC, Virtual Sound Canvas, range of PC {{software}} which provide GM and GSsynthesis on Windows PCs. Many versions of <b>Cakewalk's</b> Sonar software came bundled {{with a copy of}} VSC, though from Sonar 4 onwards they ship with the improved TTS-1 softsynth, which Roland has sold previously through its Edirol subsidiary as the HyperCanvas.|$|R
25|$|His {{start in}} show business, like his early life, is also {{shrouded}} in myth. Most sources cite his first female role originally having {{been at the}} age of ten with the Boston Cadets Review at the Tremont Theater in Boston. He is reported to have played the role so well that the next year the revue was written around him which led to minor roles elsewhere. But as to how he came to perform as a female a decade later with the Boston Cadets, sources differ. In some versions he was taking <b>cakewalk</b> lessons from a Mrs. Wyman's dance studio when he impressed upon his teacher an incredible ability to emulate females. It is said to be Mrs. Wyman who encouraged young William to study the art of female impersonation. Boys often play female roles in all male theater groups.|$|E
25|$|Erik Satie, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and {{the other}} members of The Group of Six in Paris never made any secret of their sympathy for ragtime, which is {{sometimes}} evident in their works. Consider, in particular, the ballet of Satie, Parade (Ragtime du Paquebot), (1917) and La Mort de Monsieur Mouche, an overture for piano for a drama in three acts, composed in the early 1900s in memory of his friend J.P. Contamine de Latour. In 1902 the American <b>cakewalk</b> was very popular in Paris and Satie two years later wrote two rags, La Diva de l'empire and Piccadilly. Despite the two Anglo-Saxon settings, the tracks appear American-inspired. La Diva de l'empire, a march for piano soloist, was written for Paulette Darty and initially bore the title Stand-Walk Marche; it was later subtitled Intermezzo Americain when Rouarts-Lerolle reprinted it in 1919. Piccadilly, another march, was initially titled The Transatlantique; it presented a stereotypical wealthy American heir sailing on an ocean liner on the New York–Europe route, going to trade his fortune for an aristocratic title in Europe. There is a similar influence in Milhaud's ballets Le boeuf sur le toite and Creation du Monde, which he wrote after a trip to Harlem during his trip in 1922. Even the Swiss composer Honegger wrote works in which the influence of African American music is pretty obvious. Examples include Pacific 231, Prélude et Blues and especially the Concertino for piano and orchestra.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Indiana yet again. In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79–78, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back, however, and took the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Sixers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win (with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121–88 rout) and Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88–87 victory that sent the Sixers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging {{injuries}} that had plagued him late in the season. Though most predicted a Milwaukee <b>cakewalk,</b> the 76ers kept the game close before falling, 80–74. Philadelphia seemed to gain momentum despite the loss, and they would win Games Four and Five. Milwaukee put any Sixer celebration plans on hold by building up a 33-point lead in the third quarter of Game Six, but the 76ers would make a furious fourth-quarter rally before falling 110–100. Struggling in the series up to that point, Iverson scored 26 points in the final quarter to finish with 46 on the night and appeared to have gotten a second wind. In Game Seven, the Bucks jumped out to a 34–25 second quarter advantage before seldom-used reserve Raja Bell scored 10 points to spark a 23–4 run that gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Iverson scored 44 points and the 76ers pulled away in the second half, winning by a 108–91 score to put them in the NBA Finals for the first time since 1983. As had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11–0 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale (both the Sixers and the Lakers finished with identical 56–26 records, but Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers), the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road.|$|E
50|$|A Scottish fiddler named Niel Gow {{is usually}} {{credited}} with developing (during the 1740s) the short bow sawstroke technique that defined Appalachian fiddling. This technique was altered {{during the next}} century, with European waltzes and polkas being most influential. Square dances, based on the cotillion, and <b>cakewalks,</b> an African American imitation of white dances and the Virginia Reel arose during the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|James Melville Fulton (1873-1940) was a composer, arranger, conductor, {{and music}} {{educator}} {{best known for}} composing marches. He {{is often associated with}} the traditional British melody Garry Owen which he arranged for band in 1903. His most recognized march is Associated Press, published in 1897. His more than 245 compositions include more than 144 marches (more than Sousa) as well as many waltzes, polkas, overtures, schottisches, reveries, and <b>cakewalks.</b>|$|R

When Guiteau finishes, the Balladeer enters and sings about Guiteau's trial and {{sentencing}} while Guiteau merrily <b>cakewalks</b> up to the noose, getting more and more desperately optimistic with each verse. Guiteau sings along with the Balladeer about Guiteau's optimism before he is finally hanged ("The Ballad of Guiteau").|$|R
500|$|Joplin {{combines}} the waltz' [...] "oom-pa-pah" [...] rhythm and its conventionally accented three quarter {{notes in the}} bass, with a syncopated melody in the treble. The main melody line used in the introduction and then repeated regularly throughout, with its alternate unaccented eighth notes and accented quarter notes, is {{the rhythm of the}} <b>Cakewalk</b> minus the final note. The <b>Cakewalk</b> was a popular African-American dance which originated in plantation slave communities in nineteenth century America, and ultimately contributed to the musical style Ragtime. [...] The simultaneous sounding of the two independent rhythms, he combination of the waltz in the bass and the syncopation of the main theme in the treble, {{is an example of a}} 4 against 3 polyrhythm. There are many subtle variations of this sequence which occur throughout the work.|$|E
500|$|Ragtime was {{originally}} a piano style, featuring syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms. It {{is primarily a}} form of dance music utilizing the walking bass, and is generally composed in sonata form. Ragtime is a refined and evolved form of the African American <b>cakewalk</b> dance, mixed with styles ranging from European marches and popular songs to jigs and other dances played by large African American bands in northern cities during {{the end of the}} 19th century. The most famous ragtime performer and composer was Scott Joplin, known for works such as [...] "Maple Leaf Rag".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{reviews of the}} musical, Rodgers was given credit for an imaginative score. [...] "Sweet Thursday" [...] is a <b>cakewalk,</b> unusual for Rodgers who rarely wrote them. However, Rodgers biographer William Hyland {{suggests}} that [...] "Sweet Thursday" [...] was {{out of character for}} Traubel's voice. Hyland also speculates that [...] "The Next Time It Happens", a duet for Suzy and Doc as they decide their love will not work, needed to be more melancholy, and Doc's [...] "The Man I Used To Be" [...] more of a lament rather than having a lively melody. According to Broadway writer Ken Mandelbaum, [...] "Pipe Dream contains a generally fascinating score." [...] He terms Suzy's [...] "Everybody's Got a Home but Me", a [...] "gorgeous ballad of yearning".|$|E

5000|$|A South Carolinian told of Griffin, a fiddler {{who played}} for the dances of the whites {{as well as for}} the [...] "annual <b>cakewalks</b> of his own people". In 1960, a story told to him by his {{childhood}} nanny in 1901 was repeated by 80-year-old actor Leigh Whipple, [...] "Us slave watched white folks' parties where the guests danced a minuet and then paraded in a grand march, with the ladies and gentlemen going different ways and then meeting again, arm in arm, and marching down the center together. Then we'd do it too, but we used to mock 'em every step. Sometimes the white folks noticed it, but they seemed to like it; I guess they thought we couldn't dance any better." ...|$|R
500|$|Hebden {{recorded}} Rounds {{over ten}} months in his North London flat, using a desktop {{computer and a}} home hi-fi system. With {{the exception of a}} guitar part recorded for [...] "Slow Jam", he composed the music exclusively from a file of samples he had assembled over several years. The album uses between 200 and 300 samples; each song is built from between 20 and 30 samples heavily processed with the software packages AudioMulch and Cool Edit Pro, in many cases beyond recognition. The nine-minute track [...] "Unspoken" [...] was originally based on a sample from the Tori Amos song [...] "Winter" [...] but was reworked when Hebden failed to get sample clearance.

Likewise, ComputerAndVideoGames.com called the gameplay [...] "incredibly compelling and addictive". GameZone noted that the gameplay was more refined and challenging than that of previous titles. However, GameSpot called the games [...] "a <b>cakewalk</b> from start to finish" [...] and claimed that Ruby and Sapphire [...] "don't offer much of a challenge". Eurogamer also felt that the mechanics [...] " [...] very tired, very fast". 1UP.com also felt that the games were formulaic and that double battles were underused.|$|E
500|$|During Bomar's {{senior season}} (when {{he moved to}} halfback), the Commodores tied the Quantico Marines 13–13. Bomar, picking up a fumble, ran 84 yards for a touchdown. According to a {{newspaper}} account, [...] "It was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up {{what looked like a}} Marine <b>cakewalk.</b> After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield was in there. Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then he seemed a little undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. His thin, yellow hair stood out. On he swept like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal. Bedlam broke loose." [...] Captain and guard Tuck Kelly was injured during the game, making Bomar the interim captain two weeks later against the Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the nineteenth}} century ended, American taste in popular music turned to less sentimental fare: {{patriotic}} songs, ragtime (more syncopated African-American styles than the minstrel songs and <b>cakewalks),</b> union and labor songs, and songs created for and derived from the more recent ethnic immigrant communities. At the same time, {{a new group of}} writers and composers began to dominate Tin Pan Alley and the explosive growth in recorded music soon dwarfed sheet music sales. Despite these changes Dresser continued to write in his own genre, known as [...] "mother-and-home" [...] songs to later generations. In 1900 Dresser published one of his last hit [...] songs, [...] "The Blue and the Gray". Although Dresser's songs were popularized by Richard Jose and others, his music was falling out of style. Sales of his music quickly decreased.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Leslie Johnson (December 3, 1876 - December 28, 1950) was an American {{composer}} of ragtime {{and popular}} music.

He published over 300 songs in his life, nearly 40 of them ragtime compositions such as [...] "Doc Brown’s Cakewalk", [...] "Dill Pickles", [...] "Apple Jack (Some Rag)", and [...] "Snookums Rag". His best selling piece, a sentimental ballad called [...] "Sweet and Low", sold over a million copies. Experts believe that had Johnson {{lived and worked in}} New York, he would be included alongside Scott Joplin, James Scott, and Joseph Lamb {{as one of the greatest}} ragtime composers. He wrote more than the other three combined and exemplified a greater range of talent, composing waltzes, tangos, <b>cakewalks,</b> marches, novelty pieces, and other types of music popular at that time.|$|R
40|$|MidiTrans is an {{application}} {{built on a}} visual language that supports general processing of standard MIDI files. Unlike most software sequencer programs that have a fixed repertoire of transforms, MidiTrans allows any transform to be implemented using {{the elements of a}} visual data-flow language. MidiTrans allows conditional transforming, and thus has much more of the flavor of a programming language. It allows transforms like: In this interval in these tracks, if the top note is less than a fifth away from the next highest note, then transpose it up an octave, unless this results too high a note. A MIDI file is processed by MidiTrans as a structured stream of MIDI commands using the generator/ collector metaphor. Arrays and lists are supported as polymorphic structures, and the basic data types include MIDI events and timestamps, both important in MIDI files. A comparison with OpCodes MAX, and <b>Cakewalks</b> CAL is made to illustrate the power and ease of use of MidiTrans, which runs on Windows 95 or NT platforms...|$|R
500|$|During {{his ninth}} season in 1966, Taylor did not sign a new one-year {{contract}} and instead played out his option; {{he made no}} secret that it was likely his last season with the Packers. He caught a career-high 41 passes that year but recorded the fewest rushing yards since his second season. The Packers finished atop the Western Division with a 12–2 record and defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the 1966 NFL Championship Game for their fourth NFL title in six years. In January 1967, Taylor and the Packers played in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, known retroactively as Super Bowl I, in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. They easily defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 35–10. Taylor was the top rusher of the game with 56 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} on a Packer Sweep play, with his score being the first rushing touchdown in Super Bowl history. [...] "It was just good blocking on a weak-side sweep play," [...] said Taylor of his touchdown run. [...] "It's a <b>cakewalk</b> when you get the blocking. It was just like we had been doing the last five or six years." [...] The game was his final with the Packers.|$|E
500|$|Clusters {{were also}} {{beginning}} {{to appear in}} more pieces by European composers. Isaac Albéniz's use of them in Iberia (1905–8) may have influenced Gabriel Fauré's subsequent piano writing. Joseph Horowitz {{has suggested that the}} [...] "dissonant star clusters" [...] in its third and fourth books were particularly compelling to Olivier Messiaen, who called Iberia [...] "the wonder of the piano." [...] The Thomas de Hartmann score for Wassily Kandinsky's stage show The Yellow Sound (1909) employs a chromatic cluster at two climactic points. Alban Berg's Four Pieces for clarinet and piano (1913) calls for clusters along with other avant-garde keyboard techniques. Claude Debussy's Piano Prelude “La Cathédrale Engloutie” makes powerful use of clusters to evoke the sound of “pealing bells – with so many added major seconds one would call this pan-diatonic harmony.”: In his 1913 piano prelude “General Lavine – Excentric”, one of the first pieces to be influenced by black American popular styles (the <b>Cakewalk)</b> Debussy features abrasive tone clusters {{at the conclusion of the}} following passage: [...] In his 1915 arrangement for solo piano of his Six Epigraphes Antiques (1914), originally a set of piano duets, Debussy includes tone clusters in the fifth piece, [...] Richard Strauss's An Alpine Symphony (1915) [...] "starts and ends with the setting sun—a B flat minor chord cluster slowly built down." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ida Forsyne {{was born}} on South Side, Chicago, Illinois in 1883, and raised by her mother. Forsyne’s mother was a maid and her father {{disappeared}} {{when she was about}} two years old. Although her mother was not supportive of her dancing, Forsyne watched rehearsals at local theaters and learned to dance. The family lived {{across the street from the}} Alhambra Theater so Forsyne would “would climb the fire escape to see the shows,” Forsyne recalled in an article in 1953. At age 10 she danced and sang for money on the street, candy stores, hotels and rent parties. She also worked as a Pick (Pickaninny) and <b>cakewalked</b> at the Chicago World’s Fair. By age 14, Forsyne ran away to join a ‘Tab Show’ called the ‘Black Bostonians Coon Town 400’. With this show she sang and danced Legomania or rubberlegging style in a Buck Dance routine. She also sung a duet with performer Rosie Grayson; a lullaby called “Drowsy Babe.” The show went broke in Montana and Forsyne was stranded. Although Forsyne had not written to tell her mother what had happened, “when her mother heard they were stranded…she contacted fire and poilice departments and the mayor, to ‘send my children home.’” Forsyne and the other child in the show, Eddie Gray, were sent home.|$|R

2500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} unusual {{elements}} of character dance in modern Highland dance competitions is the inclusion of the <b>Cakewalk.</b> The <b>cakewalk</b> is originally a dance performed by black slaves in the southern US imitating, in exaggerated style, the stately courtship ballroom dancing of slave owners. It is unique in competitive Highland Dance as it is the only dance always performed as a duo and is the only dance that originated outside the British Isles. Also unique is the inclusion of fanciful and often outrageous costumes upon which some of the judging of artistry is based. While costume contests do occasionally take place regarding the outfits worn for the other dances, the outfits for those dances are so carefully prescribed (differences are restricted primarily to choice of tartan, color of jackets or sashes, and choices such as lace sleeves and velvet vests instead of velvet jackets) that costume does not {{play a significant role in}} the dance competition or vary much across dancers. In contrast, while the <b>cakewalk</b> may be danced in traditional Scottish attire, dancers involved in the <b>cakewalk</b> often attempt to come up with the most creative duo costume they can, such as Frankstein and his bride or Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The <b>cakewalk</b> is generally only danced at very large scale competitions such as national or provincial championships and is generally restricted to the top level of competitive dancers known as [...] "premier" [...] (formerly [...] "open".) The <b>Cakewalk</b> is generally performed to [...] "Whistling Rufus" [...] Written in 1899 by Kerry Mills. The inclusion of the <b>Cakewalk</b> in competitive Highland Dance is credited to dancer, judge and examiner James L. McKenzie who introduced the dance to Scotland from the United States.|$|E
