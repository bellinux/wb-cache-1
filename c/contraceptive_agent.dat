40|$|It is {{important}} to identify effective contraceptive drugs that cause minimal disruption to physiological processes. Phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE 3) inhibitors suppress meiosis in oocytes by decreasing the level of cAMP and blocking the extrusion of the first polar body. In this study, we tested the PDE 3 inhibitor, cilostazol, as a potential <b>contraceptive</b> <b>agent.</b> The effects of cilostazol treatment in vitro and in vivo on the suppression of oocyte maturation in a mouse model were investigated. The results indicated that treatment with increasing concentrations of cilostazol led to a dose-dependent arrest in meiosis progression. The effective in vitro concentration was 1 ÂµM and was 300 mg/kg in vivo. The effect of cilostazol was reversible. After removal of the drug, meiosis resumed and mouse oocytes matured in vitro, and showed normal chromosome alignment and spindle organization. After fertilization using an ICSI method, the oocytes showed normal morphology, fertilization rate, embryo cleavage, blastocyst formation, and number of viable pups when compared with controls. The offspring showed similar body weight and fertility. In vivo, the mice became infertile if the drug was injected sequentially, and became pregnant following discontinuation of cilostazol. More importantly, no side effects of cilostazol were observed in treated female mice as demonstrated by blood pressure and heart rate monitoring. It is concluded that cilostazol, a drug routinely used for intermittent claudication, can effectively inhibit oocyte maturation in vitro and in vivo, {{does not affect the}} developmental potential of oocytes following drug removal and has few side effects in female mice treated with this drug. These findings suggest that cilostazol may be a potential new <b>contraceptive</b> <b>agent</b> that may facilitate an efficacy and safety study of this drug...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>agents</b> (OCA) on {{riboflavin}} nutritional {{status of women}} of child-bearing age in a low socioeconomic population was studied. For a control group, 100 women in the same age and socioeconomic group using alternate forms of contraception were selected. Riboflavin deficiency was determined by measuring erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity, a reliable index of the deficiency. None of the women was on vitamin supplements or had clinical conditions effecting dietary intake or utilization. Eleven of 100 women {{in the control group}} had biochemical evidence of deficiency. This compared to 24 of 56 OCA users who were deficient. The frequency of deficiency increased among those on OCA for longer periods of time. Thirteen of 17 OCA users for 3 years or more, compared to 11 of 39 users under 3 years were deficient. There were no discernable dietary differences between the groups. These studies demonstrate that riboflavin deficiency is a problem of women in the lower socioeconomic level in the child-bearing age. The use of OCA aggravates the prevalence of deficiency. Am. J.

ABSTRACT Thiamin, riboflavin, and {{pantothenic acid}} status was determined in 13 young women, 19 to 25 years of age, {{at the beginning}} and end of a 12 -day confmed study. Nine of the women were using oral <b>contraceptive</b> <b>agents</b> (+OCA) and the other four were not (-OCA).

Prestudy intakes, estimated from 3 -day dietary records, were about one-hall of the thiamin, riboflavin, and pantothenic acid levels fed in the study and were similar in both groups. Use of OCAâs did not appear to influence the activity of erythrocyte transketolase or erythrocyte glutathi-one reductase or the response of these enzymes to in vitro stimulation by their cofactors.
