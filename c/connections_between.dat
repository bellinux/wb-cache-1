5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics.

40|$|Introduction: Hypervigilance {{and fear}} of pain can cause pain {{patients}} to avoid certain activities. Those activities include activities {{that might lead to}} recovery. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether implementation intentions that strengthen the mental <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> pain and a performance goal on a painful finger pressing task can reduce avoidance of a painful task in healthy participants. Method: 75 participants ranging from 17 - 27 years old were randomly assigned to 3 different groups. 1 group formed implementation intentions that strengthened the mental <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> pain and a performance goal, 1 group formed implementation intentions that created a mental <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> a neutral stimulus and a performance goal and 1 group formed goal intentions. The participants had to press a button 5 times per second, which resulted in a painful sensation in the arm of participants. To measure avoidance of the painful task, the time spended on the task and the number of presses were registered. The hypothesis was that implementation intentions that strengthened the mental <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> pain and a performance goal would lead to a greater reduction of avoidance compared implementation intentions that created a <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> a neutral stimulus and a performance goal and compared to goal intentions. Also it was expected that implementation intentions that created a mental <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> a neutral stimulus and a performance goal would lead to a greater reduction of avoidance than goal intentions. Results: Implementation intentions that strengthened the mental <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> pain and a performance goal led to a greater reduction of avoidance than goal intentions, but not than implementation intentions that created a <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> a neutral stimulus and a performance goal. Implementation intentions that created a mental <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> a neutral stimulus and a performance goal did not lead to a greater reduction of avoidance than goal intentions. Discussion: The findings of the current study suggest that implementation intentions that strengthen the mental <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> pain and a performance goal could be a useful instrument in reducing avoidance of painful activities in pain patients...|$|R

5|$|In the 7th and 8th centuries, {{expanding}} Muslim conquests {{following the}} advent of Islam led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> Rome and the Byzantine Empire. Conflicts involving authority in the church, particularly {{the authority of the}} Bishop of Rome finally culminated in the East–West Schism in the 11th century, splitting the Church into the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Earlier splits within the Church occurred after the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in communion with Rome, and portions of some others established communion in the 15th century and later, forming what are called the Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E
40|$|Technology now at hand can {{integrate}} {{all kinds}} of digital information for individuals, groups, and organizations so their information usefully links together. iInfo(TM) information integration works by making connections including examples like the following: - A statistical <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> "being in a traffic jam" and "driving in downtown Trenton between 5 PM and 6 PM on a weekday. " - A terminological <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> "MSR" and "Microsoft Research. " - A causal <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> "joining a group" and "being {{a member of the}} group. " - A syntactic <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> "a pin dropped" and "a dropped pin. " - A biological <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> "a dolphin" and "a mammal". - A demographic <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> "undocumented residents of California" and " 7 % of the population of California. " - A geographical <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> "Leeds" and "England. " - A temporal <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> "turning on a computer" and "joining an on-line discussion. " By making these connections, iInfo offers tremendous value for individuals, families, groups, and organizations in making more effective use of information technology. In practice, integrated information is invariably pervasively inconsistent. Therefore iInfo must be able to make connections {{even in the face of}} inconsistency. The business of iInfo is not to make difficult decisions like deciding the ultimate truth or probability of propositions. Instead it provides means for processing information and carefully recording its provenance including arguments (including arguments about arguments) for and against propositions that is used by iConsult(TM) and iEntertain(TM) apps in iOrgs(TM) Information Systems. A historical perspective on the above questions is highly pertinent to the current quest to develop foundations for privacy-friendly client-cloud computing. Comment: updated title and abstrac...|$|R
