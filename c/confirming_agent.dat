5000|$|Microsporum gypseum is {{categorized}} as a rare agent of infection, and usually only occurs in rural areas. The infections associated with hair {{can also be}} prone to fluorescence under a Wood's Lamp. Sometimes these clinical manifestations are not ringworm but appear as impetigo, scleroderma or psoriasis. The lesions are usually inflammatory, impetiginous, and sometimes bullous with rapid development and resolution; this is accompanied by scarring and permanent patches alopecia. The greatest intensity of inflammation is at the advancing margin of the ring. Direct examination with KOH of skin, reveal mycelium and masses of arthroconidia in some chains; KOH examination of hair produces distinctive large macroconidia in chain or irregular masses of hair. Mycelium was also discovered to run parallel to its length. Wood's lamp tests on humans indicate the fungus by fluorescence. The fungus is encountered rarely as a <b>confirmed</b> <b>agent</b> of onychomycosis in which the infection is validated by both a direct observation of filaments in the nail and recovery of the fungus in culture.<<ref name=Romano /> ref name=Romano2 /> ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTen {{years after}} the {{discovery}} of spirochaetes as agents of Lyme disease in 1982 in the USA, three genomic species had diverged from the phenotypically heterogeneous strains of Borrelia burgdorferi isolated in North America and Europe: Borrelia afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (further B. burgdorferi), and Borrelia garinii. Whereas B. burgdorferi remained the only human pathogen in North America, all three species are aetiological agents of Lyme borreliosis in Europe. Another seven genospecies were described in the 1990 s, including species from Asia (Borrelia japonica, Borrelia turdi, and B. tanukii), North America (Borrelia andersonii), Europe (Borrelia lusitaniae and Borrelia valaisiana), and from Europe and Asia (Borrelia bissettii). Another eight species were delineated in the years up to 2010 : Borrelia sinica (Asia), Borrelia spielmanii (Europe), Borrelia yangtze (Asia), Borrelia californiensis, Borrelia americana, Borrelia carolinensis (North America), Borrelia bavariensis (Europe), and Borrelia kurtenbachii (North America). Of these 18 genomic species B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi and B. garinii are the <b>confirmed</b> <b>agents</b> of localized, disseminated and chronic manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, whereas B. spielmanii has been detected in early skin disease, and B. bissettii and B. valaisiana have been detected in specimens from single cases of Lyme borreliosis. The clinical role of B. lusitaniae remains to be substantiated...|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the dynamics}} of the potentially toxic and harmful species of Prorocentrum Ehrenberg in Bizerte lagoon (important aquaculture area, Northern Tunisia), substantiating the possible driving forces (temperature, salinity and nutrients), based on a two years database. We revealed that Prorocentrum spp. blooms of high magnitude (104 - 105 cells l- 1) occurred mostly during the period of late winter to early spring. We found five species of Prorocentrum, two of which, P. lima and P. cordatum, the most common during the field, are <b>confirmed</b> <b>agents</b> of Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning in various regions of the world ocean. Prorocentrum sp., P. micans, and P. gracile were however present only sporadically but with high cell abundances, exemplifying bloom densities. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that P. minimum and P. lima were much more abundant in eutrophied waters characterized here by high Chl a biomass, while P. gracile species occurred principally in warm waters. Furthermore, Prorocentrum sp. and P. micans seemed more likely to proliferate in saline waters with high concentrations of inorganic nutrients (nitrate, ammonia and phosphate). Our study calls attention to a possible intensification of DSP events in the Bizerte lagoon, given the propensity of Prorocentrum spp. to proliferate in a eutrophied system...|$|R
