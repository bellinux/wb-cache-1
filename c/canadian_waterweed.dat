50|$|Lake Parangi has {{freshwater}} mussels, eels, pondweed Potamogeton ochreatus and watermilfoil Myriophyllum triphyllum. Catfish {{have been}} introduced and water quality is deteriorating. <b>Canadian</b> <b>Waterweed</b> has invaded much of the lake.|$|E
50|$|Elodea canadensis (American or <b>Canadian</b> <b>waterweed</b> or pondweed) is a {{perennial}} aquatic plant, or submergent macrophyte, native {{to most of}} North America. It has been introduced widely to regions outside its native range and was first recorded from the British Isles in about 1836.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrocharitaceae is a {{flowering}} plant family including 16 known genera {{with a total}} of ca 135 known species (Christenhusz & Byng 2016 [...] ), that including a number of species of aquatic plant, for instance the tape-grasses, the well known <b>Canadian</b> <b>waterweed</b> and frogbit Hydrocharis morsus-ranae.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduced}} <b>Canadian</b> and Nuttall's <b>Waterweeds</b> are widespread {{throughout the}} levels (Myles p.211).|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} plant of {{the waters}} edge is reed canary grass running from the East round to the South and into the West side. Creeping bent, reed sweet grass and iris are abundant. Common water-crowfoot, chara species, <b>Canadian</b> <b>waterweed,</b> slender spike-rush, perfoliate pondweed and spiked water milfoil are the other main species present.|$|E
50|$|The {{aquatic flora}} {{composed}} of reed, common club-rush, flowering rush, yellow iris, greater water-parsnip, brooklime, bulbous rush, toad rush, eight-stamened waterwort, needle spike-rush, spring quillwort, amphibious bistort, pale persicaria, rigid hornwort, horned pondweed, perfoliate pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, grass-wrack pondweed, fennel pondweed, various-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed, fan-leaved water-goosefoot, whorled water-milfoil, alternate water-milfoil, spiked water-milfoil, <b>Canadian</b> <b>waterweed,</b> Nuttall's waterweed, and common duckweed. There are stoneworts such as Chara delicatula and Nitella flexilis.|$|E
50|$|The Usman Forest is {{representative}} of pine forests growing on sandy deposits along the left bank of the rivers Don and Voronezh. The tree species in the reserve are a combination of pine (32.3% of the total), broad-leaved (mostly oak) (29.3%), aspen (19.3%), birch (5.7%), and black alder (5.2%). There {{is a problem in}} the reserve with invasive species from the Americas - particularly the <b>Canadian</b> <b>waterweed,</b> the American maple, and the Saskatoon pigweed. The reserve has recorded over 200 species of plants considered medicinal by local cultures. Over 1,000 species of plants have been recorded in total, and 60 species of mammals.|$|E
50|$|The large pond is {{populated}} with spiked water-milfoil (Myriophylium spicatum), <b>Canadian</b> <b>waterweed</b> (Elodea canadensis), yellow-flowered fringed water-lily (Nymphoides peltata), and beds of bulrush (Typha latifolia), common reed (Phragmites australis), sea club-rush (Scirpus maritimus) and grey club-rush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani). The pond provides a habitat and {{breeding ground for}} a variety of waterfowl such as the mute swan, tufted duck, coot and dabchick. Other avians species nesting at the pond include gadwall, water rail, reed warbler, sedge warbler, reed bunting and other passerines. The three smaller ponds are more shallow - one sufficiently so to dry up in times of low rainfall. They host rushes (Juncaceae) and bulrush, water mint (Mentha aquatica), false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum), common fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), gipsywort (Lyccous europaeus), branched bur-reed (Sparganium erectum), common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palusrre), and water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica). Two species, parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii) and sea club-rush indicate brackish water.|$|E
50|$|Castle Semple and Barr Lochs are SSSIs and Kilbirnie Loch is a Scottish Wildlife Trust {{designated}} LSNC (Local Site for Nature Conservation) {{in terms}} of the Ayrshire Local Biodiversity Action Plan (ALBAP) and in partnership with North Ayrshire Council. High levels of invasive alien waterweed species, <b>Canadian</b> <b>waterweed</b> (Elodea canadensis) and Nuttall’s waterweed (Elodea nuttalli) if left unchecked, will continue to spread and overwhelm other native aquatic plants. The loch's southern end is dominated by large areas of mown grass with mature grown bushes and wood copses. The western shore for the first 0.75 km or so is composed of planted willow with some older deciduous trees; round the loch into the very north-east corner, pastures surround the loch. Along the western part, the ground slopes quite steeply down to the loch. The northern shore itself is level and there are areas of marshy ground. The eastern side of the loch is a narrow strip of reedbed and bogbean grows in sheltered area.|$|E
50|$|The Ameryka {{peninsula}} {{is located}} in between the two lakes Orzysz and Wierzbińskie, which is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Wierzbińskie Bay. From {{the western part of the}} lake there is a bridge which crosses a narrow gap. The width of the peninsula ranges from about 100 to 300 metres. In the narrowest parts of the peninsula, both of the lakes can be seen. On both sides of the lake there are overgrown patches of Alnus glutinosa. Some roots of the trees are visible due to waves eroding their soil, creating a separate characteristic to the part of the lake. Both of the lakes are eutrophic and have similar water-based plants. There is a large amount of swamp vegetation, including the following species found in the lake: bugleweed, bittersweet, water mint, yellow water-lily, and <b>Canadian</b> <b>waterweed.</b> In some parts the shore has sand and is easily accessible. There are also synanthrope plants in the lake: burdock, lion's tail, common nettle, cow parsley, tetterwort and common wormwood. To the southeastern part of the lake, the peninsula becomes more wider and the plants become luxuriant. There are different types of plants in that part than elsewhere: there are blueberries, blackberries and moss, and in the autumn mushrooms grow. In the forest there are visible trenches from World War II. Along the southern part of the shore of Wierzbińskie Lake, there is the stretched village Wierzbiny.|$|E
40|$|Climate {{data and}} {{distribution}} {{data for the}} <b>Canadian</b> <b>waterweed</b> Elodea canadensis Michx. from North America, whole Europe and Finland were used to investigate the ability of bioclimatic envelope models to predict the distribution range and recent northward range shift of the species in Europe. Four different main types of models were developed using the North American data, including either three 'baseline' climate variables (growing degrees days, temperature of the coldest month, water balance) or an extended set of seven climate variables, both averaged either over a 30 year time slice or a longer 90 year time slice. Ten different random selections of pseudo-absences were generated from the North American data, {{on the basis of}} which ten separate generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed for each main model type. All the 40 developed GAMs were applied first to North America and then transferred to whole Europe and Finland. All the models showed a statistically highly significant accuracy in the three study areas. Although the differences among the four main model types were only minor, the two extended model types showed on average statistically better performance than the two baseline models based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values, the amount of deviance explained by the models, resubstitution validation and four-fold cross-validation in North America. They also provided slightly more accurate predictions of climatically suitable area for Elodea canadensis in Finland both in 1961 – 1984 and 1985 – 2006. However, the projections from the individual extended models were more variable than projections from the baseline models. Thus model predictions based on a variety of predictor variables but only one selection of pseudoabsences may be subject to biases, and outputs from multiple models should be investigated to better account for uncertainties in modelling. Overall, our results suggest that more attention should be paid to the careful selection of predictor variables and the use of multiple pseudo-absence sets in the ecological niche modelling in order to increase the reliability of the projections of the range shifts of invasive species...|$|E
