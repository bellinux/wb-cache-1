Michael Janigan of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre stated:The concern associated with the practice of negative option billing has its origins {{in the nature of}} a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> and sale, as recognized in common law. As every first year law student learns, such a contract consists of an offer and an acceptance. The history of consumer protection statutes is a chronicle of legislators attempting to ensure that the offer is conveyed without misrepresentation by the vendor to a purchaser who has an opportunity to make an informed choice to accept or refuse the offer. This is because a contract that is made with a consumer who is unaware of key elements of the contract such as price, quantity and quality of the goods to be delivered is subversive of the efficiency of the market as a whole.|$|E

It deals with advantages and disadvantages of their using, their main principles, relations between participants in documentary transactions and with a description of the whole process of operations with these documentary instruments. Further there are captured individual kinds of documentary letter of credits and documentary collections in the thesis.

40|$|Limitation period {{plays an}} {{important}} part in civil action. Failure to comply with the limitation period would mean that the action instituted could diminish. The limitation period for all actions founded on contract pursuant to section 6 of the Limitation Act 1953 is 6 years. However based on the decided cases, the limitation period for action of specific performance <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> sale and <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> land is 12 years, not 6. This is because all actions for specific performance <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> sale and <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> land were held in the decided cases to be actions 'to recover land'. Pursuant to section 9 of the Limitation Act 1953 limitation period for all actions for the recovery of land, is 12 years. However, in the author's view, the limitation period of action for specific performance <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> sale and <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> land should, be 6 years instead of 12 years because it is an action founded on contract. This article examines the decided cases which rule that the limitation period must be 12 years and elaborates the grounds to support the contention of the author in this respect. The second part of this article will highlight the importance of defence of limitation, and instead be successfully if the parties plead this defence in their pleading pursuant to section 4 of the Limitation Act 1953. However, this requirement has not been consistently followed by courts. It is in the author's view that the failure of the parties to plead this defence expressly could affect his defence of limitation. This article will attempt to unveil the grounds and policies of the courts concerning the above issues...|$|R

The thesis is composed of six chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of regulation of liability for defective goods. Chapter one presents a view of the legal theory on liability for defective goods and informs about elementary aspects of historical development of legislation. Chapter two defines the concept of defects according to relevant Czech legislation. The chapter consists of three parts. Part one describes quantity defect, quality defect, cover defect, documents defect and delivery of different goods. Part two describes legal defects. Part three describes apparent defects and hidden defects. Chapter three focuses on legal [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Byzantine, Graeco-Roman, law is {{the organic}} {{continuation}} of Roman law. However, the legal system itself, and many legal institutions in it, had gone through certain evolution. In this article, by researching Greek acts conserved in various monastic arhives, and confronting them with stipulations in the Byzantine law codes, we question the issues of consensuality of a contract, form of a legal deed, and acquisation of a real right in Byzantine private law. The nature of contracts in Byzantine law has not been sufficiently studied. Richful theoretical studies had been written {{in regards to the}} <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> in Roman and Justinians law, however various and sometimes confronting information from the later Greek codes did not give definite answers to this question. Byzantine codices on this theme encompass already familiar stipulations and legal institutes. The attention of the lawgiver was on the notary system, on the mechanism which produced a written instrument. We believe that the issue of the παράδοσις δι̉ ἐγγράφου was not sufficiently highlighted in the field of Byzantine studies mostly {{due to the lack of}} information in the sources. However, when regarding the Athonite documents, it can be seen that the formulae describing the act of law transfer could be concidered as a relevant material to comment on this legal institute...|$|E

40|$|The <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> {{commercial}} distribution are indispensable {{legal instruments}} {{to the development}} of the economic activity. The distribution, since the industrial revolution, acquired autonomy, given the necessity of specialized intermediation to distribute good and products. In this process, the structural organization of the distribution process suffered mutations, starting to assume a set of activities aiming at adjusting demand to supply, including, among others, clients canvassing, after-sales services, financing and assumption of risks, advisory services, promotion and advertising. The insufficiency <b>of</b> traditional <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> and sales and commission to satisfy the distributive needs caused by the industrial revolution will justify the development of new contractual schemes, such us agency contract, commercial concession and franchising. The obligation of the distributer to ensure the interests of the producer and to promote the distribution of the goods and services of the producer, in the context of a lasting relation of cooperation between the parts, through which the distributer is incorporated, with greater or minor intensity, in the producer distribution network, allowed us to sustain, as affirmed in the Portuguese and European literature, that distribution contracts could be framed in the same legal category. These contracts, as contracts that were shaped by praxis, do not have, with exception <b>of</b> agency <b>contract,</b> a legal framework in Portugal and Spain. It has been discussed in literature if agency contract legal framework can be applied, by analogy, to the contracts that fit in the legal category <b>of</b> distribution <b>contracts.</b> This paper aims at analyzing the legal framework <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> distribution in these legal systems, with the purpose to discuss the analogical application <b>of</b> the agency <b>contract</b> to these contracts. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{contract}} to lease an enterprise A {{contract to}} lease an enterprise (Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., the Commercial Code) {{was replaced by}} an agreement of usufructuary lease of an establishment with effect from 1. January 2014, when the New Civil Code came into force. Due to a new legislation, thesis in some chapters mentions comparison between present and former legal regulations, especially represented by Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., the Commercial Code. Some chapters explain concept of usufructuary lease of an establishment from the historical point of view. The thesis deals with Czech legal regulation of the agreement of usufructuary lease of an establishment. It is an agreement regulated by Section 2349 atc. Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the New Civil Code. Usufructuary lease of an establishment is a contractual type related to <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> of an establishment.

40|$|Liability for {{defects in}} {{business}} contracts The topic of my diploma thesis is liability for defects in business contracts, i. e. agreements that are even today being closed under the Czech Commercial Code, as amended. The liability for defects {{arising from the}} <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> (or other types of contracts if needed) is {{a significant part of}} liability relationships, which may come into existence from obligations. Considering the upcoming recodification of private law, the focus of the thesis is the comparison of current and future legislation of the matter (Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., the Commercial Code and Act. no 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code being the current and future major regulations). The aim of the thesis is to identify the major modifications that are about to come into practise {{and at the same time}} to evaluate how these changes are going to influence the position of either party to a contract. I decided to systematize the comparison according to different aspects of the topic and I used the same system structuring the chapters. After the introduction and a brief historical summary I first presented the general characteristics of the liability for defects. In following chapters, these particular aspects have been examined: the definition of wrongful performance, the kinds of defects, the [...] ...|$|E
