60|$|Mr. Grimes {{was to come}} up {{next morning}} to Sir John Harthover's, at the Place, for his old chimney-sweep was gone to prison, and the <b>chimneys</b> wanted <b>sweeping.</b> And so he rode away, not giving Tom time to ask what the sweep had gone to prison for, which {{was a matter of}} {{interest}} to Tom, as he had been in prison once or twice himself. Moreover, the groom looked so very neat and clean, with his drab gaiters, drab breeches, drab jacket, snow-white tie with a smart pin in it, and clean round ruddy face, that Tom was offended and disgusted at his appearance, and considered him a stuck-up fellow, who gave himself airs because he wore smart clothes, and other people paid for them; and went behind the wall to fetch the half- brick after all; but did not, remembering that he had come in the way of business, and was, as it were, under a flag of truce.|$|R

Here a sweep describes the fate of one boy:After passing through the chimney and descending to the second angle of the fireplace the Boy finds it completely filled with soot, which he has dislodged from the sides of the upright part. He endeavours to get through, and succeeds in doing so, after much struggling as far as his shoulders; but finding that the soot is compressed hard all around him, by his exertions, that he can recede no farther; he then endeavours to move forward, but his attempts in this respect are quite abortive; for the covering of the horizontal part of the Flue being stone, the sharp angle of which bears hard on his shoulders, and the back part of his head prevents him from moving in the least either one way or the other. His face, already covered with a climbing cap, and being pressed hard in the soot beneath him, stops his breath. In this dreadful condition he strives violently to extricate himself, but his strength fails him; he cries and groans, and in a few minutes he is suffocated. An alarm is then given, a brick-layer is sent for, an aperture is perforated in the Flue, and the boy is extracted, but found lifeless. In a short time an inquest is held, and a Coroner's Jury returns a verdict of 'Accidental Death.' [...] " ...|$|R

Why should poor we be liable to suffer hardship for our Country or otherwise, your Majesty! Can no one else be got to do it? sang out the thousand children.

In school term time the daily limit of employment for children is three hours, in holiday time three hours. As regards factories Germany, unlike Great Britain, France and Switzerland, requires a shorter day for young persons than for women - io hours for the former, t t hours for the latter. Women over 16 years may be employed i 1 hours. Night work is forbidden, i.e. work between 8.30 P.M. and 5.30 A.M. Overtime may be granted to meet unforeseen pressure or for work on perishable articles, under conditions, by local authorities and the higher administrative authorities. Prescribed meal-times are - an unbroken half-hour for children in their 6 hours; for young persons a midday pause of one hour, and half an hour respectively in the morning and afternoon spells; for women, an hour at midday, but women with the care of a household have the claim, on demand, to an extra halfhour, as in Switzerland. No woman may be employed within four weeks after childbirth, and unless a medical certificate can then be produced, the absence must extend to six weeks. Notice of working periods and meal-times must be affixed, and copies sent to the local authorities.

40|$|Objectives: To explore <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeping</b> work tasks, chimney sweeps’ use of {{protective}} equipment, {{and type of}} fuel used by clients, over time. Further, to assess work-relatedness of current eye and airway symptoms. Methods: In a cross-sectional study in 2011, male Swedish chimney sweeps (n = 483; age 21 – 69 years) answered a questionnaire about their occupational history and eye and airway symptoms. Results: Between 1960 and 2010, black-soot-sweeping in private homes was the major task, although it decreased during the time period, for chimney sweeps. Between 1975 and 2010, the use of petroleum oil decreased, whereas the use of pellets and wood increased. Also, the use of gloves and masks increased significantly. Black-soot-sweeping in industry was associated with work-related eye symptoms (prevalence odds ratio POR = 3. 76, 95 % CI: 1. 72 – 8. 24, for every 10 % increment of working time, adjusted for age and tobacco smoking). Chimney sweeps also had slightly higher prevalence of cough with increasing black-soot-sweeping (POR = 1. 06, 95 % CI: 0. 99 – 1. 13 for every 10 % increment, further adjusted {{for the use of}} mask), and the association was more pronounced, although nonsignificant, for black-soot-sweeping in industry (adjusted POR = 1. 26, 95 % CI: 0. 98 – 1. 61). Conclusions: <b>Chimney</b> <b>sweeping</b> tasks and use {{of protective}} equipment as well as type of fuel used by the clients changed significantly over the last 35 years, which may have changed chimney sweeps’ exposure to soot. Still, chimney sweeps in Sweden have black-soot-sweeping-related eye and airway symptoms...|$|E
40|$|This work {{endeavours}} to map {{the development}} and actual level of chimney and flue cleaning in the Czech Republic including the appraisal of statutory instruments {{during the period from}} 1751 to 2015. The aim is to compare the techniques and methods of chimney cleaning used in the past {{as well as in the}} present and their effect on health and enviromental protection and safety. The work is divided into two parts. The theoretical one introduces historical changes of rules defining cleaning of chimneys and combustion tracks in Czech lands in the past. The present technologies are being described as well as conditions of fire safety for functioning of chimneys and flues. This part is also following up checking and revisions of combustion tracks, measuring efficiency of combustion, burning of chimneys, frequency of checking and cleaning of chimneys etc. The following sections pay attention to documents dealing with classification of types of chimneys, technical and safety standards for safe working of combustion tracks and the impact of techniques of cleaning on health and enviromental protection and safety. In the second part of this work the results extracted from the questionnaire survey are presented. The results are devided into three chapters according to the three main areas the survey was focused on. The first chapter compares statutory instruments, prevention, checking and methods of chimney clearing and their effect on health, safety and environment. The second chapter pays attention to the same topics but in present days. In the last chapter the research is based on statistic numbers of fires in the particular periods. For the research the methods of analysis and appraisal of technical books, legal standards and information from internet sources were used. The qualitative research was evaluated by methods of comparison and analysis. By the means of analysis and appraisal of information from relevant literature the methods of cleaning of chimneys in particular periods of existence of <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeping</b> profession were compared. The main research was based on the evaluation of the answers to eleven questions concerning the issues of cleaning chimneys and the impact on health and enviromental protection and safety. The questions were presented to chimney sweepers in the form of an electronic questionnaire which was sent to two hundred persons from the whole area of the Czech Republic by e-mail. From the mentioned number 26 respondents sent their answers back. The results of the questionnaire survey were evaluated by the method of comparison individual opinions of the respondents were compared and after that the summary answers about various aspects related to <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeping</b> profession were made. The aim of this work was to compare the development of methods of chimney cleaning during various periods of existence of <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeping</b> profession and also to appraise the situation in the present days, including statutory instruments. The results of the research should have answered two main questions the first one should have assessed the effect of methods of chimney cleaning used in the present on health and enviromental protection and safety in comparison with the methods used in the past. The answer to the second one should have appraised legislation which deals with issues of chimney cleaning from the point of its comprehensiveness. The research shows that the techniques and methods of cleaning chimneys and flues used in the present guarantee better and higher health and enviromental protection and safety than the methods used in the past. However it is necessary to mention the fact that the number of fires which arise because of the chimney activity is still relatively high. According to the legislation the results show that the actual laws and regulations are sufficient, however in some aspects, especially in education system and professional preparation of chimney sweepers, we can find substantial defects...|$|E
40|$|Sweden {{recently}} {{changed the}} national regulation of <b>chimney</b> <b>sweeping.</b> This study has two purposes. The first {{purpose is to}} evaluate {{the effect of this}} reform to see if the new regulation has led to an effect in terms of increased chimney fires in single-family houses and for the wood-burning and oil-burning stoves, respectively. The second purpose is an updating of a previous study (Mattsson 1994) of analysis of society´s benefits and costs of different alternative sweeping frequencies for wood-burning and oil-burning stoves. This study also has a secondary purpose to examine {{the extent to which the}} local sweeping rules vary with climate conditions.   Mattsson, based on his results, proposed that the sweeping requirements for oil-burning stoves should be reduced from twice a year to once every second year and for wood-burning stoves the sweeping should be reduced from four times to once each year. Recommendation for oil- burning stoves was implemented in the new regulation from 2003. The results from the statistical analysis show that the differences between the various municipalities sweeping frequencies cannot be explained by differences in climate conditions, i. e. municipalities don´t have perfectly adapted the sweeping frequencies with temperature. The results even show that the reform of year 2003 has led to fewer chimney fires.   Results from the cost-benefit analysis show that for oil-burning stoves, a cut from a sweeping every two years to a sweeping every three years is socially efficient if the value of the environmental factor is below 60 kronor per stove and year. For wood- burning stoves, a cut from 3 - 5 times to once each year would be efficient if the value of the environmental factor is below 1290 kronor per stove and year...|$|E
