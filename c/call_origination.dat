50|$|In the U.S., {{the process}} by which a {{mortgage}} is secured by a borrower is <b>called</b> <b>origination.</b> This involves the borrower submitting a loan application and documentation related to his/her financial history and/or credit history to the underwriter, which is typically a bank.

The bandwidth allocation is distributed to each origination node, which in turn then calculates routes for the individual calls.

40|$|Abstract—Mass-calling {{events can}} cause {{significant}} congestion {{in the phone}} network due to the high volume of redial attempts. This letter presents dynamic algorithms which randomly block some <b>calls</b> at their <b>origination</b> points, thus reducing traffic in the network. The algorithms respond to changing congestion levels by observing whether or not previous calls have been answered. The algorithms reduce call attempts by 50 % during periods of 80 % blocking, with little disruption in blocking levels to the dialing customers (blocking increases by less than 1 %). We also derive an improved blocking heuristic which is more effective under periods of heavier congestion. Index Terms—Communication systems, information rates, traffic control (communication).

N ext-generation telecommunications networks will provide global information access for users with mobility, which is anticipated to be achieved through integration of the Internet and third-generation (3 G) wireless communication. The Internet provides ubiquitous connectivity for data communications, and it has become the most important vehicle for global information delivery.

Furthermore, the recent introduction of 3 G mobile systems has driven the Internet into new markets that support mobile users.

The outgoing register detects backward MF tones arriving from the incoming register. The incoming register detects forward MF tones arriving from the outgoing register. The outgoing register transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the outgoing register merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the incoming register. (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the outgoing register's first push signal to the incoming register is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the incoming register's pull signals, which request information from the outgoing register, are client-server, where the client is the incoming register and the server is the outgoing register.) ...|$|R

The entire simulation duration is divided into short time intervals of equal duration, t: During t; a batch processing of <b>call</b> <b>origination</b> or termination events is executed and the time-points of these events are sorted. The number of sorting executions is drastically reduced compared to a call-by-call simulator, resulting in considerable timesaving. The proposed data structures of the simulator can be implemented by a general-purpose programming language and are well fitted to parallel processing techniques for implementation on parallel computers, for further savings of execution time. We have first implemented the simulator in a sequential computer and then we have applied parallelization techniques to achieve its implementation on a parallel computer. In order to simplify the parallelization procedure, we dissociate the core simulation from the built-in call-level functions (e. g. bandwidth control or dynamic routing) of the network. The key point for a parallel implementation is to organize data by virtual paths (VPs) and distribute them among processors, which all execute the same set of instructions on this data.
