5|$|Where the two chough species occur together, {{there is}} only limited {{competition}} for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate <b>cranefly</b> pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added <b>cranefly</b> pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Where their ranges overlap, the two chough {{species may}} feed {{together}} in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate <b>cranefly</b> pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added <b>cranefly</b> pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in Juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region {{and at the same}} time of year, which dig for food in the soil of the villages' terraced pastures.|$|E

25|$|An urban legend {{claims that}} the {{harvestman}} is the most venomous animal in the world, but possesses fangs too short or a mouth too round and small to bite a human, so is not dangerous (the same myth applies to Pholcus phalangioides and the <b>cranefly,</b> which are both also called a 'daddy longlegs'). This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen has venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and {{not strong enough to}} break human skin.|$|E
