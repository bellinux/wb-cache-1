5|$|In June 1963, Kenyatta {{met with}} the Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi. The trio {{discussed}} the possibility of merging their three nations into a single East African Federation, agreeing {{that this would be}} accomplished {{by the end of the}} year. Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> federation had not come to pass. In May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this was true.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} flank, {{north of the}} road, the North Koreans overran the {{battalion}} observation post and B Company's outpost line. This high ground changed hands three times during the day. While the infantry fight was in progress, and shortly after the first tank penetration, five more T-34s <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> road bend toward the US 71st Tank Battalion. Check had called for an air strike when the first tanks appeared. Three F-80 Shooting Stars arrived and immediately dived on the approaching group of tanks, destroying three of them with 5-inch rockets. Altogether, bazooka, artillery, and air strikes knocked out six North Korean tanks during the morning, either within or {{on the edge of}} the 1st Battalion position. In its first engagement with American troops, the NK 2nd Division lost all but two of the eight tanks that had been attached to it a few days earlier at Chongju.|$|E
5|$|As {{operations}} continued {{throughout the}} month, casualties amongst the Australian Corps became critical {{and the decision}} was made to disband some of the 3rd Division's battalions and use them to reinforce the remaining units. This decision saw the reduction of the strength of division's infantry brigades from four battalions to three, bringing the Australians into line with the British, who had made a similar decision earlier in the war. Nevertheless, the decision was not popular amongst the soldiers and when the 42nd Battalion received the order to disband, the attempt was rejected by its personnel and the order disobeyed. As a result, the proposed reorganisation was postponed until after the division's final offensive actions were fought in early October 1918. These <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> St Quentin Canal when the division attacked the Beaurevoir Line in concert with American troops from the US 27th Division, who would lead the assault in. The attack went awry, however, when the lead assault units failed to adequately clear the forward positions and subsequently when the 3rd Division was committed they came under fire almost immediately and instead of passing through the American positions, they had to complete the mopping up process before they could advance. Nevertheless, by nightfall on 1 October, the division had captured the northern end of the tunnel that ran under the canal.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} Owen's {{tactical}} mind {{was seen in}} one of his early international matches against England in 1902. Wales were behind in the game with little time remaining when Owen tricked his opposite number, Bernard Oughtred, into an off-side tackle near the English posts. With the Welsh in charge of the scrum on the English '25', Owen told his forwards, in Welsh, to keep hold of the ball, while Owen bent down and pretended to collect it. Oughtred <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> scrum to tackle Owen and finding the Welshman empty handed was penalised for being off-side. John Strand-Jones kicked the penalty, allowing Wales to win 9-8.|$|E
25|$|Japan was {{a closed}} country {{for more than}} two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since {{military}} rulers from the Tokugawa family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society. The only exceptions were Chinese and some Dutch, but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese citizens. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad.

25|$|After {{blunting}} the German offensive, in August the Allies {{launched the}} Hundred Days Offensive, which ultimately ended the war, around Amiens. After joining {{the attack on}} 8 August, the 34th participated in the series of advances that followed. Its final action <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> St Quentin Canal in late September. The involvement of the Australian Corps in the earlier actions in 1918 had significantly depleted its battalions which had suffered heavy casualties {{that they had been}} unable to replace as the number of volunteers arriving from Australia had fallen. As a result, upon Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes' request, it was subsequently withdrawn from the line for reorganisation and rest in October. It remained out of the line until the armistice came into effect in November. With the end of hostilities, the Australian units began to demobilise and their personnel were slowly repatriated back to Australia. As its numbers dwindled, the 34th Battalion was disbanded in May 1919.|$|E
25|$|For 14 days in 1901, Rusk {{assisted}} Harry Fielding Reid in mapping Mount Adams. Before they began, they ascended Adams {{with two}} others, Nelson B. Brooks and Dr. H. S. Goddard, and then circled the mountain with Rusk leading. As they <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mountain, Rusk suggested names for {{several of the}} glaciers. He wanted to name Adams Glacier as Reid Glacier in honor of Reid; however, Reid insisted {{that it should be}} named something else because he thought it improper to place his own name on the map that he was making and the Mazamas were trying to name a glacier on Mount Hood after him. This eventually persuaded Rusk, but years later when he wrote Tales, Rusk repeated his wish that the glacier be known as Reid Glacier. Rusk also recommended that the Lyman Glacier be named as such in honor of William Denison Lyman, who had done some to the first research into Adams. Reid officially named Rusk Glacier after him.|$|E
25|$|As {{the safety}} car was exiting turn 11, an {{approaching}} Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 drastically reduced its speed {{in response to}} the unusually slow safety car. However, a BMW a few seconds behind <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> blind turn at speed, colliding with the Gallardo and safety car. The collision destroyed the Gallardo and sent the BMW into a number of rolls. The safety car was sent off the track into the Armco at great speed. In the chaos, a Marcos LM600 coming around turn 11 locked up its brakes and spun into the wet grass {{on the inside of the}} track. Sliding back onto the track, it was hit from the side by a BMW Z3. Furthermore, two E46 BMW M3 GTRs were damaged: one on the outside line hit the rear of the Marcos, and the other, on the inside line, slightly damaged its front right. The second M3 continued around the track, while the first slid into the grass before turn 12. The race was stopped, and there were no serious injuries to any of the drivers.|$|E

25|$|Maj. Gen. William B. Bate's {{division}} had a {{long distance}} to march to reach its assigned objective on the Union right and when he gave the final order to attack it was almost dark. First contact with the enemy <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Everbright Mansion, the home of Rebecca Bostick, and the Confederates pushed aside Union sharpshooters and swept past the house. However, Bate's left flank was not being protected as he expected by Chalmers's cavalry division, and they received enfilade fire. To protect the flank, Bate ordered the Florida Brigade, temporarily commanded by Col. Robert Bullock, to move from its reserve position to his left flank. This not only delayed the advance, but provided only a single line to attack the Union fortifications, leaving no reserve. Chalmers's troopers had actually engaged the Federal right by this time (the brigades of Col. Isaac M. Kirby and Brig. Gen. Walter C. Whitaker of Kimball's division), fighting dismounted, but Bate was unaware of it because the two forces were separated by rolling ground and orchards. Neither Bate nor Chalmers made any progress and they withdrew.|$|E
25|$|In March 1918, the Germans {{launched}} the Spring Offensive, {{after the collapse}} of Tsarist Russia ended the fighting on the Eastern Front and allowed the Germans to transfer a large number of troops to the west. The offensive steadily pushed the Allies back towards Paris, and as a result the Australian divisions were brought south from Belgium to the Somme to help restore the situation. In late March, the battalion took part in a defensive action around Dernancourt. After the offensive had been halted, in August the Allies {{launched the}} Hundred Days Offensive, which ultimately brought about an end to the war. The 38th Battalion was placed in reserve during {{the first day of the}} offensive around Amiens on 8 August, and therefore fought their first major action of the offensive around Proyart on 10 August. A series of advances followed as the Allies sought to break through the Hindenburg Line, with the 3rd Division advancing through the Somme Valley. In October 1918, the Australian divisions were withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation, and as a consequence the 38th Battalion's final involvement in the war <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> St Quentin Canal, where the heavily depleted Australian divisions were bolstered by fresh American divisions. After the cessation of hostilities in November, the AIF was demobilised and the 38th Battalion was disbanded in April 1919. During the war, the 38th Battalion's casualties amounted to 499 killed and 1,478 wounded. The battalion received 14 battle honours for its involvement in the fighting on the Western Front in 1927.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} {{in the third round}} and their cup run started with an away tie against Carlisle United. Although the home side created numerous chances in the opening minutes and looked likeliest to score, Arsenal took the lead in the 22nd minute through Sylvain Wiltord. Poor finishing from both teams thereafter meant Arsenal progressed by a slender scoreline. [...] In the fourth round, Arsenal faced Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. The visitors' first goal <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> half-hour mark; defender Ashley Cole cleared Peter Crouch's goal-bound header and from that Arsenal launched a counterattack. Lee Dixon's cross inadvertently met Chris Plummer who scored an own goal. Wiltord extended Arsenal's lead a minute later, and QPR conceded another own goal early in the second half which sealed the tie in the visitors' favour. Arsenal finished as comfortable 6–0 winners, representing the club's best away win in the FA Cup for 64 years.|$|E

[...] were joined by Gilbert's [...] squad {{in order to reduce}} the lead advantage; it was cut to around a minute with [...] to go, and the break was eventually caught inside of [...] remaining. The field remained together onto the Côte de Seraing, but halfway up the climb, Cancellara attacked and only Peter Sagan (...) could hold pace with him. 's Edvald Boasson Hagen later bridged up to the duo, and it was left to the three riders to fight it out for the stage win, with the reduced peloton chasing behind. Cancellara attacked first, but Sagan <b>came</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outside and freewheeled to his fourteenth victory of 2012, ahead of Cancellara – who maintained his overall lead – and Boasson Hagen. Gilbert led home the peloton in fourth, as 22-year-old Sagan became the youngest rider to win a Tour stage since Lance Armstrong in 1993.|$|E
