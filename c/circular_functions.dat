25|$|In mathematics, the {{trigonometric}} functions (also called <b>circular</b> <b>functions,</b> angle functions or goniometric functions) are functions of an angle. They relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides.

The success of such a model {{is largely due to}} the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of <b>circular</b> <b>functions</b> (the Fourier modes). Other Greek scientists, such as the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus, postulated (according to Stobaeus account) that {{at the center of the}} Universe was a [...] "central fire" [...] around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion.|$|E

40|$|This book {{focuses on}} the {{ellipsoidal}} function, which serves as an evolution and extension of the <b>circular</b> <b>function</b> (trigonometric function) and elliptic function. It presents an in-depth discussion of the ellipsoidal function (algebra) theory and the conformal mapping (geometry) theory of the ellipsoid function, demonstrating the outstanding performance of the ellipsoid function response filter. Applications of the ellipsoidal function include the capacitance of ellipsoidal conductors and the surface area of ellipsoids, which in turn correspond to ellipsoidal integrals of the first kind and the second kind, respectively. The book offers a valuable reference guide for undergraduates, graduate students and researchers in the related fields. ...|$|R
2500|$|In [...] {{mathematics}} and physical science, spherical harmonics are special functions defined {{on the surface}} of a sphere. They are often employed in solving partial differential equations that commonly occur in science. The spherical harmonics are a complete set of orthogonal functions on the sphere, and thus may be used to represent functions defined {{on the surface of}} a sphere, just as <b>circular</b> <b>functions</b> (sines and cosines) are used to represent functions on a circle via Fourier series. Like the sines and cosines in Fourier series, the spherical harmonics may be organized by (spatial) angular frequency, as seen in the rows of functions in the illustration on the right. Further, spherical harmonics are basis functions for SO(3), the group of rotations in three dimensions, and thus {{play a central role in}} the group theoretic discussion of SO(3).|$|E

25|$|A {{hyperbolic}} {{angle is}} an argument of a hyperbolic function just as the circular angle is the argument of a <b>circular</b> <b>function.</b> The comparison can be visualized as {{the size of the}} openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the <b>circular</b> and hyperbolic <b>functions</b> are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument, the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by Leonhard Euler in Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite.|$|R
