40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityA three-dimensional finite element model was used to predict the strength and location of failure of nine wood transmission poles. The poles were made from three commonlyused species (western redcedar, Douglas-fir and southern pine) in North America. All poles were tested to failure as a cantilever beam with a concentrated load applied to the tip. The methodology involved was to select several eighteen inches long segments, located along the poles, which contained the most severe defects such as <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>knots,</b> spiral grain, including material inhomogeneity in the highly stressed region. Each segment was analyzed using the finite element technique with appropriate boundary conditions. Material properties for each segment were determined by measuring clear-wood elastic and strength parameters in boles taken from broken poles. The information about knots and spiral grain, obtained by visual inspection of the pole surface, was used to identify the worst knot clusters and grain deviation in any segment. Knots were modeled in the finite element mesh and the localized grain deviation around the knots were determined {{through the use of}} the flow-grain analogy model. Finite element computer analysis were performed through the use of the program GTSTRUDL. The model resulted in a total of 288 three-dimensional, isoparametric, linear strain, 20 -node parallelepiped and 15 -node wedge shaped elements. For the nine poles studied, the results showed good agreement between predicted and experimental strength. The predicted values for strength differed from the actual ones with an average deviation of 7 % (below the actual). Concerning failure location, in six of the poles, failure was verified in the same places as those predicted by the model. In the three other cases the failure with the maximum error of three feet, except for one pole where the deviation was twelve feet. The study revealed that the three-dimensional finite element approach to model growth characteristics applied to the more critical segments along the pole length proved to be very useful tool for strength and failure location prediction of poles...|$|E

40|$|Ejecta knot flickering, {{ablation}} tails, and fragmentation {{are expected}} signatures {{associated with the}} gradual dissolution of high-velocity supernova (SN) ejecta caused by their passage through an inhomogeneous circumstellar medium or interstellar medium (ISM). Such phenomena mark {{the initial stages of}} the gradual merger of SN ejecta with and the enrichment of the surrounding ISM. Here we report on an investigation of this process through changes in the optical flux and morphology of several high-velocity ejecta knots located in the outskirts of the young core-collapse SN remnant Cassiopeia A using Hubble Space Telescope images. Examination of WFPC 2 F 675 W and combined ACS F 625 W + F 775 W images taken between 1999 June and 2004 December of several dozen debris fragments in the remnant's northeast ejecta stream and along the remnant's eastern limb reveal substantial emission variations ("flickering") over timescales as short as nine months. Such widespread and rapid variability indicates knot scale lengths similar or equal to 10 (15) cm and a highly inhomogeneous surrounding medium. We also identify a small percentage <b>of</b> ejecta <b>knots</b> located all around the remnant's outer periphery which show trailing emissions typically 0 ''. 2 - 0 ''. 7 in length aligned along the <b>knot's</b> direction <b>of</b> motion suggestive <b>of</b> <b>knot</b> ablation tails.

The metal abundances are approximately solar, with individual knot abundances ranging from log (O/H) þ 12 8 : 1 0 : 5 to 8 : 9 0 : 4. The H luminosities of the 14 observed knots yield a total star formation rate (SFR) of 46 M yr 1. The sizes of the H ii regions associated with the knots were determined from L(H) and range from 28 to 119 pc when a filling factor of 0. 1 is assumed. The sizes are a factor of 2. 15 smaller for a filling factor of 1. Using Starburst 99, the EW(H + [N ii]), and EW(H), we estimate the ages of the star-forming regions to be 5. 5 – 10. 5 Myr.
