The sample’s absorption properties were obtained from the analysis of the optical parameters changes (refraction index and absorption coefficient, and a thickness of near-surface region, too). The latest were studied by the method of multiangular monochromatic ellipsometry in test camera in ethyl alcohol, ammonia and acetone environment. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to analyze the surface morphology. Protons and alpha particles were found to lead to the Si near-surface layer destruction of and an enhancement of the surface roughness. The proton irradiated samples revealed a higher sensitivity to the absorption of ammonia and acetone molecules. Plasma treated Si displays surface modification (loosening of near-surface layer), though, gas absorption is not clearly revealed. Optical properties of Si/SiO 2 structures depend on the dimensions and the depths of nanopores, created by the etching of latent tracks in dioxide after irradiation. The greatest optical constant changes occurred in irradiated with 209 Ві structures, where tracks penetrated the whole dioxide. Accordingly bismuth-irradiated structures have the best gas sensitivity. Ultrasound influences on the optical parameters of porous Si/SiO 2 structure (loosening of the near-surface layer).

High surface energy liquids may not only be unable to wet low energetic surfaces, but can also cause nonwetting of small structures or pattern collapse. The improvement of the wetting behavior of a cleaning liquid by lowering its surface energy by the addition of surfactants is the strategy followed in this study. We show that with choosing the appropriate rinsing solution a wet chemical process using surfactant aided cleaning solutions compatible to the materials used in BEOL (porous low-k, copper, barriers) can be found. The results show a distinct improvement of the wetting behavior of the modified solutions on several low energetic solid surfaces like copper or polymers deposited during dry etching...|$|E

Its new ThinGaN technology, based on Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) will promote applications such as use of LEDs in vehicle headlights. Series production is due to start in 2004. Standard substrate material for blue LEDs based on InGaN is SiC, with a typical substrate thickness of 250 mm. Chemically and mechanically stable, this cannot be removed without a wet chemical or dry <b>chemical</b> <b>plasma</b> process without destroying the InGaN epitaxial layer.

40|$|Reactive ion etch {{processes}} for modern interlevel dielectrics {{become more and}} more complex, especially for further scaling of interconnect dimensions. The materials will be damaged within such processes with the result of an increase in their dielectric constants. The capability of selected additives to minimize the low-k sidewall damage during reactive ion etching (RIE) of SiCOH materials in fluorocarbon plasmas was shown in different works in the past. Most of the investigated additive gases alter the fluorine to carbon ratio as well as the dissociation of the parent gas inside the etch plasma. The result is a changed etch rate, a modified polymerization behavior and other characteristics of the process induced SiCOH damage. Heavy inert ions like argon will be accelerated to the sample surface in the cathode dark space and enhance therewith the sputter yield on the SiCOH network [1]. In this paper the additives Ar, O- 2, C 4 F 8, H- 2, N- 2 and CO were added to a conventional CF 4 etch plasma. We try to provoke different changes in the plasma conditions and therewith in the process results. Contact angle measurements, spectroscopic ellipsometry, Hg-probe analysis, FTIR measurements and SEM cross-sections were used to overview the additive induced modifications. To understand the influences of the additives gases more exactly, changes in the physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>plasma</b> behavior must be analyzed.

40|$|Porous ultra low {{constant}} materials (ULK) for isolation {{within the}} interconnect system of integrated circuits are a promising approach to reduce crosstalk and RC-delays due to shrinking feature sizes [1]. Due to their porosity and {{the integration of}} carbon rich species like methyl groups into the Si-O-Si backbone of currently fabricated PECVD SiCOH dielectrics those materials are highly sensible towards plasma processing, e. g. dry etching or resist stripping [2]. Metal hard mask approaches, e. g. using TiN hard masks are widely used to prevent the resist stripping plasma directly attacking the low-k material [3]. To reduce further plasma damage like carbon depletion and formation of polar silanol groups the development of less aggressive etching processes is in the focus {{of research and development}} activities. Nevertheless dry etching will attack the sidewalls and cause a material degradation. That is why repair processes, mainly based on silylation, are considered to follow the patterning step to reintegrate carbon rich species and to recover the dielectric’s properties [3]. Subsequently to dry etching and repairing the dielectric the wet <b>chemical</b> <b>plasma</b> etch residue removal process is performed. Besides material compatibility and effectiveness in residue removal the wetting behavior of the applied cleaning solutions towards the surface which has to be cleaned is crucial, especially looking on wetting issues like the incomplete wetting of very small via holes or pattern collapse. In this study we investigate in which way different silylation based repair processing regimes are affecting the wettability of the dielectric by water based cleaning solutions using contact angle based surface energy calculations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceExperimental {{data about}} {{branching}} ratios for {{the products of}} dissociative recombination of polyatomic ions are presently the unique information source available to modelers of natural or laboratory <b>chemical</b> <b>plasmas.</b> Yet, because of limitations in the measurement techniques, data for many ions are incomplete. In particular, the repartition of hydrogen atoms among the fragments of hydrocarbons ions is often not available. A consequence is that proper implementation of dissociative recombination processes in chemical models is difficult, and many models ignore invaluable data. We propose a novel probabilistic approach based on Dirichlet-type distributions, enabling modelers to fully account for the available information. As an application, we consider the production rate of radicals through dissociative recombination in an ionospheric chemistry model of Titan, the largest moon of Saturn.

The plasma based inactivation of harmful biological systems is, however, not yet widely used, because any validation is hampered by the limited knowledge about the interaction mechanisms at the interface between a plasma and a biological system. By using quantified beams of hydrogen atoms, argon ions and UV photons, the treatment of bacteria in a typical argon - hydrogen plasma is mimicked in a very controlled manner. As an example the inactivation of endospores of Bacillus atrophaeus is studied. It is shown that the impact of H atoms alone causes no inactivation of bacteria.
