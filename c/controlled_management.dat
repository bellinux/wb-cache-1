40|$|In the Koran, the <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> is be {{an issue}} that very {{important}} in life, business, organization, society and the state system, enhacing of the environment as well. Objectives: This paper suggests to explain the basics of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran; the aspects of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran; the models of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran. There are six methods used in this study, namely: Method of selection of theme of studies; the method of determining the type of study; method of data collecting; methods of data analysis; approachs to the study. Result: This research has found: First, the basis of controlling management: There are three principles: (1) the theological principle; (2) humanistic principle; (3) maslahah al-mursalah principle. Second, the aspects of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran: Aspects of micro-macro (the individual-states). Third, there are three models of <b>controlling</b> <b>management</b> in the Koran: (1) self-control (raqabah dzatiyah); (2) <b>control</b> through <b>management.</b> (3) social <b>control.</b> Conclusion: In the Koran the most relevant terms to enhance the environment and social controls are both taqwa (piety) and amar ma'ruf nahi munkar. Both are very important things to protect religion, life, intellect, lineage, wealth and environment.

5000|$|The Australian {{kangaroo}} industry {{produces a}} range of meat and leather products from animals harvested from the wild under strict government <b>controlled</b> <b>Management</b> Plans. These ensure the harvest is sustainable and humane.A wide cross section of Australian ecologists support the kangaroo industry as being both sustainable and environmentally wise. [...] Many argue kangaroos, which are native to Australia, are a more environmentally friendly livestock option than introduced sheep and cattle. [...] The two most important facets of kangaroos' better ecological fit than European agricultural animals relate to their adaptation to Australia's aridity. Kangaroos have small chest development and so require less water to breathe than placental mammals, which usually must expand a diaphragm. This means they lose more moisture in respiration. Kangaroos just make small pants while immobile and in motion expand and contract their lungs effectively using their leg muscles. The belly flops up and down, contracting and expanding the lungs respectively. Also, the kangaroo's paw is softer and does not compact the ground as hoofed cattle and sheep do. Instead, its hopping leaves very small bowl-shaped cuts in the surface of even dry clay soil, which let native grass seeds carried on the wind settle into them. The bowl shape concentrates any moisture that may fall into it into a wet point that the grass seed can use to germinate. Thus, kangaroos deplete the water table at a slower rate than cattle or sheep and would even be viable {{in the absence of}} any bore water at all. The ecological arguments for kangaroos replacing sheep and cattle as arid land livestock are compelling, though they must be set against objections of kangaroos' lack of domestication and breeding rate.Kangaroos are eaten in most states.|$|E

Different weed <b>control</b> <b>managements</b> can induce distinct changes in soil structure.

The objective of this work was to verify the use of physico-hydrical attributes to understand the effect of weed <b>control</b> <b>managements</b> on soil structure. Two soil layers (0 – 0. 05 and 0. 10 – 0. 15 m) and six weed <b>control</b> <b>managements</b> divided into two groups were analyzed: I. no soil disturbance and ground cover (no weed control, post-emergence herbicide, mechanical mower); and II. soil disturbance and no ground cover (hand-hoe weeding, rotary tiller, pre-emergence herbicide).

The results showed that the volumetric water capacity derived from the SWRC can be an interesting tool to evaluate the impact of weed <b>control</b> <b>managements</b> on soil structure.

The samples of this study were dispensaries that had some criteria i. e. privately owned dispensaries; dispensaries that were not in hospital areas; and dispensaries that transacted at least once a month at the biggest PBF in Bengkulu. Each dispensary has a person who was responsible in purchasing goods and then was involved as the respondent. The number of samples was 52. The data used in this study were primary ones obtained by distributing questionnaires to the respondents. Of the 52 questionnaires distributed, 40 questionnaires could be analyzed. The data obtained were processed by using multiple linear regression with SPSS version 16. The results of this study were: 1) Management control system had no significant effect on performance in a strategic supply relationship. This means that the more or less <b>controlled</b> <b>management</b> of dispensaries did not lead to improved performance in a strategic supply relationship. 2) Management control system had a positive and significant effect on cooperation. This means that the more or less <b>controlled</b> <b>management</b> of dispensaries led to improved cooperation. 3) Cooperation had no significant effect on performance in a strategic supply relationship. This means that a better or worse cooperation in dispensaries led to improved performance in a strategic supply relationship. 4) Management control system had no significant effect on performance in a strategic supply relationship, and cooperation did not mediate (intervening) the system of management control on performance in a strategic supply relationship as in the case of a better or worse cooperation in the dispensaries that did not cause an improvement in management control system toward performance in a strategic supply relationship...|$|E

Although the near-miss concept has long been understood in the oil industry, what has been largely missing is the integration of near-miss management into the safety culture and day to day operations in a manner that underlines the critical connections between near-misses and behavior. In the oil industry, incident assessment is key to its very survival and profitability. But among other incidences, there were challenges in th...|$|E
