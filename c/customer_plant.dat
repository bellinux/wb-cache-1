40|$|Voltage dips are {{becoming}} an increasing concern to many industrial and commercial customers, {{due to the}} problems they cause on several types of equipment. In industrial plants equipped with private generating systems, {{in case of a}} fault in the supply feeder, the protection device will disconnect the <b>customer</b> <b>plant</b> from the utility system, preserving sensitive loads from interruptions, but exposing the equipment to a voltage dip due to its intervention delay. This paper describes a high speed protection device based on solid-state breakers, intelligently controlled by an artificial neural network, which is able to considerably reduce this voltage dip duration. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} predict with good accuracy the value of the RMS voltage, in order to recognise, within a few μs, the kind of abnormal event that is about to occur on the network.

Its aim was to develop certain measures for reducing <b>customer’s</b> <b>plants</b> influence on the Belarusian power supply system as their activity has unfavorable economic consequences. The following methods were used in the present research: the system analysis, the method of analogies and expenses calculation. The article presents the comparative characteristics of the power production during the typical working day of the heating period in the years 2013 and 2014 in terms of condensation power plants, central heating and power <b>plants</b> and <b>customer’s</b> <b>plants.</b> The potential damage caused by the <b>customer’s</b> <b>plants</b> to the power supply system has been calculated, the restrictions for the <b>customer’s</b> <b>plants</b> activity existing in the Republic of Belarus nowadays has been analyzed.

40|$|To {{maintain}} a good voltage quality level to customers in power distribution system, {{it is essential}} to minimise transients, line voltage dips and spikes due to a variety of causes, including fault occurrence, power interruption and large load changes. In case of private generating systems it is essential that ultra-rapid switching devices be used which cut off the <b>customer</b> <b>plant</b> from the utility system so quickly that the presence of voltage dips is not perceived by the industrial plant's sensitive loads. These devices require very fast acquisition and control systems which permit to diagnose and, possibly, predict abnormal events. In this paper a control methodology based on a locally recurrent-globally feedforward neural network and on a neural classifier is proposed.

40|$|An {{optimization}} model is proposed to redesign {{the supply chain}} of spare part delivery under demand uncertainty from strategic and tactical perspectives in a planning horizon consisting of multiple periods. Long term decisions involve new installations, expansions and elimination of warehouses and factories handling multiple products. It is also considered which warehouses should be used as repair work-shops in order to store, repair and deliver used units to customers. Tactical planning includes deciding inventory levels (safety stock and expected inventory) {{for each type of}} spare part in distribution centers and customer plants, as well as the connection links between the supply chain nodes. Capacity constraints are also taken into account when planning inventory levels. At the tactical level it is determined how demand of failing units is satisfied, and whether to use new or used parts. The uncertain demand is addressed by defining the optimal amount of safety stock that guarantees certain service level at a <b>customer</b> <b>plant.</b> In addition, the risk-pooling effect is taken into account when defining inventory levels in distribution centers and customer zones. Due to the nonlinear nature of the original formulation, a piece-wise linearization approach is applied to obtain a tight lower bound of the optimal solution. The formulation can be adapted to several industry-critical units and the supply chain of electric motors is provided here as an example...|$|E

From a global perspective, {{the total volume}} of crushed rock is massive and corresponds to several billion tons. All societies have to fulfil a daily need of rock material products and its derivatives such as metals and minerals. The business for metals and minerals is global while the aggregates production is mainly a local industry. This paper presents a broader overview of optimisation with respect to product yield, use {{of natural resources and}} energy consumption. High level plant optimisation of compressive crushing plants is covered as well as real-time optimisation and optimisation of single production units. Each of three optimisation areas are presented and a discussion around how these three areas will be able {{to communicate with each other}} is given. Several models, e. g. process performance behaviour with respect to wear, as well as fitness functions can be common for all three areas. Well-defined and representative fitness functions are of the utmost importance in order to assure that the optimisation results reflect the production targets. It is concluded that great benefits can be achieved by linking together different areas of optimisation. The future for compressing crushing lies, without a doubt, in tailored processes both with respect to machines optimised for each <b>customer,</b> <b>plant</b> parameters and operation routines as well as an on-line adjustment, which takes into account current information and control possibilities...|$|E

The study of the ITC focuses {{on the development of}} a “preferred supplier ” concept, developed in the UK subsidiary since the mid- 1990 ’s. The aim was to capture business volume at customers through greatly increased embeddedness from a legal, technical and social point of view. In brief, the ITC offers greater productivity at the <b>customer</b> <b>plant</b> through productivity analysis using its network knowledge of cutting, milling and drilling operations and the tools involved. This has been codified in a software package. The ICT also offers automated, real-time stock control and consignment stocks. The case study highlights some important implications of business relationships. It shows that strong ties can be built relatively fast if a working methodology exists and if buyers are willing to give suppliers a greater role. The main driver for the relationship in general, commitment, investments and trust, is the explicit methodology and documentation of achievements in terms of productivity gains and cost savings. It is the network knowledge of the ITC that is exchanged, not the tools themselves but rather the optimization of the activities that they perform. For the ITC, what was previously a fragmented but stable market is becoming a winner-takes-all market, at the customer level. This indicates that increased levels of supplier-customer embeddedness can lead to fierce competition among suppliers...|$|E

Power Smart develops, operates and manages various DSM programs for residential, commercial and industrial customers. The Power Smart Partners Program (PSP) is the premier demand-side management program for BC Hydro?s large commercial and industrial non-transmission class customers. It is a direct energy acquisition program {{that is based on}} a partnering approach with BC Hydro?s business customers. A customer that commits to being a Power Smart Partner gains access to financial support and assistance with the identification and implementation of electricity savings projects. A direct financial incentive is provided to lower customers? funding requirements and to improve the payback and/or investment criteria for energy efficiency projects. Projects are evaluated against established criteria set forth by BC Hydro. Projects which prove to be the most cost-effective on a $/kWh basis receive funds. For transmission-voltage customers, BC Hydro has recently implemented a new tariff designed to encourage energy reduction. The new tariff is an inclining block tariff and is known as the Stepped Rate. The customer?s consumption is compared against their Customer Baseline Load (CBL). The first 90 % of the customer?s consumption is billed at a Tier 1 rate. The remaining consumption is billed at a Tier 2 rate, approximately two times the Tier 1 rate. There are mechanisms in place to adjust the customer?s CBL to account for activities such as customer-funded demand-side-management projects and <b>customer</b> <b>plant</b> expansion projects. This paper will discuss BC Hydro?s M&V program in terms of the process, operations and M&V results to date for the PSP.

40|$|Current {{practices}} of power quality mitigation {{in the industry}} are characterized by sub-optimal investment decisions where over compensation is often the norm such causing huge wastage in financial resources. Providing power quality management services to industrial customers {{in the form of}} power quality contracts could yield substantial return for the network operator. With better understanding of network parameters, and the option of installing network level mitigation devices, network operators could employ wider range of cost effective mitigation solutions. Tapping into the market however, entails bearing the risks for the customers which network operators are not always willing or encouraged to do. With potentially millions at stake, extensive risk assessments are crucial for any proposed power quality management scheme. This thesis investigates the voltage sag aspect of the problem {{as part of a larger}} power quality management scheme. The aim is to develop general framework for technical and financial assessments of voltage sags prior to the introduction of power quality management service. The thesis focuses on five major aspects of voltage sag assessment: identification of customer requirement, financial loss assessment, network sag performance estimation, sag mitigation, and financial appraisal of mitigating solutions. The first part of the thesis gives a comprehensive overview of current power quality problems faced by industrial customers and provides ranges of typical financial losses incurred by different types of industries around the world. It then proposes robust methodology for assessment of typical financial loss, i. e., customized customer damage function (CCDF), for a given industry based on available survey data and taking into account characteristics of the assessed <b>customer</b> <b>plant.</b> For failure and financial risk assessments, the thesis introduces new customer models employing probabilistic methods to quantify risks induced by voltage sags and proposes generic models that incorporate full flexibility in failure risk assessment, taking into account the effect of unbalanced sags on equipment behavior. It further quantifies the error introduced by sag performance estimation using limited monitoring data with a case study on actual sag profile. It demonstrates how different estimation methods and different durations of monitoring period affect accuracy of estimation of voltage sag profile and associated risk of industrial process failure. Following this, the thesis presents new models for plant and network level sag mitigation devices. They include power injecting mitigation devices, devices that reduce number of faults in the network and devices that reduce the severity of faults. Developed models are then used to investigate the cost-effectiveness of sag mitigation at different levels. Finally, the thesis presents Genetic Algorithm based methodology for deciding on optimal investment scheme in voltage sag mitigation in the network. The sensitivity of the solution to various influential parameters, including plant type and size, sensitive equipment type, process characteristics, financial loss resulting from process interruption, cost and effectiveness of mitigating solution and network fault rates is also established.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{presented}} {{the concept and}} practices of enlarged JIT and determined its impact on JIT implementation and performance of the production system. Enlarged JIT {{has been defined as}} a set of activities which facilitate JIT production and thus improve the performance of the production system. Specifically, enlarged JIT will help reduce uncertainties in customers 2 ̆ 7 demand and thus stabilize master production schedules. Stabilizing MPS has been frequently mentioned as a prerequisite in implementing JIT. Such activities would include establishing a direct communication link with <b>customer</b> <b>plants,</b> improving frequency of deliveries to <b>customer</b> <b>plants,</b> effective communication links in producer plants, and other supporting activities. ^ To determine the impact of enlarged JIT on production, several hypotheses were developed as to the relationships between enlarged JIT and both the implementation of other JIT practices and system performance. To test the proposed hypotheses, data were collected using questionnaires. Hotelling 2 ̆ 7 s T 2 test and discriminant analysis were used to test the two proposed hypotheses. ^ The result of statistical analysis shows that companies utilizing enlarged JIT are implementing JIT to a greater extent in all eight functional areas than companies not doing so. Even though the interrelationship of JIT implementation among those areas has not been specifically stated, one would anticipate that enlarged JIT helps stabilize part or all of the master production schedules in advance and provides uniform and level schedules by eliminating unnecessary demand fluctuations in the production system, which in turn facilitates JIT production in every other area. ^ The result also indicates that companies utilizing enlarged JIT achieve greater performance improvement in terms of cost, quality, flexibility, and delivery. There is a strong indication that the nine enlarged JIT practices are important facilitators of JIT implementation and thus contributors to higher performance improvement. Factor analysis shows that the essence of enlarged JIT consists of two factors: communication and reverse implementation of JIT purchasing. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{effective}} Demand Side Management (DSM) programs, {{it is important to}} properly understand the cogeneration capabilities of large industrial customers. Projecting historical trends may be simple and convenient, but can lead to erroneous conclusions. A better understanding can be obtained by analyzing specific details of the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system in the <b>customer's</b> <b>plant.</b> The authors present a new methodology which they call "Demand Side Dispatching". This methodology comprises developing simple yet realistic mixed integer linear models of the customer's CHP and solving such models using proven Mixed Integer Linear Programming algorithms to determine globally optimum operating policies. This methodology in effect predicts rational customer responses to varying steam/power load scenarios to alternate fuel/power contracts. Such analyses could either be done individually for each customer or combined to provide a composite regional picture. The intended application is to study the impact of different rate schedules on the customer's CHP operating policy, and hence on the utility demand profile. By including potential alternate cogeneration equipment options in the models, it would also be possible to understand which rate schedules provide incentives for future cogeneration, and which do not.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the situation of}} a supplier <b>plant</b> whose <b>customer</b> <b>plants</b> desire just-in-time (JIT) deliveries. Randomness in both the production and demand processes make satisfying every demand that might occur in true JIT fashion impossible. Therefore, supplier plants typically negotiate bounds on JIT contracts with their customers. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} use of "quotas" or "target inventory levels" as a mechanism for establishing such bounds. That is, the supplier firm is responsible for meeting periodic demands up to the quota, but not beyond. In this paper, we {{consider the}} problem of setting an appropriate quota {{from the perspective of the}} supplier plant and interpret our results in the context of the negotiation process between the supplier and its customers. Under the assumption that "safety capacity" (i. e., overtime or a vendoring option) is available, we develop two models that address this problem. The first model assumes that quota shortfalls cannot be carried over to the next regular time production period and are made up with overtime/vendoring, which incurs fixed plus variable costs. The second model assumes that shortages can be backlogged to the next regular time production period at a cost. We use numerical examples to demonstrate how the models we developed were used by a clutch supplier to a large auto manufacturer to negotiate its JIT contracts. pull systems, just-in-time, production control, supply chain management...|$|R
