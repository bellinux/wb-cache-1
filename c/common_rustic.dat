'Twere {{an insult to}} your sex to believe it. It is not yet sure that she has not {{captured}} even so high game as she has named. If she has, it would add another interest to a treaty of comity and alliance." ...|$|E

5000|$|Similarly, {{the common}} {{language}} now used in everyday conversations in the Amami Ōshima {{is not the}} traditional Amami language, but rather a regional variation of Amami-accented Japanese, locally nicknamed トン普通語 (Ton Futsūgo, literally meaning [...] "potato <b>rustic</b> <b>common</b> language") by older speakers.|$|R

Their habitat is in grassland, woodland, scrub, and lawns that are in Asia, Europe, and North America. The spider hunts {{on the ground and}} often gets caught in pitfall traps.|$|R

5000|$|Qin, {{from a tiny}} base, {{had become}} a great power, ruling the land and {{receiving}} homage from all quarters for a hundred odd years. Yet after they unified the land and secured themselves within the pass, a single <b>common</b> <b>rustic</b> could nevertheless challenge this empire... Why? Because the ruler lacked humaneness and rightness; because preserving power differs fundamentally from seizing power.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{structures of}} Grand Teton National Park span {{a period of}} {{little more than a}} century. They share a <b>common</b> heritage of <b>rustic</b> design and construction, first from necessity, and later from a common desire on the part of dude ranch operators and the National Park Service to evoke the aesthetics of the Western frontier. Grand Teton is unusual in its extensive inventory of structures from the pre-park period, a legacy of its expansion into areas that had been previously settled.|$|R
50|$|Courageous and powerfully built, Gan, {{by his own}} admission, was {{not terribly}} bright. But he {{was the voice of}} reason and <b>rustic</b> <b>common</b> sense so he was far from stupid. His manner was direct, honest and straightforward. Unlike the other more cynical members of the crew, he took things at face value and was not always expecting to be betrayed or double-crossed. He was loyal and selfless in his devotion to Blake's cause, and his raw {{physical}} strength was a great asset. Although loyal to Blake, Gan was noticeably outspoken against Blake's plans to ally with Terra Nostra, a drug dealing organisation.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the parts}} of the South which face the Atlantic Ocean, French {{influences}} often were dictated by where French Huguenots settled, however it is Louisiana that got the lion's share of older French cooking methods from Poitou and Normandy via Nova Scotia, most of which are foodways that pre-date the codification of haute cuisine during the reign of Louis XIV and have more in <b>common</b> with <b>rustic</b> cuisines of the 17th and 18th century than anything ever found at the French court in Versailles or the bistros of 19th and 20th century Paris; {{this is especially true of}} Cajun cuisine. Louisiana is a state named for Louis XIV and to this day French is still a commonly spoken tongue in the areas west of New Orleans, in Acadiana. The Cajuns and their dialect have occupied Southern Louisiana since the 1700s owing to Le Grande Dérangement, an event in which they were forcibly evicted by the English Crown from their lands in Canada and made to occupy more marginal lands on the bayou.|$|R
5000|$|The term chula {{is often}} {{given to the}} call and {{response}} louvação immediately following the ladainha. By comparison, traditionally in Bahia the chula is the free form song text of the Samba de Roda sung between the dances (as in the samba parada) and defines the structures of the various other [...] "styles" [...] of samba de roda, while the samba corrido lasts {{as long as the}} singer feels like singing it before moving on to another. The chula is a poetic form based on the quadra (quatrain) form (which may have influenced Mestre Bimba's replacement of ladainhas with quadras) with its roots in Iberia. The word chula comes from the word chulo meaning [...] "vulgar", <b>common,</b> <b>rustic</b> (similarly the Spanish word chulo/chulito is used for peasant Indians in the Americas), being often pastoral and sentimental.|$|E
50|$|This {{church is}} modern (1854) with many {{fragments}} {{of a more}} ancient building inserted in its walls. Possibly the central arcade supporting the vaulting of its two aisles may be ancient. This arcade is carried on two circular columns with cushion capitals and between them is a singular looking font on a platform which {{is said to be}} used for a ceremony on the festival of the Epiphany. The baldachino of stone over the altar and the iconostasis appear to be of the same date as the modern rebuilding in 1854. There are several ancient icons (traditionally said to have been brought from Ayia Sophia in Constantinople after the Turkish conquest), one of which is of unusually large size. Another is dated 1529. In the narthex amongst other fragments is a small basso-relievo of the Madonna and Child under a canopy, <b>common</b> <b>rustic</b> work of the 15th century. This is the only surviving church in Cyprus dedicated to St. Kassianos.|$|E
5000|$|Attired as a <b>common</b> <b>rustic,</b> O'Connor is {{introduced}} by Dr Rosy as [...] "Honest Humphrey Hum", of a naive and bashful temperament. He is soon entrusted with Lauretta, to mind {{her while she}} walks in the garden, with especial instructions to keep her safe from the soldiers. As soon as they are alone, O'Connor tells her who he is, and the Justice returns {{a few minutes later}} to kind him kissing her. Discovering his true identity in his anger, he dismisses him angrily and threatens to shoot him should he return. Returning to Dr Rosy in despair, he soon comes up with another plan and, disguised as a German quack, sends a missive to the Judge informing him that he has been poisoned. In terror Credulous sends for Dr Rosy, who affirms that he has been poisoned, [...] "how came these black spots on your nose?...alack, how you are swelled". He tells him that the only hope lies in consulting the German, and O'Connor is accordingly sent for. When he arrives, he informs Justice Credulous that he has an antidote, but that he will give it to him only on the payment of three thousand pounds, and permission to marry his daughter if he can get her consent. Trusting that Lauretta will never give the latter, Credulous agrees, only to find too late that he has been at last outwitted. The play ends happily, with Justice Credulous withdrawing his objection :"I give my daughter to you, who are the most impudent dog I ever saw in my life", and that the affair will provide he and his wife [...] "a good subject for them to quarrel about the rest of their lives".|$|E
50|$|The {{detailing}} of the Dawes house represents {{more the}} flavor of rural French architecture, and in this respect has more in <b>common</b> with the <b>rustic</b> character of Grey Towers, the much larger home of Gifford Pinchot outside of Milford, Pennsylvania that was designed largely by Hunt in 1886, but in which Ficken {{had a hand in}} some of the details. Even a quick study of the Dawes house, Grey Towers, and the more formally detailed John A. McGill house (1892) in Chicago (see picture) will show how closely they are all related {{to each other and to}} their French antecedents, especially to the Château de Chambord at Chambord, Loir-et-Cher in France.|$|R

5000|$|Although some of Perrault's tales had folkloric origins, he {{modified}} {{them with}} elaborate detail written in intentionally brilliant language {{for an audience}} of sophisticated adults who expected embellishment. Some stories such as [...] "Sleeping Beauty" [...] were original literary tales, divested from their (possible) folkloric roots. The intention was to present the précieux with modern retellings of stories from which the base, the <b>common,</b> and the <b>rustic</b> had been removed. The chapbook or bibliotheque bleue version of [...] "Sleeping Beauty" [...] has simple language intended for an uneducated and unsophisticated audience, whereas Perrault embellished the story {{to appeal to the}} sophisticates who frequented the literary salons. Carpenter says of [...] "Sleeping Beauty" [...] that [...] "it reads like a fashionable romance rather than a folk-tale." [...] "Little Red Riding Hood" [...] was almost certainly original, because earlier versions have not been recorded or do not seem to exist, and nothing remotely similar can be found in older literature. The first edition of the volume has margin notes for [...] "Little Red Riding Hood" [...] telling the reader the last lines are to be read in a loud voice to scare the child, leading Carpenter to believe it was written as a children's game, though he goes on the say that the sexual connotations are impossible to ignore. The stories were not intended for children because literature for children did not exist in the late 17th century, and most likely were taken from earlier literary stories. [...] "Griselidis", intended to be a [...] "modern novella", although based on a contemporary chapbook exists in a version in Boccaccio's 14th-century Decameron which was later translated to Latin by Petrarch. Giambattista Basile's volume of stories published in Naples earlier in the century, around 1634, contains stories with strong similarities to four of Perrault's stories, including [...] "Puss-n-Boots".|$|R
40|$|The Isabel grape {{is one of}} {{the main}} cultivars of Vitis labrusca, and it's a <b>common,</b> <b>rustic</b> and less {{demanding}} variety. The aim of this work was the obtention of&nbsp; Isabel grape extract and the evaluation of its activity on the growth of Lactic Acid Bacteria. The effect of grape extract and ethanol on lactic acid bacteria growth was evaluated. The average of total phenolic compounds in the Isabel grape extract was 14, 80 mg/mL, less than literature data. The amount of phenolic compounds on grape extract can be influenced by the type of extraction and techniques used in the production of the extract and by the reactions that occurs during its storage. The Isabel grape extract was more efficient on reducing Lactic acid bacteria growth than ethanol...|$|E
