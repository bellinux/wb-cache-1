40|$|The upgrade {{recycling}} of cast-iron scrap chips towards β-FeSi 2 thermoelectric materials is proposed as an eco-friendly and cost-effective production process. By using scrap waste from the machining process of cast-iron components, the material cost to fabricate β-FeSi 2 is reduced {{and the industrial}} waste is recycled. In this study, β-FeSi 2 specimens obtained from <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>scrap</b> chips were prepared both in the undoped form and doped with Al and Co elements. The maximum figure of merit (ZT) indicated a thermoelectric performance of approximately 70 % in p-type samples and nearly 90 % in n-type samples compared to β-FeSi 2 prepared from pure Fe and other published studies. The use of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>scrap</b> chips to produce β-FeSi 2 shows promise as an eco-friendly and cost-effective production process for thermoelectric materials...|$|R

This study is towards ensuring grey iron is reproduced from <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>scrap</b> auto engine blocks, when using a diesel fired rotary furnace and a FeSi alloy for structural modification (inoculation). With varying addition rate of the FeSi alloy to the tapped molten metal, chill wedge tests were performed on two different wedge samples of type W (according to ASTM A 367 - wedge test) with cooling modulus of 0. 45 cm (W 3 ½) and 0. 54 cm (W 4). The carbon equivalents for the test casts were within hypoeutectic range (3. 85 wt. (%) to 4. 11 wt. (%)). In the W 4 wedge sample, at 2. 0 wt.

The microstructure from the cast at this level of addition was free of carbidic phases; it shows randomly oriented graphite flakes evenly distributed in the iron matrix. Hardness assessment shows that increasing rate of FeSi addition results in decreasing hardness, with maximum effect at 2. 0 wt. (%) addition. With equivalent aspect ratio (cooling modulus) in a target cast product, this addition rate for this FeSi alloy under this furnace condition will attain graphitized microstructure in the cast product...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} melting {{atmosphere}} and charge material type on the metallic and alloy recovery of ferrous charge materials were investigated in {{two sets of}} experiments (Tasks 1 and 2). In addition, thermodynamic studies were performed (Task 3) to determine the suitability of ladle treatment {{for the production of}} ductile <b>iron</b> using <b>scrap</b> charge materials high in manganese and sulfur. Task 1 [...] In the first set of experiments, the charge materials investigated were thin steel scrap, thick steel <b>scrap,</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>scrap,</b> and pig <b>iron</b> in the rusty and clean states. Melting atmospheres in this set of experiments were varied by melting with and without a furnace cover. In this study, it was found that neither covered melting nor melting clean (non-rusty) ferrous charge materials improved the metallic recovery over the recovery experienced with uncovered melting or rusty charge materials. However, the silicon and manganese recoveries were greater with covered melting and clean materials. Silicon and manganese in the molten iron react with oxygen dissolved in the iron from uncovered melting and oxidized iron (surface rust). Silica and manganese silicates are formed which float to the slag decreasing recoveries of silicon and manganese. <b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> and pig iron had higher metallic recoveries than steel scrap. Carbon recovery was affected by the carbon content of the charge materials, and not by the melting conditions. Irons with higher silicon contents had higher silicon recovery than irons with lower silicon contents. Task 2 [...] In the second set of experiments, briquetted turnings and borings were used to evaluate the effects of briquette cleanliness, carbon additions, and melting atmosphere on metallic and alloy recovery. The melting atmosphere in this set of experiments was varied by melting in air and with an argon atmosphere using the SPAL process. In this set of experiments, carbon additions to the briquettes were found to have the greatest effect on metallic and alloy recovery. The use of an argon atmosphere was also found to increase recoveries, but to a lesser extent than with carbon additions to the briquettes. Task 3 [...] Finally, thermodynamic studies were carried out to evaluate the potential for removing manganese and sulfur from iron melts for the production of ferritic ductile iron. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that manganese and sulfur might be removed from iron melts by careful control of the temperature and slag.
