2500|$|In 1907, a Central American Court of Justice was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua {{established}} the Central American Common Market ("CACM"). Costa Rica, {{because of its}} relative economic prosperity and political stability, chose {{not to participate in}} the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of import substitution industrialization policies. The project was an immediate economic success, but was abandoned after the 1969 [...] "Football War" [...] between El Salvador and Honduras. A <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>Parliament</b> has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. Costa Rica has repeatedly declined invitations to join the regional parliament, which seats deputies from the four other former members of the Union, as well as from Panama and the Dominican Republic.|$|E

However, the proposals ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. Later meetings attempted to increase {{the scope of the}} group. They discussed about fostering the bilateral relations, creating a Latin <b>American</b> <b>parliament,</b> and a technological club. They also created a [...] "debitors club", to make coordinated actions towards creditors of their foreign debt. According to a proposal by Caputo, they rejected the United Kingdom policy towards the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Both groups were eventually replaced by the Rio Group.|$|R

The <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Free Trade Agreement was signed by five <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> countries, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.
