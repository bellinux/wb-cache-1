40|$|<b>Professional</b> <b>Knowledge,</b> <b>Professional</b> Lives" {{sets out}} to examine the state of <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> with regard to {{teaching}} and teacher education. The current situation of <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is scrutinised with particular regard {{to the location of}} educational study within the faculties of education. The fate of disciplinary patterns of study, which have come under attack from the proponents of more practical perspectives, are also examined. As practical perspectives promoted by a wide spectrum of advocates have become part of the fashionable discourse around teacher education, these perspectives are examined and some of the results of such practical fundamentalism are held up for scrutiny. It is argued that confining <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> entirely within the practical domain would not seem to be a well-thought out strategy for raising professional standards. A more active notion of teachers' <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> can, and should, be explored, and consolidated by work which focuses on the teacher's life and work, using more reflective and 'public intellectual' modes...|$|R
