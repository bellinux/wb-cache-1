5000|$|The word loblolly is a {{combination}} of lob, referring to thick heavy bubbling of cooking porridge, and lolly, an old British dialect word for broth, soup, or any other food boiled in a pot. In the southern United States, the word is used to mean [...] "a mudhole; a mire," [...] a sense derived from an allusion to the consistency of porridge. Hence the pine is named as it is generally (but not exclusively) found in lowlands and swampy areas. Loblolly pines grow well in acidic clay soil, which is common throughout the South, and are thus often found in large stands in rural places. Other old names, now rarely used, include oldfield pine, due to its status as an early colonizer of abandoned fields; bull pine, due to its size (several other yellow pines are also often so named, especially large isolated specimens); rosemary pine, due to loblolly's distinctive fragrance compared to the other southern pines; and North <b>Carolina</b> <b>pine.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{town was}} the initial landing {{point for a}} Civil War battle known as the Battle of New Bern. On March 11, 1862, Brigadier General Ambrose Burnside's command {{embarked}} from Roanoke Island to rendezvous with Union gunboats at Hatteras Inlet for an expedition against New Bern. On March 13, the fleet sailed up the Neuse River, anchored at Slocum Creek, and disembarked infantry on the river's south bank. Elements of the Rhode Island Heavy Artillery came ashore near the present-day location of the Officers' Club on Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station and also near the <b>Carolina</b> <b>Pines</b> Golf and Country Club. After the capture of New Bern, the Federals transited Havelock {{on their way to}} the Battle of Fort Macon. Despite several Confederate attempts to reclaim New Bern and the surrounding area, the Federals did not withdraw until after the end of the war. During one of the attempts, however, the Union-built blockhouse fort on Havelock's Slocom Creek was burned in 1864.

40|$|Among {{the more}} {{intriguing}} topics in general ecology courses are the symbiotic relationships (the ‘-isms’ as I sometimes present them – mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism). Of these, mutualism is typically the most appealing to students. The scenario that different species {{can not only}} co-exist, but can also provide essential resources/services for one another, resonates well with all but the least interested in the course. Ultimately, however, {{there is also the}} palpable degree of dismay when they discover that these relationships arise from mutual exploitation, rather than from some benign force of nature. A flip-side of this, in many ways a type of dark side of nature, is something most ecology students have experienced directly – the degrading effects of invasive plant species on plant communities. Whether it is a verdant blanket of kudzu (Pueraria lobata) on <b>Carolina</b> <b>pines,</b> Japanese knotweed (Microstegium vimineum) extending beyond paths of the Appalachian Trail, or garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) creating a monospecific carpet on the forest floor of a temperate hardwood forest, most students have witnessed this phenomenon, with the more curious asking: why? Why is it that invasive species attain, and then maintain, the edge over their native counterparts? Building on earlier work published out of the same laboratory (Cantor et al., 2011; Brouwer et al., 2015), Hale et al., in this issue of New Phytologist (pp. 542 – 549) address this very important question, and do so in a creative way, ultimately elucidating a novel explanation that answers this question – at least in part – for eastern hardwood forests, and they do so by invoking one of the more well-known mutualistic relationships: mycorrhizas...|$|R

5000|$|The {{replacement}} lighthouse {{now known}} as [...] "Old Baldy" [...] was completed by 1817. [...] Old Baldy was built further inland where {{it would not be}} threatened by shifting sands along the river for just under $16,000 using bricks salvaged from the old tower. A stone plaque above the entrance identifies the builder as Daniel S. Way, and the foundry for the lantern room, that was also salvaged from the old tower, as R. Cochran. The octagonal brick tower is coated with stucco and stands 110 ft high, the exterior was originally whitewashed or painted white. At its base, the tower is 36 ft wide and at its top 14.25 ft wide, while the walls are 5 ft thick at the base and taper to 2.5 ft at the top. The rectangular stairway leading up the inside of the tower is made of <b>Carolina</b> yellow <b>pine.</b> The lantern room sits on top of one of the tower support beams which makes it offset {{from the center of the}} tower.

5000|$|Values of nest success {{reported}} for Bachman's sparrows vary. Daily nest survival rate of Bachman's sparrow ranged from 0.89 to 0.96 across sites and {{years in the}} dry prairie of central Florida. On average 3.13 birds were fledged per successful Bachman's sparrow nest. Estimates of productivity ranged from 1.21 to 4.16 offspring per pair per year across sites and years. In a South <b>Carolina</b> longleaf <b>pine</b> community, daily survival rate of Bachman's sparrow nests in 1995 was 0.952, which was significantly (p=0.04) higher than the 1996 daily nest survival rate of 0.889. Earlier nesting attempts (before June 15, n=15) had significantly (p=0.05) higher survival rates than those started {{later in the year}} (n=11). Daily nest survival rate was 0.922 during incubation and 0.973 during the nestling stage. In central Arkansas, daily success rate during the incubation period was 0.965, while in the nestling period it was 0.919. In the glades of south-central Missouri, 8 female Bachman's sparrows fledged an average of 1.5 young per season over 2 years. Predation accounted for 80% of egg loss on study sites in Arkansas and 94% of nest failures on sites in central Florida.
