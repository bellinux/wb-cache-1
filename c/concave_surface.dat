25|$|Wheels : Abrasive cups or {{wheels are}} used to {{superfinish}} flat and spherical surfaces. The wheel and workpiece are rotated in opposite directions, which creates the cross-hatching. If the two are parallel then the result if a flat finish, but if the wheel is tilted slightly a convex or <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> will form.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is similar in}} basic concept to a jaw crusher, {{consisting}} of a <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> and a conical head; both surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel surfaces. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but does not rotate; the movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement. As with the jaw crusher, material travels downward between the two surfaces being progressively crushed until it is small enough to fall out through {{the gap between the}} two surfaces.|$|E

25|$|Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can {{be either}} {{positive}} or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A negative meniscus lens has a steeper <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a positive meniscus lens has a steeper convex surface and is thicker at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light. All real lenses have nonzero thickness, however, which makes a real lens with identical curved surfaces slightly positive. To obtain exactly zero optical power, a meniscus lens must have slightly unequal curvatures {{to account for the}} effect of the lens' thickness.|$|E
25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the concave shape to hold the disc into the soil– unless something hard strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll {{up and over the}} obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make as good a job as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|E
25|$|It {{does this}} by {{climbing}} up to a height, which it does easily {{by virtue of}} its keeled belly scales, and then launching itself into mid-air. The snake contracts its ventral surface inwards to form a U-shaped concave depression along the entire length of their bodies, holding the outer edges of the ventral scales rigid. This <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> acts like a parachute, and increases air resistance, allowing the snake to glide forward with the thrust of its launch. The snake undulates through the air, in a swimming-like motion. It holds the tail rigidly upwards, and by twisting the tail from side to side, it attains balance. This motion allows it to propel forward, landing clumsily {{at the end of its}} flight.|$|E

25|$|The core of beta-catenin {{consists}} of several very characteristic repeats, each approximately 40 amino acids long. Termed armadillo repeats, all these elements fold {{together into a}} single, rigid protein domain with an elongated shape – called armadillo (ARM) domain. An average armadillo repeat is composed of three alpha helixes. The first repeat of β-catenin (near the N-terminus) is slightly different from the others – as it has an elongated helix with a kink, formed by the fusion of helices 1 and 2. Due to the complex shape of individual repeats, the whole ARM domain is not a straight rod: it possesses a slight curvature, so that an outer (convex) and an inner (<b>concave)</b> <b>surface</b> is formed. This inner surface serves as a ligand-binding site for the various interaction partners of the ARM domains.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Allain {{established}} some distinctive traits. Dubreuillosaurus has {{an unusually}} low and long skull, with a length {{three times the}} height. In the upper corner of {{the front edge of}} the nasal branch of the maxilla, a kink is present, separating a convex curvature below from a concave curvature above. The descending branch of the postorbital has a U-shaped cross-section. The parietal bones are not visible in side view. The supratemporal fenestra has a straight inner edge. A paraquadratic fenestra is lacking. A well-developed process is present {{on the underside of the}} jugal branch of the ectopterygoid. The rear edge of the jugal branch of the ectopterygoid, in front of the infratemporal fenestra, is deeply grooved. The lower jaw has a large external mandibular fenestra. The foramen mylohyoideum is largely oriented to the front and below. The head of the thighbone is directed to the inside and below. The front underside of the thighbone has a <b>concave</b> <b>surface.</b> In 2012 Matthew Carrano added one autapomorphy: on the rear of the braincase there is a notch between the basioccipital and the bone surface formed by the exoccipitals and the opisthotic.|$|E

Single-mode standing-wave pattern is focused by ring element situated between driver and reflector. <b>Concave</b> <b>surfaces</b> increase levitating forces up to factor of 6 {{as opposed to}} conventional flat surfaces, {{making it possible to}} suspend heavier objects...|$|R
500|$|At the {{posterior}} {{end of this}} spermaceti complex is the frontal sac, which covers the <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> of the cranium. [...] The posterior wall of the frontal sac is covered with fluid–filled knobs, which are about 4–13 mm in diameter and separated by narrow grooves. [...] The anterior wall is smooth. The knobbly surface reflects sound waves that come through the spermaceti organ from the phonic lips. The grooves between the knobs trap a film of air that is consistent whatever the orientation or depth of the whale, making it an excellent sound mirror.|$|E
500|$|Adult skulls also possess large, rugose, and oval bosses on the supraorbital region {{above the}} eyes, {{instead of the}} horns of other ceratopsids. The supraorbital bosses {{extended}} from the postorbital bone forward to incorporate the triangular palpebral and prefrontal bones, and had high transverse ridges around the middle, which were thick at their base and thin towards their top. The palpebral bones strongly stood out, forming an [...] "antorbital buttress". The fused prefrontals did not reach the nasal boss, forming a distinctive transverse sadle-shaped groove separating the nasal boss from the supraorbital bosses. This groove extended backwards, separating the supraorbital bosses {{from each other and}} forming a T-shape in top view. These bosses were similar to those of Pachyrhinosaurus, but with taller ridges and more pronounced rugosities. The long and low supraorbital horncores of the sub-adult specimen MOR 591 were similar to those of sub-adult Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. They had a <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> on the inner side as with Pachyrhinosaurus; ridges on the postorbital bones were present that may indicate a beginning transition to bosses.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the right}} is {{an image of a}} {{straight}} wheel. These are by far the most common style of wheel and can be found on bench or pedestal grinders. They are used on the periphery only and therefore produce a slightly <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> (hollow ground) on the part. [...] This can be used to advantage on many tools such as chisels.|$|E
50|$|A {{meteorite}}, {{known as}} the Glenormiston meteorite, {{was found on the}} station by the manager Mr F. H. Story, in 1925. Story sold the object to the University of Queensland in 1926. The meteorite had a mass of 38.5 kg, has an irregular sub-triangular shape with convex and <b>concave</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} the ideal {{polishing}} agent for resin composite materials is still ongoing.

2500|$|At this point, if {{the mouth}} {{continues}} to open, {{not only are}} the condylar heads rotating within the lower compartment of the temporomandibular joints, but the entire apparatus (condylar head and articular disc) translates. [...] Although this had traditionally been explained as a forward and downward sliding motion, on the anterior <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> of the glenoid fossa and the posterior convex surface of the articular eminence, this translation actually amounts to a rotation around another axis. [...] This effectively produces an evolute which can be termed the resultant axis of mandibular rotation, which lies {{in the vicinity of the}} mandibular foramen, allowing for a low-tension environment for the vasculature and innervation of the mandible.|$|E
2500|$|On a CT scan, {{subdural}} hematomas are classically crescent-shaped, with a <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> {{away from}} the skull. [...] However, {{they can have a}} convex appearance, especially in the early stage of bleeding. [...] This may cause difficulty in distinguishing between subdural and epidural hemorrhages. [...] A more reliable indicator of subdural hemorrhage is its involvement of a larger portion of the cerebral hemisphere since it can cross suture lines, unlike an epidural hemorrhage. [...] Subdural blood can also be seen as a layering density along the tentorium cerebelli. This can be a chronic, stable process, since the feeding system is low-pressure. In such cases, subtle signs of bleeding such as effacement of sulci or medial displacement of the junction between gray matter and white matter may be apparent. [...] A chronic bleed can be the same density as brain tissue (called isodense to brain), meaning that it will show up on CT scan as the same shade as brain tissue, potentially obscuring the finding.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the belly}} {{side of the}} second head segment is the labrum, a mouth opening {{surrounded}} by sensitive [...] "lips". In the velvet worms, this structure is a muscular outgrowth of the throat, so, despite its name, it is probably not homologous to the labrum of the Arthropoda and is used for feeding. Deep within the oral cavity lie the sharp, crescent-shaped [...] "jaws", or mandibles, which are strongly hardened and resemble the claws of the feet, {{with which they are}} serially homologous; early in development, the jaw appendages have a similar position and shape to the subsequent legs. The jaws are divided into internal and external mandibles and their <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> bears fine denticles. They move backward and forward in a longitudinal direction, tearing apart the prey, apparently moved in one direction by musculature and the other by hydrostatic pressure. [...] The claws are made of sclerotised α-chitin, reinforced with phenols and chinons, and have a uniform composition – except that there is a higher concentration of calcium towards the tip, presumably affording greater strength.|$|E

However, a retrieval analysis study of 40 dual-mobility sockets showed that both the mean total wear (the sum of the wear on the convex and <b>concave</b> <b>surfaces)</b> {{as well as the}} mean annual total wear volume of the polyethylene liner was not more than that for conventional metal–polyethylene bearings [3].|$|R

60|$|The {{whiteness}} of Linnen, Paper, Silk, &c. proceeds {{much from the}} same reason, as the Microscope will easily discover; for the Paper {{is made up of}} an abundance of pellucid bodies, which afford a very plentifull reflection from within, that is, from the <b>concave</b> <b>surface</b> of the air contiguous to its component particles; wherefore by the affusion of Water, Oyl, Tallow, Turpentine, &c. all those reflections are made more faint, and the beams of light are suffer'd to traject & run through the Paper more freely.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} a handgun injury, Sturtevant found that {{pressure}} waves from a bullet impact in the torso can reach the spine and that a focusing effect from <b>concave</b> <b>surfaces</b> can concentrate the pressure wave on the spinal cord producing significant injury.
