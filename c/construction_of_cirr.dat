40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{occurrence}} {{and potential}} orthodontic causes of cervical invasive root resorption (CIRR) are unknown. We aimed {{to identify the}} occurrence <b>of</b> <b>CIRR</b> in molar teeth of orthodontic patients treated with fixed appliances. METHODS: All patients invited for final orthodontic recall between November 2009 and March 2011 were included. From 175 patients, 108 (46 men/ 62 women; mean age, 25 ± 5 years; mean time after bracket removal, 8 ± 2 years) were available. The first and second molar teeth (N = 858) of these patients were investigated for clinical and radiographic signs <b>of</b> <b>CIRR.</b> Patients identified with such signs were asked to have limited-volume cone-beam computed tomography scans performed. RESULTS: No clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>CIRR</b> were detected. CIRR could {{not be ruled out}} on bite-wing radiographs in 18 patients. CIRR was thus identified in 1 patient in whom a second maxillary molar was affected. All first molars had been extracted in this patient, and the second molars had been moved mesially over a long distance. The 3 other second molars showed surface resorption. CONCLUSIONS: CIRR in molar teeth of orthodontic patients have a low mid-term occurrence (0. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 2 %- 5. 2 %). Long movement distances and/or long treatment duration {{may be related to the}} development of these lesions...|$|R

50|$|As {{construction}} progressed in Shaker Heights, the Van Sweringens {{realized that}} the connection to Cleveland Railway's streetcar system through Cleveland Heights resulted in a slow trip to downtown. They planned for a grade-separated right-of-way {{all the way to}} downtown that could significantly reduce travel times for commuters, and thus increase the desirability of their suburb. In 1915 they acquired a majority interest in the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (the Nickel Plate Road), mainly to allow for a line next to a relocated NYC&StL. The next section <b>of</b> <b>CIRR</b> opened in April 1920, running west from Coventry Road down the median of the new Shaker Boulevard to Woodhill Road, then across the Cleveland Short Line Railway (New York Central Railroad) and alongside a CSL branch to East 55th Street. West of East 55th Street, where the CSL branch crossed over the parallel Nickel Plate, the new streetcar line also crossed the Nickel Plate, continuing west between the branch and Nickel Plate, then up a ramp to the intersection of the Kingsbury Viaduct (East 34th Street) and Broadway. From there, the CIRR cars traveled along the tracks of Cleveland Railway's Broadway line, using street-running {{for the remainder of the}} trip downtown.|$|R
40|$|Accounting-based {{measures}} of a firm's ex post performance represent accessible, albeit imperfect, surrogates for its internal {{rate of return}} (IRR). Using a cross-sectional data set obtained via computer simulation, this study calculated the error with which the accounting rate of return (ARR) and conditional estimate of internal rate <b>of</b> return (<b>CIRR)</b> estimate IRR. The study compared the error with which both surrogates measure IRR, as well as the ability of growth in unit demand (gD), inventory cost flow assumption (INV) and depreciation method (DEP) to explain the measurement error in both surrogates.
