25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} used to {{transfer}} heat because less high-grade energy is required than is released as heat. Most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment, {{only a fraction of}} which comes from electricity (or some other high-grade energy source required to run a compressor). In electrically-powered heat pumps, the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical power consumed, giving the system a <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> (COP) of 3 or 4, as opposed to a COP of 1 for a conventional electrical resistance heater, in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy.|$|E
25|$|HVAC use of {{a cooling}} tower pairs the cooling tower with a {{water-cooled}} chiller or water-cooled condenser. A ton of air-conditioning {{is defined as the}} removal of 12,000 BTU/hour (3500 W). The equivalent ton on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 BTU/hour (4400 W) due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller's compressor. This equivalent ton is defined as the heat rejection in cooling 3 US gallons/minute (1,500 pound/hour) of water 10°F (6°C), which amounts to 15,000 BTU/hour, assuming a chiller <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> (COP) of 4.0. This COP is equivalent to an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 14.|$|E
25|$|A {{refrigeration}} system's <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> (CoP) is {{very important}} in determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use performance factor (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It {{is important to note that}} both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system's performance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a <b>performance</b> comparison <b>of</b> four different configurations for absorption cooling systems operating with water-lithium bromide mixture. The configurations are: i) single effect, ii) half effect, iii) double effect in series, and iv) double effect inverse. Every system {{is described in}} detail and a mathematical model was developed for each one <b>of</b> them. <b>Coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> and flow ratios are reported for the systems as function of their main operating temperatures, such as: generation, absorption, condensation, and evaporation. From the results analysis regarding to evaporation temperatures, this mixture is easily associated with air-conditioning applications. It is seen that the single effect obtains theoretical <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> up to 0. 89 at generation temperatures between 100 °C and 110 °C. On the other hand, {{it was observed that}} half effect systems may operate with generation temperatures from 55 °C, but obtaining <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> almost half <b>of</b> those obtained with single effect systems. Finally, it was found that double effect systems are the most efficient, reaching <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> up to 1. 48, however, they are more complex and require generation temperatures as high as 158 °C. It is important to mention that half effect systems work better than any other when condensation and absorptions temperatures are as high as 40 °C...|$|R
2500|$|When {{comparing}} {{the performance of}} heat pumps, {{it is best to}} avoid the word [...] "efficiency", which has a very specific thermodynamic definition. The term <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> (COP) is used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input. Most vapor-compression heat pumps use electrically powered motors for their work input.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the twentieth century, the vapor {{absorption}} cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used. [...] After the development of the vapor compression cycle, the vapor absorption cycle lost much of its importance because of its low <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Today, the vapor absorption cycle is used mainly where fuel for heating is available but electricity is not, such as in recreational vehicles that carry LP gas. [...] It is also used in industrial environments where plentiful waste heat overcomes its inefficiency.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{essential}} that the refrigerant reach a sufficiently high temperature, when compressed, to release heat through the [...] "hot" [...] heat exchanger (the condenser). Similarly, the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand, or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger (the evaporator). In particular, the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the required pressure difference, and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid. Thus, as with all heat pumps, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> (amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required) decreases with increasing temperature difference.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "power coefficient" [...] Cp (= P/Pwind) has {{a maximum}} value of: Cp.max = 16/27 = 0.593 (or 59.3%; however, <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> are usually {{expressed}} as a decimal, not a percentage).|$|R

Precipitation, stream discharge, surface runoff, and suspended sediment concentrations were monitored for rainfall-runoff events occurring from 1994 - 1996, inclusive. Data describing stream patterns, topography, soil type, and land use were collected and input to the model. Seven rainfall-runoff events were used for model calibration. Five storms were used to validate the model. Calibration curves were developed to correlate the antecedent precipitation index (AP 1) to the SCS curve number. For model calibration, <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> 0. 12, 0. 05, and 0. 43 were obtained for peak flow, surface runoff, and sediment yield, respectively.

2500|$|However, recent {{technical}} advances {{allow the}} use of natural heat pump refrigerants that have very low global warming potential (GWP). CO2 refrigerant (R744, GWP=1) or ammonia (R717, GWP=0) also have the benefit, depending on operating conditions, of resulting in higher heat pump efficiency than conventional refrigerants. An example is a 14 MW(thermal) district heating network in Drammen, Norway which is supplied by seawater-source heatpumps that use R717 refrigerant, and has been operating since 2011. 90°C water is delivered to the district loop (and returns at 65°C). Heat is extracted from seawater (from [...] depth) that is 8 to 9°C all year round, giving an average <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> (COP) of about 3.15. In the process the seawater is chilled to 4°C; however, this resource is not utilized. In a district system where the chilled water could be utilized for air conditioning, the effective COP would be considerably higher.|$|E
2500|$|Fuel {{switching}} on the demand side refers to changing {{the type of}} fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. [...] To meet deep decarbonization goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed. Energy efficiency alone may {{not be sufficient to}} meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions. Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning coal. [...] There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric heat pump has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> of heat pumps.|$|E
