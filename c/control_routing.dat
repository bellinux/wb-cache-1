This letter presents a joint crosslayer optimization approach, i. e., joint medium access <b>control,</b> <b>routing,</b> and energy distribution. User satisfaction represented by user utility is maximized within the required network lifetime, given the {{constraints on the}} total available energy in the network and the minimum user rates.

This paper {{introduces}} PARO, {{a dynamic}} power <b>controlled</b> <b>routing</b> scheme {{that helps to}} minimize the transmission power needed to forward packets between wireless devices in ad hoc networks. Using PARO, one or more intermediate nodes called “redirectors ” elects to forward packets on behalf of source–destination pairs thus reducing the aggregate transmission power consumed by wireless devices. PARO is applicable {{to a number of}} networking environments including wireless sensor networks, home networks and mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper, we present the detailed design of PARO and evaluate the protocol using simulation and experimentation. We show through simulation that PARO is capable of outperforming traditional broadcast-based routing protocols (e. g., MANET routing protocols) due to its energy conserving point-to-point on-demand design. We discuss our experiences from an implementation of the protocol in an experimental wireless testbed using off-the-shelf radio technology.

40|$|Abstract—Connection {{admission}} <b>control</b> and <b>routing</b> are {{two important}} mechanisms {{in the provision}} of quality of service (QoS) in IEEE 802. 16 -based wireless mesh networks. In this paper, we propose a joint admission <b>control</b> and <b>routing</b> scheme for multiple service classes with the objective to maximize the overall revenue from all carried connections. QoS constraints such as handoff dropping probability can be guaranteed. Multiple service classes can be prioritized by imposing different reward rates. We formulate the problem as a decision process, and apply optimization techniques to obtain the optimal admission control policies. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by numerical and simulation results. We show that the proposed joint admission <b>control</b> and <b>routing</b> scheme can produce maximum revenue obtainable by the system under QoS constraints. We also show that the optimal joint admission control policy is a randomized policy, i. e., connections are admitted to the system with some probabilities when the system is in some states.

Distributed network algorithms where joint power <b>control</b> and <b>routing</b> are performed on a node-by-node basis are presented. We show that with appropriately chosen parameters, these algorithms iteratively converge to the global optimum from any initial point with finite cost. We then extend the results to wireless networks with more general coding/modulation schemes where the physical-layer achievable rate region is given by an arbitrary convex set, and the link costs are quasi-convex. Finally, we demonstrate that congestion control can be seamlessly incorporated into our framework, so that algorithms developed for power <b>control</b> and <b>routing</b> can naturally be extended to optimize user input rates...|$|R
