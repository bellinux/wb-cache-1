25|$|Hip {{prosthesis}} dislocation mostly {{occur in}} the first 3 months after insertion, mainly because of incomplete scar formation and relaxed soft tissues. It takes eight to twelve weeks for the soft tissues injured or cut during surgery to heal. During this period, the hip ball <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the socket. The chance of this is diminished if less tissue is cut, if the tissue cut is repaired and if large diameter head balls are used.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} some {{problems}} using disc brakes with certain frame designs. Under hard braking, the front wheel <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> from the dropouts. The problem has occurred when the brake pads and dropouts are aligned so the brake reaction force tends to eject the wheel from the dropout. Under repeated hard braking, the axle moves in the dropout {{in a way that}} unscrews the quick release. Riders should make sure the skewers are properly tightened before riding. Forks that use different brake/dropout orientations or through-axles are not subject to this problem.|$|E

The district also accommodates a huge variety of birds such as birds of prey, guineafowl, partridges, herons etc. Hares, wild boar, monkeys and other rodents are occasionally found in the wooded savanna.|$|E

He hoped that the tragedy would also be an opportunity to improve the tone of our national dialogue and cool down the rhetoric.

[...] Beat Instrumental concluded their review by stating [...] "It's true to say that the Byrds are one of the two best groups in the world. Nobody can say any different with the proof of this album." ...|$|E

In order to safeguard the earth, the theoretical 1 Gt device would weigh about 25–30 tons, hence light enough to be lifted on the [...] Russian Energia rocket {{and it could be}} used to instantaneously vaporize a 1km asteroid, divert the paths of extinction event class asteroids (greater than 10km in diameter) within a few months of short notice, while with 1-year notice, at an interception location no closer than Jupiter, it would also be capable of dealing with the even rarer short period comets which <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the Kuiper belt and transit past Earth orbit within 2 years. For comets of this class, with a maximum estimated 100km diameter, Charon served as the hypothetical threat.|$|E

500|$|Alucard {{appears in}} the sequel [...] as a {{supporting}} character. Since the game takes place centuries later, Alucard's personality and standing towards his father has drastically changed. He believes that Dracula can still be redeemed and makes it his goal to free the world from tyranny and vanquish the evil that had corrupted him and his father. He concocts a centuries spanning plan to put his father {{into a deep sleep}} by piercing his heart with the Crissaegrim sword, in order to make both the lord of the dead, Zobek and Satan himself, believe that Dracula is dead, so they <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> in the open. Once they do, Alucard would remove the sword so Dracula can resurrect and then destroy Zobek and Satan for good. Dracula agrees with his son's plan and awakens centuries later during modern times. Throughout the game Alucard also appears as a younger Trevor Belmont and guides Dracula through his Castle to help him recover his old powers and missing memories. In order to not draw suspicion to his plan, Alucard masquerades himself as Zobek's Lieutenant and eventually reveals his true identity to his father once he remembers their pact. They destroy Zobek and Satan and appear to be on good terms in the end. Alucard is also the protagonist of the DLC Revelations, taking place shortly prior to the events of the game.|$|E

[...] The sentiment was echoed by Slate writer Aisha Harris who weighed heavily upon importance of the death and its impact saying that despite the show’s ensemble cast, [...] "Meredith has always remained the central figure of Grey’s, so this death marks a very important turning point in the show".

2500|$|The 2011/12 season saw Sammy improve as a batsman: in {{the series}} against India and Australia Sammy scored over 100runs, which he had not done {{previously}} in a Test series. This trend continued when the West Indies toured England in May 2012. Sammy began the series with scores of 17 and 37 in the first Test at Lord's, during which he passed 3,000runs in first-class cricket. In the following Test, in his 26th Test, Sammy registered his maiden Test century. It was just the seventh time a number eight batsman had scored a century for the West Indies. Sammy partnered Marlon Samuels in a 204-run stand, the second-highest for the West Indies' seventh wicket. The West Indies lost the Test and drew the next one to lose the series 2–0; Sammy finished with 201runs from five innings and was his team's third highest run-scorer {{in the series}} while his six wickets cost 48.50runs each.• Commenting on Sammy's performance in the series, former West Indies captain Viv Richards said [...] "All {{of a sudden there}} was this new-found confidence.
