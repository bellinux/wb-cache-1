In 2007, the government investigated and charged 62 persons with trafficking. The government reported at least 23 trafficking convictions in 2007. Trials often last months or years, and convicted traffickers often delay serving their sentences, sometimes by several years, by filing multiple appeals.

Qatar expert Olivier Da Lage said: “When he came to power in 1995, Sheikh Hamad had a goal to place Qatar on the world map by exploiting the gas resources which his father did not develop for fear it would change the emirate's society.

40|$|Abstract. Trends in chip {{technology}} and system design are causing {{a revolution in}} highperformance computing. The emergence of multicore processor chips, the construction of very large computing systems, and the increasing {{need to deal with}} power and energy issues in these systems are three of the most significant changes. We focus on the way that these trends have created a new set of challenges in the area of performance engineering, the measurement, analysis, and tuning of computing systems and applications. We discuss these changes and outline recent work at the Renaissance Computing Institute to meet these challenges. 1. Trends in high-performance computing As it has over its entire brief history, computing technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Since the emergence of microprocessor-based clusters, this has generally been felt as incremental improvements in single-thread performance. Recently, however, several trends are introducing qualitative changes, especially in high-performance computing. Instead of <b>continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>exploit</b> increased clock rates, and an increased degree of implicit, instruction level parallelism (ILP), the improved performance of the current generation of chips comes from increased explicit, multi-core, and multi-thread parallelism...|$|E

LIDARs on these satellites will transmit short, high-peak power pulses to obtain adequate detection sensitivity and resolution. The disadvantages of high-eak power transmitters are that they require high-current power supplies and have low PRFs and limited lifetime. At The University of Kansas we are developing a pulse compression LIDAR featuring reduced peak power requirements and increased PRF to obtain more dense sampling. We have developed and have reported (IGARSS' 99) [1] 1550 -nm fiber-optic based, coherent laser radar (lidar) that uses traditional RF pulse compression and digital signal processing techniques to enhance its range measurement capability. We have since migrated the wavelength to 1310 nm to improve the sensitivity to snow and ice while <b>continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>exploit</b> the commercially available fiber-optic components such as distributed-feedback (DFB) lasers, modulators, and praseodymium-doped flouride fiber amplifiers (PDFFAs).

Past research on models incorporating component substitutions focuses on the benefits from reduced safety-stock requirements. This paper addresses a dynamic requirements-planning problem for two-stage multi product manufacturing systems with bill-of-materials flexibility, i. e., with options to use substitute components or subassemblies produced by an upstream stage to meet demand in each period at the downstream stage. We model the problem as an integer program, and describe a dynamic-programming solution method to find the production and substitution quantities that satisfy given multi period downstream demands at minimum total setup, production, conversion, and holding cost. This methodology {{can serve as a}} module in requirements-planning systems to plan opportunistic component substitutions based on relative future demands and production costs. Computational results using real data from an aluminum-tube manufacturer show that substitution can save, on average, 8. 7 % of manufacturing cost. We also apply the model to random problems with a simple product structure to develop insights regarding substitution behavior and impacts. inventory-production: applications, inventory-production: scale-economies-lot sizing, inventory-production: deterministic, network-graphs: applications...|$|E
40|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} of human predation pressures on shellfish usually rely on measurements of complete shell specimens. However, most archaeological shell assemblages consist predominantly of broken shells, limiting measurable sample sizes, and thus potentially biasing results {{in cases where}} shell fragmentation is biased towards particular size classes (due to shell size-fragility correspondences). This paper presents a recent application of morphometric analyses on the Batissa violacea assemblage from Emo, an early ceramic site from the Gulf Province, Papua New Guinea. Our method enabled most shell valves, fragmented or not, to be accurately and comparably measured for size. The results reveal a close match between the commencement of occupation and maximum shell sizes in a sequence of occupational phases, each separated by many decades to hundreds of years of site abandonment. While each occupational phase begins with peak mean shell sizes, the later peaks never again attain the mean shell size of the initial phase. As each phase progresses, shell sizes diminish until abandonment, and then the same pattern starts again with the next phase. Identical trends were obtained from two separate excavation squares. We interpret these results to indicate that while people may have abandoned the site of Emo between the occupational phases, they did not abandon the region, <b>continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>exploit</b> local shellfish beds, albeit less frequently than during the site’s occupation. These results highlight the ability of local (site-specific) archaeological shell data {{to shed light on}} regional demographic and occupational trends...|$|E
