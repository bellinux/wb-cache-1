The analysis of social characteristics shows that evaluation of subjective loudness is influenced by income and occupation, with correlation <b>coefficients</b> or <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 0. 10 to 0. 40 (p< 0. 05 or p< 0. 01). Meanwhile, evaluation of acoustic comfort evaluation is influenced by income, education level, and occupation, with correlation <b>coefficients</b> or <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 0. 10 to 0. 60 (p< 0. 05 or p< 0. 01). The effect of gender and age on evaluation of subjective loudness and acoustic comfort is statistically insignificant. The effects of occupation are mainly caused by the differences in income and education level, in which the effects of income are greater than that of education level. In terms of behavioural characteristics, evaluation of subjective loudness is influenced by the reason for visit, frequency of visit, and length of stay, with correlation <b>coefficients</b> or <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 0. 10 to 0. 40 (p< 0. 05 or p< 0. 01). Evaluation of acoustic comfort is influenced by the reason for visit to the site, the frequency of visit, length of stay, and also season of visit, with correlation coefficients of 0. 10 to 0. 30 (p< 0. 05 or p< 0. 01). In particular, users who are waiting for someone show lower evaluation of acoustic comfort, whereas users who go to shopping malls more than once a month show higher evaluation of acoustic comfort. On the contrary, the influence of the period of visit and the accompanying persons are found insignificant. ...|$|R

In total, 235 product names registered in the database for cheeses and cheese products were analyzed according to type of label and country of origin. To discover a dependences between the variables, χ 2 test and <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficients</b> were calculated. Hierarchical clustering method enabled to identify the clusters of countries with similar distribution of products in the database. Findings – More than 80 percent of cheeses and cheese products are certified with PDO. Leading countries in number of certified products are France and Italy. Taking into account all product classes in the database, only 6 percent of all PGIs, 33 percent of PDOs and 15 percent of TSGs were awarded for cheeses and cheese products. A middle weak correlation between the number of certified products and the country of origin was confirmed. Research limitations/implications – The number of certified products is continuously increasing, their distribution between countries may change slightly over time. Only cluster analysis and two criteria of comparison were used. Practical implications – To local food producers, the findings provide a more deep insight to the EU cheese market.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to generate a close-to-reality synthetic human population for use in a geosimulation of urban dynamics. Two commonly accepted approaches to generating synthetic human populations are Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and Resampling with Replacement. While these methods are effective at reproducing one instance of the probability model describing the survey, it is an instance with extremely small variability amongst subgroups and is very unlikely to be the real population. IPF and Resampling with Replacement also rely on pure replication of units from the underlying sample which can increase unrealistic model behavior. In this work we present a sequential logic for estimating variables using multinomial logistic regressions and the conditional probabilities amongst each variable in order to generate combinations which were not represented in the original survey but are likely to occur in the real population. We also present a model based approach to imputing missing observation responses and apply the methodology to the Ghana Living Standard Survey 5 (GLSS 5) in order to generate a comprehensive synthetic population for the Republic of Ghana, including such household and person variables as household size, tribal aliation, educational attainment and annual income, amongst others.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} some of the factors from childhood experience which might contribute to the kind of church attendance practices which individuals adopt as adults. The factors chosen for investigation were enforced church attendance in childhood, parental church attendance practices, the kind of discipline employed in the parental home, and the theological position of the church attended in childhood. The five specific hypotheses which were tested were: 1. There is no relationship between parentally enforced church attendance of young children and the church attendance practices which these individuals have as adults. 2. There is no relationship between parental church attendance patterns and the church attendance patterns of their offspring as adults. 3. There is no relationship between parental discipline and adoption of the parents' church attendance habits by the offspring as adults. 4. There is no relationship between the theological position of the church individuals attended as children and the degree of participation in church as adults. 5. There is no significant association among enforced church attendance, parental church attendance, parental discipline, theological position of childhood church, and present adult church attendance practices in the population sampled. Data were obtained through the use of a questionnaire devised by the investigator expressly for this study. The sample consisted of 221 Protestant church members from six churches representing a range of theological positions located in the area in and around Huntington, Long Island, New York. Churches used for this purpose were a Unitarian Fellowship, Episcopalian, two Presbyterian churches, a Missouri Synod Lutheran and an Assembly of God (Pentecostal) church. Subjects were contacted by mail and responded to the questionnaires anonymously. Responses were categorized on a three -by -five table according to the respondents' present church attendance practices (no relationship to a church, casual relationship to a church, active relationship to a liberal, moderate or conservative church) in relation to having been forced or not forced to attend church as children, parental church attendance practices (active, casual, no relationship), type of discipline used in the parental home (strict, moderate, permissive), and theological position of church attended as children (liberal, moderate, conservative, none). Chi - square tests of independence were performed on the data on each of the past experience variables in relation to present church attendance practices. <b>Contingency</b> <b>coefficients</b> were then computed for each of the past experience variables in relation to each other and in relation to the present church attendance variable. On the basis of these coefficients, degree of association among the variables could be determined. No relationship was found between parentally enforced church attendance and the church attendance practices of individuals as adults. However, a relationship was found to exist between parental church attendance and adult church attendance, and when parentally enforced church attendance was considered together with parental church attendance practices it was found that combined they have a relationship to adult church attendance which is highly significant. A relationship was found to exist between parental discipline and adult church attendance practices which i s most apparent along the dimension of strict parental discipline in that individuals reared in strict homes tend to adopt church attendance practices different from those of their parents. On the basis of the <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficients</b> computed, no direct relationship was found to exist between the theological position of the church attended in childhood and present church attendance practices. However, a very high relationship was found to exist between this factor and parental church attendance, which in turn is related to adult church attendance practices. Present church attendance practices were found to have a relatively low relationship with parental discipline, which in turn has a higher relationship to enforced church attendance in childhood. Enforced church attendance was found to be related in turn to theological position of the church attended in childhood. The only factors which were not directly related to adult church attendance practices were enforced church attendance in childhood and theological position of childhood church. The main value to be derived from this exploratory study lies in its generation of hypotheses for further study, in part due to the fact that the sample is not representative of a well- defined population...|$|R

Global assessment of pillar hyperplasia of the cervical spine {{as a unit}} has not shown a relationship with degenerative joint disease, but a more sensible explanation of the architectural influence of CPH on cervical spine biomechanics may be segment-specific. Objective The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the level of association between degenerative joint disease (DJD) and cervical pillar hyperplasia (CPH) in an age- and gender-matched sample on a [cervical spine] by-level basis. Research Methods Two-hundred and forty radiographs were collected from subjects ranging in age between 40 and 69 years. The two primary outcome measures used in the study were the segmental presence/absence of cervical pillar hyperplasia from C 3 to C 6, and segment-specific presence/absence of degenerative joint disease from C 1 to C 7. <b>Contingency</b> <b>Coefficients,</b> at the 5 % level of significance, at each level, were used to determine the strength of the association between CPH and DJD. Odds Ratios (OR) with their 95 % Confidence Intervals (95 % CI) were also calculated at each level to assess the strength of the association. Results Our study suggests that an approximately two-to-one odds, or a weak-to-moderate correlation, exists at C 4 and C 5 CPH and adjacent level degenerative disc disease (DDD); with the strongest (overall) associations demonstrated between C 4 CPH and C 4 – 5 DDD and between C 5 CPH and C 5 – 6 DDD. Age-stratified results demonstrated a similar pattern of association, even reaching the initially hypothesized OR ≥ 5. 0 (95 % CI > 1. 0) or "moderately-strong correlation of C ≥. 4 (p ≤. 05) " in some age categories, including the 40 – 44, 50 – 59, and 60 – 64 years of age subgroups; these ORs were as follows: OR = 5. 5 (95 % CI 1. 39 – 21. 59); OR = 6. 7 (95 % CI 1. 65 – 27. 34); and OR = 5. 3 (95 % CI 1. 35 – 21. 14), respectively. Conclusion Our results suggest that CPH has around two-to-one odds, that is, only a weak-to-moderate association with the presence of DJD (DDD component) at specific cervical spine levels; therefore, CPH may be but one of several factors that contributes (to a clinically important degree) to the development of DJD at specific levels in the cervical spine. </p...|$|R

Results analyzed with a <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficient</b> and biserial correlation indicated that not all number one ranked goals had the same value for a particular adolescent, and that number one ranked goals were correlated with verbal reports of concrete actions directed at achieving those goals...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of using component analysis for nominal data is discussed. Particularly, two nominal scale correlation coefficients are applicable, namely, Tschuprow’s coefficient and the J index. The {{reason is that}} they are E-correlation coefficients; that is, they satisfy the requirements of a scalar product between normalized vectors in a Euclidean space. Some characteristics of these coefficients are described. The <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficient</b> and Cramer’s V are shown not to be applicable in a component analysis. An example of a truncated component analysis on artificial nominal data is included with both the J index and Tschuprow’s coefficient...|$|E
40|$|In {{a simple}} sense minded {{entrepreneurs}} {{are willing to}} take the risk to start a business in a variety of occasions. Spirited dare to take risks means independent minded and dare to start a business, without overwhelmed with fear or anxiety even under conditions of uncertainty. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the factors of formal education, network of social relationship, and capital can affect entrepreneurial income communities in Malalayang II. Research conducted by using quantitative methods and data retrieval using disproportionate stratified random sampling technique with the number of respondents 110 people. Data obtained from the questionnaires were collected from selected respondents. After calculation based on chi-square analysis, obtained three variables that affect entrepreneurial income communities are formal education (x 2 test = 21. 39), network of social relationship (x 2 test = 20. 91) and capital (x 2 test = 24. 38). After that, compared with x 2 table based on the degrees of freedom worth 4 and x 2 table 13. 277. It can be seen that x 2 test > x 2 table. Furthermore, the comparison between the <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficient,</b> formal education (kk = 0. 40), network of social relationship (kk = 0. 40) and capital (kk = 0. 42), with maximum <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Cmax = 0. 80) then obtained correlation is moderate...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the association between}} dental caries, Body Mass Index (BMI) and sugar intake in children attending primary school. METHODS: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted with}} 91 children, with mean age of 3. 9 years (sd = &# 177; 1. 0), considering anthropometric measurements, according to standardized methodology of the Ministry of Health and occurrence of dental caries was recorded from clinical examinations (dmft). The sugar intake level was measured with a questionnaire that was applied to parents/caretakers of the children. The association of the variables was checked using a correlation with the <b>Contingency</b> C <b>coefficient</b> test. RESULTS: 33 (36. 3 %) children were at risk for overweight, overweight or obese. Of these, 10 (30. 3 %) had dmft > 1. An association was found between sugar added to the bottle and child dmft (coeff. C = 0. 5853 and p < 0. 0001) and also with BMI (coeff. C = 0. 5693 and p < 0. 0001). There was no association between BMI and caries (chi-square = 0. 1447 and p-value = 0. 7036). CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that there was a correlation between sugar intake and dmft and BMI, but not between caries and BMI...|$|R
40|$|Background: Social media {{platforms}} such as Twitter {{are rapidly}} becoming key resources {{for public health}} surveillance applications, yet {{little is known about}} Twitter users' levels of informedness and sentiment toward tobacco, especially with regard to the emerging tobacco control challenges posed by hookah and electronic cigarettes. Objective: To develop a content and sentiment analysis of tobacco-related Twitter posts and build machine learning classifiers to detect tobacco-relevant posts and sentiment towards tobacco, with a particular focus on new and emerging products like hookah and electronic cigarettes. Methods: We collected 7362 tobacco-related Twitter posts at 15 -day intervals from December 2011 to July 2012. Each tweet was manually classified using a triaxial scheme, capturing genre, theme, and sentiment. Using the collected data, machine-learning classifiers were trained to detect tobacco-related vs irrelevant tweets as well as positive vs negative sentiment, using Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Finally, phi <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficients</b> were computed between each of the categories to discover emergent patterns. Results: The most prevalent genres were first- and second-hand experience and opinion, and the most frequent themes were hookah, cessation, and pleasure. Sentiment toward tobacco was overall more positive (1939 / 4215, 46 % of tweets) than negative (1349 / 4215, 32 %) or neutral among tweets mentioning it, even excluding the 9 % of tweets categorized as marketing. Three separate metrics converged to support an emergent distinction between, on one hand, hookah and electronic cigarettes corresponding to positive sentiment, and on the other hand, traditional tobacco products and more general references corresponding to negative sentiment. These metrics included correlations between categories in the annotation scheme (phihookah-positive= 0. 39; phie-cigs-positive= 0. 19); correlations between search keywords and sentiment (χ 2 4 = 414. 50, P <. 001, Cramer's V= 0. 36), and the most discriminating unigram features for positive and negative sentiment ranked by log odds ratio in the machine learning component of the study. In the automated classification tasks, SVMs using {{a relatively small number of}} unigram features (500) achieved best performance in discriminating tobacco-related from unrelated tweets (F score= 0. 85). Conclusions: Novel insights available through Twitter for tobacco surveillance are attested through the high prevalence of positive sentiment. This positive sentiment is correlated in complex ways with social image, personal experience, and recently popular products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. Several apparent perceptual disconnects between these products and their health effects suggest opportunities for tobacco control education. Finally, machine classification of tobacco-related posts shows a promising edge over strictly keyword-based approaches, yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio in Twitter data and paving the way for automated tobacco surveillance applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} the proportion of unsuccessful projects {{in the development of}} new products, managers have become concerned in understanding which factors {{have an impact on the}} success or failure of new products. A research area in new product development (NPD) management is useful to identify success factors, i. e., description of practices related to product development that, when well carried out, help to reduce the unsuccessful rate when launching new products. Relevant works (GRIFFIN, 1997; SOUDER et al., 1997; ERNEST, 2002; ROZENFELD et al. 2006) identify characteristics of the product/project that impel it towards success. The aim of this paper is to identify and analyze the critical success factors (CSF) when developing new products in High-Technology Small Firms (HTSF). As these firms exist in various industrial sectors in Brazil and because the specificity of technologies and markets can influence the structuring and management of NPD in these firms, the present research focuses on two sectors: medical and hospital equipment and process control automation. The data was obtained through a survey in 62 high technology small firms of these sectors, in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. This has resulted in a sample of 62 new product projects considered successful (one of each company) and 42 unsuccessful (20 companies did not submit information of the unsuccessful specific cases), from the firms point of view. As research procedure, the companies were asked to select two development projects in the last five years, one successful and the other unsuccessful. The questionnaire was structured based on eleven factors, deployment in 64 variables. When dealing with the data, statistical techniques were applied in the analysis. The association of the 64 investigated variables with the project result (successful or unsuccessful) was measured through their respective <b>contingency</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Thus, we sought to determine which variables, considered in isolation, could explain a new products success or unsuccess. We also tried to reduce and summarize the individual variables by using factorial analysis techniques. By applying the factorial analysis, three main components were associated to new product success: target-market characteristics, execution quality of NPD activities and integration between the areas involved in NPD. In the component target market characteristics, the pre-development activities are highlighted. In successful projects, the customers requirements are well met and correctly translated into specifications. In addition to this, market research is well carried out by customer demand for the new product. The proficiency of the technical development activities was pointed out as a determining factor for success. The component integration between the areas is managed in order to stimulate the best integration possible, especially in the pre-development activities. Pages: 722 - 73...|$|R
