When calculated according to dry matter intake of the cows, mean percentages of GHG emissions from enteric fermentation on organic or conventional farms were 31 or 42 % from the complete product related emissions from milk production from <b>cradle</b> <b>to</b> farm <b>gate,</b> respectively. When feed quality parameters were considered in calculation, enteric methane production increased considerably with higher fibre contents in feedstuffs.

On the 44 farms that were analysed, minimal potential GHG emissions from enteric fermentation on the herd level were 0. 39 (organic farm) and 0. 32 kg CO 2 eq kg ECM- 1 (conventional farm). This is proposed as unavoidable range for milk from intensive conventional and organic dairy production. GHG emissions from replacement animals and from feedstuff production {{are also part of}} the dairy systems.

However, {{the assessment of the}} latter, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), is a time-consuming and complex task. To establish a simplified approach, especially relevant for certification incentives, as an alternative to a full LCA, we first highlight key parameters in resource use of the system to provide {{a better understanding of the}} variability in LCA results, and second present inferred equations that allow for an easy estimation of the resource footprint using some of these key parameters. A representative sample of 10 certified (i. e., ASC and GLOBALG. A. P.) and 10 non-certified intensive Pangasius farms in the Mekong Delta was investigated. Detailed LCA results, resulting in resource consumption in terms of the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from Natural Environment (CEENE), showed that pond water renewal and feed production, particularly agriculture-based feed ingredients, were the hotspots. Inferred equations, in fact linear regression models, were successfully set up and have proven to be useful to estimate the resource footprint of Pangasius feeds and aquaculture using parameters identified as the resource use hotspots. The CEENE over the <b>cradle</b> <b>to</b> feed mill <b>gate</b> per tonne feed could be predicted from the mass share of agriculture-based ingredients (R 2 ≥ 0. 90, n = 12 feeds). The CEENE over the <b>cradle</b> <b>to</b> farm <b>gate</b> per tonne Pangasius fish in the certified farms and/or non-certified farms can be explained by the amount of water and feed inputs (R 2 ≥ 0. 98, n = 20 farms), which highlights the relevance of managing these resources in intensive Pangasius farming, and subsequent equations were also set up. </p...|$|R

The additional 95 % confidence interval on an individual farm footprint is less than 10 %. Feed efficiency and manure management are key determinants of the footprint per kg milk.

40|$|Purpose A {{renewable}} thermoplastic called Novatein Thermoplastic Protein (NTP) {{has been}} developed from blood meal—a low-value by-product of the meat processing industry. The aim {{of this research was}} to develop a non-renewable energy and greenhouse gas emission eco-profile for <b>cradle</b> <b>to</b> <b>gate</b> production of NTP. Environmental impacts of supplying blood meal as a raw material were investigated using different allocation methods for farming and blood meal production. These included mass, economic, treating low-value by-products as waste and system expansion by substitution. In part 2, the entire system will be analysed on a <b>cradle</b> <b>to</b> <b>gate</b> basis and include the production of thermoplastic (NTP). Methods A theoretical NTP production facility was analysed for non-renewable primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Data for feedstocks and process steps were obtained from published papers, government agency reports and engineering models. Mass and economic allocation models treating low-value by-products as waste and substitution were applied, and a sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the impact of different methods of allocation on environmental impact. Results and discussion Non-renewable energy use in blood meal production varied between 5 (substitution) and 38 MJ (simple mass allocation) per kg of NTP. Greenhouse gas emissions varied between 0. 4 (substitution), or even less if the biogenic carbon content is considered a credit, and 14 kg (mass allocation) CO 2 e per kg NTP. Conclusions It was concluded that both mass allocation and a waste assumption should be considered for the <b>cradle</b> <b>to</b> <b>gate</b> system. Mass allocation is common in other attributional studies and allows for a more transparent comparison. The most appropriate treatment of allocation in an attributional profile was to consider blood as a waste with regard to farming and meat processing, but include blood drying. This takes into account the motivations for farming and meat processing, but also recognises that there are other treatment options for blood that do not produce blood meal used in manufacturing NTP. This would allow NTP to be compared to other bioplastics as well as identifying hot spots in its <b>cradle</b> <b>to</b> <b>gate</b> production.

Today, the man-made cellulose fibre industry is the worldwide second largest biorefinery (next to the paper industry). In the last few years, the interest in man-made cellulose fibres has grown as a consequence of increased environmental awareness and the depletion of fossil fuels. However, an environmental assessment of modern man-made cellulose fibres has not been conducted so far. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the environmental impact of man-made cellulose fibres. Five staple fibre products, i. e., 1) Lenzing Viscose Asia, 2) Lenzing Viscose Austria, 3) Lenzing Modal, 4) Tencel Austria, and 5) Tencel Austria 2012, are analysed by means of Life cycle assessment (LCA). The system boundary is <b>cradle</b> <b>to</b> factory <b>gate.</b> We compare the results with conventional cotton, novel bio-based fibres (PLA fibres), and fossil fuel-based fibres (PET and PP). The inventory data for the {{production of}} man-made cellulose fibres were provided by Lenzing AG. The inventory data for cotton, PET, PP, and PLA were obtained from literature sources. The environmental indicators analysed include resources and the impact categories covered by CML 2000 baseline method. The indicators for resources include non-renewable energy use (NREU), renewable energy use (REU), cumulative energy demand (CED), water use, and land use. The environmental impact indicators covered by the CML method are global warming potential (GWP) 100 a, abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, acidification, and eutrophication. In addition, the system boundary of <b>cradle</b> <b>to</b> factory <b>gate</b> plus end-of-life waste management was analysed for NREU and GWP. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses have been carried out to understand the influence of various assumptions and allocation methods. The LCA results show that Lenzing Viscose Austria and Lenzing Modal offer environmental benefits in all categories (except for land use and water use) compared to Lenzing Viscose Asia. Tencel Austria 2012, Lenzing Viscose Austria, Lenzing Modal, and Tencel Austria are the most favourable choices from an environmental point of view among all the fibres studied. These four man-made cellulose fibres offer important benefits for reducing NREU, GWP, toxicity impacts, water use, and land use. Lenzing Viscose Asia has higher impacts than the other man-made cellulose fibres with regard to NREU, GWP, abiotic depletion, photochemical oxidation, and acidification.
