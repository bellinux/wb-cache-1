5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} cimetidine causes {{an increase}} in the plasma concentration of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the <b>cationic</b> (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other <b>cationic</b> medications may produce the same effect.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the uranyl salts {{of uranium}} and polyatomic ion uranium-oxide <b>cationic</b> forms, the uranates, salts {{containing}} a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion, {{are generally not}} water-soluble.|$|E
5|$|Anhydrous iron(III) {{chloride}} adopts the BiI3 structure, {{which features}} octahedral Fe(III) centres interconnected by two-coordinate chloride ligands. Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate consists of trans-+ <b>cationic</b> complexes and chloride anions, {{with the remaining}} two H2O molecules embedded within the monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|Extensions of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} {{are generally}} also subsumed {{under the same}} name. For example, an α-β, γ-δ unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar <b>cationic</b> conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso-Nazarov cyclization reaction. Other such extensions have been given similar names, including homo-Nazarov cyclizations and vinylogous Nazarov cyclizations.|$|E
5|$|The three {{fluorides}} {{of chlorine}} form {{a subset of}} the interhalogen compounds, all of which are diamagnetic. Some <b>cationic</b> and anionic derivatives are known, such as , , , and Cl2F+. Some pseudohalides of chlorine are also known, such as cyanogen chloride (ClCN, linear), chlorine cyanate (ClNCO), chlorine thiocyanate (ClSCN, unlike its oxygen counterpart), and chlorine azide (ClN3).|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} described, the Nazarov cyclization {{involves the}} activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic acid promoter. The key {{step of the}} reaction mechanism involves a <b>cationic</b> 4π-electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product (See Mechanism below). As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway.|$|E
5|$|By extension, any pentadienyl cation {{regardless}} of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization. There have been {{a large number of}} examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements. One such example involves the silver catalyzed <b>cationic</b> ring opening of allylic dichloro cylopropanes. The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo <b>cationic</b> cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form {{complete}} series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds {{can be described}} as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as <b>cationic</b> and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series NaCl, Na2O, Na2S, Na3P, Na3As, Na3Sb, Na3Bi, Na.|$|E
5|$|A {{nitrogen}} atom {{has seven}} electrons. In the ground state, they {{are arranged in}} the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It therefore has five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It {{has one of the}} highest electronegativities among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by chlorine (3.16), oxygen (3.44), and fluorine (3.98). Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 71pm is smaller than those of boron (84pm) and carbon (76pm), while it is larger than those of oxygen (66pm) and fluorine (57pm). The nitride anion, N3−, is much larger at 146pm, similar to that of the oxide (O2−: 140pm) and fluoride (F−: 133pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920MJ·mol−1. Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple <b>cationic</b> chemistry.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with the major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and nonmetals, there is some variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the monatomic nonmetals, radon is the most metallic and begins to show some <b>cationic</b> behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{the first}} of the {{transition}} metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of +8, although its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium can, with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium. Ruthenium exhibits an aqueous <b>cationic</b> chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron, but osmium does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes. In fact, in this second half of the 3d transition series, vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors cobalt and nickel in the periodic table, which are also ferromagnetic at room temperature and share similar chemistry. As such, iron, cobalt, and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the iron triad.|$|E
5|$|The episode filmed {{for eight}} days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and drops {{it onto a}} horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing <b>cationic</b> polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant <b>cationic</b> chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E
25|$|The 1- and 3-aza-Cope rearrangements are obscure in {{comparison}} to the <b>cationic</b> 2-aza-Cope rearrangement due to their activation energies, which are comparatively much higher than that of the <b>cationic</b> 2-aza-Cope rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|The second {{route is}} {{ring-opening}} polymerization of laurolactam at 260-300˚C. Ring opening {{can be carried}} out by <b>cationic</b> or anionic initiators, although <b>cationic</b> initiators have not been used commercially due to the product being less stable and oxidized relatively quickly in comparison to those produced by activated anionic polymerization (monomer casting). Ring-opening polymerization is the preferred route for commercial production.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the first}} studies on the cation-π {{interaction}} involved looking at the interactions of charged, nitrogenous molecules in cyclophane host-guest chemistry. It was found that even when anionic solubilizing groups were appended to aromatic host capsules, <b>cationic</b> guests preferred to associate with the π-system in many cases. The type of host shown to the right was also able to catalyze N-alkylation reactions to form <b>cationic</b> products.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{on larger}} data sets found similar trends, {{including}} some dramatic arrays of alternating stacks of <b>cationic</b> and aromatic side chains. In {{some cases the}} N-H hydrogens were aligned toward aromatic residues, and in others the <b>cationic</b> moiety was stacked above the π system. A particularly strong trend was found for close contacts between Arg and Trp. The guanidinium moiety of Arg in particular has a high propensity to be stacked on top of aromatic residues while also hydrogen-bonding with nearby oxygen atoms.|$|E
25|$|Any {{positively}} charged protein will {{be attracted to}} a negatively charged membrane by nonspecific electrostatic interactions. However, not all peripheral peptides and proteins are <b>cationic,</b> and only certain sides of membrane are negatively charged. These include the cytoplasmic side of plasma membranes, the outer leaflet of outer bacterial membranes and mitochondrial membranes. Therefore, electrostatic interactions {{play an important role}} in membrane targeting of electron carriers such as cytochrome c, <b>cationic</b> toxins such as charybdotoxin, and specific membrane-targeting domains such as some PH domains, C1 domains, and C2 domains.|$|E
25|$|Products are {{supplied}} {{most commonly}} in formulations of 120, 240, 360, 480, and 680g/l of active ingredient. The most common formulation in agriculture is 360g/l, either {{alone or with}} added <b>cationic</b> surfactants.|$|E
25|$|PCC also {{converts}} suitable unsaturated alcohols and aldehydes to cyclohexenones. This pathway, an oxidative <b>cationic</b> cyclization, {{is illustrated}} by the conversion of (−)-citronellol to (−)-pulegone. PCC also effects allylic oxidations, for example, in conversion of dihydrofurans to furanones.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} that cation–π interactions {{played a role}} in protein structure was the observation that in crystallographic data, aromatic side chains appear in close contact with nitrogen-containing side chains (which can exist as protonated, <b>cationic</b> species) with disproportionate frequency.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Corey {{commenced}} detailed {{studies on}} <b>cationic</b> polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of cholesterol from simpler plant terpenes. Corey established {{the details of}} the remarkable cylization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene.|$|E
25|$|Attaching ionic ligands to {{nanoparticles}} allows {{control over}} enzyme activity. An example of enzyme inhibition {{is given by}} binding of a-chymotrypsin (ChT), an enzyme with a largely <b>cationic</b> active site. When a-chymotrypsin is incubated with anionic (negatively charged) nanoparticles, ChT activity is inhibited as anionic nanoparticles bind to the active site. Enzyme activity can be restored {{by the addition of}} <b>cationic</b> surfactants. Alkyl surfactants form a bilayer around ChT, whereas thiol and alcohol surfactants alter the surface of ChT such that interactions with nanoparticles are interrupted. Though formation of a protein-nanoparticle complex can inhibit enzyme activity, studies show that it can also stabilize protein structure, and significantly protect the protein from denaturization.|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic {{interactions}} are strongly {{dependent on the}} ionic strength of the solution. These {{interactions are}} relatively weak at the physiological ionic strength (0.14M NaCl): ~3 to 4 kcal/mol for small <b>cationic</b> proteins, such as cytochrome c, charybdotoxin or hisactophilin.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of halide anion acceptors such as AlBr3, FpX compounds react with alkenes to afford <b>cationic</b> alkene–Fp complexes. In some cases, salts of + are precursors to other Fp–alkene complexes. The exchange process is facilitated {{by the loss of}} gaseous isobutene.|$|E
25|$|Polycyclization enzymes also rely on cation-π interactions. Since proton-triggered polycylizations of {{squalene}} proceed {{through a}} (potentially concerted) <b>cationic</b> cascade, cation-π interactions {{are ideal for}} stabilizing this dispersed positive charge. The crystal structure of squalene-hopene cyclase shows that the active site is lined with aromatic residues.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{factors that are}} closely related to the {{selectivity}} property of antimicrobial peptides, among which the <b>cationic</b> property contributes most. Since the surface of the bacterial membranes is more negatively charged than mammalian cells, antimicrobial peptides will show different affinities towards the bacterial membranes and mammalian cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|This {{limitation}} can {{be overcome}} by polymerizing directly on the surface. This process {{is referred to as}} grafting from, or surface-initiated polymerization (SIP). As the name suggests, the initiator molecules must be immobilized on the solid surface. Like other polymerization methods, SIP can be tailored to follow radical, anionic, or <b>cationic</b> mechanisms and can be controlled utilizing reversible addition transfer polymerization (RAFT), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), or nitroxide-mediated techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of DNA immunization {{can be improved}} by stabilising DNA against degradation, and increasing the {{efficiency of}} delivery of DNA into antigen-presenting cells. This has been demonstrated by coating biodegradable <b>cationic</b> microparticles (such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) formulated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) with DNA. Such DNA-coated microparticles can be as effective at raising CTL as recombinant viruses, especially when mixed with alum. Particles 300nm in diameter appear to be most efficient for uptake by antigen presenting cells.|$|E
25|$|Electron-donating (n-type) dopants {{can also}} be used to create {{conductive}} polyacetylene. n-Type dopants for polyacetylene include lithium, sodium, and potassium. As with p-type dopants, charge-transfer complexes are created, where the polymer backbone is anionic and the donor is <b>cationic.</b> The increase in conductivity upon treatment with an n-type dopant is not as significant as those achieved upon treatment with a p-type dopant. Polyacetylene chains doped with n-type dopants are extremely sensitive to air and moisture.|$|E
25|$|The {{coagulation}} system {{overlaps with}} the immune system. Some {{products of the}} coagulation system {{can contribute to the}} non-specific defenses by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as chemotactic agents for phagocytic cells. In addition, some of the products of the coagulation system are directly antimicrobial. For example, beta-lysine, a protein produced by platelets during coagulation, can cause lysis of many Gram-positive bacteria by acting as a <b>cationic</b> detergent. Many acute-phase proteins of inflammation are involved in the coagulation system.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Calvin {{discovered}} that copper(II) complexes oxidized H2. The 1960s witnessed {{the development of}} well defined homogeneous catalysts using transition metal complexes, e.g., Wilkinson's catalyst (RhCl(PPh3)3). Soon thereafter <b>cationic</b> Rh and Ir were found catalyze the hydrogenation of alkenes and carbonyls. In the 1970s, asymmetric hydrogenation was demonstrated in the synthesis of L-DOPA, and the 1990s saw the invention of Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation. The development of homogeneous hydrogenation was influenced by work started in the 1930s and 1940s on the oxo process and Ziegler–Natta polymerization.|$|E
25|$|In this {{technique}} siRNA first must be designed against the target gene. Once the siRNA is configured against the gene {{it has to}} be effectively delivered through a transfection protocol. Delivery is usually done by <b>cationic</b> liposomes, polymer nanoparticles, and lipid conjugation. This method is advantageous because it can deliver siRNA to most types of cells, has high efficiency and reproducibility, and is offered commercially. The most common commercial reagents for transfection of siRNA are Lipofectamine and Neon Transfection. However it is not compatible with all cell types, and has low in vivo efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The use of cation-pi {{interactions}} {{has also}} been successfully implemented in reactions with synthetic catalysts. A combination of anion-binding and cation-pi strategies {{can be used to}} effect enantioselective <b>cationic</b> polycyclizations. In the transition state, it is proposed that the thiourea group binds chloride, while the aromatic system stabilizes the associated polyene cation. In support of this, increasing the size of the aromatic ring leads to improvements both in yield and stereoselectivity. The enantioselectivity correlates well with both the polarizability and the quadrupole moment of the aryl group.|$|E
25|$|Alginate, carboxymethycellulose, {{polyacrylic}} acid, {{tannic acid}} and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The {{effectiveness of these}} polyelectrolytes depend on the pH of the solution. Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the isoelectric point. <b>Cationic</b> polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using Irish moss.|$|E
