40|$|Engineering {{of cooling}} {{mechanisms}} is a bottleneck in nanoelectronics. Whereas thermal exchanges in diffusive graphene {{are driven by}} defect assisted acoustic phonon scattering (the so-called supercollisions), the case of highmobility graphene on hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) is radically different with a prominent contribution of remote phonons from the substrate. Here, we show that a bi-layer graphene on hBN transistor with local gate can be driven in a very original regime where almost perfect current saturation is achieved by compensation of the decrease of the carrier density and Zener-Klein tunneling (ZKT) at high bias, leading to unprecedented figures for the voltage gain. Using noise thermometry, we show that this Zener-Klein tunneling triggers a new <b>cooling</b> <b>pathway</b> due to the emission of hyperbolic phonons (HPP) in hBN by out-of-equilibrium electron-hole pairs beyond the super-Planckian regime. The combination of ZKT-transport and HPP-cooling promotes graphene on BN transistors as a valuable nanotechnology for power devices and RF electronics. Comment: 15 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

This paper discusses the heating {{generated by the}} gradient coils and proposes an automatic procedure to define the optimal layout of the <b>cooling</b> <b>pathways.</b> The procedure {{is based on an}} integrated magneto-thermal analysis iteratively coupled to a topological optimization routine...|$|R
40|$|Long lifetimes of hot {{carriers}} {{can lead}} to qualitatively new types of responses in materials. The magnitude and time scales for these responses reflect the mechanisms governing energy flows. We examine the microscopics of two processes which are key for energy transport, focusing on the unusual behavior arising due to graphene's unique combination of material properties. One is hot carrier generation in its photoexcitation dynamics, where hot carriers multiply through an Auger type carrier-carrier scattering cascade. The hot-carrier generation manifests itself through elevated electronic temperatures which can be accessed {{in a variety of}} ways, in particular optical conductivity measurements. Another process of high interest is electron-lattice cooling. We survey different <b>cooling</b> <b>pathways</b> and discuss the cooling bottleneck arising for the momentum-conserving electron-phonon scattering pathway. We show how this bottleneck can be relieved by higher-order collisions - supercollisions - and examine the variety of supercollision processes that can occur in graphene.

50|$|Further {{along the}} visitor enters the {{waterfall}} {{area on the}} site of the old quarry. This area is planted densely with tropical character foliage plants to both upper and under stories producing a <b>cool</b> shady <b>pathway</b> to the base of the waterfall. Large stepping stones are used to define the track around the base of the waterfall. A recent addition to the enclosed lawn area to the west of the waterfall is a small rotunda structure used as the focal point for celebrations such as weddings. Further westwards an informal track leads to the Bill Gould Lookout offering views down to the Warrego Highway below. To the south a lighted pathway and stairs, both paved with stone slabs, negotiate a series of low terraced garden beds through the shrubbery border to the enclosed lawn area, eventually leading the visitor along another formed pathway to the top of the old quarry and a viewing platform above the waterfall or across onto the Central Precinct area in the vicinity of the entry traffic island on Tourist Road.|$|R
40|$|Velvet panicum is {{a native}} {{perennial}} bunchgrass. However, the plant’s lifespan {{is considered to be}} short when compared to other perennial plants. It has erect coarse stems up to 4. 5 feet tall. The gray-green stems and leaves are covered with fine hairs. The leaves are. 25 to 1. 0 inch wide which are smaller than broadleaf rosettegrass (D. latifolium) and Bosc’s panicgrass (D. boscii) (USDA-NRCS, 2007 and Grelen, 1984). The plant produces seed in the summer (May to June) and also in the fall. The fall seeds are found within the spikelet sheath. Velvet panicum is considered a C 3 (<b>cool</b> season) photosynthetic <b>pathway</b> plant (Gould, 1978). Velvet panicum is a diploid (2 n = 18). The plant tends to flower later than the other Dichanthelium species if they are present in a stand (Gould, 1978). There are approximately 380, 000 seeds per pound; however, velvet panicum is considered a low volume seed produce...|$|R
40|$|We studied N-(2 -aminoethyl) -N-(4 -(benzyloxy) - 3 -methoxybenzyl) thiophene- 2 -carboxamide {{hydrochloride}} (M 8 -B), {{a selective}} and po-tent antagonist of the transient receptor potential melastatin- 8 (TRPM 8) channel. In vitro, M 8 -B blocked cold-induced and TRPM 8 -agonist-induced activation of rat, human, and murine TRPM 8 channels, including those on primary sensory neurons. In vivo, M 8 -B decreased {{deep body temperature}} (Tb) in Trpm 8 / mice and rats, but not in Trpm 8 / mice, thus suggesting an on-target action. Intravenous administration of M 8 -B was more effective in decreasing Tb in rats than intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administra-tion, indicating a peripheral action. M 8 -B attenuated cold-induced c-Fos expression in the lateral parabrachial nucleus, thus indicating a site of action within the cutaneous <b>cooling</b> neural <b>pathway</b> to thermoeffectors, presumably on sensory neurons. A low intravenous dose ofM 8 -B did not affect Tb at either a constantly high or a constantly low ambient temperature (Ta), but the same dose readily decreased Tb if rats were kept at a high Ta during theM 8 -B infusion and transferred to a low Ta immediately thereafter. These data suggest that both a successful deliveryofM 8 -B to the skin (high cutaneousperfusion) and the activationof cutaneousTRPM 8 channels (by cold) are required for the hypothermic action of M 8 -B. At tail-skin temperatures 23 °C, {{the magnitude of the}} M 8 -B-induced decrease in Tb was inversely related to skin temperature, thus suggesting that M 8 -B blocks thermal (cold) activation of TRPM 8. M 8 -B affected all thermoeffector...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} associated with Pebble Bed and Particle Bed reactor core research has revealed a systemic problem inherent to reactor core concepts which utilize randomized rather than structured coolant channel flow paths. For both the Pebble Bed and Particle Bed Reactor designs; case studies reveal that for indeterminate reasons, regions within the core would suffer from excessive heating leading to thermal runaway and localized fuel melting. A thermal Computational Fluid Dynamics model was utilized to verify that In both the Pebble Bed and Particle Bed Reactor concepts randomized coolant channel pathways combined with localized high temperature regions would work together to resist the flow of coolant diverting it away from where it is needed the most to <b>cooler</b> less resistive <b>pathways</b> where it is needed the least. In other words given the choice via randomized coolant pathways the reactor coolant will take {{the path of least}} resistance, and hot zones offer the highest resistance. Having identified the relationship between randomized coolant channel pathways and localized fuel melting it is now safe to assume that other reactor concepts that utilize randomized coolant pathways such as the foam core reactor are also susceptible to this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional Fourier-transform (2 DFT) {{spectra of}} the D 2 line of {{rubidium}} vapor in argon buffer gas are simulated using a three-dimensional frequency domain solution of Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s equations that treats linear propagation distortions exactly. Simulations for the homogeneous optical Bloch model at optical densities {{of up to}} 3 are compared to measured rephasing 2 DFT spectra. Experimentally observed propagation distortions are qualitatively reproduced in calculated 2 DFT spectra, including peak broadening, peak splitting, and peak twisting. Varying beam overlap through the sample is crudely modeled in simulations, demonstrating that reduced beam overlap causes narrowing of the peak shape in the excitation dimension and an overall reduction in signal size. Propagation distortions, including peak splitting depth and peak twist, are found to vary with waiting time and with the excited state lifetime at a fixed total dephasing time, suggesting a coherent mechanism. A new method for reducing repetitive excitation of the sample by scanning beams {{with respect to a}} stationary sample cell using a fast steering mirror is described. This apparatus extends the average time between excitations at any point in the sample to 3 ̆e 0. 3 s and accommodates a wide variety of sample cell formats, including cryostats, air-tight cuvettes, and flow cells. Colloidal indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots (QDs) are interrogated by degenerate pump probe transient absorption spectroscopy at a photon energy of approximately 1. 5 times the band gap using spatially-averaged excitation probabilities lower than in previously reported studies. Signatures of Auger recombination appear with a timescale of 26 +/- 5 ps. Carrier <b>cooling</b> and recombination <b>pathways</b> are explored, revealing new dynamics not observed in studies that probe the band edge...|$|R
