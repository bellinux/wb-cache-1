Red stem colour, presence of <b>cyanogenetic</b> <b>glycoside</b> 1 black keel tip, floret striping, pod mottling and seed speckling were inherited as dominant characters• Several of the hybrida expressed p. ronounced heterosis, especially for leaflet and floret size. In spite of cytological irregularities which included cytomixis, desynapsis and multivalent formation, normal chromosome pairing was recorded in at least 60 % of the metaphase plates observed for each hybrid. Percentages of stainable pollen ranged from 55 to 99 in the parental species 1 whereas only 2 to 45 % of the pollen stained in the hybrids. Seed set per pod was low in all hybrids. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate and characterise biologically active {{compounds}} from endemic Australian plants. A total of 6 novel, and 26 known compounds have been isolated throughout the course of this work. A comprehensive investigation of the GC-MS chemical profile of C. cunninghamii leaf essential oil found that thymol (1) cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (4), myrtenyl acetate (2), myrtenol (3) and cis-chrsanthenol (5) were the major constituents. The essential oil and crude solvent extracts of C. cunninghamii possessed significant antioxidant and antiinflammatory activity. A 50 % aqueous ethanol extract was demonstrated to possess multiple modes of anti-inflammatory action. The crude extract was found to significantly inhibit both COX- 1 and COX- 2 cyclooxygenases and was comparable to the positive controls; Ibuprofen and Celebrex respectively. The crude extract also exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in the nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-α) assays, but did not show inhibition in the lipoxygenase (LO) assay. A total of seventeen compounds, of which 10, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are novel, have been identified from the aqueous-ethanolic extract of C. cunninghamii. Five flavonoids; axillarin (16), isokaempferide (17), 4 ’, 5, 7 -trihydroxy- 3, 6 -dimethoxyflavone (18), jaceidin (19), and 2 ’, 4 ’, 5, 7 -tetrahydroxy- 6 -methoxyflavone- 3 -O-β-glucopyranoside (10) were isolated from the flowers of C. cunninghamii. A series of caffeic acids were isolated as the major component of the stems, these included; chlorogenic acid (12) and its methyl ester (13), caffeic acid ethyl ester (11), isochlorogenic acid A (14) macroantoin G (15) and the novel 4 ξ, 5 ξ-di-O-caffeoyl- 2, 6 ξ-dihydroxyhept- 2 -ene- 1, 7 - dioic acid (6) and its 1 -methyl ester (7), 7 -methyl ester (8) and 1, 7 -dimethylester (9) derivatives. Lastly, arnicolide C (20) a sesquiterpene lactone, 3 -hydroxykaura- 9 (11), 16 - diene- 18 -oic acid (21) and 8 -hydroxy- 9, 10 -diisobutyryloxythymol (23) were characterised by spectroscopic methods. All of the compounds were evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity, as determined by the inhibition of prostaglandin E 2 in 3 T 3 fibroblast cells. All compounds, inhibited PGE 2 production to some extent, at a concentration of 31. 25 μg/mL. The flavonoids 10 and 16 - 19 were the most active compounds. The caffeic acids 6 - 9, 12 - 14 and the thymol derivative 23 also significantly inhibited PGE 2 production. The IC 50 values were determined for the novel compounds; 10, 6, 7, 8 and 9, as 1. 47, 2. 48, 4. 73, 5. 54 and 1. 26 μM, respectively. These novel compounds were more potent than the positive control, aspirin, which was found to inhibit PGE 2 production by 42 % at a concentration of 18 μM. Antioxidant activity, as determined by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) has also been attributed to both the flavonoids; 10, 16 - 19 and caffeic acid compounds; 6 - 9 and 12 - 14. The antioxidant capacity of these compounds was found to be comparable to epicatechin, a major antioxidant constituent of green tea. A detailed analysis of the wood, leaf, branch and root oil of E. mitchellii was carried out by a combination of GC-FID, GC-MS, LC/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The wood, root, leaf and branch oils were found to be predominantly composed of sesquiterpenes. The three major compounds identified in the leaf oil, which accounted for 44 % of the oil, were α-pinene (40), (+) spathulenol (15) and an unidentified sesquiterpene alcohol. The composition of the leaf oil was complex and chemically distinct from the wood and root oils, whereas the branch oil was found to exhibit a chemical composition that was intermediate between the leaf and the wood oil. After fractionation by preparative HPLC six components of the wood oil were characterized and accounted for 80 % of the oil. The major constituents of the wood oil were; eremophilone (30), 9 -hydroxy- 7 (11), 9 -eremophiladien- 8 -one (36), santalcamphor (35) and the novel 9 -hydroxy- 1, 7 (11), 9 -eremophilatrien- 8 -one (42). Two minor constituents, 8 -hydroxy- 10, 11 -eremophiladien- 9 -one (32) and 8 -hydroxy- 1, 11 - eremophiladien- 9 -one (33) were also isolated in this study. The two major constituents of the root oil of E. mitchellii were found to be eremophilone (30) and the zizaene, sesquithuriferone (43). These, together with the minor constituents 32, 33, 42, 35 and 36 accounted for 92 % of the root oil. The insecticidal properties of E. mitchellii were evaluated against several species of termites Nasutitermes walkeri (Hill), Nasutitermes exitiosus (Hill) and Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Bioassay-guided fractionation of E. mitchellii wood oil was undertaken to investigate the termiticidal metabolites. Of the major components, it has been determined that eremophilone (30) was the most active constituent of the wood oil followed by 8 -hydroxy- 1, 11 -eremophiladien- 9 -one (33), 9 -hydroxy- 7 (11), 9 - eremophiladien- 8 -one (36) and santalcamphor (35). The methanolic extracts from a total of 36 species have been evaluated for cytotoxicity against P 388 D 1 mouse lymphoblast cells. A collection of fifteen species of Eremophila from Western Australia and a further twenty from the Northern Territory were surveyed. Cytotoxicity was found to be largely non-selective across a range of human cancer cell lines, including MCF 7 (mammary adenocarcinoma), Hep G 2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), A 2780 (ovarian carcinoma), A- 375 (malignant melanoma) and PC- 3 (prostate cancer). Fractionation of the leaf material of E. racemosa afforded the six major metabolites. Isolation and structural elucidation of these polar compounds revealed the <b>cyanogenetic</b> <b>glycoside</b> prunasin (65), the flavonoid luteolin (74), the furofuran lignans, phillygenin (75), its 4 -O-β-D-glucoside phillyrin (76), pinoresinol- 4 -O-β-D-glucoside (77) and epipinoresinol- 4 -O-β-D-glucoside (78). Fractionation of the leaf material of E. maculata var. brevifolia afforded piceine (81) and epipinoresinol- 4 -O-β-D-glucoside (78). Quercetin (79) and nepetin (80) were isolated from the methanolic extracts of E. bignoniflora...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} Adenanthera pavonina (AP) seed extract {{on the blood}} {{pressure}} of normotensive rats was evaluated. Twelve adult male Wistar rats divided into 3 groups of 4 animals each were used and were treated orally with normal saline (control group), propanolol (positive control, and was given at 1 mg/kg) and 200 mg/kg of AP seed extract over a 4 - week period. Condon manometer {{was used to measure}} the mean arterial blood pressure. The mean arterial blood pressure of the normal saline treated animal was 60 mmHg, those of propanolol treated animals was 23 mmHg while the 200 mg/kg extract treated group was 30 mmHg. Phytochemical screening showed that the extract contained cardiac glycosides, tannins, saponins, alkaloids and flavonoids. <b>Cyanogenetic</b> <b>glycosides</b> and anthraquinones were absent. The sodium level for the 200 mg/kg group was significantly lower than that of control group. The total bilirubin, total protein and the globulin fraction were significantly higher in the extract treated groups compared to the control group. Histopathological examination showed that the extract did not cause any significant lesion changes in the liver, kidney and even the testes. The study showed that Adenanthera pavonina seed extract have the potential to cause a blood pressure lowering effect. The serum biochemistry changes may suggest that the extract has a tonic effect on the kidneys and the liver and these organs play central role in drug metabolism.

40|$|Abstract Background Persistent {{diarrhea}} is {{a common}} endemic disease with high incidence among the Africans including Nigerians. It also represents a frequent opportunistic disease in people living with HIV. Diarrhea {{represents one of the}} most distressful and persistent symptoms of HIV/AIDS, {{which may or may not}} be accompanied by an infection. The leaves decoction of Baissea axillaries Hua (Apocynaceae) is used by traditional herbalists in Edo state, Nigeria for the management of people living with HIV/AIDS. Determination of its antimicrobial activity and toxicological profile will provide supportive scientific evidence in favour of its continuous usage. Method Chemical and chromatographic tests were employed in phytochemical investigations. Inhibitory activities of aqueous and ethanolic extracts against clinical strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were compared with Togamycin (Spectinomycin). Our report includes minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the test organisms. Toxicological evaluation was determined by administering 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg of extracts on male Wister rats for 14 days with normal saline as control. The kidneys, liver, heart and testis tissues were examined. Results Phytochemical studies revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, and <b>cyanogenetic</b> <b>glycosides.</b> The extracts inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus to varying extents, but only the ethanolic extract inhibited growth in Streptococcus faecalis. The LD 50 of the extract in mice was above 5000 mg/kg body weight when administered intraperitoneally. Toxicological evaluation showed mere ballooning degeneration of the liver at 250 mg/kg while at 500 mg/kg there was tissue necrosis. The low and high doses showed ill-defined leydig cells in the testis and no remarkable changes in the heart and kidneys. Conclusion Extracts of Baissea axillaries have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against clinical strains of selected microorganisms. While there is toxicity at the dose of 500 mg/kg, the therapy shows potential for application in the treatment of diarrhoea associated with AIDS/HIV. Further studies of Baissea axillaries on diarrhoea and toxicity are necessary to evaluate its mechanism of action and to fully establish its safety profile. </p...|$|R

Our results showed that the extract at 100 and 200 mg/ kg body weight significantly reduced the formation of the oedema induced by carrageenan and histamine. In the acetic acid-induced writhing model, the extract showed a good analgesic effect characterized by reduction in the number of writhes when compared to the control. The extract caused dose-dependent decrease of licking time and licking frequency in rats injected with 2. 5 % formalin, signifying its analgesic effect. These results were however less than those of indomethacin, the reference drug used in this study. Since the plant extract reduced significantly the formation of oedema induced by carrageenan and histamine, as well as reduced the number of writhes in acetic acid-induced writhing models and dose-dependent decrease of licking frequency in rats injected with 2. 5 % formalin, the results have validated the basis for the traditional use of Lagenaria breviflora against inflamed purulent wounds, swellings, and bruises seen in some infectious diseases such as New Castle disease...|$|R
