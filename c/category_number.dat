40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} the scientific linguistic paradigms (formal, structural and semantic approaches) on research of the morphological <b>category</b> of <b>number.</b> The topicality of the paper {{lies in the fact that}} the <b>category</b> of <b>number</b> is attractive for re-searching the semantic and grammatical asymmetry phenomenon. The aim of the article is to analyze the views of linguists – representatives of different directions on the <b>category</b> of <b>number</b> in order to determine correlation between semantics and grammar in the morphological <b>category</b> of <b>number.</b> The main scientific achievements of the scientists who studied morphological categories of the noun are characterized. The author concludes that the morphological <b>category</b> of <b>number</b> is one of the main categories in constituting the grammatical meaning of a subject, but nowadays there is tendency in domestic linguistics to understand the noun <b>category</b> of <b>number</b> as of one that has some dimensions. It is proved that in the morphological <b>category</b> of <b>number</b> there is no direct correlation between semantics and form at the system level, indicating the existence of semantic and grammatical asymmetry...|$|R

In predicting survival, none of the medical indicators without dementia was a strong predictor of survival. When dementia was included, <b>number</b> of <b>categories</b> with worsening trajectory seemed to be the best indicator of survival, with average severity score being a close second. Among the diagnoses, dementia and its severity were the strongest predictors of survival. Prediction of continuous stay in the community (in contrast to death or entry into a nursing home) was significant for most indices and is easier to predict from medical indices than death.

5000|$|By way of background, the {{journalist}} Carlos del Frade has described {{a meeting in}} 1991 between Rodolfo Enrique Riegé, Secretary of Public Security for the province of Santa Fe, and Atilio Bléfari, head of police in Rosario. Riegé informed Bléfari that if he didn't increase the graft revenues that he was paying to Riegé, Riegé would relieve him of command and force him to retire. The resulting struggle for control of Rosario was not a struggle between justice and corruption, but a struggle between a corrupt police officer and his even more corrupt superior. The document that del Frade cites as a source goes on to list the sources of extralegal income the police were collecting, which included theft of goods during transport, bank robbery, car theft, gambling, exploitation of juveniles in nightclubs and discos, and medical quackery, among other things. <b>Category</b> <b>number</b> two was income from the Public Morality units of the police, and included drug traffickers, drug addicts, prostitutes, exploiters, pimps, nightclubs, discos, motels [...] Since the nightclubs and discos were fronts for brothels, this can be summarized as drugs and prostitution.|$|E
