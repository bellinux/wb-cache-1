50|$|St John the Baptist <b>Church.</b> This <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1720, {{at the same}} time that the St. Nicholas <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built, {{although}} the difference between the types of architecture of the two <b>churches</b> <b>is</b> quite remarkable.

In the absence of historical facts, mediaeval chroniclers provided their own details for Æthelberht's ancestry, life as king and death at the hands of Offa. His feast day is 20 May. Several Norfolk, Suffolk and West Country parish <b>churches</b> <b>are</b> dedicated to the saint.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{a number}} of churches and monasteries {{were built in the}} town. St Canute's Church (Skt.

The town's other old <b>churches</b> <b>are</b> St Mary's (Vor Frue Kirke) and St John's (Skt. Hans Kirke) with its adjacent monastery. Greyfriars Monastery (Gråbrødre Kloster) was founded by the Franciscans in 1279.|$|E
50|$|The first Austevoll <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} the middle ages on the small island of Sandtorv.

5|$|Most of the Baroque palazzi {{continued}} in private ownership throughout the 19th century, {{as the old}} aristocracy either married middle-class money or fell further into debt. There were a few exceptions {{and some of these}} retain the ancestral palazzo still today. Thanks to the continuing religious devotion of the Sicilian people many of the Sicilian Baroque <b>churches</b> <b>are</b> today still in the use for which they were designed.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the diverse}} {{religious}} buildings the 18th century Baroque <b>churches</b> <b>are</b> prominent: the Matriz Church, the Senhora das Dores Church and its six chapels, and the fishermen Lapa Church, with its curious Lapa Lighthouse. On the other hand, Misericórdia Church and Coração de Jesus Basilica denote {{the preference for}} the Neoclassical style {{in the end of}} the 19th century. The Romanesque revival style can be seen in São José de Ribamar.|$|E
5|$|Scientology {{first became}} active in Germany in 1970.

The German Scientology <b>Churches</b> <b>are</b> located in the big cities– Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Hannover and Stuttgart. Of the Scientology Missions, nine are in Baden-Württemberg, and three in Bavaria. Following German re-unification, Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic; most adherents are found in Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia.|$|E
50|$|The stave <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{demolished}} in 1710, and {{a wooden}} cruciform <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built on the}} site.

5000|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>churches</b> on {{this site}} for many centuries. There {{were at least}} three known churches on the site before the present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> constructed.

5|$|Skopje Fortress was rebuilt {{several times}} before it was {{destroyed}} by the 1963 earthquake. Since then, it has been restored to its medieval appearance. It is the only medieval monument in Skopje, but several churches located around the city illustrate the Vardar architectural school which flourished around 1300. Among these <b>churches</b> <b>are</b> the ones around Matka Canyon (St Nicholas, St Andrew and Matka churches). The church of St. Panteleimon in Gorno Nerezi dates from the 12th century. Its expressive frescoes anticipate the Italian primitives.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Catholic Churches {{share common}} {{patrimony}} and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches who {{are no longer}} in communion with the Holy See. These include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East. The Eastern Catholic <b>Churches</b> <b>are</b> groups of faithful who have either never been out of communion with the Holy See or who have restored communion with it at the cost of breaking communion with their associates of the same tradition.|$|E
5|$|The huge {{extent of}} the mediaeval parish of Llanbadarn made Sunday worship {{impossible}} for distant inhabitants, so early centres with a Christian identity like Llanychaearn and Llaneithr would act as chapels of ease, and later churches whether built by Welsh princes (such as Llanfihangel-y-Creuddyn) or Norman lords (e.g. Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn) were also subordinate to Llanbadarn before developing as separate parishes. Churches like Llanbadarn with a large hinterland of lesser <b>churches</b> <b>are</b> often known as mam-eglwysi, mother churches. There were no parishes in Wales prior to {{the coming of the}} Normans.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> {{established}} in Laconia. The Laconia Presbyterian <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> organized in 1874 and {{met in the}} town hall and private homes until 1880, when the present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built on Cross St. The Laconia Methodist <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> organized in 1842. The minister traveled from Mauckport, about seven miles to the southwest, to conduct services. The present <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in 1874 on Main St.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> a {{cruciform}} basilica with {{a western}} tower. The original <b>church</b> <b>was</b> destroyed in 1467 by Burgundian troops. A new <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built and subsequently devastated by fire in 1584 during the Eighty Years' War. The <b>church</b> <b>was</b> restored in 1592.

50|$|Other <b>churches</b> <b>were</b> built later. A frame Methodist <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1860 {{and the first}} Presbyterian <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built in c.1864.

5|$|The old {{villages of}} Three Bridges, Crawley and Ifield lay within the ancient parishes of Crawley and Ifield. Both of their 13th-century parish <b>churches</b> <b>are</b> still used for Anglican worship. Expansion of the borough's {{boundary}} has brought more churches into Crawley, including the early 11th-century church at Worth—formerly an isolated Wealden village at {{the centre of}} its own large parish. Ifield was a centre of Nonconformism in the 17thcentury: its Friends Meeting House was built in 1676, when more than 25% of the village's residents were Dissenters.|$|E
5|$|There are 37 Grade I listed {{buildings}} in North Somerset, including the Clifton Suspension Bridge, which joins North Somerset to Bristol and Clevedon Pier. Of the listed buildings, manor houses include Clevedon Court, {{built in the}} 14th century, and from the 15th century, Ashton Court and Nailsea Court. Somerset has many religious structures; the largest number are from the Norman or medieval eras. Some of the <b>churches</b> <b>are</b> included in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic church towers.|$|E
5|$|There are High Church and Low Church traditions, {{and some}} Anglicans regard {{themselves}} as Anglo-Catholics, following the Tractarian movement. The monarch of the United Kingdom is the Supreme Governor of the church, which has around 26million baptised members (of whom {{the vast majority}} are not regular churchgoers). It forms part of the Anglican Communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury acting as its symbolic worldwide head. Many cathedrals and parish <b>churches</b> <b>are</b> historic buildings of significant architectural importance, such as Westminster Abbey, York Minster, Durham Cathedral, and Salisbury Cathedral.|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> four <b>churches</b> in Pleasanton. The Pleasanton United Methodist <b>Church</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1899.
