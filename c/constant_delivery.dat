The first instance of screaming used as a <b>constant</b> <b>delivery</b> of lyrics was Chuck Schuldiner of the band Death. Musicologist Robert Walser notes, [...] "The punk influence {{shows up in the}} music's fast tempos and frenetic aggressiveness and in critical or sarcastic lyrics delivered in a menacing growl." [...] It should however be noted that the vocal delivery of thrash metal is incredibly diverse; some bands such as Anthrax use much cleaner vocals, early Metallica uses very hardcore punk influenced vocals while other bands such as Slayer use more [...] "evil" [...] shouts and yells, bearing little resemblance to hardcore punk. More recent bands within metal's various subgenres, such as Carnifex, are known for making use of multiple variations of both screaming and growling.|$|E
50|$|UNJLC, WFP and CARE International {{have joined}} forces to create a common {{pipeline}} for the different UN agencies and NGOs to transport their procured goods to the Darfur region. During the months of May and June 2008, they offered theses services for free, to help the NGOs stockpile their materials {{so that they would}} have enough to outstand the rainy season. These services were limited however, and only really applicable for non-food items. Humanitarian organisations that require more <b>constant</b> <b>delivery</b> of goods and delicate materials such as medical supplies and food supplements have been faced with the dilemma of having to fly their materials in, due to the rains. UNHAS has only a few planes and is overstretched due to lack of funding. Many organisations are having to resort to hiring local air freight contractors, which alone is very expensive. Some organisations who cannot afford the high prices use the larger multimodal companies which offer a midway to the fast and expensive air freight, and the cheap and very slow land freight.|$|E
5000|$|By 1912, the KMRy's most {{important}} customers were the gold dredging companies along Bonanza Creek, most particularly those {{owned and operated}} by Joe Boyle's Canadian Klondyke Mining Company. Since all of these dredges worked steam thawing plants, these companies were dependent on the railway for the <b>constant</b> <b>delivery</b> of cordwood required for the process. The dependence which characterized the relationship between the gold dredging companies and the Klondike Mines Railway was mutual: having interrupted its passenger service to focus its activities on freight business, the eventual dissolution of three of the dredges on the railroad route meant a significant and incurable blow to the railroad's operation. More so, the railway's efficient focus on providing the materials for the creation and operation of mechanized mining companies implied and necessitated its eventual termination. as Greg Skuce emphasizes in The Klondike Mines Railway, [...] "the railroad hastened its own end by putting the machinery of the modern mining companies into place." [...] With a mining process increasingly mechanized and a correspondingly decreasing population -in large part thanks to the efficiency of the railway in quickly delivering machinery to the major creeks- the railway very much contributed to its own downfall. Tellingly, the population of the territory had dropped from 27,219 in 1901 to 8,512 in 1911, and gold production figures for 1918 show an 80% decline from 1912. The railway could not have done otherwise than to shut down its operations.|$|E
30|$|The short ferry {{routes to}} Sweden and Estonia {{together}} with truck transportation are also used, especially in transportation to East European markets and with smaller volumes to other Nordic Countries. Truck transportation is very cost-competitive in these smaller markets, and trucks from the Eastern Europe are loaded full {{at the mill}} and driven directly to customers. Short sea shipping is used in larger and more <b>constant</b> <b>deliveries</b> to Central and Southern Europe. In the paper industry delivered volumes per country can be in {{tens of thousands of}} tons, and therefore short sea shipping to larger markets in Southern Europe and the United Kingdom {{is considered to be a}} reasonable transport method. The paper companies own logistics service providers such as stevedores. In Finland, railways are used in transportation only to the Russian markets.|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} is described to capture nano-size aerosols on internally-cooled micro tubing of the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) device followed by convenient {{introduction of the}} collected analytes into analytical instrument. Particles were generated using an aerosol formation by homogeneous nucleation of an organic vapor, and subsequent growth to nano-size particles by coagulation of decanedioic acid, bis[2 -ethylhexyl] ester (DEHS). The approach was validated by using carbon dioxide-cooled micro tubing to collect the nanosize DEHS particles followed by analyses on GC-flame ionization detector (FID). Particle size ranged from 150 to 590 nm. Temperature difference between the SPME device and DEHS particles mixture created a temperature gradient and resulted in thermophoretic effect that was determining the extraction rate. SPME device was cooled to as low as - 75 degrees C, while the DEHS remained close to room temperature. Several aspects of nanoparticle sampling were tested to demonstrate {{the principle of the}} sampling approach. These included the effects of thermal gradient, sample flow rate, sampling time, CO 2 <b>delivery</b> mode (<b>constant</b> coolant <b>delivery</b> vs. <b>constant</b> temperature), and particle size. Results were normalized to measure particulate concentrations using direct sampling with PTFE filters. Nanoparticle extractions of DEHS mass were proportional to sampling time. Normalized mass of DEHS extracted increased with increase in temperature gradient and with increase of the cross flow velocity. Preliminary results indicate that the variation of heat transfer boundary layer caused by the variation in the cross flow velocity produce self-compensating effect at <b>constant</b> coolant <b>delivery,</b> indicating that this approach could be used for field determinations including the time-weighted average sampling of nanoparticles.

50|$|The new Twincharger (TSI) {{petrol engine}} uses Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), {{along with a}} pair of {{chargers}} forcing the induction of the air. The chargers are a single supercharger that disengages after a specified rev-range, at which point charging of the air is handled by a single turbocharger. This system benefits from the pumping efficiency of the supercharger at lower revs and the fuel efficiency of the turbocharger at high revs. This results in more <b>constant</b> power <b>delivery</b> through the rev range, and better fuel efficiency. Both petrol and diesel versions are also available with DSG (Direct-Shift Gearbox).

40|$|Several {{processes}} {{that occur in}} the luminal compartments of the tissues are modulated by heparin-like polysaccharides. To identify proteins responsible for the expression of heparan sulfate at the apex of polarized cells, we investigated the polarity of the expression of the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans in CaCo- 2 cells. Domain- specific biotinylation of the apical and basolateral membranes of these cells identified glypican, a GPI-linked heparan sulfate proteoglycan, as the major source of apical heparan sulfate. Yet, most of this proteoglycan was expressed at the basolateral surface, an unexpected finding for a glypiated protein. Metabolic labeling and chase experiments indicated that sorting mechanisms, rather than differential turnover, accounted for this bipolar expression of glypican. Chlorate treatment did not affect the polarity of the expression of glypican in CaCo- 2 cells, and transfectant MDCK cells expressed wild-type glypican and a syndecan- 4 /glypican chimera also in an essentially unpolarized fashion. Yet, complete removal of the heparan sulfate glycanation sites from the glypican core protein resulted in the nearly exclusive apical targeting of glypican in the transfectants, whereas two- and one-chain mutant forms had intermediate distributions. These results indicate that glypican accounts for the expression of apical heparan sulfate, but that glycanation of the core protein antagonizes the activity of the apical sorting signal conveyed by the GPI anchor of this proteoglycan. A possible implication of these findings is that heparan sulfate glycanation may be a determinant of the subcellular expression of glypican. Alternatively, inverse glycanation-apical sorting relationships in glypican may insure near <b>constant</b> <b>deliveries</b> of HS to the apical compartment, or "active" GPI-mediated entry of heparan sulfate into apical membrane compartments may require the overriding of this antagonizing effect of the heparan sulfate chains...|$|R
