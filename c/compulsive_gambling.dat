In addition, he also admitted to losing $2.5 million [...] "in a six-hour period" [...] while playing blackjack. Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit. When approached by fellow TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson about the issue, Barkley replied, [...] "It's not a problem. If you're a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems. I gamble for too much money. As long as I can continue to do it I don't think it's a problem. Do I think it's a bad habit? Yes, I think it's a bad habit. Am I {{going to continue to do}} it?

2500|$|Complications of late Parkinson's {{disease may}} include {{a range of}} impulse-control disorders, {{including}} eating, buying, <b>compulsive</b> <b>gambling</b> and sexual behavior. One study found that 13.6% of Parkinson's patients exhibited at least one form of ICD. There is a significant co-occurrence of pathological gambling and personality disorder, and is suggested to be caused partly by their common [...] "genetic vulnerability". The degree of heritability to ICD is similar to other psychiatric disorders including substance abuse disorder. There has also been found a genetic factor {{to the development of}} ICD just as there is for substance abuse disorder. The risk for subclinical PG in a population is accounted for by the risk of alcohol dependence by about 12-20% genetic and 3-8% environmental factors. There is a high rate of comorbidity between ADHD and other impulse-control disorders.|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{existing}} literature on financial behavior focuses on basic money management tasks (e. g., balancing a checkbook). However, it can be equally important to identify problematic financial behaviors that can sabotage one’s financial health. The {{purpose of this study}} was to create an assessment tool that can be used by mental health and financial professionals to identify disordered money behaviors that may impede on progress towards one’s financial goals. This study asked 422 respondents to indicate their agreement with disordered money behaviors, including <b>compulsive</b> buying, pathological <b>gambling,</b> <b>compulsive</b> hoarding, workaholism, financial enabling, financial dependence, financial denial, and financial enmeshment, which were correlated with demographic characteristics and financial outcomes. The results identified eight subscales derived from 68 disordered money behavior items. All eight subscales were found to have high reliability in measuring disordered behaviors, and six were associated with negative financial health indicators (e. g. less net worth, less income, and/or more revolving credit) ...|$|R

2500|$|Continuing {{from her}} studies in {{computer}} addiction, Maressa Orzack {{moved on to}} look at internet addiction. In her research, she again likened the addiction to alcoholism, and through studies of cases of extreme internet addiction, learned {{the severity of the}} matter. Included in the cases she encountered was where a male who had become heavily addicted to the Internet, resulting in him quitting his graduate degree, leaving his wife and ignoring friends. Although she did not consider Internet addiction to be a recognizable disorder, Orzack felt that it could eventually be categorized as an impulse control disorder in a similar way to kleptomania, compulsive shopping and <b>compulsive</b> <b>gambling.</b> Orzack documented the effects of internet addiction, with withdrawal, loss of control, and compulsive behavior being some of them. She also described that one in ten people become addicted to the internet, with the figure being compared to that of gambling and alcohol addiction. Many of her patients were later referred to a psychiatrist for prescriptions for antidepressant and antianxiety medication. Orzack believed that treatment for internet addiction should be carried out without the aid of computers, and argued that computer-based treatment would be like [...] "having an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in a bar".|$|E

40|$|Since the {{original}} descriptions of hedonistic homeostatic dysregulation syndrome and pathological gambling in Parkinson's disease, impulse control disorders, such as compulsive spending, punding, or binge eating, are increasingly recognized. Although the term hedonistic homeostatic dysregulation syndrome has been supplanted by {{the concept of}} the dopamine dysregulation syndrome, the features of severe dyskinesias, cyclical mood disorder with hypomania or manic psychosis, and impairment of social and occupational functioning in the setting of increased intake of antiparkinson therapy remain. At this time, impulse control disorder is defined as maladaptive behaviors that emerge with disease progression and increasing antiparkinson medications.

5000|$|In the West, feeling [...] "empty" [...] {{is often}} viewed as a {{negative}} condition. Psychologist Clive Hazell, for example, attributes feelings of emptiness to problematic family backgrounds with abusive relationships and mistreatment. He claims that {{some people who are}} facing a sense of emptiness try to resolve their painful feelings by becoming addicted to a drug or obsessive activity (be it <b>compulsive</b> sex, <b>gambling</b> or work) or engaging in [...] "frenzied action" [...] or violence. In sociology, a sense of emptiness is associated with social alienation of the individual. This sense of alienation may be suppressed while working, due to the routine of work tasks, but during leisure hours or during the weekend, people may feel a sense of [...] "existential vacuum" [...] and emptiness.|$|R

30|$|What {{could such}} reward {{electrodes}} or mesolimbic dopamine activations be doing, if not causing pleasure? One {{possible explanation is}} that they promote 'wanting' without 'liking'. We suggest those electrode activations and mesolimbic dopamine in general momentarily enhance motivational value in the form of incentive salience attribution to surroundings and stimuli perceived or imagined at that moment. The incentive salience becomes permanently attached to those particular stimuli to make them 'wanted'. For the original 'pleasure electrodes', incentive salience would be attributed especially to the act of stimulating the electrode via pressing the button, and to the stimuli that surround that act. If the electrodes caused 'wanting', a person might well describe a sudden feeling that life was suddenly more attractive, desirable, and compelling to pursue. If it caused 'wanting' attribution to the button and the act of pressing it, people might well 'want' to activate their electrode again, even if it produced no pleasure sensation. Attribution of incentive salience to nearby people might help the individual to 'fall in love', and attribution to cues that are nearby or that signify individually-favorite incentives could lead to binges of <b>compulsive</b> shopping, <b>gambling,</b> etc. All that could be mere incentive salience 'wanting' -- without hedonic 'liking' (Figure 5). It would be possible in that case to 'want' to press the electrode again, or to 'want' another incentive quite impulsively, without ever gaining significant pleasure, or even necessarily having a clear expectation of gaining pleasure from the electrode or the incentive target. Similar 'wanting' interpretations have been applied more generally to the role of mesolimbic dopamine in reward (Berridge 2007; Berridge and Robinson 1998).|$|R
40|$|Compulsivity is a core {{feature of}} {{addictive}} disorders, including gambling disorder. However, {{it is unclear}} to what extent this <b>compulsive</b> behavior in <b>gambling</b> disorder is associated with abnormal compulsivity-related neurocognitive functioning. Here, we summarize and synthesize the evidence for compulsive behavior, as assessed by compulsivity-related neurocognitive tasks, in individuals with gambling disorder compared to healthy controls (HCs). A total of 29 studies, comprising 41 task-results, {{were included in the}} systematic review; 32 datasets (n= 1072 individuals with gambling disorder; n= 1312 HCs) were also included in the meta-analyses, conducted for each cognitive task separately. Our meta-analyses indicate significant deficits in individuals with gambling disorder in cognitive flexibility, attentional set-shifting, and attentional bias. Overall, these findings support the idea that compulsivity-related performance deficits characterize gambling disorder. This association may provide a possible link between impairments in executive functions related to compulsive action. We discuss the practical relevance of these results, their implications for our understanding of gambling disorder and how they relate to neurobiological factors and other 'disorders of compulsivity...|$|R
50|$|Borderline {{personality}} disorder (BPD) {{has long been}} {{believed to be the}} one psychiatric disorder that produced the most intense emotional pain, agony, and distress in those who suffer with this condition. Studies have shown that borderline patients experience chronic and significant emotional suffering and mental agony. Borderline patients may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions, experiencing intense grief instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead of annoyance and panic instead of nervousness. People with BPD are especially sensitive to feelings of rejection, isolation and perceived failure. Both clinicians and laymen alike have witnessed the desperate attempts to escape these subjective inner experiences of these patients. Borderline patients are severely impulsive and their attempts to alleviate the agony are often very destructive or self-destructive. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa), self-harm (cutting, overdosing, etc.), <b>compulsive</b> spending, <b>gambling,</b> sex addiction, violent and aggressive behaviour, sexual promiscuity and deviant sexual behaviours, or desperate attempts to escape through hard drugs. The intrapsychic pain experienced by those diagnosed with BPD has been studied and compared to normal healthy controls and to others suffering from major depression, bipolar disorder, substance use disorder, schizophrenia, other {{personality disorder}}s, and a range of other conditions. The excruciatingly painful inner experience of the borderline patient is both unique and perplexing. In clinical populations, the rate of suicide of patients with borderline personality disorder is estimated to be 10%, a rate far greater than that in the general population and still considerably greater than for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, since 60-70% of patients with borderline personality disorder make suicide attempts, unsuccessful suicide attempts are far more frequent than completed suicides in patients with borderline personality disorder.|$|R
