40|$|AbstractThe digit tips of {{children}} and rodents are known to regenerate following amputation. The skeletal structure that regenerates is the distal region of the terminal phalangeal bone {{that is associated with}} the nail organ. The terminal phalanx forms late in gestation by endochondral ossification and continues to elongate until sexual maturity (8  weeks of age). Postnatal elongation at its distal end occurs by appositional ossification, i. e. direct ossification {{on the surface of the}} terminal phalanx, whereas proximal elongation results from an endochondral growth plate. Amputation through the middle of the terminal phalanx regenerates whereas regenerative failure is observed following amputation to remove the distal 2 / 3 of the bone. Regeneration is characterized by the formation of a blastema of proliferating cells that appear undifferentiated and express Bmp 4. Using chondrogenic and osteogenic markers we show that redifferentiation does not occur by endochondral ossification but by the direct ossification of blastema cells that form the rudiment of the digit tip. Once formed the rudiment elongates by appositional ossification in parallel with unamputated <b>control</b> <b>digits.</b> Regenerated digits are consistently shorter than unamputated <b>control</b> <b>digits.</b> Finally, we present a case study of a child who suffered an amputation injury at a proximal level of the terminal phalanx, but failed to regenerate despite conservative treatment and the presence of the nail organ. These clinical and experimental findings expand on previously published observations and initiate a molecular assessment of a mammalian regeneration model...|$|R

Expression of rhoC is a {{precocious}} marker of the zeugopodial and digit blastemas and is induced by treatments with TGFβs preceding the formation of ectopic digits. As development progresses, expression of rhoC outlines the growing distal tip of the digits, and marks the regions of interphalangeal joint formation. Functional experiments show that RhoC is a negative regulator of chondrogenesis, which <b>controls</b> <b>digit</b> outgrowth and joint segmentation.

40|$|A {{case-control study}} was {{conducted}} to compare the physical hoof properties of digits responsible for clinical lameness with those of other digits on the same cows and with those of equivalent <b>digits</b> on non-lame <b>control</b> cows. The control cows were herd-mates matched by age, breed and stage of lactation. Hoof moisture, hoof hardness and sole concavity were measured on-farm. The resilience, compressive strength and elastic modulus of both sole and wall hoof were measured on biopsy samples collected from both case and <b>control</b> <b>digits.</b> White line disease, sole bruising and septic pododermatitis accounted for 92 % of the clinical lameness lesions in the case digits examined. Less severe forms of white line disease and hoof haemorrhage were also observed frequently in the non-lame digits of both the case and control cows. Independent variables were screened for unconditional associations with case-control status using Student's paired t-test and Wilcoxon's matched pairs test. Conditional logistic regression analysis was finally used to identify which risk factors were associated with lameness. When equivalent digits on the matched cows were used as controls, sole and heel moisture, sole hardness, sole concavity and wall colour were selected for inclusion in the model derived to explain differences between the physical properties of lame and <b>control</b> <b>digits.</b> Values for each of these properties were lower in the lame digits than in the <b>controls.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>digits</b> had a higher percentage of black coloration than the lame digits. Sole hardness and sole concavity (both lower in the lame digits) were also selected for inclusion in the conditional logistic regression model derived when the adjoining digits on the same legs of the lame cows were used as controls. None of the physical hoof properties measured were associated with lameness when attempts were made to fit a model using the equivalent digits on the opposite legs of the lame cows as controls. Production of the lame cows was also compared with that of matched herd-mates. Total lactation yields of milk, milk fat and milk protein were lower for the lame cows than for the control cows (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Embryogenesis {{depends on}} self-regulatory {{interactions}} between spatially separated signaling centers, {{but few of}} these are well understood. Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal (e-m) feedback loops between sonic hedgehog (SHH) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling involving the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Gremlin 1 (GREM 1). By combining mouse molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, we showed that BMP 4 first initiates and SHH then propagates e-m feedback signaling through differential transcriptional regulation of Grem 1 to <b>control</b> <b>digit</b> specification. This switch occurs by linking a fast BMP 4 /GREM 1 module to the slower SHH/GREM 1 /FGF e-m feedback loop.

40|$|Successful object {{manipulation}} {{relies on}} the ability to form and retrieve sensorimotor memories of digit forces and positions used in previous object lifts. Past studies of patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) have revealed that the basal ganglia {{play a crucial role in}} the acquisition and/or retrieval of sensorimotor memories for grasp control. Whereas it is known that PD impairs anticipatory <b>control</b> of <b>digit</b> forces during grasp, learning deficits associated with the planning of digit placement have yet to be explored. This question is motivated by recent work in healthy subjects revealing that anticipatory <b>control</b> of <b>digit</b> placement plays a crucial role for successful manipulation. We asked ten PD patients off medication and ten age-matched controls to reach, grasp and lift an object whose center of mass (CM) was on the left, right or center. The only task requirement was to minimize object roll during lift. The CM remained the same across consecutive trials (blocked condition) or was altered from trial to trial (random condition). We hypothesized that impairment of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits in PD patients would reduce their ability to anticipate digit placement appropriate to the CM location. Consequently, we predicted that PD patients would exhibit similar digit placement in the blocked vs. random conditions and produce larger peak object rolls than that of control subjects. In the blocked condition, PD patients exhibited significantly weaker modulation of fingertip contact points to CM location and larger object roll than controls (p< 0. 05 and p< 0. 01, respectively). Nevertheless, both controls and PD patients minimized object roll more in the blocked than in the random condition (p< 0. 01). Our findings indicate that, even though PD patients may have a residual ability of anticipatory <b>control</b> of <b>digit</b> contact points and forces, they fail to implement a motor plan with the same degree of effectiveness as controls. We conclude that intact basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits are necessary for successful sensorimotor learning of both grasp kinematics and kinetics required for dexterous hand-object interactions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSonic {{hedgehog}} (SHH) plays {{a central}} role in patterning numerous embryonic tissues including, classically, the developing limb bud where it <b>controls</b> <b>digit</b> number and identity. This study utilises the polydactylous Silkie (Slk) chicken breed, which carries a mutation in the long range limb-specific regulatory element of SHH, the ZRS. Using allele specific SHH expression analysis combined with quantitative protein analysis, we measure allele specific changes in SHH mRNA and concentration of SHH protein over time. This confirms that the Slk ZRS enhancer mutation causes increased SHH expression in the posterior leg mesenchyme. Secondary consequences of this increased SHH signalling include increased FGF pathway signalling and growth as predicted by the SHH/GREM 1 /FGF feedback loop and the Growth/Morphogen models. Manipulation of Hedgehog, FGF signalling and growth demonstrate that anterior-ectopic expression of SHH and induction of preaxial polydactyly is induced secondary to increased SHH signalling and Hedgehog-dependent growth directed from the posterior limb. We predict that increased long range SHH signalling acts in combination with changes in activation of SHH transcription from the Slk ZRS allele. Through analysis of the temporal dynamics of anterior SHH induction we predict a gene regulatory network which may contribute to activation of anterior SHH expression from the Slk ZRS...|$|R

This study explored the cognitive and linguistic correlates of character reading in Chinese preschool children with ASD. METHOD: Participants were 51 typically developing (TD) children and 47 children with ASD matched on chronicle age (M = 4. 47, SD = 1. 19), in an inclusive kindergarten in China. All participants were administered {{on the task of}} Chinese character recognition, and a set of cognitive tasks including rapid automated naming (RAN), theory of mind, inhibitory <b>control,</b> <b>digit</b> span, non-verbal IQ, as well as oral language skills such as vocabulary, phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and listening comprehension. Additionally, the Putonghua Communicative Development Inventories (PCDI) were administered to the caregivers of these children. RESULTS: Our correlation analyses revealed that, unlike TD children’s character reading, which was correlated with all the measured cognitive and linguistic skills, ASD children’s character reading was only significantly correlated with RAN, inhibitory control, phonological awareness, and PCDI. RAN and phonological awareness uniquely associated with character reading among ASD children even after controlling for inhibitory control, vocabulary, morphological awareness, listening comprehension and PCDI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that phonological awareness and RAN may serve as pre-markers for difficulties in emergent literacy acquisition in Chinese ASD children.

40|$|In the {{classical}} model of chick wing digit- patterning(1), the polarizing region - {{a group of}} cells at the posterior margin of the early bud - produces a morphogen gradient, now known {{to be based on}} Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (2, 3), that progressively specifies anteroposterior positional identities in the posterior digit- forming region(4). Here we add an integral growth component to this model by showing that Shh- dependent proliferation of prospective digit progenitor cells is essential for specifying the complete pattern of digits across the anteroposterior axis. Inhibiting Shh signalling in early wing buds reduced anteroposterior expansion, and posterior digits were lost because all prospective digit precursors formed anterior structures. Inhibiting proliferation also irreversibly reduced anteroposterior expansion, but instead anterior digits were lost because all prospective digit precursors formed posterior structures. When proliferation recovered in such wings, Shh transcription was maintained for longer than normal, suggesting that duration of Shh expression is controlled by a mechanism that measures proliferation. Rescue experiments confirmed that Shh- dependent proliferation <b>controls</b> <b>digit</b> number during a discrete time- window in which Shh- dependent specification normally occurs. Our findings that Shh signalling has dual functions that can be temporally uncoupled have implications for understanding congenital and evolutionary digit reductions...|$|R

Throughout the trial, overt attention was directed to the leftmost part, to the centre, or to the rightmost part of the travelling path of the target. During the course of motion a <b>control</b> <b>digit</b> was presented at a fixated location. Participants had to identify the digit and assess how velocity of the moving target changed with time.

The newest light emitting diodes can last up to 100,000 hours before having to be replaced. Advances in large-scale integrated circuits permitted the introduction of computer control. This also made it cost effective to send the signals that control the operation of the scoreboard either through the existing AC wires providing power to the scoreboard or through the air. Powerline modems permit the digital control signals to be sent over the AC power lines. The most common method of sending digital data over power lines at rates less than 2400 bits per second is called frequency shift keying (FSK). Two radio frequencies represent binary 0 and 1. Radio transmission such as FSK sends data digitally. Until recently radio transmission was subject to short range and interference by other radio sources. A fairly recent technology called spread spectrum permits much more robust radio control of scoreboards. Spread spectrum, like the name implies, distributes the signal over a wide portion of the radio spectrum. This helps the signal resist interference which is usually confined to a narrow frequency band.|$|R
