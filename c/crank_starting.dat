In 1984, the loco was rebuilt again, however this time it lost its fake steam outline and became an 0-4-2 similar to an industrial diesel shunter. It was named Perkins in 1985 and was given a twin-disc transmission in 1990 reverting to an 0-4-4.|$|R

50|$|Byron J.

At the time of his death, he was vice president and general superintendent of the Motorcar Company of Detroit. Carter’s death was the impetus for Charles Kettering and Henry M. Leland to develop the electric self-starter. Carter was survived by his widow, Dorothy “Della” Carter, and two children, Rachel Lucretia Carter, who later married Clifford Maurice Sparks, 1916 All-American football player at the University of Michigan; and Kenneth G.

50|$|The Model AA Ford {{is powered}} by the same 201-cubic-inch (3.3 L) engine I4 engine that the Model A Ford used. The engine {{produced}} a maximum of forty horsepower at 2,200 rpm. The engine featured an up-draft carburetor, six-volt generator, 2-blade fan, mechanical water pump, mechanical oil pump, electric starter and four-row radiator. All of these features were identical to the Model A Ford except the radiator. The engine could also be <b>crank</b> <b>started</b> if necessary by a hand crank that is inserted {{through a hole in}} the radiator shell. The Model AA was based on a chassis that was similar in design to the Model A Ford, except it was substantially larger and heavier to accommodate the work this truck was designed for.|$|R

50|$|Steam-powered and {{electric}} cars outsold gasoline-powered ones in many US states {{prior to the}} invention of the electric starter, since internal combustion cars relied on a hand <b>crank</b> to <b>start</b> the engine, which was difficult and occasionally dangerous to use, as improper cranking could cause a backfire capable of breaking the arm of the operator.

25|$|Gasoline cars became ever {{easier to}} operate {{thanks to the}} {{invention}} of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912, which eliminated the need of a hand <b>crank</b> for <b>starting</b> a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks {{to the use of the}} muffler, which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in 1897. Finally, the initiation of mass production of gas-powered vehicles by Henry Ford brought their price down. By contrast, the price of similar electric vehicles continued to rise; by 1912, an electric car sold for almost double the price of a gasoline car.|$|R
50|$|The {{volunteer}} fire department {{for much of}} the early and mid-20th century used a truck with 3 tanks and a front-mounted pump (sometimes called the chemical truck), and a General-St. Louis truck that was acquired from Mason City. Both had open cockpits and could be hand <b>cranked</b> to <b>start</b> the engine. In the late 1950s the school bus barn burned and the department saved two International Metro buses. Some of the fire department members restored one Metro for the District and the District gave the other one to the department, which used it for rescue for quiet a few years.|$|R

Then an explanation of the man's escape was supplied, for the hand-car, which had stood there an hour ago, had gone.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{thesis is}} focused on {{comparison}} of submaximal load PWC 170 to three different types of cranks together with contrasting various methods of calculating this index. We have chosen one method from those four, which has seemed like having the least error and we have compared it against those three remaining ones. METHODOLOGY: It has been tested on 10 probands (5 men and 5 women) which were in age range from 20 to 29 years and without any serious health problems. Graded test without breaks has been chosen for stress protocol, where every proband started with stress 1 W/kg of his weight on bycycle and eliptical crank. We have used conversion factor 0, 5 on arm crank, {{which means that the}} stress on this <b>crank</b> <b>started</b> on 0, 5 W/kg. The load has been gradually increasing by 0, 5 W/kg on each level (0. 25 W/kg on arm crank). Every level of load has three minutes duration and number of levels used has been individual because it has been driven by increase of pulse rate. After the proband has reached at least 170 beats per minute we have been continuously increasing the stress till we have reached maximum. We have determined pulse frequency during the examination on the end of each level of stress and also when the maximum has been reached, as well as subjective evaluation of load intensity on a [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{technological}} {{limitations and}} the lack of transistor-based electric technology, the top speed of these early electric vehicles was limited to about [...] Despite this slow speed, electric vehicles had a number of advantages over their early-1900s competitors. They did not have the vibration, smell, and noise associated with gasoline cars. They also did not require gear changes. (While steam-powered cars also had no gear shifting, they suffered from long start-up times of up to 45 minutes on cold mornings.) The cars were also preferred because they did not require a manual effort to start, as did gasoline cars which featured a hand <b>crank</b> to <b>start</b> the engine.|$|R
25|$|Cranks were {{formerly}} {{common on}} some {{machines in the}} early 20th century; for example almost all phonographs before the 1930s were powered by clockwork motors wound with cranks. Reciprocating piston engines use cranks to convert the linear piston motion into rotational motion. Internal combustion engines of early 20th century automobiles were usually <b>started</b> with hand <b>cranks</b> (known as <b>starting</b> handles in the UK), before electric starters came into general use.|$|R

5000|$|Specific {{types of}} distal radius {{fractures}} are Colles' fracture; Smith's fracture; Barton's fracture; Chauffeur's fracture (so called because the <b>crank</b> used to <b>start</b> old cars often kicked back {{and broke the}} chauffeurs' wrists with a particular pattern).

50|$|Making about 13 {{knots and}} her engines in full reverse, Sea Witch rammed its ice-reinforced bow into the {{starboard}} side of the Esso Brussels between the midship and aft deckhouses, piercing three of the Esso Brussels cargo tanks and locking the two ships together.

Dert supervised the terrified crew as they abandoned the burning ship onto the only available lifeboat.

5000|$|The {{cool thing}} {{about using the}} Myth II engine from day one is that we already had a {{solution}} for {{how we were going}} to make levels. We had the level designers immediately <b>start</b> <b>cranking</b> out levels. Because we had Tiki, and access to that, our modelers immediately started making 3D Studio Max models. Because we had all of these key components in place starting out, we were able to start asset production, and that's how I think we'll be able to ship a literally one-year project.|$|R
50|$|A Spring Starter uses {{potential}} energy {{stored in a}} spring {{wound up with a}} <b>crank</b> to <b>start</b> an engine without a battery or alternator. Turning the crank moves the pinion into mesh with the engine’s ring gear, then winds up the spring. Pulling the release lever then applies the spring tension to the pinion, turning the ring gear to start the engine. The pinion automatically disengages from the flywheel after operation. Provision is also made to allow the engine to be slowly turned over by hand for engine maintenance. This is achieved by operating the trip lever just after the pinion has engaged with the flywheel. Subsequent turning of the winding handle during this operation will not load the starter. Spring starters can be found in engine-generators, hydraulic power packs, and on lifeboat engines, with the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels.|$|R

Felix removes his tail and uses it as a <b>crank</b> to <b>start</b> the engine. He speeds away and drives through an intersection controlled by a traffic policeman. The policeman turns toward Felix's wrecked car, puffs out his chest and shoots out the buttons of his uniform {{as if they were}} bullets.

50|$|Although <b>starting</b> <b>cranks</b> {{had been}} {{replaced}} by electric starters for decades, Ford cars included a manual starting feature until 1948 as an antidote to dead-battery syndrome. The wheel-lug wrench served as a handle (also for the jack) and the jack shaft with bayonet-coupling pins could be inserted through a small hole in the grille to engage a bayonet socket on the forward end of the engine crankshaft. A quick-and-easy twist of the handle was sufficient to start the flat head V8, and the bayonet coupling was self-disengaging for safety.|$|R
