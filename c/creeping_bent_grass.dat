50|$|Agrostis (bent or bentgrass) is a {{large and}} very nearly {{cosmopolitan}} genus of plants in the grass family, found in nearly all {{the countries in the}} world. It has been bred as a GMO <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{golf course}} is an 18-hole, par 72 course with 6,832 yards of fairway {{consisting}} of Bermuda grass and <b>Creeping</b> <b>Bent</b> <b>grass</b> greens. The club features a 5000 sq ft clubhouse that holds a pro shop and the Stonebridge Grill. The club {{also includes a}} driving range, chipping green, and practice bunker.|$|E
50|$|Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu {{features}} a 27-hole championship golf course designed by noted British architect Herbert Strong. The course is covered entirely by <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass,</b> offers 27 holes, and measures either 6,066 or 6,326 yards, {{depending on which}} course is played. The course was officially opened by U.S. President William Howard Taft in 1925.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} plant of {{the waters}} edge is reed canary grass running from the East round to the South and into the West side. <b>Creeping</b> <b>bent,</b> reed sweet <b>grass</b> and iris are abundant. Common water-crowfoot, chara species, Canadian waterweed, slender spike-rush, perfoliate pondweed and spiked water milfoil are the other main species present.|$|R
5000|$|... (Agrostis canina) gets it {{name for}} the velvet {{appearance}} that this grass produces. It has the finest texture of all the <b>bent</b> <b>grasses.</b> This grass was used in Europe for estate lawns and golf courses because it could be cut so short. Velvet <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> requires similar upkeep and maintenance to <b>creeping</b> <b>bent.</b> Velvet bent has recently had a resurgence in the UK due to the high demands on greens from inclement weather and speed expectations. This species also has a lighter color than the two previous species.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} growing in neutral to acidic soils. It {{has a very}} fine texture and like most <b>bent</b> <b>grasses</b> grows very dense. Although this species is used on golf courses, {{providing}} {{some of the best}} ball playing surfaces in the world, it also produces a spectacular visual appearance when maintained properly. It provides an excellent home lawn but is not tolerant of heavy use. Colonial bent is fairly easy to grow from seeds and fertilization of the lawn is not as intense. This grass also takes longer to establish than <b>creeping</b> <b>bent.</b> However it does not require the intense maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Saturated, mud {{dominated}} pannes are occasionally {{found in}} the transition zone next to forested uplands where they are shaded by overhanging tree branches thus inhibiting evaporation. This is the preferred habitat for the uncommon seaside crowfoot (Ranunculus cymbalaria), where prostrate colonies may form small patches over the soil surface. Other graminoids and forbs scattered across the mud, or more often around the panne edge, include Virginia wild rye (Elymus virginicus), chaffy salt sedge (Carex paleacea) seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens), marsh <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass,</b> New York aster and smooth cordgrass.|$|E
30|$|Outside Table  1, {{only very}} few {{bacterial}} proteins have been identified, except peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein in the plasma membrane of P. putida (Table  2), outer membrane porin F from P. fluorescens (Table  2) and 2, 3 -bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase from Rhodospirillum centenum SW (Table  2). The latter photosynthetic bacterium is housing in marine and brackish water {{and so can}} be easily caught by the mussel valves. Still another intruder {{in the list of}} proteomics is ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase from Agrostis stolonifera (<b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass)</b> as this reaction takes place in chloroplasts. The habitat of <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> is on wetlands with tolerance to flooding (Garry Oak Ecosystems Recovery team: www.goert.ca/documents/A.stolonifera.pdf) or inundation of riparian zones which may have brought the plants in contact with the mussels.|$|E
40|$|Symptoms of basal rot {{occurred}} sporadically on {{creeping bent}} grasses {{growing at a}} golf course in Hampyeong, Korea in April 2007. Ten isolates of Microdochium sp. were obtained from leaves and crowns of the diseased bent grasses. All isolates were identified as Microdochium bolleyi based on morphological, cultural, and molecular characteristics. This is the first report on M. bolleyi associated with basal rot on <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> in Korea...|$|E
5000|$|... (Agrostis capillaris or Colonial bent) {{was brought}} to America from Europe. This {{was the type of}} grass that was used on the lawns of most estates. It is the tallest of the bents with very fine texture and like most <b>bent</b> <b>grasses</b> grows very densely. Although this species has been used on golf courses and {{sporting}} fields it is better suited for lawns. Colonial bent is fairly easy to grow from seeds and fertilization of the lawn is not as intense. This grass also takes longer to establish than <b>creeping</b> <b>bent.</b> However it does not require the intense maintenance.|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{long-term}} applications (50, 100 and 200 m(3) ha(- 1) y(- 1)) of pig and cow slurries on yield, botanical composition and nutrient content of herbage of an original perennial ryegrass sward were assessed in a three-cut silage system and compared with unamended and fertilized controls in the 36 th {{year of the}} experiment. Cow slurry at 50 m(3) ha(- 1) produced similar annual herbage DM yield to 200 kg ha(- 1) fertilizer N in 2006, whereas about 100 m(3) ha(- 1) pig slurry were required to produce a similar amount of DM. The highest slurry application rate significantly influenced sward botanical composition without depressing DM yield. The principal invading species were <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> and meadow <b>grasses</b> (similar to findings at a previous assessment in 1981) except in the unamended control (which were common bent and Yorkshire fog). Perennial ryegrass remained a main species in plots receiving fertilizer (31 % annual DM yield) and low slurry rates (38 %) but declined to 3 % annual DM yield at the highest slurry rate where the ability of ryegrass to utilize slurry N and P may {{have been affected by}} chemically or physically induced deficiencies of other nutrients (e. g. Ca) or direct physical effects such as smothering...|$|R

50|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{designated}} area is dominated by wavy hair grass, marsh foxtail and <b>creeping</b> <b>bent.</b> The improved grassland is dominated by perennial rye <b>grass,</b> <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> and Timothy. The northern section is mostly marshy and comprises rush and sedge species. The marshes also support bog pimpernel and ragged robin. The ditches are significant as they are examples of a disappearing habitat. A wide range of wetland plants flourish with a large population of flote grass and several pondweeds. There are rarities including tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa).|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades the amount of weeds in our fields have noticeably decreased. The easily annihilated and {{susceptible}} species were almost eradicated by means of herbicides and agrotechnical operations. Their place was taken by more resistant species, which are a huge problem for the farmers. For this purpose I decided to make an experiment under the working circumstances. I observed the occurrence of the weeds in certain localities. Especially I concentrated on the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti), on its occurrence, regulation, extension and susceptibility or resistance to certain herbicides. The effect of the tested herbicide combinations was statistically significant for silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> {{as well as for}} the other weeds (P 0. 05). The coach grass was the only exception, where the effect of these preparations was not proved, as well as Vicia cracca, Lamium purpurem, Galium aparine, Geranium pusillum (P > 0. 05). However the coach grass appeared among these inconclusively responsive weeds more frequently. (P > 0. 05). As the results of experiment showed, the most effective combinations for elimination of the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti) were Sumimax + Glean, Cugar Forte + Glean + Dural a Cugar Forte + Logran. All these combinations were proved to be 100 % effective against the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti). The other combinations were not 100 % effective. These comprised Rapsan + Command+ Grounded with 89 % effectivity, Sumimax + Logran 91 % effectivity a Butisan+ Clomate+ Grounded 67 % effectivity. The results show that the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti) is more susceptible to some herbicide combinations and in the fields it can be successfully reduced. On the contrary the silky <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Apera spica-venti) is resilient to some other agents. From this point of view the right choice of the herbicides is crucial in next year...|$|R
50|$|It forms a {{dense sward}} of fine leaves. The ligule {{is short and}} does not come to a point. This differs from <b>creeping</b> <b>bent,</b> Agrostis stolonifera {{in which it is}} pointed and up to 5mm long.|$|R
5000|$|... (Agrostis stolonifera) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used species of Agrostis. Historically, it was often called Orcheston long grass, after a village on Salisbury Plain, England. It is cultivated almost exclusively on golf courses, especially on putting greens. <b>Creeping</b> <b>bent</b> aggressively produces horizontal stems, called stolons, that run along the soil's surface. These allow <b>creeping</b> <b>bent</b> to form dense stands under conducive conditions and outcompete bunch-type grass and broadleaf weeds. As such, if infested in a home lawn, it can become a troublesome weed problem. The leaves of the bentgrass are long and slender. It can quickly take over a home lawn if it is not controlled and has very shallow roots.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is dominated}} by grasses and herbaceous plants, growing on soils deficient in lime (calcium). These may be found on acid sedimentary rock such as sandstone; acid igneous rock such as granite; and fluvial or glacial deposits such as sand and gravel. Typical plants of lowland acid grassland in Britain include common <b>bent</b> <b>grass,</b> Agrostis capillaris, wavy hair-grass, Deschampsia flexuosa, bristle <b>bent</b> <b>grass,</b> Agrostis curtisii, tormentil, Potentilla erecta, and flowers such as sheep's sorrel, Rumex acetosella and heath bedstraw, Galium saxatile.|$|R

40|$|Epichloë typhina, a clavicipitaceous {{systemic}} phytopathogen, {{was isolated}} from two varieties and three hybrids of tall fescue (Festuca arundinaceae). The morphology of the fescue isolates was compared with E. typhina isolated from <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> (Agrostis perennans). In all isolates, conidia were identical and were typical of E. typhina. In fescue grasses the endophyte {{failed to produce}} stromata, but on <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> the fungus seasonally produced stromata, typical of the genus. Cattle grazing the fescue grasses showed signs of the fescue toxicity syndrome, the E. typhina was found in frequencies of 100 %; in grasses from pastures in which cattle {{showed no signs of}} the syndrome, frequencies were 0 to 50 %. Nutritional factors in vitro were more complex for the isolates from fescue than for the isolate from <b>bent</b> <b>grass.</b> These studies suggested that E. typhina includes biotypes that might be involved in the toxicity syndrome. The fescue biotypes grew poorly on media, and yields were inadequate for toxicity studies. However, the <b>bent</b> <b>grass</b> isolate grew well on three media, and extracts from two of these were toxic to chicken embryos. All isolates produced in vitro the nontoxic fungal steroid tetraenone [ergosta- 4, 6, 8 (14), 22 -tetraen- 3 -one], which has been isolated from toxic fescue grasses...|$|R
