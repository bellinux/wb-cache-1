40|$|Modeling and {{understanding}} large urban areas {{is becoming an}} important topic in a world were everything is being digitized. A semantic and accurate 3 D representation of a city {{can be used in}} many applications such as event and security planning and management, assisted navigation, autonomous operations, <b>city</b> <b>surveying</b> or urban planning to name just a few. Different sources of information can be used for this purpose. Cameras at the aerial or ground level, laser scanners, satellite imagery or geographical information data are common and widely used. In particular images based approaches have received a lot of attention given the flexibility and low cost of the cameras used to record the scene. Given the complexity of the complete process, difficulties arise mainly in three stages: the decomposition of the image based reconstruction process, the accurate estimation of the camera positions and the semantic interpretation of the resulting model. This thesis deals with the problem of large scale city-size reconstruction and modeling using a monocular camera. The goal of the research was twofold. Firstly, to obtain an accurate, fast and inexpensive method to perform 3 D reconstruction. Secondly, to obtain a semantic model of the reconstructed environment. We decompose the reconstruction procedure and design a processing pipeline for 3 D reconstruction of urban areas by exploring the range of algorithms and methodology choices. By careful reasoning and comparison of state-of- the-art methods we are able to optimize the results of the algorithms involved. We propose an algorithm for estimating optimally, and in closed form, the scaled translation of a camera with as little as one correspondence between the 3 D space and the 2 D image space. Finally, we approach the problem of semantic modeling of large urban areas by merging information from different sources to reach a detailed building level description...|$|E
40|$|The {{consumption}} of dietary supplements and herbal mixtures to promote weight loss {{is a common}} practice in the West. This study was undertaken in Mexico <b>City,</b> <b>surveying</b> stores selling "natural products" at subway stations. The aims of this paper were as follows: to compile a record of plant products marketed as slimming aids and of retailer perceptions of these products; to review the pharmacological and ethnobotanical literature on the species declared; and to create an optical micrograph of a subset of products to verify {{the accuracy of the}} list of component plant species shown on the labels. We applied the techniques of observation, semi-structured interviews and free-listing at the retail stores. Results are presented for the 75 species recorded in the 41 weight-loss products surveyed, showing which plant parts are used, the geographical distribution of the species, pharmacological effects, dosage, route of administration and method of preparation, as well as ethnobotanical information derived from fieldwork. We discuss the values assigned to the species used. Microscopic analyses revealed that many of the plant ingredients declared were absent, highlighting the need for greater quality control and safety of these herbal remedies.

30|$|In the Kyoto <b>City</b> <b>survey,</b> tourist {{consumption}} {{was classified}} as “Travel expenses within the city,” “Lodging expenses,” “Souvenir expenses,” “Dining expenses,” or “Other expenses.” With regard to “Travel expenses within the city,” the Kyoto <b>City</b> <b>survey</b> revealed that the percentages of tourists using Japan Railways (JR), private rail, buses, and passenger vehicles were 33.3, 27.6, 9.0, and 30.1 %, respectively. The statistics for JR and private rail were used to estimate the demand for “ 78 Rail transport” in KIRWIOT 2000, and the statistics for buses were used to estimate the demand for “ 79 Road transport.” According to the Kyoto <b>City</b> <b>survey,</b> private automobiles, rental cars, and taxis/hired cars were also used, and these means of transportation were grouped under “Automobile.” Since these categories were not specified in the Kyoto <b>City</b> <b>survey,</b> their proportions were estimated by referencing the “Travel and Tourism Consumption Trends Survey” [Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLITT) 2004]. As a result, we hypothesized that “Automobile” could be subdivided as follows: private automobile, 95.6 %; rental car, 3.9 %; and taxis/hired cars, 0.6 %.|$|R
