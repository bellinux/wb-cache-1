40|$|Resting and {{postural}} tremor, {{intention and}} action tremor, clonus and the <b>cogwheel</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in Parkinson's disease have been characterised {{in terms of}} frequency content using spectral analysis. Typical resting tremor ranged in peak frequency from 4 to 5. 3 HZ with tremor in each individual varying only by 0. 2 to 0. 3 HZ. The peak frequency of postural tremor ranged between 6 and 6. 2 HZ. Intention tremor {{appeared to be an}} exaggeration of postural tremor. Clonus evoked by active or passive stretch at the wrist had a frequency of 6 HZ and appeared to be a continuation of postural tremor. The <b>cogwheel</b> <b>phenomenon</b> was found at frequencies between 6 and 6. 5 HZ and between 7. 5 to 9 HZ. Action tremor was indistinguishable from the <b>cogwheel</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Some patients had either a symptomatic resting tremor with a concurrent 6 HZ component of smaller amplitude or a symptomatic postural tremor with a 4 - 5 HZ component of smaller amplitude. These combinations would produce two peaks in the power spectrum. When this occurred EMG studies showed that individual muscles had two types of rhythmical activation suggesting that the tremors have separate mechanisms. Likewise some patients had a symptomatic 6 HZ tremor on posture with a second peak at 8 - 10 HZ in the physiological band. Therefore, the 6 HZ postural tremor is not an exaggeration of physiological tremor. On the basis of wave form and frequency similarities postural tremor, the low frequency type of active or passive cogwheeling, intention tremor and clonus possibly involve a common spinal mechanism. Higher frequency <b>cogwheel</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and action tremor may be an exaggeration of physiological tremor. More than 80 % of patients with Parkinson's disease manifest tremors at both 4 - 5 HZ and 6 HZ. This combination would appear to be the strongest objective criterion for the diagnosis of basal ganglia disease...|$|E
40|$|CHARCOT in 1884 first {{applied the}} term Parkinson's disease to the shaking palsy {{described}} by James Parkinson in 1817 (Critchley, 1955). In {{spite of the}} great advances made {{in the treatment of}} this disorder, there is still an element of controversy concerning its pathology, and considerable con-fusion {{about the nature of the}} peripheral disturbance it occasions. Recent publications have ascribed the characteristic muscular rigidity to over-activity of the small motor fibres supplying the muscle spindle (Denny-Brown 1960; Rushworth, 1960), and yet others have taken the contrary view, that part or whole of the gamma efferent system is underactive in Parkinson's disease (Jung and Hassler, 1960; Stern and Ward, 1960). It has always been assumed that the periodic interruption of rigidity on passive movement of the limbs in Parkinson's disease, which is palpated clinically as the "cogwheel phenomenon, " results from superimposition upon muscular activity of the tremor observed in the quiescent patient. This traditional hypothesis is unsatisfactory as many patients with cog-wheel rigidity have no tremor at rest. This discrepancy was thought to warrant the present reinvestigation of the changes in function brought about at a spinal level by Parkinson's disease. De Jong (1926) described an "action tremor " in Parkinson's disease which he distinguished from resting tremor. The presence of such an action tremor was confirmed by our study, and its relationship to resting tremor and the <b>cogwheel</b> <b>phenomenon</b> forms the substance of this paper. TECHNIQUE Forty patients with unequivocal signs of Parkinson's disease have been studied by electromyography after they had been assessed clinically. The only criterion of selection was the presence of cogwheel rigidity, althoug...|$|E
