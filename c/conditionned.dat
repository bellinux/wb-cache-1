In particular, atomism (not in the modern sense of [...] "atoms" [...] and [...] "elementary particles", but in the classical signification related to the existence of indivisible items from which the entire corporeal world is supposedly built) is a conception formally opposed to the Veda, notably in connection with the theory of five elements. Classical atomism states that [...] "an atom, or anu, partakes, potentially at least, the nature of one or other of the elements, and it is from the grouping together of atoms of various kinds, under the action of a force said to be 'non perceptible' or adrishta that all bodies are supposed to be formed". The error of atomism {{comes from the fact that}} these atoms are supposed to exist within the corporeal order whereas all that is bodily is necessarily composite [...] "being always divisible by the fact that it is extended, that is to say subject to the spatial condition" [...] (although in the corporeal domain, divisibility has necessarily its limits).in order to find something simple or indivisible it is necessary to pass outside space, and therefore outside that special modality of manifestation which constitutes corporeal existence.In its true sense of 'indivisible' writes Guénon, an atom, having no parts, must be without extension, and [...] "the sum of elements devoid of extension can never form an extension", so that [...] "atoms" [...] cannot make up bodies. Guénon also reproduces an argument coming from Shankaracharya for the refutation of atomism:two things can come into contact with one another either by a part of themselves or by the whole; for atoms, devoid as they are of parts, the first hypothesis is inadmissible; thus only the second hypothesis remains which amounts to saying that the aggregation of two atoms can only be realized by their coincidence ... when it clearly follows that two atoms when joined occupy no more space than a single atom and so forth indefinitely.The issue will be included in The principles of the infinitesimal calculus in relation to the concept of a whole understood as [...] "logically prior to its parts" [...] as well as in the conditions of corporeal existence and The symbolism of the cross.In that latter book, he speaks of [...] "the elementary distance between two points" [...] and in The principles of infinitesimal calculus he states that the ends of a segment are no longer in the domain of extension. Applied to the corporeal world, this leads to introduce the [...] "limits of spatial possibility by which divisibility is conditioned" [...] and to consider the [...] "atoms" [...] not in the corporeal world (which is properly the concept designated as classical atomism). The process of [...] "quintuplication" [...] of the elements being universal and coextensive to the whole manifestation, a universalization is contemplated in The conditions of corporeal existence: [...] "the point in itself is not contained in space and cannot in anyway be <b>conditionned</b> by it, because on the contrary it is the point that creates out of its own 'ipseity' redoubled or polarized into essence and substance, which amounts to saying that it contains space potentially. It is space that proceeds from the point, and not the point that is determined by space; but secondarily (all manifestation or exterior modification being only contingent and accidental in relation to its 'intimate nature'), the point determines itself in space in order to realize the actual extension of its potentialities of unlimited multiplication (of itself by itself) ... that extension already exists in the potential state in the point itself; it starts to exists in the actual state only when this point, in its first manifestation, is in a way doubled in order to stand face to face with itself, for one can then speak of the elementary distance between two points .... However one must point out that the elementary distance is only what corresponds to this doubling in the domain of spatial or geometric representation (which only has the character of symbol for us). Metaphysically, the point is considered to represent Being in its unity and its principal identity, that is to say Ātma outside of any special condition (or determination) and all differentiation; this point itself, its exteriorization ... and the distance that joins them while at the same time separating them (a relationship that implies causality ...) corresponds respectively to the three terms of the ternary that we have distinguished in Being considered as knowing itself (that is to say in Buddhi) ..., terms which ... are perfectly identical among themselves, and which are designated Sat, Chit, and Ananda."

40|$|The {{treatment}} of (near-) incompressibility {{is a major}} concern for the simulation of rubber-like parts, or forming processes. The use of mixed finite element methods is known to prevent the locking of the F. E. approximation in the incompressible limit.

Recently, finite elements method has evolved with the introduction of the partition of unity. The X-FEM uses it to remove the need to mesh (and remesh) physical surfaces.

The problem can be analyzed using {{the properties of the}} Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov (F-KPP) equation.

At v=v_c the survival probability decays like a stretched exponential. Using the F-KPP equation, one can also calculate the distribution of the population size at time t <b>conditionned</b> by the survival of one individual at a later time T>t.
