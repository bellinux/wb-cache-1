40|$|Abstract Storing and {{transporting}} {{of urine}} samples for doping analysis, as {{performed by the}} anti-doping organi-zations associated with the World Anti-Doping Agency, does not include a specific protocol for cooled transport from the place of urine sampling to the doping laboratory, although low cost cooling facilities can easily be made available. As a result, microbial and thermal degradation of the chemical substances in the urine may occur, which may lead to false negative or false positive results in the sub-sequent doping analysis. This scientifically and morally unacceptable practice is still maintained in spite of publi-cations demonstrating that immediate cooling is an absolute requirement. Given the enormous societal conse-quences of positive tests, {{the lack of a}} controllable chain of <b>custody</b> during <b>transport</b> should be outlawed. This paper proposes a simple method, based on immediate cooling and cooled transport, which can easily be implemented in developed countries at low cost...|$|R

The restitution was based on debts accumulated by the State of Alabama during a fraudulent warehouse deal, but Siegelman was acquitted on charges related to the deal. Upon sentencing, Scrushy and Siegelman were taken into <b>custody</b> and <b>transported</b> to a federal prison in Atlanta, Georgia, where they briefly shared a cell.|$|R

50|$|In 2014, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) {{under the}} U.S. Department of Justice {{released}} a report entitled “Best Practices in the Use of Restraints with Pregnant Women and Girls under Correctional Custody.” This statement on best practices {{was created by the}} National Task Force on the Use of Restraints with Pregnant Women under Correctional Custody to guide and assist institutions and jurisdictions in “the development of local policy and practice.” The report itself outlines five key principles the Task Force reached consensus on and eleven recommendations concerning the use of restraints on pregnant women. In particular, the five principles discuss the following: the importance of written policies and procedures on the use of restraints during <b>custody</b> and <b>transport,</b> who should be writing these policies, the unique healthcare needs and circumstance of pregnant women and girls and the related health risks posed by restraints, and the limitation on the use of restraints to “absolute necessity.” Meanwhile, the eleven recommendations outline specific cases where the use of restraints should be prohibited, avoided and/or limited, as well as what facility standard operating procedures should include regarding the use of restraints on pregnant women. The ACOG, the professional organization of Obstetrics and Gynecology, standards specifically state, that the use of restraints on pregnant incarcerated women and adolescents compromises health care and inhumane. Georgia, South Carolina, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Alabama have no policies. Many other states have policies about providing healthcare for pregnant inmates, but do not mention anything about restraining or shackling them.|$|R

Under his command, the SSS quickly became infamous for its brutality and abuses, while Yeaten came to serve as Taylor's hitman. He carried out numerous political murders, {{with one of the most}} notorious cases occurring shortly after the Liberian general election, 1997: On 3 Dember 1997, Samuel Dokie, one of Taylor's political rivals, was detained alongside his family in Nimba County. On the following day, Yeaten and his men arrived, took them into <b>custody,</b> and <b>transported</b> them to an undisclosed location.

Although Dokie's death was a scandal with much publicity, which prompted President Taylor to deny any involvement in the killings and order an investigation, Yeaten was never prosecuted and kept his job. The U.S. embassy at the time simply noted that Yeaten was one of the [...] "known human rights abusers" [...] in Liberia. Despite his power in the government, Yeaten still faced a rival in the form of Taylor's son Charles McArther Emmanuel, better known as [...] "Chuckie". Chuckie led the Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU) which was effectively in competition for resources with Yeaten's units.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of May 1945, Kren left Zagreb and began withdrawing towards Austria. He managed to evade capture by the Yugoslav Partisans and escaped across the Yugoslav border into Italy. He was captured by the Allied forces there {{and placed in a}} prisoner-of-war camp in Grumo Appula, near Bari. He was then transferred to a camp in Grottaglie, where he remained until 1947. That year, Kren escaped from Allied <b>custody</b> while being <b>transported</b> by locomotive to another prisoner-of-war camp. He then went to Rome and hid there for a few months. In March 1947, British intelligence discovered that Kren was staying in Genoa under the protection of Monsignor Karlo Petranović and that he was planning to leave for Argentina under the alias Marko Rubini. Kren was arrested by British authorities on 4 March 1947 while attempting to board a ship called Philippa, which regularly carried suspected Croatian war criminals along the Genoa–Buenos Aires route. Eight other suspected war criminals were arrested alongside Kren. Kren was extradited to Yugoslavia that same month. He was tried in Zagreb and on 22 October 1948 the city's municipal court found him guilty of mass murder, terrorism, forced mobilization, forced religious conversion, aerial bombardment of civilian areas, and the forced expulsion of civilians. He was sentenced to death by firing squad. Kren appealed the decision to {{the supreme court of the}} Socialist Republic of Croatia, but his appeal was dismissed on 9 November 1948.
