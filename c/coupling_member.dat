40|$|A {{coupling}} device has a transversely arranged, open-end groove in a flange {{attached to a}} pipe end. The groove in the flange receives a circumferentially arranged locking flange element on the other <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> and permits alignment of the bores of the coupling members when the locking flange element is in the open end groove. Upon alignment of the bores of the coupling members, a trigger member is activated to automatically release a spring biased tubular member {{in one of the}} coupling members. The tubular member has a conical end which is displaced into the other <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> to lock the coupling members to one another. A tensioning nut is threadedly movable on a <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> so as to be moved into tightening engagement with the other <b>coupling</b> <b>member...</b>|$|E
40|$|A safety lockout adapter {{is formed}} of two {{coupling}} members. Each <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> {{is adapted to}} couple with another corresponding <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> of substantially similar configuration for locking-out power disconnects or fluid line disconnects. When connecting the members to the power disconnect handle, a worker must use both hands. Each <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> comprises a substantially rigid and planar member having opposing front and rear edges and opposing side edges defining front and rear portions. The front portion includes {{on one of the}} side edges an arcuate portion extending inwardly to form a substantially concave cut-out and a hook portion defined by the front edge and projecting toward the side {{from the front of the}} concave cut-out. Means positioned along the side edge opposite the arcuate cut-out holds together two coupling members when reversed and coupled in overlapping registry with each other. The rear portion of each <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> has a plurality of holes therein which are positioned to align with the holes of the other <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> when both members are coupled together to permit padlocks to be inserted through the aligned holes...|$|E
40|$|A rotary {{coupling}} for connecting a driven part to {{a source}} of rotary force is described. This device transmits rotary force in one direction only and disengages to permit the driven part to free wheel when the input member is stopped and precludes the backdriving of rotary force from output member to input member. The coupling includes an input member having a splined shaft, a <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> connected to the splined shaft, and a coaxial output member. The <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> and the output member having complementary sets of axially facing clutch teeth. Guides {{in the form of}} helical grooves on the <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> and spring loaded followers acting with the guides affect the engagement and disengagement of the clutch teeth by moving the <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> toward and away from output member, the followers and guides themselves disengaging to permit free wheeling of output member when input member is stopped...|$|E

40|$|A quick-connect {{fastener}} of a relatively-simple straightforward {{design is}} arranged with a tubular body adapted {{to be engaged}} against an attachment fitting in coincidental alignment with an opening in that fitting. A tubular collet having flexible finger projecting from its forward end is arranged in the fastener body to be shifted forwardly by an elongated expander member coaxially arranged within the tubular collet for advancing the collet fingers into the opening in the attachment fitting. Biasing means are arranged between the elongated expander member and a rotatable actuator which is threadedly mounted within the tubular collet {{so as to be}} rotated for urging the expander member into engagement with the collet fingers. A first <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> is arranged on the rotatable actuator to be accessible from outside of the fastener so that a second <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> on the distal end of a flexible shaft can be introduced into the fastener body and coupled to the first <b>coupling</b> <b>member</b> to enable a typical actuating tool coupled to the shaft outside of the fastener body to be operated for advancing the outwardly-enlarged ends of the collet fingers into the opening in the attachment fitting and thereafter rotating the actuator member to expand the fingers to that attachment fitting. Upon expansion of the collet fingers, the biasing means impose a biasing force on the expander to releasably retain the fingers in their latching positions...|$|E

40|$|Few studies {{exist that}} examine Latino romantic relationships; even fewer assess {{interpersonal}} power among romantically involved Latino adolescent couples. This observational study investigated interaction, negotiation of power, and communication styles of Latino adolescents in current romantic relationships. Twenty-nine participating couples (ages 14 - 21) {{were recruited from}} a small Rocky Mountain community; all identified as being of Latino decent. Couples were digitally videotaped during problem solving conversations and completed a video recall procedure administered directly 11 following the recording. The Quality of Relationship Inventory (QRI) was completed by all <b>couple</b> <b>members</b> {{as a measure of}} their overall relationship quality. In addition to this, the Global Assessment Scale (GAS), which measured feelings of honesty, being attacked, misunderstood, and conversation control was administered to each <b>couple</b> <b>member</b> after videotaping. The video recall procedure captured positive and negative aspects of interaction, negotiation of power, and skillfulness in problem solving. Power dynamics for each conversation were also rated by an outside observer on dominance through talking and dominance through not listening scale. Overall, these couples rated their relationship quality positively and viewed their own and partner 2 ̆ 7 s behavior positively as well. Low levels of dominance through talking and dominance through not listening were observed to be used by <b>couple</b> <b>members</b> as a means to handle conflict during the conversation. The majority of the couples were observed to be mutually engaged in the conversations and appear to have good problem solving skills. However, higher ratings of power inequity by both <b>couple</b> <b>members</b> and observers were linked to lower overall relationship quality, with differing patterns of correlation for male and female <b>couple</b> <b>members...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{empirical}} analysis investigates how {{the labor}} supply dynamics of married workers aged 46 - 65 is in‡uenced {{by their own}} health conditions and by those of their cohabiting partners. Exploiting the information conveyed by the European Community Household Panel (1995 - 2001), our econometric speci…cations focus on the transition towards not employment {{within the next year}} and use alternative health indicators to describe the overall physical and mental conditions of <b>couple</b> <b>members.</b> We also control for partners labor supply because of its close relationship with their own health and the well-documented coordination with the labor market position of the other <b>couple</b> <b>member.</b> Our results show that while healthier individuals present higher chances of remaining at work in the future, living with healthier spouses a¤ects positively the likelihood of ceasing from work. Finally, when the spouse is employed, the probability of keeping on working is estimated to rise. This last result upholds the hypothesis, suggested by the literature, that <b>couple</b> <b>members</b> prefer to spend their time in the same employment status...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{to connect the}} supporting portions of orthopaedic implants {{such as in the}} head, spine, upper limb and lower limb and thereby prevent loosening and fretting at the implant interface of an orthopaedic implant construct has been developed based on shape memory effect and super-elasticity of shape memory materials such as nickel-titanium (nitinol or NiTi) shape-memory-alloy, without the use of typical threaded fastening technique. Advantages are conferred by making the entire device, not just connecting pieces, out of shape memory alloy and having shape memory effect and super-elasticity. Heating the memory head of the device will compress the connection portion without the use of an auxiliary device (e. g. <b>coupling</b> <b>member)</b> so that the connection portion can be completely clamped down by the memory head. Further advantages are provided {{through the use of a}} two-way shape memory effect in which the memory device can be closed or tightened by heating up the ambient temperature, and re-opened by cooling down the temperature. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

30|$|Table  2 {{also reports}} {{labour force status}} {{for males and females}} across power-type couples. Employment rates are {{considerably}} higher for males at 94  % for all males and 75  % for all females. The biggest employment difference across <b>couple</b> <b>members</b> occurs amongst male-power couples (with 97  % of the men and 71  % of the women employed). In general, the gender employment rates are closer for power couples and female-power couples, whilst no-power couples also have considerably fewer women employed. A similar pattern is found for the percentage out-of-the-labour-force; men are consistently found to be more likely to be participating in the labour market, with the gender gap in participation being highest in male-power couples (followed closely by no-power couples). In aggregate, and unsurprisingly, unemployment rates are lower amongst power <b>couple</b> <b>members</b> than no-power <b>couples.</b>|$|R

In two studies, measures of acceptance of dependency needs and independent functioning were obtained through <b>couple</b> <b>member</b> reports, by observing <b>couple</b> <b>members</b> 2 ̆ 7 behaviors during laboratory interactions, by observing responses to experimentally manipulated partner assistance provided during an individual laboratory task, and by following couples over a period of 6 months to examine independent goal striving as a function of prior assessments of dependency acceptance.

30|$|The {{issue of}} whether power couples {{actually}} migrate into large metropolitan areas (LMAs) is not easily addressed by the cross-sectional census data used by Costa and Kahn (2000). Using longitudinal panel data, Compton and Pollak (2007) further explore the within country migration patterns of couples and conclude that colocation {{is not necessarily the}} dominant explanation of movement into LMAs in America. If the family is looking to maximise its earnings from salaries, location preference may be given to the <b>couple</b> <b>member</b> with the highest paying occupation which may not necessarily accord with the highest education level. In other words, if there is a substantial difference in the earning capacity across <b>couple</b> <b>members,</b> then when <b>couples</b> do migrate, it is the education level of the highest salary earner (typically the husband) which best predicts this propensity to migrate. Whilst this may maximise the welfare of the couple, it also implies that the lower salary earner can become a “tied-mover” in the migration decision.|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} the British Household Panel Study (BHPS) from 1995 to 2005 we examine {{the nature of the}} {{allocation}} of savings, investments and debts between heterosexual <b>couple</b> <b>members,</b> how these vary by individual and household characteristics, and how these patterns vary over a ten-year time horizon. We find savings are more commonly held in joint names than investments or debts and there is evidence of an increasing independence in financial arrangements between <b>couple</b> <b>members</b> throughout the period 1995 to 2005. Controlling for age and other factors, cohabitation reduces the likelihood of shared financial arrangements. Both partners' labour market income affects the likelihood of having any savings or investments {{for both men and women}} but as men's labour income increases, the likelihood of men having jointly held savings and investments with their female partner reduces. Psychological well-being is improved where individuals have any savings or investments either solely or jointly held with their partner. © 2013 The Editorial Board of The Sociological Review...|$|R

30|$|Considering {{household}} characteristics (panel 3 of Table  2), {{the average}} age distribution across couples is similar with male-power couples averaging the oldest at 39  years. On average, 63  % of the households in the full sample have dependent children present (with, on average, 1.3 children), this is 60  % when the female <b>couple</b> <b>member</b> is a graduate (1.1 children). Household financial year disposable income is calculated as the difference between household financial year gross incomes (including wages and other income) less all household financial year taxes. Power couples have 53.5  % more household disposable income than no-power couples in Australia. A substantial proportion of the <b>couple</b> <b>members</b> are foreign born, considerably more so amongst power couples (column 9). Home ownership is prevalent in Australia (Mariotti et al. 2015), {{and the distribution of}} home ownership across power-type couples is consistent with expectations: no-power couples are considerably less likely to be home owners. We would expect home ownership to increase the costs associated with migration and to lessen the probability of the couple moving.|$|R
