She is Laverne and Shirley's neighbor and a regular character after they move to Burbank. Rhonda, who also <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> rather narcissistic about her good looks and self-obsessed, usually (always?) refers to herself in the third person, by her first name. Rhonda often bursts into Laverne and Shirley's apartment (occasionally at inopportune times, much like Lenny and Squiggy often do) to borrow things without really asking and to brag about her social engagements or romantic dates with desirable men {{with the intention of}} making the girls envious.|$|E

500|$|The Houston Chronicles Everett Evans {{described}} [...] "A Change in Me" [...] as a [...] "serviceable ballad". In a less positive review, Morgan Halaska of the Twin Cities Daily Planet {{felt that}} the ballad only [...] "unravels everything Belle {{is supposed to be}} in its attempt to explain Belle’s motive to ditch her dreams for a dude", concluding, [...] "She <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> weak, nothing like the strong, independent woman she embodied in Act I." ...|$|E
500|$|Robbie Collin of The Telegraph {{called the}} film [...] "flamboyantly loathsome on every imaginable level" [...] and was {{critical}} of the three lead characters, saying [...] "unlike Superbads leads, these three are poisonously unpleasant, and the supposedly comedic banter between them <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> bullying." [...] The Los Angeles Timess Robert Abele called the main trio [...] "numbingly predictable" [...] and the film itself [...] "unoriginal", stating the film [...] "bears a cravenly piggish attitude toward rewarding socially unacceptable behavior that feels unseemly rather than exciting".|$|E
500|$|... <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> {{peculiar}} [...] Not {{a typical}} relationship. A lot of macho men {{see the movie}} and like Guy's character, because he doesn't give me any special treatment. I think we <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a couple that has that has a genuine and deep connection. He is always there for me, but he's not impressed. I feel like we are sort of The Honeymooners, only I'm the Jackie Gleason character. Obviously, he irritates me on a significant basis, as everyone's significant other does.|$|R

500|$|... "Do You..." [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said the song [...] "spins the ostensibly sleazy pickup line 'Do you like drugs?' into an irresistibly sweet proposal, imagining lovely, perfectly wasted afternoons {{spent in a}} content daze." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly called it a [...] "fabulous song" [...] and felt that [...] "Miguel's smooth, subtle swagger is so appealing that a line like 'I wanna do you like drugs tonight' <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> audacious instead of offensive." [...] Rob Tannenbaum of Rolling Stone quipped, [...] "Just when you thought there were no new ways to say 'I love you'".|$|E
500|$|As McCotter {{embarked}} {{on his first}} official campaign trip to the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire, he received media attention for his hometown newspaper's reaction to his run. An editorial in The Oakland Press, based out of Oakland County, Michigan, wrote {{that the idea of}} a McCotter presidency [...] "isn't a pleasant thought and is, in fact, a bit scary". It added, [...] "the representative <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> cold, arrogant and egotistical". McCotter largely ignored the criticism, and continued his campaign in New Hampshire, focusing on the [...] "fundamental restructuring of government", and signing the Susan B. Anthony List's Pro-Life Leadership Pledge. Radio host Chris Buck was hired as leader of operations in New Hampshire.|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} song three stars out of five, calling it [...] "just plain predictable." [...] Steven Hyden and Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club were {{positive}} of the song, with Hyden, {{giving it a}} B+, noted that, although the lyrics seemed [...] "dopey", the production and the chorus are [...] "pretty damn sticky", while Koski, giving the song a B, noted that the song follows a similar formula to several of Perry's previous singles but {{went on to say}} that [...] "the template works well in the context of a break-up anthem" [...] and positively remarked that it <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a chintzier, 2012 version of 'Since U Been Gone.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Retrospective reviews, however, {{tend to be}} more {{critical}} of the album. AllMusic's Steve Huey criticized the album for lacking [...] "the conceptual unity and musical bite" [...] of its predecessor. According to him, the album [...] "wants to sound threatening but mostly <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> forced and somewhat juvenile", citing the cover track as an example. Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic opined that the record is [...] "a fairly decent album, but not a great one". He felt that apart from [...] "Set the World Afire" [...] and [...] "Mary Jane", the rest of the album [...] "feels somewhat uninspired". Conversely, Adrien Begrand from MSN Music opined that the record was [...] "somehow ignored" [...] in the band's discography.|$|E
500|$|... of Billboard {{felt that}} [...] "by {{isolating}} the electric and acoustic sides, the concept <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> repetitious" [...] and ultimately concluding that [...] "by scaling back their ambitions, the Foos {{could have made}} one great album instead of two average ones." [...] Pitchfork Media's Amanda Petrusich described the record as [...] "sterile and controlled", the double disc conceit as [...] "heavy handed, the segregation too deliberate" [...] and the rock songs as repetitive. Edna Gundersen of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of four and said, [...] "Though its most smartly crafted tunes and liveliest performances don't measure up to the band's finest, Honor is an honorable effort, full of the brawn and vigor that keeps the Foos in fighting shape." ...|$|E
500|$|According to AllMusic {{reviewer}} Heather Phares, Taking Back Sunday [...] "sometimes <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> {{less than}} distinctive, and the album can {{sound like a}} generic soundtrack to generic teenage angst." [...] Phares called Where You Want to Be [...] "definitely a solid album... but crafting {{something a little more}} unique would take Taking Back Sunday's music that much farther." [...] On Chart Attack, despite the album's being [...] "overwrought" [...] its [...] "quality songwriting and some killer arrangements conceal Where You Want to Bes occasional off-the-chart cheese readings." [...] Although Drowned in Sound writer Mat Hocking expected the album {{to be one of the}} [...] "grittiest, most emotionally driving punk-pop records of the year," [...] it turned out to be [...] "an album that's playing it far too safe: melodies rise and fall, soaring and curving with painful predictability." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{many other}} poems {{of this kind}} can <b>come</b> <b>off</b> preachy and offensive, Rose’s poem {{delivers}} a message and conveys her obvious emotional stake in the matter {{while at the same}} time managing to not <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> overly-emotional sermonizing.

500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back."

In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Get Together" [...] {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} Stardust's [...] "Music Sounds Better with You" [...] which also contain samples of Chaka Khan's song [...] "Fate".

The song {{is set in}} common time with moderately fast dance groove tempo and a metronome of 126 beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of A minor. Madonna's voice spans from A3 to A4. It follows in the chord progression of Em–F–G-Am throughout. The song's lyrics portray an anthem-like picture about the different possibilities of finding love on the dance floor. It includes an allusion to The SOS Band's 1980 single [...] "Take Your Time (Do It Right)" [...] in the line [...] "Baby we can do it, we can do it all right."

It's hot, it's sexy, it definitely makes you feel like you caught the fever." [...] She additionally stated that her favorite fragrance notes are red vanilla orchid, due to its [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "spicy" [...] smell, and honeysuckle, due to its [...] "sensual" [...] and [...] "sweet" [...] smell. She concluded: [...] "It was a lot of work but I was really really happy and I think it's something I'll be proud of 20 years from now." [...] During an interview with Teen Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she loved the perfume because it featured notes of orchid, her favorite flower. She further said that it was suitable for her alter ego Sasha Fierce as it was [...] "fiery".|$|E

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. They heavily criticized the episode for taking place before the events of [...] "Kaddish" [...] and [...] "Memento Mori" [...] {{in an attempt to}} not deal with Scully's cancer. Furthermore, the two criticized the episode for being [...] "thin stuff" [...] and heavily padded; Shearman and Pearson note that the long teaser is replayed in the episode [...] "to no new {{dramatic}} effect" [...] and that Covarrubias's appearance offers no new information. Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Unrequited" [...] one star out of four, writing that it [...] "collapses under the weight of its message" [...] and that it [...] "fails to bring to life any of its guest characters". Furthermore, she criticized the reusing of the teaser, noting that it [...] "just <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a writer's device".|$|E
500|$|Considerable {{attention}} was {{generated by the}} more sexual image of Furtado presented in promotion and publicity for the album, {{and in particular the}} music videos for [...] "Promiscuous" [...] and [...] "Maneater", in which she dances around with her midriff exposed. According to Maclean's magazine, some said that Furtado's progression was a natural transformation of a pop singer; others believed that she had [...] "sold out" [...] in an effort to garner record sales, particularly after her second album was a commercial failure in comparison to her first. Maclean's wrote that her makeover [...] "seems a bit forced" [...] and contrasted her with singers such as Madonna and Emily Haines of Metric: [...] " [...] seem to be completely in control, even somewhat intimidating in their sexuality: they've made a calculated decision for commercial and feminist reasons. In contrast, Furtado's new, overt sexuality <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> unoriginal—overdone by thousands of pouty pop stars with a quarter of Furtado's natural talent ... the revamping feels as if it's been imposed rather than chosen by the unique, articulate singer we've seen in the past." ...|$|E

Because of that, Bell explains that Elle <b>comes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> more of a victim. Bell also explains that Elle {{is one of the few}} characters with abilities that embrace their power and is almost on the verge of being addicted to her ability. Elle [...] "enjoys the emotional power it gives her over other people". She is described as one who is [...] "always out to get what she wants" [...] and someone who [...] "doesn’t have many boundaries". Bell describes Elle as a vixen who [...] "feels like she has a romantic connection to everybody", and in a few episodes, Elle is shown displaying a great deal of affection to men and flirting with both Peter Petrelli and Mohinder Suresh.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for That Guy Dick Miller has been predominantly positive. Film Threat praised the documentary's use of interviews, as {{they noted that}} these would normally be ineffective [...] "because they <b>come</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> little more than EPK-publicity materials designed to bow at the altar of an already-known icon" [...] and felt that the interviews in the film <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> showing genuine admiration for Miller. Twitch Film and Ain't It Cool News also gave the film positive reviews, and Ain't it Cool News considered it to be [...] "a warm, worthy tribute to a national treasure!" [...] The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a B-, as they enjoyed the film overall but felt that it [...] "too frequently loses focus".|$|R
