25|$|In 1986, Congress {{passed the}} Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act, giving {{children}} a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in sexual abuse cases. The number of laws {{created in the}} 1980s and 1990s began to create greater prosecution and detection of child sexual abusers. During the 1970s a large transition began in the legislature related to child sexual abuse. Megan's Law which was enacted in 1996 gives the public access to knowledge of sex offenders nationwide.|$|E
25|$|In March 2000 Altmann filed a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> {{against the}} Austrian {{government}} {{for the return of}} the paintings. She was informed that the cost of filing (consisting of 1.2% of the amount in question, plus a filing fee), would have meant a fee of €1.75 million. To avoid the prohibitively high costs, Altmann and Schoenberg sued the Austrian government and the Galerie Belvedere in the US courts. The Austrian government filed for dismissal, based on arguments around the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (1976). The Act granted immunity to sovereign nations except under certain conditions. Schoenberg showed that three of the conditions pertinent to the case were that Altmann's property had been taken in violation of international law; the property was owned by the state in question, or one of its agencies; and that the property had been used on a commercial basis in the US. Over four years of litigation followed as to whether the case could be brought against a sovereign state before it was brought before the Supreme Court in Republic of Austria v. Altmann. In June 2004 the Supreme Court determined that the paintings had been stolen and that Austria was not immune from a claim from Altmann; the court made no comment on the current ownership of the paintings.|$|E

[...] The case achieved public notoriety as Theodore was then the Treasurer of the Australian Government.

2500|$|A cell-phone video {{broadcast}} on local television station KTVU on January 23 showed {{what appeared to}} be Pirone rushing towards one of the detained men and punching him in the face several times two minutes before the shooting.

[...] The subsequent autopsy showed that Grant's body had no injuries other than that from the bullet wound. Pirone's attorney stated that Grant provoked Pirone by trying to knee the officer in the groin and by hitting Officer Marysol Domenici's arm when she attempted to handcuff one of Grant's friends.|$|E
6000|$|Again, did you {{ask these}} questions, {{when you went to}} rob them of their landed estates, their money, their ornaments, and even their wearing-apparel? When you sent those great lawyers, Major ----, Major ----, and the other majors, and colonels, and captains, did you call on them to exhibit their title-deeds? No: with a pistol at their breast, you demanded their money. Instead of forging a charge of {{rebellion}} against these unhappy persons, why did you not then call on them for their vouchers? No rebellion was necessary to give validity to a <b>civil</b> <b>claim.</b> What you could get by an ordinary judgment did not want confiscation called to its aid. When you had their eunuchs, their ministers, their treasurers, their agents and attorneys in irons, did you then ask any of these questions? No. [...] "Discover the money you have in trust, or you go to corporal punishment,--you go to the castle of Chunar,--here is another pair of irons!"--this was the only language used.|$|E

40|$|Ancillary federal {{district}} court powers embody more than adjudicatory authority over "factually interdependent" <b>civil</b> <b>claims</b> initially presented within cases or controversies. Ancillary powers are used to facilitate civil case settlement agreements encompassing claims never presented for adjudication, {{as well as to}} adjudicate some disputes over settlement agreements long after final judgments. While certain ancillary powers are now recognized in the "supplemental jurisdiction" statute, 28 U. S. C. ý 1367, the range of the statute is quite limited. It chiefly codifies earlier precedents on pendent and ancillary jurisdiction that primarily address initial ancillary adjudicatory authority over state law <b>civil</b> <b>claims</b> without independent jurisdictional bases that arise from the same "common nucleus of operative facts" as the <b>civil</b> <b>claims</b> having independent subject matter jurisdictional bases. Section 1367 should provide clarity for all federal court ancillary powers, eliminating much uncertainty and confusion. Section 1367 should be amended to encompass more fully ancillary adjudicatory and nonadjudicatory federal court authority. This task is facilitated by the 1994 decision in Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. A reformulated statute should speak {{for the first time to}} the ancillary nonadjudicatory powers necessary for courts to function successfully, including management, vindication, and certain enforcement powers. And, it should better recognize the differences between initial and later ancillary adjudicatory powers over nonfederal <b>civil</b> <b>claims</b> that are factually related to federal <b>civil</b> <b>claims.</b> In the absence of Congressional action, judicial decisions should better recognize and differentiate the varying forms of ancillary {{federal district}} court powers...|$|R
