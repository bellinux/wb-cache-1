6000|$|... 'You needn't say [...] "exactually,"' the Queen remarked: 'I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> without that. Now I'll give YOU {{something}} to believe. I'm just {{one hundred and}} one, five months and a day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's been tried, too," [...] {{declared}} the Galesburg attorney. [...] "Say, you <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> or not, but we've never dug anything up so far. He's been too slick for us, I guess." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Office and Sherlock star Martin Freeman {{appeared}} {{early in}} the second series, pictured stealing money from Milly and Egg's bedroom after a party, and accidentally drinking Egg's urine from a <b>can,</b> <b>believing</b> <b>it</b> to be beer.|$|R
5000|$|... "Microlite is so formed, so perfect, you <b>can</b> hardly <b>believe</b> <b>it's</b> their debut" [...] The Guardian ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be you. I <b>can</b> {{scarcely}} <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> now. You are not"--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--"a prisoner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> Peter, {{for he was}} a good man, {{and such}} are our Christian laws, though few of us obey them. I can easily believe that Parson Amen was an exception, however." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How strange! Yet I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> of her, {{she looked}} {{a woman who}} would dare do anything. Then you came back, Adam, to find me? What led you here, hoping so much and knowing so little?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Barrington spoke almost fiercely, {{and then}} flushed through his tan, {{when the girl}} looking into his eyes smiled a little. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> because I owe a good deal to one of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Bevoir." [...] Dave's {{head was}} in a whirl. [...] "But this,--of you! I <b>can</b> {{scarcely}} <b>believe</b> <b>it!</b> And then that attack on the pack-train!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> easily <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> And was he {{anxious to}} steal the {{gunpowder}} {{and put it on}} the fire, or did he have to be persuaded?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> well <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> sir. I'll pay twice sixty {{dollars for}} the {{delivery}} to me of the forged check, and {{the withdrawal of the}} prosecution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> Mavy. Had things been {{different}} it's quite likely I'd {{have had to}} keep the boys at home; I was only sure that I was throwing my time away yesterday. Anyway, I'm thankful that one hailed crop won't clean me out." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{took the}} spray of forceythia {{out of his}} buttonhole. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> I found this in one, of the squares, and I think it belongs to you." [...] He offered it with a bow and a laugh, and she took {{it in the same}} humour.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{say that}} {{she is one of}} these Suffragette women, {{although}} she keeps it dark. Well, I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> Anyway, this officer is tumbling into honey, and there's no fool like a woman in love," [...] said the lawyer to himself as he packed his bag of papers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jem," [...] {{she cried}} breathlessly, [...] "is it really you? I <b>can</b> hardly <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> Where {{have you been}} all this long time? Where have you been?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't," [...] said Peter to himself. [...] "I won't {{repeat it}} to a soul. No one will <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> The truth is, I <b>can</b> hardly <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> myself. I'll just keep my tongue still." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{you have}} changed, Jim," [...] she whispered. [...] "It is you, isn't <b>it?</b> I <b>can</b> {{scarcely}} <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Can</b> the months really write their lines so deeply?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> all," [...] said Medlicot, [...] "and am {{very sorry}} {{that it should}} be so. But I can not see the justice of {{punishing}} a man on the merest, vaguest suspicion. Your only ground for imputing this crime to him is that your own conduct to him may have given him a motive." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Bishop Berkeley said 'there was {{no matter}},' [...] And proved it--'t was {{no matter what}} he said: [...] They say his system 't is in vain to batter, [...] Too subtle for the airiest human head; [...] And yet who <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it?</b> I would shatter [...] Gladly all matters down to stone or lead, [...] Or adamant, to find the world a spirit, [...] And wear my head, denying that I wear it.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{regards the}} {{advertising}} signs," [...] continued the girl, [...] "I've heard you spoken of {{as a man}} of excellent taste, and I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> since I've examined the class of goods you keep. And your store is as neat and attractive as can be. The fight is not against the signs themselves, but against putting them on fences and barns, and so making great glaring spots in a landscape where all should be beautiful and harmonious. I suppose a man of your refinement and good taste has often thought of that, and said the same thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> hardly <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> possible!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Yet {{many things}} are queer here, he added," [...] with a {{peculiar}} look {{that made my}} uncle wince.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Does {{it really}} hurt your soul, Ursula?' asked Gudrun, in some surprise. 'I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> quite <b>it</b> hurts your skin--it is TERRIBLE. But I {{thought it was}} ADMIRABLE for the soul.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, I <b>can</b> {{scarcely}} <b>believe</b> <b>it's</b> true," [...] said Phil Franklin to the Rover boys. [...] "Why, {{my father}} will have more money than he ever dreamed of." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jenny Wren's sharp little eyes snapped. [...] "If you half used {{your eyes}} you wouldn't {{have to ask}} me how he gets those little sticks," [...] she sputtered. [...] "If you had watched {{him when he was}} flying close to the tree tops you would have seen him clutch little dead twigs in his claws and snap them off without stopping. That's the way he gets his little sticks, Mr. Smarty, He fastens them {{together}} with a sticky substance he has in his mouth, and he fastens the nest {{to the side of the}} chimney in the same way. You <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> or not, but it's so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on there, Master Pathfinder," [...] {{interrupted}} Cap, {{not without}} some heat; [...] "in {{the way of a}} proper and manly faith, I will turn my back on no one, when afloat. Although more accustomed to make all snug aloft, and to show the proper canvas, than to pray when the hurricane comes, I know that we are but helpless mortals at times, and I hope I pay reverence where reverence is due. All I mean to say is this: that, being accustomed to see water in large bodies salt, I should like to taste it before I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be fresh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> You are tarred {{with the}} same brush as Geoffrey. The obstinate fool must go {{out there with a}} couple of hundred pounds or so, when he knew he had only to humor me by marrying Millicent and wait for prosperity. And yet, in one way, I'm glad he did. He never wrote me to {{apologize}} or explain--still, that's hardly surprising either. I don't know that any of us ever troubled much about other folks' opinions or listened to advice. Here am I, who might have lived another ten years, dying, because, when an officious keeper warned me, I went the opposite way. I hear wheels, Halliday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> hardly <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> of you, Sam," [...] said Miss Nugent. [...] "I {{can hardly}} {{think you could}} have been so deceitful. Why, we've trusted you all our lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} I <b>can</b> {{scarcely}} <b>believe</b> <b>it's</b> true," [...] Phil Franklin {{had said to}} the Rover boys. [...] "Why, my father will have more money than he ever dreamed of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> readily <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> your Majesty." [...] Corneille {{had picked}} up his book again, {{and was about to}} resume his reading when there came a sharp tap at the door.|$|R
60|$|The {{truth of}} this story I cannot vouch for. Myself, I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> Brown and MacShaughnassy {{made no attempt to}} do so, which seemed unfriendly. Jephson excused himself on the plea of a headache. I admit there are points in it {{presenting}} difficulties to the average intellect. As I explained at the commencement, it was told to me by Ethelbertha, who had it from Amenda, who got it from the char-woman, and exaggerations may have crept into it. The following, however, were incidents that came under my own personal observation. They afforded a still stronger example of the influence exercised by Tommy Atkins upon the British domestic, and I therefore thought it right to relate them.|$|E
60|$|It is said by {{some that}} {{drunkenness}} {{is on the}} increase in this island. I have no trusty proof of it: but I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> possible; for every cause of drunkenness seems on the increase. Overwork of body and mind; circumstances which depress health; temptation to drink, and drink again, at {{every corner of the}} streets; and finally, money, and ever more money, in the hands of uneducated people, who have not the desire, and too often not the means, of spending it in any save the lowest pleasures. These, it seems to me, are the true causes of drunkenness, increasing or not. And if we wish to become a more temperate nation, we must lessen them, if we cannot eradicate them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lady Kirkaldy {{says that}} all has turned out better than could have been expected. You see, as she says, Mr. Egremont {{has been used to}} good women in his own family, and would not like to see her in a slangy fast set. All her own gaieties have been under Lady Kirkaldy's wing, or that of Mrs. William Egremont's relations, and only in a quiet {{moderate}} way. Her father gets his own old set about him, and they have not been very choice, but they are mostly elderly men, and gentlemen, and know how to behave themselves to her. Indeed, her cousin Blanche, who was here in the winter, gave us to understand that Ursula knows {{how to take care of}} herself, and gets laughed at as rather an old maidish model of propriety, if you <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> of your little Nuttie.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{he wished}} to succeed in that assembly,' replied Lord Montacute, 'I <b>can</b> easily <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> In all things an early {{initiation}} must be of advantage. But I have not that wish.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But to {{be accused}} after that fashion,--by her husband!" [...] said Violet. [...] "One <b>can</b> hardly <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> in these days. And of all women she is the last to deserve such accusation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>can</b> easily <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> Individuality {{runs through}} all we do, however {{seemingly}} mechanical. But are {{the points of}} a sort that you could make clear in court {{to the satisfaction of}} a jury?' ...|$|R
