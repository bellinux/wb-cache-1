50|$|<b>Control</b> <b>limits</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with tolerance limits or specifications, which are completely independent of the distribution of the plotted sample statistic. <b>Control</b> <b>limits</b> describe what a process is capable of producing (sometimes referred to as the “voice of the process”), while tolerances and specifications describe how the product should perform to meet the customer's expectations (referred to as the “voice of the customer”).|$|E
