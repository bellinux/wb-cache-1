500|$|Despite the {{recognition}} {{given to the}} film, Lee was not nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director (though he was nominated for the Golden Globe). The scholar Shu-mei Shih and the journalist <b>Clarence</b> <b>Page</b> have attributed this snub to Hollywood's racism against Lee, and Chinese cinema in general. Lee sought to avoid turning his omission into a scandal and specifically asked the Taiwan state media not {{to make it a}} [...] "national issue," [...] explaining that he endured more pressure when forced to act as his country's representative.|$|E
500|$|New York Times {{reporter}} Linda Greenhouse {{described the}} initial verdict as [...] "an anomaly, an extreme misuse of Government power {{in which an}} innocent person was led to commit a manufactured crime" [...] and thus not likely to signal a shift back in favor of defendants after a period that had seen a {{move away from the}} liberalism of the Warren and Burger Courts towards a more law-and-order–oriented Court. Editorialists at newspapers around the country – the Times, the Chicago Tribune, and the Washington Post – praised the court's decision, as did Jacobson's hometown paper, the Omaha World-Herald. Columnists {{on both sides of the}} political spectrum, from <b>Clarence</b> <b>Page</b> to William Safire joined in celebrating his turn of fate and criticizing the excessive zeal of the postal inspectors. Civil liberties advocates savored what they felt was an overdue triumph against the overreach of law enforcement during the preceding decade. [...] "... (W)hen the State gets behind a moral panic, no one is safe," [...] wrote Bob Chatelle of the political issues committee of the American Writers' Union, pointing to other zealous prosecutions of people with no demonstrable interest in child pornography who had nevertheless fallen afoul of newer laws by taking or possessing pictures of naked children with no apparent sexual content.|$|E

500|$|Many major {{editorial}} pages and columnists have been {{sympathetic to the}} supporters of the Jena Six. They have used the case to discuss broader trends of racism in the US criminal justice system and {{to call for a}} renewed civil rights movement. Most editorials were published {{around the time of the}} Jena rally. The New York Post, in a September 23, 2007, editorial, stated [...] "it's impossible to examine the case of the so-called Jena Six without concluding that these black teens have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, with a clearly racial double standard at work." [...] Byron Williams, writing on the Huffington Post, was one of several to cite the Urban League's 2005 finding that the average black male convicted of aggravated assault serves 48months in prison, one-third longer than a comparable white man. The 2005 report also found that a black male who is arrested is three times more likely to go to jail than a white male arrested for the same crime. Citing the same statistics, syndicated columnist <b>Clarence</b> <b>Page</b> wrote that [...] "The best legacy for the Jena March 6would be a new movement, dedicated this time to the reduction and elimination of unequal justice wherever it appears. I don't care who leads it, but it shouldn't be for blacks only." [...] Writing in the New York Times, Professor Orlando Patterson of Harvard University used the case to highlight the use of the prison system as a means of [...] "controlling young black men", which is one factor in a broader [...] "crisis in relations between men and women of all classes and, as a result, the catastrophic state of black family life".|$|E

5000|$|Investigation and {{planning}} for a water supply scheme for Innisfail commenced in 1926. Up until this time the community relied on tank water and water vendors, and despite {{being one of the}} wettest towns in Australia in terms of rainfall, there were water shortages during the dry months of the year. In 1930 the Irrigation and Water Supply Sub-Department of the Queensland Lands Department explored options and prepared designs for a gravity scheme relying on supply from Fisher's Creek; however the Shire did not pursue funding for it until 1932 when they renewed their application. Councillor <b>Clarence</b> Stanley Kopsen <b>Page,</b> Chairman of the Johnstone Shire Council and Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce at the time, was a strong advocate for the scheme, which he argued would allow the formation of a fire brigade, improve public health, allow drains and streets to be flushed as well as providing water for households and public gardens. The local newspaper, the Johnstone River Advocate, reported in August of that year that a prolonged dry spell had resulted in motor traffic causing [...] "... miniature desert storms on the dusty roads".|$|R
