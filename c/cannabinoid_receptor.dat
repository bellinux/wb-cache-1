25|$|Cannabis and {{a number}} of <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> {{agonists}} appear to be effective for neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these specialized cannabinoid {{receptors in the brain}} led researchers to the discovery of endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glyceride (2-AG). THC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during retrograde signaling, as the drug has a relatively low <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> efficacy and affinity. In populations of low <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> density, THC may act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy. THC is a lipophilic molecule and may bind non-specifically to a variety of entities in the brain and body, such as adipose tissue (fat).|$|E

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors,</b> numerous studies associate the endocannabinoid system with several physiological and pathological processes including cancer, appetite, fertility, memory, neuropathic and inflammatory pain, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases. Over the last two decades, several researches have been dedicated extensively on the <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> ligands since the direct activation of <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> results in several beneficial effects, in the brain and in the periphery...|$|R
50|$|In mice it was {{demonstrated}} that certain {{features of a}} runner's high depend on <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors.</b> Pharmacological or genetic disruption of cannabinoid signaling via <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> prevents the analgesic and anxiety-reducing effects of running.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are of a}} {{class of}} cell {{membrane}} receptors under the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. As is typical of G protein-coupled <b>receptors,</b> the <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> contain seven transmembrane spanning domains. [...] <b>Cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> are activated by three major groups of ligands: endocannabinoids, produced by the mammillary body; plant cannabinoids (such as Cannabidiol, produced by the cannabis plant); and synthetic cannabinoids (such as HU-210). All of the endocannabinoids and plant cannabinoids are lipophilic, such as fat soluble compounds.|$|R
25|$|On 13 June 2011, a {{study by}} Dr Matt Jones and Michal Kucewicz {{on the effects of}} <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> {{activation}} in the brain was published in The Journal of Neuroscience and the British medical journal The Lancet. The study was used in articles by CBS News, Le Figaro, and Bild among others.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{receptor}} types associated with the endocannabinoid signaling system; <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2). Both receptors are 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which inhibit the accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate within cells. CB1 receptors are present in highest concentration in the brain but {{can also be found}} in the periphery. CB2 receptors are mostly located in the immune and haematopoietic systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{actions of}} THC result from its partial agonist {{activity}} at the <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> CB1 (Ki=10nM), located mainly in the central nervous system, and the CB2 receptor (Ki=24nM), mainly expressed in cells of the immune system. The psychoactive effects of THC are primarily mediated by the activation of cannabinoid receptors, which result in {{a decrease in the}} concentration of the second messenger molecule cAMP through inhibition of adenylate cyclase.|$|E
50|$|Separation {{between the}} therapeutically {{undesirable}} psychotropic effects, and the clinically desirable ones, however, {{has not been}} reported with agonists that bind to <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors.</b> THC, {{as well as the}} two major endogenous compounds identified so far that bind to the <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> —anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG)— produce most of their effects by binding to both the CB1 and CB2 <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors.</b> While the effects mediated by CB1, mostly in the central nervous system, have been thoroughly investigated, those mediated by CB2 are not equally well defined.|$|R
50|$|Before the 1980s, it {{was often}} speculated that cannabinoids {{produced}} their physiological and behavioral effects via nonspecific interaction with cell membranes, instead of interacting with specific membrane-bound receptors. The discovery of the first <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> in the 1980s helped to resolve this debate. These receptors are common in animals, and {{have been found in}} mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles. At present, there are two known types of <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors,</b> termed CB1 and CB2, with mounting evidence of more. The human brain has more <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> than any other G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) type.|$|R
50|$|Anandamide's {{effects can}} occur in either the central or {{peripheral}} nervous system. These distinct effects are mediated primarily by CB1 <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> in the central nervous system, and CB2 <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> in the periphery. The latter are mainly involved in functions of the immune system. <b>Cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> were originally discovered as being sensitive to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, commonly called THC), which is the primary psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis. The discovery of anandamide came from research into CB1 and CB2, as {{it was inevitable that}} a naturally occurring (endogenous) chemical would be found to affect these receptors.|$|R
25|$|The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a {{biological}} system composed of endocannabinoids, which are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> proteins that are expressed throughout the mammalian {{central nervous system}} (including the brain) and peripheral nervous system. The endocannabinoid system is involved in regulating a variety of physiological and cognitive processes including fertility, pregnancy, during pre- and postnatal development, appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the pharmacological effects of cannabis. The ECS is also involved in mediating some of the physiological and cognitive effects of voluntary physical exercise in humans and other animals, such as contributing to exercise-induced euphoria as well as modulating locomotor activity and motivational salience for rewards. In humans, the plasma concentration of certain endocannabinoids (i.e., anandamide) {{have been found to}} rise during physical activity; since endocannabinoids can effectively penetrate the blood–brain barrier, {{it has been suggested that}} anandamide, along with other euphoriant neurochemicals, contributes to the development of exercise-induced euphoria in humans, a state colloquially referred to as a runner's high.|$|E
25|$|For centuries hashish and {{marijuana}} from the Indian hemp Cannabis sativa L. {{have been used}} for medicinal and recreational purposes. In 1840, Schlesinger S. was apparently the first investigator to obtain an active extract from the leaves and flowers of hemp. A few years later, in 1848, Decourtive E. described the preparation of an ethanol extract that on evaporation of the solvent gave a dark resin, which he named “cannabin”. In 1964 the main active constituent of C. sativa L., Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was isolated and synthesized by Mechoulam's laboratory. Two types of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, responsible for the effects of THC were discovered and cloned in the early 1990s. Once cannabinoid receptors had been discovered, it became important to establish whether their agonists occur naturally in the body. This search led to the discovery of the first endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid), anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide). Later on other endocannabinoids were found, for example 2-AG (2-arachidonoyl glycerol). These findings raised further questions about the pharmacological and physiological role of the cannabinoid system. This revived the research on <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonists which were expected to help answer these questions. The use of the cannabinoid agonist, THC, in its many preparations to enhance appetite is a well known fact. This fact led to the logical extension that blocking of the cannabinoid receptors might be useful in decreasing appetite and food intake. It was then discovered that the blockage of the CB1 receptor represented a new pharmacological target. The first specific CB1 receptor antagonist / inverse agonist was rimonabant, discovered in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemical}} messengers {{presumed to}} be responsible for mediating depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition was discovered by three separate groups in 2001. [...] Wilson & Nicoll (2001) published their work in the prestigious journal, Nature, while the other two groups, Kreitzer & Regehr (2001) and Ohno-Shosaku et al. (2001), published in the same issue of another reputable journal, Neuron. [...] All three demonstrated heavy involvement of the CB1 <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> in depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, suggesting that the endocannabinoids were the brain's mediators of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. [...] They showed that <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> agonists, drugs that mimic the actions of endocannabinoids or THC, could evoke the same reduction in inhibitory currents caused by depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. [...] They also demonstrated that depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition could be prevented by <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonists, drugs that block the actions of cannabinoid compounds.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Marijuana is {{a widely}} used illicit drug and its {{consumption}} during pregnancy {{has been associated with}} adverse reproductive outcomes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of chronic intake of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major component of marijuana, on trophoblast function, placental development, and birth outcomes. Methods: The pathological characteristics and distribution of <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> in placenta were observed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Cell migration in response to THC was measured by transwell assays. The levels of <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT 3) were detected by western blot. Results: We found the placenta expressed two main <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors,</b> suggesting that THC induced biological responses in placental cells. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed dramatic alterations of placental morphology in marijuana users. Using THC and inhibitors of <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors,</b> we demonstrated that THC impaired trophoblast cell migration and invasion partly via <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors.</b> Additionally, pregnant mice injected with THC showed adverse reproductive events including reduced number of fetuses, lower maternal and placental weights. Mechanistically, STAT 3 signaling pathway was involved in the THC-induced suppression of trophoblast cell motility and pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: Our study indicates that the STAT 3 signaling pathway plays a critical role in THC-induced trophoblast dysfunction...|$|R

2500|$|A study {{published}} in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that [...] "there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans" [...] and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart. Gettman claims that the discovery of the <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> system in the late 1980s revolutionized scientific understanding of cannabis' effects and provided further evidence that it does not belong in Schedule I.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> is {{a typical}} member of the largest known family of receptors called a G protein-coupled receptor. A {{signature}} {{of this type of}} receptor is the distinct pattern of how the receptor molecule spans the cell membrane seven times. The location of cannabinoid receptors exists on the cell membrane, and both outside (extracellularly) and inside (intracellularly) the cell membrane. CB1 receptors, the bigger of the two, are extraordinarily abundant in the brain: 10 times more plentiful than μ-opioid receptors, the receptors responsible for the effects of morphine. CB2 receptors are structurally different (the sequence similarity [...] between the two subtypes of receptors is 44%), found only on cells of the immune system, and seems to function similarly to its CB1 counterpart. CB2 receptors are most commonly prevalent on B-cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes, but can also be found on polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells, T8 cells, and T4 cells. In the tonsils the CB2 receptors appear to be restricted to B-lymphocyte-enriched areas.|$|E
2500|$|On July 10, 1995, Jon Gettman and High Times Magazine filed another {{rescheduling}} petition {{with the}} DEA. This time, {{instead of focusing}} on cannabis' medical uses, the petitioners claimed that cannabis did not have the [...] "high potential for abuse" [...] required for Schedule I or Schedule II status. They based their claims on studies of the brain's <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor</b> system conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) between 1988 and 1994. In particular, they claim that a 1992 study by M. Herkenham et al., [...] "using a lesion-technique, established that there are no cannabinoid receptors in the dopamine-producing areas of the brain". Other studies, summarized in Gettman's 1997 report Dopamine and the Dependence Liability of Marijuana, showed that cannabis has only an indirect effect on dopamine transmission. This suggested that cannabis' psychoactive effects are produced by a different mechanism than addictive drugs such as amphetamine, cocaine, ethanol, nicotine, and opiates. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, however, continued to publish literature denying this finding. For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: ...|$|E

40|$|The endocannabinoid 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) regulates {{neurotransmission}} and neuroinflammation by activating CB 1 <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> on neurons and CB 2 <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> on microglia.

ABHD 6 was expressed by neurons in primary culture and its inhibition led to activity-dependent accumulation of 2 -AG. In adult mouse cortex, ABHD 6 was located postsynaptically and its selective inhibition allowed the induction of CB 1 -dependent long-term depression by otherwise subthreshold stimulation. Our results indicate that ABHD 6 is a rate-limiting step of 2 -AG signaling and is therefore a bona fide member of the endocannabinoid signaling system...|$|R
40|$|Metabotropic {{glutamate}} (mGlu) and <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> are G-protein coupled receptors {{which have}} shown synaptic co-operation through small lipid messengers {{in the central}} nervous system (CNS). A functional interaction between these two receptor families could have a relevant potential in the treatment of CNS disorders, including chronic pain.

In particular, as both mGlu and <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> have been found in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a crucial station in the pain modulatory system, these receptors could be a substrate for producing analgesia at this level. In this review we aim to briefly illustrate the role of mGlu and can-nabinoid receptors in controlling nociceptive processes, some points of convergence, and their functional interaction in pain processing. Further insights into this functional linkage between the mGlu and <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> could pave the way to a new strategy for pain relief, such as a drug cocktail acting on cannabinoid/metabotropic glutamate receptors...|$|R
2500|$|A <b>{{cannabinoid}}</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist, {{also known}} simply as a cannabinoid antagonist or as an anticannabinoid, {{is a type of}} cannabinoidergic drug that binds to cannabinoid receptors (CBR) and prevents their activation by endocannabinoids. They include antagonists, inverse agonists, and antibodies of CBRs. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system {{led to the development of}} CB1 receptor antagonists. The first CBR antagonist, rimonabant, was described in 1994. Rimonabant blocks the CB1 receptor selectively and has been shown to decrease food intake and regulate body-weight gain. The prevalence of obesity worldwide is increasing dramatically and has a great impact on public health. The lack of efficient and well-tolerated drugs to cure obesity has led to an increased interest [...] in research and development of CBR antagonists. Cannabidiol (CBD), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, is a non-competitive CB1/CB2 receptor antagonist. And Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, modulate the effects of THC via direct blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, thus behaving like first-generation CB1 receptor inverse agonists, such as rimonabant. CBD is a very low-affinity CB1 ligand, that can nevertheless affect CB1 receptor activity in vivo in an indirect manner, while THCV is a high-affinity CB1 receptor ligand and potent antagonist in vitro and yet only occasionally produces effects in vivo resulting from CB1 receptor antagonism. THCV has also high affinity for CB2 receptors and signals as a partial agonist, differing from both CBD and rimonabant.|$|E
2500|$|While {{working with}} the cerebellum, Kreitzer's group also {{discovered}} that depolarization of Purkinje cells could also cause a temporary reduction in excitatory input into these cells from both climbing fibres and parallel fibres (Kreitzer et al. 2001b). [...] This phenomenon was termed depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), and differs from DSI only {{by the kind of}} neurotransmitter whose release is reduced. [...] In the case of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, the result is a reduction in inhibitory GABA release, while in DSE the effect is a reduction in excitatory glutamate release. [...] DSE was also found to occur in other regions of the brain, however the evidence for the involvement of the endocannabinoid receptor CB1 in this process is not as solid as it is for DSI. [...] Both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE have been studied in the CB1 knock-out mice. [...] Some groups show that both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE are lacking in these mice, while others have shown that DSE, but not depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, can still be evoked in the knock-outs (Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2002, Hajos et al. 2001). [...] The endocannabinoids may still mediate DSE too, but by acting at a yet unknown <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptor.</b> [...] Interestingly, some work has shown that anandamide can bind to the vannilloid receptor VR1, the receptor responsible for mediating the effects of capsaicin. [...] This receptor is present in the brain, and anandamide actions at this receptor may potentially contribute to DSE (Cristino et al. 2006, Hajos et al. 2002).

The synaptic underpinning of cocaine-cannabinoid receptor interaction is however, obscure. We have studied electrophysiologically the sensitivity of <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> modulating synaptic transmission in the striatum of rats exposed to cocaine. One-day treatment with cocaine did not modify the synaptic response to HU 210, a <b>cannabinoid</b> CB 1 <b>receptor</b> agonist.

The <b>cannabinoid</b> receptor-induced modulation of glutamate transmission was unaltered by cocaine. Furthermore, the effects of chronic cocaine on cannabinoid-mediated regulation of striatal GABA synapses were attenuated {{one week after the}} discontinuation of cocaine, and absent two weeks later, indicating the progressive reversibility of the adaptations of cannabinoid system during abstinence of drug consumption.

25|$|Cannabinoids usually {{contain a}} 1,1'-di-methyl-pyran ring, a variedly derivatized {{aromatic}} ring and a variedly unsaturated cyclohexyl ring and their immediate chemical precursors, constituting {{a family of}} about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds.

40|$|AbstractSince <b>cannabinoid</b> <b>receptors</b> inhibit {{excitatory}} synaptic transmission {{by reducing}} glutamate release, we have examined whether this might occur through the direct inhibition of presynaptic Ca 2 + channels.
