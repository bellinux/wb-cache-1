40|$|M. A. This study {{focuses on}} empirically {{determining}} the branding role that product labelling plays {{as a strategic}} element in Integrated Marketing <b>Communication</b> <b>functioning</b> within the food and beverage industry. This research topic was selected {{for a number of}} reasons. Firstly, there is a general misconception of the definition of the term Integrated Marketing Communication. Secondly, there is also an emergence of the perception that labelling plays an important role as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing <b>Communication</b> <b>functioning.</b> Thirdly, there is also speculation regarding what this actual role is, that labelling plays within the Integrated Marketing <b>Communication</b> <b>functioning.</b> Fourthly, on closer investigation, it becomes evident that although there is a degree of literaturebased evidence that identifies the role that product labelling plays (within Integrated Marketing Communication), as that of branding, there is no empirical research to substantiate these claims. For these combined reasons there is a direct need for research into these issues. To facilitate the effective fulfilment of the research goals, there was a thorough examination of the theoretical literature available and the completion of an empirical study. Furthermore {{it was found that the}} examination of the branding role that product labelling plays as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing <b>Communication</b> <b>functioning</b> would be attainable if the research goal was restricted to a manageable field. To satisfy this aim, the study was focused on the food and beverage industry. The key terms of branding as well as Integrated Marketing Communication were investigated and defined. From the literature available, the branding role that product labelling plays as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing <b>Communication</b> <b>functioning</b> was examined and also defined. From this context it was found that ample evidence was available to conduct empirical research into this area. It became clear that the identification of the branding role that product labelling plays as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing <b>Communication</b> <b>functioning</b> within the food and beverage industry would rest upon the identification of the transmission of functional and non-functional attributes, consequences and values to consumers via verbal and visual images. The method best suited to identifying the transmission of these values was shown to be that of qualitative research. The proof of the transmission of these functions within the sample formed the focus of the empirical study. Ultimately this proof would illustrate the branding role of labelling. Within the context of the qualitative research, it was shown that the most appropriate approach to identify the transmission of functionality was through the use of the Means-end theory utilising the laddering technique. Within the context of the research document through the laddering technique, it also became apparent that there is a clear role that product labelling plays as a strategic element in Integrated Marketing <b>Communication</b> <b>functioning</b> within the food and beverage industry. It is also evident through literature-based and empirical evidence that this role is one ofbranding...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine the role of {{specific}} social cognitive skills in psychosocial and relational adjustment to a chronic illness. The particular chronic illness investigated in this study was female breast cancer, and 30 married heterosexual couples facing the onset and treatment of breast cancer volunteered to be participants. The study was founded on the premise that chronic illness often presents as much of a social and relational challenge as it does a physical challenge. Based on this premise, the study's central argument was that persons equipped with relatively more sophisticated interpersonal communication skills would receive higher ratings of their <b>communication</b> <b>functioning</b> by their partners, express higher levels of marital satisfaction, and (in the case of wives) exhibit better psychosocial adjustment than would persons with less sophisticated communication skills. A significant association was revealed between participants' construct differentiation and message design logic. Contrary to predictions, no relationship was found between participants' social cognitive skills and partners' ratings of participants' <b>communication</b> <b>functioning,</b> or between participants' social cognitive skills and partners' assessments of global relationship satisfaction. A positive trend for wives and a significant positive association for husbands were found for the predicted relationship between participants' assessments of their partners' <b>communication</b> <b>functioning</b> and their own global relationship satisfaction. Partial support was provided for the predicted associations between wives' social cognitive skills and their own psychosocial adjustment to breast cancer, and between wives' social cognitive skills and their assessments of partners' <b>communication</b> <b>functioning.</b> Additional analyses revealed that wives' global relationship satisfaction was significantly associated with time since diagnosis and disease stage, whereas husbands' global relationship satisfaction was significantly associated with time since diagnosis only. Supplemental analyses also indicated several hypothesis-disconfirming negative associations between participants' social cognitive skills and participants' assessments of partners' <b>communication</b> <b>functioning,</b> global relationship satisfaction, and wives' psychosocial adjustment to breast cancer. These associations were found, however, only for couples wherein partners had highly discrepant construct differentiation scores. Despite providing only mixed support for the study's central argument, the study's results present several interesting findings that warrant further investigation. Intervention implications are also identified...|$|R
