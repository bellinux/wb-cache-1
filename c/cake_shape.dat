40|$|The energy {{spectrum}} of <b>cake</b> <b>shape</b> normal - superconducting systems is calculated by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We {{take into account}} the mismatch in the effective masses and Fermi energies of the normal and superconducting regions as well as the potential barrier at the interface. In the case of a perfect interface and without mismatch, the energy levels are treated by semi-classics. Analytical expressions for the density of states and its integral, the step function, are derived and compared with that obtained from exact numerics. We find a very good agreement between the two calculations. It is shown that the spectrum possesses an energy gap and the density of states is singular {{at the edge of the}} gap. The effect of the mismatch and the potential barrier on the gap is also investigated. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Tecnologias Ambientais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaDetergents are {{substances}} or preparations containing soaps {{or other}} surfactants intend for water based laundry or dishwashing processes. Detergents {{may be used}} in any form (liquid, powder, paste, bar, <b>cake,</b> <b>shape,</b> etc,) widely for household laundry products, domestic and industrial cleaners, cosmetic products, and industrial purposes. Surfactants are organic substances, used in detergents, intentionally added to achieve cleaning, rising and/or fabric softening due to its surface-active properties. They consist of one or more hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of such nature and size that they are capable of forming micelles. Surfactants belong to a group of chemicals of high environment relevance due to their large production volumes. They are mainly discharged into the environment by the wastewater pathway, either after treatment in a wastewater treatment plant or directly where no treatment is available. Environmental compartments, which may be influenced by surfactants, are the fresh water environment (water body and sediments), the soil if surfactants loaded sewage sludge is added, and the marine environment. The wastewaters of detergent manufacturing contain high levels of inhibitory surfactants that pose appreciable impacts on the environment. In addition to industrial wastewaters, domestic wastewater also includes synthetic organic compounds like surfactants, personal-care products, additives that have severe effects on wildlife and human health due to their toxicological properties. Therefore there is a growing research need on the inhibitory effects and removal of such compounds. Linear alkyl benzene sulphonates (LAS) and sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) {{play an important role in}} our everyday, since they have been announced as biodegradable and environmentally friendly surfactants compared to branched benzene sulphonates like Dodecyl Benzene Sulphonates. LAS are known as biodegradable due to the linear structure of the alkyl benzene group present in this molecular structure. However, it has also been reported that surfactants, specifically linear alkyl benzene sulphonates decrease the affinity of substrate to biomass and lower maximum growth rates are observed in the presence of surfactants. Sodium lauryl ether sulphate consists of straight carbon chains, usually 12 to 14, and, due to its more simple structure (i. e., no benzene ring), it can be more easily biodegradable than other surfactants such as LAS. Biodegradation is an important factor for reduction and removal of organic contaminants from the environment. The evaluation of biodegradability of anthropogenic organic substances is an essential parameter for environmental risk assessment and required according to appropriate legislation. In a risk assessment study it has been pointed out that the risk imposed on the aquatic by the anionic surfactants depends upon the applied treatment scheme prior to discharge of wastewater. [...] RESUMO O presente trabalho foi desenvolvido numa indústria de produtos de limpeza doméstica (LD) e higiene pessoal (HP), onde está implementada uma estação de tratamento de águas residuais industriais (ETARI). Durante o estudo foi monitorizada e avaliada a biodegradabilidade de algumas substâncias base dos detergentes (tensoactivos aniónicos), nomeadamente o LAS e o SLES, bem como o efluente da indústria nas diferentes fases de tratamento implementado na ETARI. Ao longo do processo de tratamento dos fluxos que compõem as águas residuais industriais, procurou-se estabelecer relações entre parâmetros chave de avaliação do conteúdo em matéria orgânica (Carência Química Oxigénio – CQO e Carência Bioquímica Oxigénio – CBO) com os tensoactivos anteriormente referidos. Os resultados obtidos na caracterização do efluente industrial nas diferentes fases do tratamento implementado mostram eficiências de remoção de CQO na ordem dos 20 % no processo de bioxidação, de 78 % no processo físico-químico de coagulação/floculação, sendo a eficiência global do processo de tratamento integrado da ordem dos 82 %. No que se refere ao teor de tensoactivos aniónicos foram alcançadas eficiências de remoção na ordem dos 16 e 94 % respectivamente, para os processos de oxidação e físico-químico, e de 95 % quando considerado todo o processo de tratamento implementado...|$|E
