500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, {{as much of it}} is often {{interpreted}} to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown {{seems to me to be}} about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicing—like the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing your boss. It's about <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you're going to shoot him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house.

2500|$|And {{what they}} {{believed}} Churchill to have said, under Connick, was disruptive enough to justify adverse action {{regardless of whether it}} addressed a public concern, which the plurality declined to decide.

[...] Perkins-Graham herself had told Davis she didn't think the hospital could [...] "tolerate that kind of negativism" [...] much longer, and if Churchill had indeed denied the possibility of getting along with Waters, Churchill's continued effectiveness as a nurse under Waters' supervision could be reasonably expected to be diminished.|$|E
2500|$|The Productivity Commission in its 2004 Inquiry Report No. 28, First Home Ownership, concluded: [...] "Growth in {{immigration}} {{since the mid-1990s}} {{has been an important}} contributor to underlying demand, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne." [...] The Reserve Bank of Australia in its submission to the same Productivity Commission report stated that [...] "rapid growth in overseas visitors such as students may have boosted demand for rental housing". However, the Commission found that [...] "the ABS resident population estimates have limitations when used for assessing housing demand. Given the significant influx of foreigners <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or study in Australia in recent years, it seems highly likely that short-stay visitor movements may have added to the demand for housing. However, the Commissions are unaware of any research that quantifies the effects." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan David Good {{was born}} on December 7, 1985 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Much of his wrestling persona is based on his own real-life {{upbringing}} in Cincinnati's East End, where {{he spent much of}} his childhood in public housing. His father, who worked in Indianapolis 70 miles away, was largely absent in Good's life and Good has gone on to say that his biggest accomplishment since joining WWE was being able to buy a house for his mother away from the rough neighborhoods in Cincinnati. An avid wrestling fan who idolized Bret Hart as a child, Good used wrestling as an escape from his rough upbringing by immersing himself in wrestling videotapes and reading stories about wrestling's earlier days. A year after beginning to train as a wrestler, he dropped out of high school, which he later compared to Peter Gibbons from the movie Office Space <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and [...] "checking out".|$|E
