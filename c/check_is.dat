5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this <b>check</b> <b>is</b> moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E
5|$|Not {{until the}} 21st century did players and analysts begin to revive Black's chances in this line. First, Watson {{showed that the}} {{disruptive}} check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the point being that after 10.g3 White is {{no longer able to}} bring the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it can assist in White's kingside attack. Later players such as Gashimov showed that the queen <b>check</b> <b>is</b> not mandatory, and that Black also retains good chances in the line 9...0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4, taking advantage of the outpost on b4.|$|E
30|$|Yamanouchi et al. [11] {{reported}} that the total widths of surface <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> different among the six sugi cultivars, {{but they did not}} discuss the factors affecting the differences. In this study, the total lengths of surface <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> different among cultivars (Fig.  2; Table  3). The total length of the surface <b>checks</b> <b>was</b> positively correlated with the tangential shrinkage when all surface <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> included, and was correlated with tangential and radial shrinkage when the short-end <b>checks</b> <b>were</b> excluded. On the other hand, the total length of surface <b>checks</b> <b>was</b> not correlated with the tangential/radial shrinkage ratio or the BD. This result suggests that the surface-check variation among cultivars is affected by tangential shrinkage, which varies among cultivars due to the variation in MFA [7].|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the limited}} padding worn by players, body <b>checking</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} disallowed in floor hockey games, although shoulder-to-shoulder <b>checking</b> <b>is</b> allowed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Check</b> kiting <b>is</b> {{illegal in}} many countries. However, a {{majority}} of countries {{do not have a}} float system and <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> not paid until they <b>are</b> cleared, so <b>check</b> kiting <b>is</b> impossible.|$|R
5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional <b>check</b> <b>is</b> the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints {{should be placed on}} the wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a <b>check</b> <b>is</b> a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to the}} Guam and CNMI {{visa waiver}} program for certain countries, an {{eligibility}} pre-clearance <b>check</b> <b>is</b> carried on Guam for flights to the States. For travel from the Northern Mariana Islands to Guam, a pre-flight passport and visa <b>check</b> <b>is</b> performed before boarding the flight to Guam. On flights from Guam to the Northern Mariana Islands, no immigration <b>check</b> <b>is</b> performed. Traveling between Guam and the States through a foreign point, however, does require a passport.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{difference}} between women's and men's ice hockey <b>is</b> that body <b>checking</b> <b>is</b> {{not allowed in}} women's hockey. After the 1990 Women's World Championship, body <b>checking</b> <b>was</b> eliminated in women's hockey. In current IIHF women's competition, body <b>checking</b> <b>is</b> either a minor or major penalty, decided at the referee's discretion. In addition, players in women's competition are required to wear protective full-face masks.|$|R

25|$|Other leagues {{typically}} assess {{penalties for}} additional infractions. For example, most adult social leagues and women's hockey leagues ban all body checking (a penalty for roughing or illegal <b>check</b> <b>is</b> called), {{and in most}} amateur leagues, any head contact whatsoever results in a penalty. If a player pulls down another female's ponytail, they will be charged with a game misconduct penalty.|$|E
25|$|Poke check: When the goaltender {{wants to}} poke the puck {{away from an}} {{opposing}} player, he quickly slides his hand up the stick, thrusting forward towards the puck. An improperly played poke <b>check</b> <b>is</b> a risky play; the goaltender may miss, and the puck-carrier will be left with an unguarded net. In tight situations, a quick, hard jab could be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{check digits}} enable the sending bank (or its customer) {{to perform a}} sanity check of the routing {{destination}} and account number from a single string of data {{at the time of}} data entry. This <b>check</b> <b>is</b> guaranteed to detect any instances where a single character has been omitted, duplicated, mistyped or where two characters have been transposed. Thus routing and account number errors are virtually eliminated.|$|E

5000|$|Certain {{cracks in}} logs are {{referred}} to as [...] "checks" [...] or [...] "checking." [...] <b>Checking</b> <b>is</b> part of the natural drying process of the wood and normally does not affect the structural integrity of the log. <b>Checks</b> <b>are</b> cracks that run vertically (with the grain).

50|$|Background <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> often {{requested}} by employers on job candidates for employment screening, especially on candidates seeking {{a position that}} requires high security or a position of trust, such as in a school, courthouse, hospital, financial institution, airport, and government. These <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> traditionally administered by a government agency for a nominal fee, but can also be administered by private companies. Background <b>checks</b> can <b>be</b> expensive depending on the information requested. Results of a background check typically include past employment verification, credit history, and criminal history. The objective of backround <b>checks</b> <b>is</b> {{to ensure the safety}} and security of the employees in the organisation.|$|R
25|$|While {{copper and}} {{stainless}} steel domestic hot water tanks are more commonplace in Europe, carbon steel tanks are {{more common in the}} United States, where typically the periodic <b>check</b> <b>is</b> neglected, the tank develops a leak whereupon the entire appliance is replaced.

30|$|These QC <b>checks</b> <b>are</b> not {{necessarily}} {{performed at the}} same time.

25|$|An {{additional}} {{aspect of}} the in-office <b>check</b> <b>is</b> to examine any events that were stored since the last follow-up. These are typically stored based on specific criteria set by the physician and specific to the patient. Some devices have the availability to display intracardiac electrograms of {{the onset of the}} event as well as the event itself. This is especially helpful in diagnosing the cause or origin of the event and making any necessary programming changes.|$|E
25|$|Roughing: Pushing or shoving {{after the}} whistle has been blown {{or when it}} takes place away from the play (often called against a player from each team, {{resulting}} in a coincidental minors situation, but can also be called on a single player); also called when the hands make contact with an opponent's head/face on an otherwise legal check; called in non-checking leagues when a body <b>check</b> <b>is</b> made. Non-checking leagues may also refer to this penalty as simply 'body checking'.|$|E
25|$|The term sock puppet {{refers to}} {{multiple}} pseudonyms in {{use by the}} same person on a particular message board or forum. The analogy of a sock puppet is of a puppeteer holding up both hands and supplying dialogue to both puppets simultaneously. A typical use of a sockpuppet account is to agree with or debate another sockpuppet account belonging to the same person, {{for the purposes of}} reinforcing the puppeteer's position in an argument. Sock puppets are usually found when an IP address <b>check</b> <b>is</b> done on the accounts in forums.|$|E
