Cofilin is recognized as a key regulator that promotes actin depolymerization. In this study, we show that although pure cofilin can disassemble Listeria monocytogenes actin <b>comet</b> <b>tails,</b> it cannot efficiently disassemble <b>comet</b> <b>tails</b> in the presence of polymerizable actin. Thymus extracts also rapidly disassemble <b>comet</b> <b>tails,</b> and this reaction is more efficient than pure cofilin when normalized to cofilin concentration. By biochemica...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPolymerization of actin {{filaments}} {{is necessary}} for both protrusion of {{the leading edge of}} crawling cells and propulsion of certain intracellular pathogens [1], and it is sufficient for generating force for bacterial motility in vitro [2]. Motile intracellular pathogens are associated with actin-rich <b>comet</b> <b>tails</b> containing many of the same molecular components present in lamellipodia [3], and this suggests that these two systems use a similar mechanism for motility. However, available structural evidence suggests that the organization of <b>comet</b> <b>tails</b> differs from that of lamellipodia. Actin filaments in lamellipodia form branched arrays [4], which are thought to arise by dendritic nucleation mediated by the Arp 2 / 3 complex [5, 6]. In contrast, <b>comet</b> <b>tails</b> have been variously described as consisting of short, randomly oriented filaments [7], with a higher degree of alignment at the periphery [8], or as containing long, straight axial filaments with a small number of oblique filaments [9]. Because the assembly of pathogen-associated <b>comet</b> <b>tails</b> {{has been used as a}} model system for lamellipodial protrusion, it is important to resolve this apparent discrepancy. Here, using a platinum replica approach, we show that actin filament arrays in <b>comet</b> <b>tails</b> in fact have a dendritic organization with the Arp 2 / 3 complex localizing to Y-junctions as in lamellipodia [10]. Thus, <b>comet</b> <b>tails</b> and lamellipodia appear to share a common dendritic nucleation mechanism for protrusive motility. However, <b>comet</b> <b>tails</b> differ from lamellipodia in that their actin filaments are usually twisted and appear to be under significant torsional stress...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{broadcasters}} modified {{their cameras}} to have ACT, but retro fitting ACT/HOP {{was not an}} easy modification as 4 new HOP camera tubes would be needed, the tube bases, wiring harness, 4 head amplifiers and 4 video amplifiers and the tube beam current boards would all have needed work done to them. ACT and HOP works by using an extra electrode in the tube to 'flood discharge' the target during the flyback period. Great care was needed in setting up the HOP voltages as damage to the tube’s emission could occur. Once fitted, the ACT circuits were adjusted so that the <b>Comet</b> <b>Tail</b> doesn't appear as a [...] "blob". Even when ACT circuits had been retro-fitted, comet tails would sometimes occur, consisting of either a mix of two separate colours, one colour inside the other (e.g. a <b>comet</b> <b>tail</b> that is red with a smaller <b>comet</b> <b>tail</b> inside that one that may be green), or the <b>comet</b> <b>tail</b> may be a non primary colour, such as pink. The problems occurred when the settings of the ACT circuits were not well matched.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an already}} {{infected}} [...] "donor" [...] cell, the Listeria bacterium expresses ActA, {{which results in}} formation of the actin <b>comet</b> <b>tail</b> and movement of the bacterium throughout the cytoplasm. When the bacterium encounters the donor cell membrane, it will either ricochet off it or adhere to it and begin to push outwards, distending the membrane and forming a protrusion of 3-18 μm. The close interaction between the bacterium and the host cell membrane is thought to depend on Ezrin, {{a member of the}} ERM family of membrane-associated proteins. Ezrin attaches the actin-propelled bacterium to the plasma membrane by crosslinking the actin <b>comet</b> <b>tail</b> to the membrane, and maintains this interaction throughout the protrusion process.|$|E

The selection of moving targets is considerably more difficult and error prone than traditional stationary target selection. In this paper, we introduce <b>Comet</b> <b>Tails</b> and Target Lock, two techniques that support the selection of moving targets. Our goal is to facilitate accurate and fast selection of moving targets. We compare our two techniques to unassisted selection in a controlled experiment. The results show that for moving target selection, <b>Comet</b> <b>Tails</b> and Target Lock can outperform unassisted selection, and result in fewer errors.
