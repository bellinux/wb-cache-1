This argument {{is based on the}} idea that patents are fully constituted property rights, providing patentees with a default level of entitlement and would undoubtedly [...] "skew the utilitarian calculus of animal welfare to the advantage of human animals and to the detriment of non-human animals." [...] For that reason, Wendy Adams has argued that the ethical review of the treatment of animals should be an additional <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>patentability.</b> Others have argued that animal welfare issues that may arise in the course of patent applications are based on the fact that animals are considered property and these issues are best dealt with outside the confines of the Patent Act.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{makes an}} {{historical}} and contemporaneous analysis of patenting of methods of medical treatment {{of human beings}} in Australia and other common law jurisdictions that derived their origin from the UK law. The issue of patenting of methods of medical treatment has never been an easy question to discuss for it raises public policy considerations surrounding this area. The main difficulty derives from {{the conflict between the}} intellectual property and practice of medicine. There is a public policy concern that in order to ensure the best possible health treatment, physicians must always be free in their choice of treatment. Since a patent may restrict this freedom, many countries around the globe prohibit methods of medical treatment from being granted patent protection. Yet, Australian courts decided to depart from those exclusions. This thesis examines how courts deal with express exclusions of patents for method of medical treatment and how such exclusions can be avoided by creative drafting of patent specifications. It will also examine the approach taken in Australia where there are no express exclusions. It first provides the descriptive background of the case law in UK, Member States of the European Patent Convention, Canada, Israel, New Zealand, US and Australia {{in order to make a}} comparative analysis of the approaches adopted in these countries in dealing with the issue, and in order to establish the framework around which the doctrinal issues can be analysed. Against this background an examination of the origins of the patent law is necessary in order to fully assess the interpretation of patent legislation by courts and consequences of such interpretation for medical profession. The thesis investigates the pre-enacting history of the 1624 Statute of Monopolies in order to analyse whether patenting of methods of medical treatment of human beings is 'generally inconvenient' within the meaning of the proviso to s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies, which in turn, form a part of s 18 (1) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth). The analysis of early patent law cases at the time they were argued and decided will lead to the conclusion that the actual original meaning of the term 'generally inconvenient' has been wrongly interpreted and applied by modern courts. The thesis considers the role of the courts in deciding whether methods of medical treatment should be granted patent protection and whether judges should and/or have ability to make moral or public policy judgments in interpreting statutes. The thesis explore the consequences of interpretation of 'generally inconvenient' as a main public policy objection to granting patents for methods of medical treatment. It concludes that it is questionable whether the term 'generally inconvenient' includes public policy considerations in its scope, and though there may be some circumstances where a patent to method of medical treatment should be rejected on public policy grounds, 'generally inconvenient' does not provide a basis upon which patents to methods of medical treatment can be denied. The thesis is that such methods should not be expressly excluded from patenting. Each method must be treated equally with other inventions and examined on its merits, on case by case basis. The tensions associated with patents for methods of medical treatment can be resolved within patent legislation by making the public policy ground for objection a separate <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>patentability,</b> equally relevant for any invention. Accordingly, the author argues that legislative amendments are necessary to rectify the existing problem and makes a number of proposals to this effect. The author also suggests the involvement of an independent body to make public policy decisions...|$|E

Changes which have been proposed to deal with these problems, including empirical supporting evidence, are discussed.

The proposed legislation addresses {{such issues as}} the assumed insufficiency of the inventive step requirement in preventing unjustified “monopolies”, the proliferation of so-called secondary patents, and the extension of market exclusivity positions through strategic filings, which are being debated also in Europe and the US. In analyzing the reform attempt, this article pursues two purposes.

Second, it examines whether the changes proposed by Bill No. 5402 / 13 are consistent with its proclaimed goals, such as the aim to reserve patent protection only to “genuine innovations”, to hamper so-called “evergreening” practices by pharmaceutical applicants and to foster incremental innovations by domestic actors. Specific attention is given in this regard to the proposals to introduce: (i) as separate <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> <b>patentability</b> a “significant technical advance” in all technological fields and an “enhanced efficacy” in the chemical sector; (ii) a general prohibition of use patents; and (iii) a pre-grant and post-grant opposition system...|$|R
40|$|The {{lack of a}} solid set of <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> {{determining}} <b>patentability</b> {{of subject}} matter - particularly subject matter dealing with life - has recently been of increasing public concern in the United States. Alarm for patent practices related to life systems ranges from patents being granted on biochemical processes and the knowledge of these processes to the patenting of entire organisms. One of the most volatile concerns is the patenting of human genes or parts of genes since this genetic material is the basic informational molecule for all life. Current patent law, legislated in 1952, has been interpreted by the U. S. Supreme Court to allow broad patents of DNA, biochemical processes, and what are generally considered 'inventions' of life systems. Several issues are addressed in this paper regarding the unsound reasoning underlying both the interpretation and execution of patent law. Lapses in logic provide a gateway for businesses and individuals to take patenting to an illogical and unworkable extreme. Patent Office disorder of this magnitude is unnecessary and has great potential for harming the mission that the patent office was designed to serve. Recently disclosed patent-granting guidelines suggest the United States Patent and Trademark Office is not upholding its Constitutional responsibility of promoting the progress of science...|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} between patents for pharmaceuticals {{and access to}} affordable medicines has elicited considerable attention and highly stimulating debates since {{the emergence of the}} World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) as part of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing WTO in 1994. The TRIPS Agreement is the first international convention to make it mandatory for all countries to make patents available in all fields of technology provided the invention to be patented meets the <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> <b>patentability.</b> Consequently, countries like India, Brazil, China and Thailand that used to refuse to grant patents for pharmaceuticals were constrained to amend their patents laws to bring them in line with the WTO standard. Many developing countries did not even have legislation for a number of the intellectual property rights areas covered by the agreement {{at the time it was}} adopted. The TRIPS Agreement has been criticised as being a significant part of the global access to medicines problem and strong arguments have been raised for having more flexible standards for the protection of patents particularly in relation to pharmaceuticals. This thesis examines the WTO regime for patent protection in the context of pharmaceuticals and the existing flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement that countries seeking access to affordable patented pharmaceutical products might adopt. The effectiveness of the TRIPS compulsory licensing regime is examined, with particular focus on the limitations resulting from the TRIPS requirements for test data protection. The concepts of parallel importation and exhaustion of intellectual property (IP) rights are also examined with aview to ascertaining the extent to which they may serve as legal stratagems for developing countries seeking access to affordable medicines. The thesis argues that the existing frameworks for the right to health and the right to development in international law may provide a strong justification for the broad interpretation of the existing flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement without the need for going through the very rigorous process of amending it. The thesis considers the patents and access to medicines problem in the context of the special and highly complex challenges people in Sub-Sahara Africa are currently encountering. It recommends the establishment of an African Free Trade Area to make it easier for Africa as a continent to make better use of the TRIPS flexibilities. The thesis argues that more than ever before, the time has come for Africa to harness her resources to address her access to medicines problem through the use of all the available options in international economic law and international human rights law...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the role of}} international law in terms of access to medicine in the global South. More specifically, it ex-plores how on the one hand, international law has a restricting influence on the access and, on the other hand, it can help those in need to argue for the access to medicine. The thesis aims {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the role of public interna-tional law, both intellectual property law and human rights law, in the challenges of access of medicine. The key goal highlight the dimensions of both international IP regime and human rights regime, which are affecting to access to medicine and find out how the overlapping spheres can be used to argumentations either to increase to access to medicine in developing countries or to promote other kinds of goals. One of main questions that this master thesis aims to answer is to out how protection of pharma-ceutical patents under the TRIPS Agreement affects the global South. First, the understanding of international intellectual property regime is crucial to comprehend the collision of regimes. The thesis provides answers to questions on the benefits of patent system and why patents matter in pharmaceutical industry. How-ever, the concentration in relation to IP law is on the TRIPS Agreement, which often cited to be one of the main reasons of inadequate access to medicine in developing countries. Therefore the objectives and purposes and the scope of patenting in the TRIPS Agreement are discussed as well as TRIPS-plus regimes. In addition, developments during and after Doha ministerial meetings and how developing countries have used TRIPS provisions in order to promote access to medicine are discussed as the TRIPS flexibilities actually provide (developing) countries means to promote access to medicine. Secondly, the right to health and access to medicine as a part of it are further discussed in order to bring the understanding of other side of the regime conflict into the same table. Several human rights instruments have confirmed the status of access to medicine in human rights law and states have obligations to take actions for improvement of access to medicine. Nonetheless, further concentration to the relation of human rights law and intellectual property law makes it evident, that even though human rights norms may be claimed to have a primacy over intellectual property law provisions in a collision situation states are likely to follow trade law provisions as the WTO system has stronger enforcement mechanisms than human rights sphere. The division of the world to global from a global North and South brings tensions to the question, as the North holds most of the pharmaceutical patents but the actual need of the pharmaceuticals is mostly demanded in the South. The study intends to uncov-er the occasionally hidden power relations and use the platform provided by international law to draw attention about injustice against dominant consensus and narrative of the North. The thesis focuses in details on North-South differences in opinion and the role of pharmaceutical companies during drafting the TRIPS Agreement as well as later on. The questions related to private actors in public law making and fairness of law are also mentioned. The social realities of developing countries in which the collision of the regimes has in real life effects to access to HIV medi-cines are explored through case examples from India and Brazil. Both countries have been active within the discussion of the effects of the pharmaceutical patenting to access in medicine although strategizes chosen by the states are however a bit differ-ent: India has focused on the pre-grant opposition, strict <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> <b>patentability</b> and protection of its own pharmaceutical indus-try while Brazil has based its arguments on compulsory licensing and its main concern is connected to its wide health program. All in all, access to medicine in the developing countries remains to be a challenge, as the prices continue to be too high. How-ever, both human rights regime and intellectual property law provide developing countries with means to increase access to essential medicines. On the other hand, both regimes can be used against the needs of developing countries. As the questions of power disparities and political will remain to be significant in the context of access to medicines, in the end the choice is to be done whether and how act in manner that no one is left behind...|$|R
