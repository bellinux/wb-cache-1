40|$|Abstract: Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) protection {{has been}} a very important reliability issue in microelectronics, especially for integrated <b>circuits</b> (ICs). ESD <b>protection</b> design for giga-Hz high-speed input/output (I/O) circuits {{has been one of the}} key challenges to implement high-speed interface circuits in CMOS technology. Conventional on-chip ESD <b>protection</b> <b>circuits</b> at the I/O pads often cause unacceptable performance degradation to high-speed I/O <b>circuits.</b> Therefore, ESD <b>protection</b> <b>circuits</b> must be designed with minimum negative impact to the high-speed interface circuits and to sustain high enough ESD robustness. In this paper, ESD protection design considerations for high-speed I/O circuits are addressed, and the patents related to on-chip ESD protection designs for high-speed I/O circuits are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|For signal {{integrity}} reasons, {{the magnitude of}} the parasitics generated by electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection devices has become budgeted. Such budgets restrict the protection level and implementation options of the ESD <b>protection</b> <b>circuit</b> designer. In this work, the ESD protection on high-speed serial I/O link performance is investigated. Simulations are used to determine the effect of the parasitic ESD capacitance on the equalization required to maintain a specific bit error rate (BER). Then, the simulation results are converted into power estimates to demonstrate the power versus reliability trade-off. Essentially, rather than approaching the effect of ESD <b>protection</b> <b>circuits</b> as harmful, this work approaches the effect of ESD <b>protection</b> <b>circuits</b> as an engineering optimization problem which requires co-design between the printed circuit board (PCB) designer, transmitter and receiver circuit designer, and ESD <b>protection</b> <b>circuit</b> designer...|$|R
