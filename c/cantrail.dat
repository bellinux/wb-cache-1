50|$|The livery {{initially}} for Mk1 coaches for British Railways in 1951 was crimson {{lake and}} cream {{with black and}} gold lining, all new Mk1 FO coaches were delivered in this livery up until 1956. In 1956 the standard livery changed to maroon with black and gold lining except for the Southern Region stock which adopted an unlined dark malachite green. The Western Region {{on the other hand}} adopted chocolate and cream to sufficient stock to operate its named trains like the Cornish Riviera Express and Torbay Express being two examples. The Southern Region introduced the yellow UIC <b>cantrail</b> stripe denoting first class in 1960 for boat train coaches. Yellow UIC <b>cantrail</b> stripe was later introduced on other regions from 1963. In 1965 Rail Blue was introduced as trailed on XP64 stock the year before and lasted for another 20 years.|$|E

50|$|However, on 23 March 1988, a {{woman was}} found murdered in a {{compartment}} EPB car on an Orpington/London Victoria working which led to Network SouthEast reconfiguring the then-remaining unrefurbished SR-design 4-EPBs; as a result all compartment stock ran limited workings in busy periods and had a red stripe at the <b>cantrail.</b> This stock did not work in service after 8pm and was known as 4COM. These units, being heavier than the EPBs were retained for the winter of 1988/1989 to run overnight keeping the tracks clear of snow.|$|E
5000|$|... 1956 saw {{the first}} big changes, {{with the end of}} 'third class' and the return of {{regional}} colour schemes. The Western Region promptly adopted GWR chocolate and cream livery for vehicles used on its named express trains and maroon for other stock. The Southern Region reverted to green and the other regions adopted maroon. 1960 saw Southern Region adopt the now familiar yellow <b>cantrail</b> above first class and red above dining cars. By 1963 this was found on all carriages. In 1962 the Western Region abandoned the use of chocolate and cream.|$|E

5000|$|By the 1970s, all {{locomotives}} {{had received}} all over British Rail blue {{with a full}} yellow nose; by 1975 most locomotives had also received their TOPS numbers. Their livery remained the same until the early 1980s when 'Large Logo blue' was introduced. This entailed the yellow nose continuing round to behind the driver's door {{and up to the}} top of the windscreen and a full height 'double arrow' logo. These locomotives had the top of the nose painted black to lower the risk of the driver being dazzled by the sun. Freight-allocated examples received a similar livery - the only difference being the blue was replaced by freight grey. In 1987, the Sectors were launched, incorporating a new livery of 'three tone grey'; a light grey lower bodyside, medium grey <b>cantrail</b> and a dark grey roof, along with a bright Sector logo (Coal, Metals, Petroleum, Distribution and Construction). This livery co-existed with plain blue, large logo blue/grey and the new Intercity and Regional Railways liveries right up to the end of British Rail in 1996.|$|E
50|$|The Class 25/2 {{locomotives}} featured restyled bodywork and two-tone green livery {{similar to}} that carried by the Brush Type 4 (Class 47). The majority were built at BR Derby although some {{came out of the}} Darlington works. The redesign principally affected two areas, the cab and the location of the air intakes. The gangway doors fitted to the earlier examples were rarely used, their presence adding to the complaints of noise and draughts in the cabs. The removal of the air filters from the side air louvers to the <b>cantrail</b> {{was the result of a}} comparison carried out at Inverness between a batch of Derby built Type 2s and a batch of BRCW Type 2s (Class 26 and Class 27), the tests targeting the air quality within the engine room. These tests revealed the location of the grilles on the Derby build allowed for much more debris to reach the filters (especially the lower ones), clogging them quicker, leading to poorer air quality within the engine compartment, and so potentially affecting performance and engine wear. With such a large order to be completed it was felt that a redesign of these areas would have a cost savings in the long run, in addition to a better working environment within the cabs, and with a general less cluttered look about the locomotive's exterior.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} further {{investigations that}} {{have been carried out}} to make the proposed procedure [5] becomes more reliable to be practically applied as a requirement in bus type approval. One important aspect highlighted in this paper is an effort to improve the accuracy of the FEA model by taking into account detailed construction of bus superstructure. It worth to note that, based on survey carried out on several bus manufacturers, the detailed construction may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. As a case study, a bus superstructure from a prominent manufacturer was chosen as a sample. Energy absorbing capacity of a bus superstructure section consisting of four bays including rear entrance door, emergency door and rear end was investigated through elastic-plastic finite element model. Incremental quasy static load according to ECE R 66 was applied, subsequently to the right and left <b>cantrail</b> to obtain load deflection curve. Then the energy absorbing capacity of the structure when residual space limit was reached was evaluated through derived energy deflection curve. Essential components of the bus superstructure governing its energy absorbing capacity will be discussed. Modeling strategy in dealing with elastic-plastic analysis for such a rather complex structure is also highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Rollover {{accidents}} are critical issue {{in many countries}} in the world because it is one mode that often causing the number of deaths and serious injuries to passengers and crews bus. Therefore, {{to ensure the safety of}} passengers necessary to test the strength of the bus superstructure prototype before the bus have road worthy license. Testing is guided by the standards that apply to a state. One of the standards used at many countries in the word is ECE-R 66 (Economic Commission for Europe-Regulation 66) which regulates the construction and design of many types of passenger vehicles. In this research, methods of testing are the pendulum test and it was simulated by Finite element software soft ware. The purposes of this study are evaluating compatibility this software, determining energy absorption capacity and the deformation that occurs in the superstructure when a loads subjected from the outside of superstructure. In the pendulum test simulation the maximum deformation value is 520 mm at time is 0. 45 s, and 466 mm at time is 1. 5 s. The maximum stress occured at the joint between the roof structure with <b>cantrail</b> and it’s value equal to 266 at simulation. Beside it, the simulation show the energy is absorbed by the superstructure at rollover test simulation equal to 66. 23 % [...] Base on simulation result, it can be concluded that the modeling vehicle is indicated safety for passenger if occure rollover accident...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} paper, the authors present an {{analysis}} of the structural characteristics of an intermediate rail vehicle and their effects on crash performance of the vehicle. Theirs is a simulation based analysis involving four stages. First, the crashworthiness of the vehicle is assessed by simulating an impact of the vehicle with a rigid wall. Second, the structural characteristics of the vehicle are analysed based on the structural behaviour during this impact and then the structure is modified. Third, the modified vehicle is tested again in the same impact scenario with a rigid wall. Finally, the modified vehicle is subjected to a modelled head-on impact which mirrors the real-life impact interface between two intermediate vehicles in a train impact. The emphasis of the current study is on the structural characteristics of the intermediate vehicle and the differences compared to an impact of a leading vehicle. The study shows that, similar to a leading vehicle, bending, or jackknifing is a main form of failure in this conventionally designed intermediate vehicle. It has also been found that the location of the door openings creates a major difference in the behaviour of an intermediate vehicle. It causes instability of the vehicle in the door area and leads to high stresses at the joint of the end beam with the solebar and shear stresses at the joint of the inner pillar with the <b>cantrail.</b> Apart from this, the shapes of the vehicle ends and impact interfaces are also different and {{have an effect on the}} crash performance of the vehicles. The simulation results allow the identification of the structural characteristics and show the effectiveness of relevant modifications. The conclusions have general relevance for the crashworthiness of rail vehicle desig...|$|E
