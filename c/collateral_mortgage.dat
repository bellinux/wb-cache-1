40|$|The aim of {{the present}} article is to scrutinize the {{usufruct}} over the right of vote related to a share as legal concept (from foregoing and current Romanian legislation and doctrine standpoint) and to highlight also the legal traits and the effective benefits provided as guaranty. To the same extent, the consolidation of the legal regime of this concept as guaranty is also the pursued objective. Although the usufruct over the right of vote has been not considered as a valid guaranty, the companies from Romania (mostly the banks) used this mechanism as guaranty within the (sophisticated) lending transactions. It is worthy to be mentioned that the right of vote {{may be related to}} a share belonging to a joint-stock company or to a social part belonging to a limited liability company. The main scope of such guaranty is to strengthen the creditor’s rights besides other established hard <b>collaterals</b> (<b>mortgages</b> over real estates, shares, receivables etc.). Thus, the creditor may influence the corporate will of a company (within the general shareholders meeting). Moreover, the guaranty has to be set up {{in the form of a}} notarized deed (authenticated by a Notary Public) aiming to be considered a writ of execution and to enable the creditor to commence the foreclosure if needed. Having in mind the above, this paper mainly regards: the content of the right of vote related to a share, security, social part, the applicability of the usufruct to the shares belonging to different companies (joint-stock companies listed or not listed to the Stock Exchange, other companies of capitals and persons), the relevant differences between the usufruct as dismemberment of the ownership right and the usufruct as guaranty, the significant aspects regarding the guaranty agreement, proposals to amend the legislation...|$|R

We consider a wide range of assets, both financial and real, risky and relatively riskless. Debts considered encompass personal unsecured loans, including credit card debt, and loans secured by housing <b>collateral,</b> mainly <b>mortgage</b> debt. Findings are of considerable policy interest, as they show how various demographic groups changed their participation and exposure to various assets and loans between 1999, when the unparalleled stock market boom took place and 2002, following the burst of the stock market bubble. ...|$|R

This coupon stream allocation is performed after prepayment tranching is complete. If the coupon tranching is done on the collateral without any prepayment tranching, then the resulting tranches are called 'strips'. The benefit is that the resulting CMO tranches can be targeted to very different sets of investors. In general, coupon tranching will produce a pair (or set) of complementary CMO tranches.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explains}} how mortgage market liberalization can introduce greater volatility {{in the housing}} market. It begins by documenting two stylized facts for OECD countries that models with perfect credit markets fail to explain: (i) housing investment is about five times as volatile as output and (ii) housing investment {{tends to be more}} volatile in economies with more liberalized mortgage markets. The paper then develops a DSGE model where households face a credit constraint and housing is used as collateral. This housing collateral constraint creates a link between the housing market and borrowing capacity, a link that amplifies the response of housing demand to shocks and becomes stronger with more mortgage market liberalization. Finally, calibrated models with a housing collateral constraint explain about 90 percent of housing investment volatility in the UK economy.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{diffusion}} of greenhouse agriculture in a watershed in the northern uplands of Thailand by applying econometrics and agent-based modeling in combination. Adoption has been rapid by farmers in the central valley of the watershed, while farmers at higher altitudes, lacking transferable land titles {{that could serve as}} <b>mortgage</b> <b>collateral,</b> have been unable to obtain loans for greenhouse investment. The objectives of the paper are both methodological and empirical. On the methodological side, it shows that econometrically estimated models of farm household behavior are useful to design and to parameterize an agent-based model. On the empirical side, simulation results show that if <b>mortgage</b> <b>collateral</b> would not be required, then adoption in {{the upper part of the}} watershed could reach nearly 77 % of farm households by 2020, as compared to about 36 % under current conditions. Furthermore results suggest a significant increase in incomes related to the innovation and a substantially greater irrigation water use, especially in the central part. As bell pepper under greenhouses has replaced pesticide-intensive chrysanthemum, it has declined average levels of pesticide use. Nevertheless, pesticide use is high and farmers are struggling to control pests, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the innovation.

As a result, the response of creditors is to rely more on some types of collateral—such as personal guarantees and accounts receivable—that can be realised directly by secured creditors and are not diluted by preferential creditors. These collateral types are used more often than <b>mortgage</b> <b>collateral</b> (Davydenko and Franks 2008).|$|R
