Supervectorcomputers like the CRAY systems provide powerful compilers, tools for application developers, and system tools for automatted operation.

During these power cuts, enterprises rely on backup sources for power such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and electric generators. This paper proposes AnywareDC, an architecture that builds on the recent work on Anyware to reduce energy utilization {{in the presence of}} such intermittent power supplies. Anyware reduces energy usage by providing enterprise users laptops instead of desktops, while maintaining performance using a <b>central</b> <b>compute</b> cluster. Our basic insight is that in the presence of power cuts, only the routers and the cluster needs to be provided power: the laptops can continue to run on their own batteries. This reduces both energy usage and UPS load allowing it to supply power for longer, thus also saving generator fuel costs. Simulations show that this architecture reduces energy usage by up to 80 % compared to one not using Anyware, and by up to 20 % compared to Anyware...|$|R

The {{objective}} of the project is to design, develop, and implement a hardware and software infrastructure to facilitate work with phylogenies and, in particular, to support an attempt at assembling the Tree of Life, the phylogeny of all organisms on the planet. The original CIPRES team was made of five lead institutions and another eight affiliated ones, comprising a total of 33 faculty researchers. The team has since grown to 16 institutions and gained additional faculty conducting research in algorithm design, database design, software architecture design, and modelling and simulation, developing a central software library with well defined and fully documented APIs, setting up a high-performance <b>central</b> <b>compute</b> and database server, and preparing {{a wide range of}} outreach tools.
