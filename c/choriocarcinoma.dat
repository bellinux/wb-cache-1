EFS was differentially expressed in the GEP1 and GEP3 groups, which were associated with worse prognosis, with more significant cytogenetic abnormalities and genomic instabilities observed in this groups.|$|E
25|$|Embryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type {{usually found}} in mixed tumors, develop {{directly}} from germ cells {{but are not}} terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further {{into a variety of}} other neoplasms, including <b>choriocarcinoma,</b> yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.|$|E
25|$|<b>Choriocarcinomas,</b> in {{contrast}} to adrenal carcinomas, have upregulated H19 and downregulated IGF2 expression. The upregulated H19 expression, however, came from alleles that were fully methylated. Surgically removed <b>choriocarcinomas</b> from human patients also exhibited a heavily methylated H19 promoter with enhanced H19 expression. This led researchers Arima et al. to suggest that in cases of <b>choriocarcinomas,</b> the H19 promoter was mutated, allowing it to overcome the transcriptional repression of promoter CpG methylation.|$|R

25|$|Larger {{bilateral}} cysts {{can develop}} {{as a result}} of fertility treatment due to elevated levels of HCG, as can be seen with the use of clomifene for follicular induction, in extreme cases resulting in a condition known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Certain malignancies can mimic the effects of clomifene on the ovaries, also due to increased HCG, in particular gestational trophoblastic disease. Ovarian hyperstimulation occurs more often with invasive moles and <b>choriocarcinoma</b> than complete molar pregnancies.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Choriocarcinoma</b> {{can occur}} as a primary ovarian tumor {{developing}} from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary.

40|$|International audienceAbnormal {{trophoblast}} differentiation is {{the main}} cause of gestational trophoblast diseases in the case of hydatidiform moles and <b>choriocarcinomas.</b> Here we investigated the expression patterns of two gene products, p 16 and Bcl- 2, implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, respectively, using immunohistochemistry during normal placenta differentiation, hydatidiform moles (partial, complete and invasive) and post-molar <b>choriocarcinomas.</b> The p 16 protein shows a gradual expression in cytotrophoblast of normal villous, from a p 16 weak proliferative phenotype to a p 16 strong invasive phenotype reaching a maximum around 17  weeks of gestation. The expression pattern in cytotrophoblast was similar in moles in contrast to the villous mesenchyme of invasive moles where p 16 was strongly expressed. Bcl- 2 expression was syncytiotrophoblast specific in normal placenta and moles and increased gradually during normal differentiation. The results explain the persistence of normal and molar villous fragments during their development and their dramatic invasion in the uterine arteries in case of invasive moles. In <b>choriocarcinomas</b> the weak Bcl- 2 expression is associated with weak p 16 expression indicating a great apoptotic and proliferative potentials. The results suggest that strong p 16 expression in the villous mesenchyme may be responsible in part of the morbidity of the moles, and the key of cancer progression in the <b>choriocarcinomas</b> would be a fast cell-cycle turnover...|$|R
50|$|Characteristic {{feature is}} the {{identification}} of intimately related syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts without formation of definite placental type villi.

50|$|<b>Choriocarcinoma</b> arising in the {{testicle}} is rare, malignant {{and highly}} resistant to chemotherapy. The {{same is true}} of <b>choriocarcinoma</b> arising in the ovary. Testicular <b>choriocarcinoma</b> has the worst prognosis of all germ-cell cancers.|$|E
50|$|Rarely, <b>choriocarcinoma</b> {{occurs in}} primary {{locations}} {{other than the}} placenta; very rarely, it occurs in testicles. Although trophoblastic components are common components of mixed germ cell tumors, pure <b>choriocarcinoma</b> of the adult testis is rare. Pure <b>choriocarcinoma</b> of the testis represents the most aggressive pathologic variant of germ cell tumors in adults, characteristically with early hematogenous and lymphatic metastatic spread. Because of early spread and inherent resistance to anticancer drugs, patients have poor prognosis. Elements of <b>choriocarcinoma</b> in a mixed testicular tumor have no prognostic importance.|$|E
40|$|Eleven {{samples of}} DNA from <b>choriocarcinomas</b> were studied by high {{resolution}} CGH-array 244 K. They were studied after histopathological {{confirmation of the}} diagnosis, of the androgenic etiology and after a microsatellite marker analysis confirming the absence of contamination of tumor DNA from maternal DNA. Three cell lines, BeWo, JAR, JEG were also studied by this high resolution pangenomic technique. According to aCGH analysis, the de novo <b>choriocarcinomas</b> exhibited simple chromosomal rearrangements or normal profiles.

40|$|International audienceGestational <b>choriocarcinomas</b> are {{malignant}} tumors of trophoblastic {{cells that}} affect 5 - 25 % {{of women with}} sporadic hydatidiform moles (HMs) depending on countries and studies. Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 7 (NLRP 7) is a major gene responsible for recurrent HMs and recently mutations in this gene have also been shown in 13 % of women with sporadic, non-recurrent moles. To investigate the role of NLRP 7 in the genetic susceptibility for the malignant degeneration of moles, we sequenced its 11 exons in 43 Senegalese patients with post-molar <b>choriocarcinomas.</b> We report the presence of three novel NLRP 7 variants that were found only in patients but not in 100 controls from the Senegalese general population, 100 controls from the Tunisian general population, and 100 controls from the Canadian population. In addition, this analysis revealed {{significant differences in the}} frequencies of four non-synonymous NLRP 7 variants between European and Senegalese controls with the biggest difference being for variant G 487 E present at a minor allele frequency of 3. 5 % in Europeans, 18. 1 % in Tunisians and 45. 6 % in Senegalese. Comparing human NLRP 7 and its paralog, NLRP 2, with their mammalian counterparts revealed that allele E at position 487 is most likely the ancestral allele that was acquired in Africa but driven to low frequencies in Europeans and Asians due to migration, population bottlenecks and selective pressures. This study is the first attempt to investigate the role of NLRP 7 in <b>choriocarcinomas</b> and highlights the higher frequencies of NLRP 7 variants in the general Senegalese and Tunisian populations both known to have higher frequencies of moles and <b>choriocarcinomas...</b>|$|R
50|$|Since gestational <b>choriocarcinoma</b> (which {{arises from}} a hydatidiform mole) {{contains}} paternal DNA (and thus paternal antigens), it is exquisitely sensitive to chemotherapy. The cure rate, even for metastatic gestational <b>choriocarcinoma,</b> is around 90-95%.|$|E

25|$|Germ cell {{tumors of the}} ovary develop {{from the}} ovarian germ cells. Germ cell tumor {{accounts}} for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are teratomas and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, {{when one of the}} germ layers in the tumor develops into a squamous cell carcinoma. Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s–30s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group. Germ-cell tumors can include dysgerminomas, teratomas, yolk sac tumors/endodermal sinus tumors, and <b>choriocarcinomas,</b> when they arise in the ovary. Some germ-cell tumors have an isochromosome 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other. Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They {{are more likely to be}} stage I at diagnosis. Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: <b>choriocarcinomas</b> are monitored with beta-HCG and endodermal sinus tumors with alpha-fetoprotein.|$|R
50|$|Often serum {{and spinal}} fluid tumor markers of AFP and beta-HCG are tested. Pure germinomas are not {{associated}} with these markers.

40|$|Gestational trophoblastic {{neoplasms}} (GTNs) are a rare {{group of}} neoplastic diseases composed of <b>choriocarcinomas,</b> placental site trophoblastic tumors (PSTTs) and epithelioid trophoblastic tumors (ETTs). Since these tumors are derivatives of fetal trophoblastic tissue, approximately 50 % of GTN cases {{are expected to}} originate from a male conceptus and carry a Y-chromosomal complement according to a balanced sex ratio. To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out a comprehensive analysis by genotyping a relatively large sample size of 51 GTN cases using three independent sex chromosome genetic markers; Amelogenin, Protein Kinase and Zinc Finger have X and Y homologues that are distinguishable by their PCR product size. We found that all cases contained the X-chromosomal complement while only five (10 %) of 51 tumors harbored the Y-chromosomal complement. Specifically, Y-chromosomal signals were detected in one (5 %) of 19 <b>choriocarcinomas,</b> one (7 %) of 15 PSTTs and three (18 %) of 17 ETTs. The histopathological features of those with a Y-chromosome {{were similar to those}} without. Our results demonstrate the presence of a Y-chromosomal complement in GTNs, albeit a low 10 % of cases. This shortfall of Y-chromosomal complements in GTNs may reinforce the notion that the majority of GTNs are derived from previous molar gestations...|$|R
