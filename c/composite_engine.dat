50|$|Reloadable composite-propellant motors {{are also}} available. These are commercially {{produced}} motors requiring {{the user to}} assemble propellant grains, o-rings and washers (to contain the expanding gases), delay grains and ejection charges into special non-shattering aluminum motor casings with screw-on or snap-in ends (closures). The advantage of a reloadable motor is the cost: firstly, because the main casing is reusable, reloads cost significantly less than single-use motors of the same impulse. Secondly, assembly of larger <b>composite</b> <b>engines</b> is labor-intensive and difficult to automate; off-loading this task on the consumer results in a cost savings. Reloadable motors are available from D through O class.|$|R

40|$|Procedures for {{modeling}} {{the effect of}} high strain rate on composite materials are needed for designing reliable <b>composite</b> <b>engine</b> cases that are lighter than the metal cases in current use. The types of polymer matrix composites {{that are likely to}} be used in such an application have a deformation response that is nonlinear and that varies with strain rate. The nonlinearity and strain rate dependence of the composite response is primarily due to the matrix constituent. Therefore, in developing material models {{to be used in the}} design of impact-resistant <b>composite</b> <b>engine</b> cases, the deformation of the polymer matrix must be correctly analyzed. However, unlike in metals, the nonlinear response of polymers depends on the hydrostatic stresses, which must be accounted for within an analytical model. An experimental program has been carried out through a university grant with the Ohio State University to obtain tensile and shear deformation data for a representative polymer for strain rates ranging from quasi-static to high rates of several hundred per second. This information has been used at the NASA Glenn Research Center to develop, characterize, and correlate a material model in which the strain rate dependence and nonlinearity (including hydrostatic stress effects) of the polymer are correctly analyzed. To obtain the material data, Glenn s researchers designed and fabricated test specimens of a representative toughened epoxy resin. Quasi-static tests at low strain rates and split Hopkinson bar tests at high strain rates were then conducted at the Ohio State University. The experimental data confirmed the strong effects of strain rate on both the tensile and shear deformation of the polymer. For the analytical model, Glenn researchers modified state variable constitutive equations previously used for the viscoplastic analysis of metals to allow for the analysis of the nonlinear, strain-rate-dependent polymer deformation. Specifically, we accounted for the effects of hydrostatic stresses. An important discovery in the course of this work was that the hydrostatic stress effects varied during the loading process, which needed to be accounted for within the constitutive equations. The model is characterized primarily by shear data, with tensile data used to characterize the hydrostatic stress effects...|$|E
