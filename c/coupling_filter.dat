However, there are currently no established techniques to accurately monitor and diagnose faults in real-time while the transformer is on-line. A major factor in the degradation of transformer insulation is partial discharging which, if left unattended, will eventually cause complete insulation failure. A partial discharge detection system (PDDS) is presented for electrically identifying partial discharge pulses and determining the number of partial discharge sources while the transformer is on-line and subjected to external interference.

A new {{admittance matrix}} filter design method has been developed, and several hybrid-coupling filters were analyzed and designed using this method. The source-load impedance loading is also introduced, and this enables a filter design with an arbitrary loss. These design principles {{were applied to}} several filter examples and proved to be very useful, especially for ones with intricate geometries. With the unique independent electric and magnetic <b>coupling</b> <b>filter</b> topology, low-loss tunable (Schottky varactor diode) filters with three different fractional-bandwidth variations (constant, decreasing, and increasing fractional-bandwidth) are obtained. The measured filters have frequency tuning ranges of 800 - 1400 MHz, and their insertion-loss, and Qu are 1. 0 - 3. 0 dB and 60 - 150, respectively. These planar tunable filters represent the state-of-the-art insertion loss performance in this frequency range. For RF-MEMS tunable filters, the lossy coupling between the resonant electric field and bias-lines is first addressed, and a high-Q multi-bit orthogonal RF-MEMS capacitance network is introduced. As a result, a state-of the-art 4 - 6 GHz multi-bit RF-MEMS tunable filter is realized with a measured insertion loss and Qu of 1. 5 - 2. 8 and 85 - 170, respectively. To author's knowledge, this is the highest-Q tunable planar filter to-date at this frequency range.

40|$|Todaysâ {{multi-band}} mobile phonesâ RF front ends require separate transceivers {{for each}} frequency band. Future wireless mobile devices {{are expected to}} accommodate {{a larger number of}} frequency bands; therefore using the existing transceiver configurations becomes prohibitive. One of the key RF components in wireless devices is the image reject and band-selection filter. Todayâs multi-band mobile phones use bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters in conjunction with solid-state or MEMS-based RF switches for selecting the frequency band of operation. This approach results in very complex circuits. As number of frequency bands increases, ferroelectric BST, operating at its paraelectric phase, has recently been utilized in designing intrinsically switchable BAW resonators and filters due to its voltage induced piezoelectricity. The intrinsically switchable BAW resonators and filters are suitable for designing compact multiband and frequency agile transceivers as they can be switched on and off by simply controlling the dc bias voltage across the ferroelectric layer instead of using separate MEMS or solid-state based RF switches. In this thesis, composite ferroelectric resonators are studied to improve the Q of intrinsically switchable BAW resonators. Intrinsically switchable BAW resonators with record Q values based on ferroelectric-on-silicon composite structures have been demonstrated.
