The {{class of}} ν-infinitely {{divisible}} (ID) distributions, which arise {{in connection with}} random summation, is a reach family including geometric infinitely divisible (<b>GID)</b> <b>and</b> geometric stable (GS) laws. We present two sim-ple results connected with triangular arrays with random number of terms and their limiting ν-ID distributions as well as random sums with ν-ID distributed terms. These generalize and unify certain results scattered in the literature that concern the special cases of <b>GID</b> <b>and</b> GS laws...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates how De Gids {{reacted to}} the {{appearance}} of De Nieuwe Gids during the years 1885 to 1890 by analyzing explicit reflections on De Nieuwe <b>Gids</b> <b>and</b> the authors surrounding this magazine. One would expect that De Gids acted defensively towards the newcomers {{at first and then}} gradually accepted them. De Gids clearly shows its disapproval of De Nieuwe Gids in the researched material. But besides this rejection of the avant-garde, appreciation for some of the new authors can also be found. This underlines the gradual acceptance of De Nieuwe <b>Gids</b> <b>and</b> its poetics and qualifies the redemption model which assu-mes that literary movements vanish rapidly and are replaced by others. After a period of resistance, De Gids adjusts its own ideas to the ideas of the new authors. By doing this De Gids can survive as a postponed avant-garde...|$|R

40|$|Background:Autoantibodies to {{tryptophan}} hydroxylase (TPHAbs) {{directed against}} serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells (EC) {{have been reported}} in autoimmune-polyendocrine-syndrome type 1 (APS- 1) patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction (GID). Serotonin plays a critical role in enteric function and its peripheral blood levels reflect serotonin release from the gastrointestinal tract. Aims:We test the hypothesis that TPHAbs mark a distinct autoimmune component of APS- 1 characterized by an autoimmune attack toward EC, which results in clinical GID. Methods:TPHAbs were measured in 64 APS- 1 patients. Endoscopy with gastric (antrum/body) and duodenal biopsy was carried in 16 TPHAbs+ patients (8 with <b>and</b> 8 without <b>GID)</b> <b>and</b> in 2 TPHAbs- patients (without GID). Immunohistochemistry of biopsy specimens was carried out using antibodies to serotonin, chromogranin-A, CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, and CD 20. Serotonin serum levels were measured in TPHAbs+ and TPHAbs- patients who had endoscopy. Results:Thirty-seven of 64 patients were TPHAbs+ (11 / 12 with <b>GID</b> <b>and</b> 26 / 52 without GID; P <. 001). Gastric and duodenal biopsies in all 8 TPHAb+ patients with GID showed lymphocytic infiltration with increased CD 3 +CD 8 + intraepithelial lymphocytes and absence of EC. Furthermore, mean serotonin serum levels were below the normal range in TPHAb+ patients with GID (P <. 01). In 8 TPHAb+ patients without <b>GID</b> gastric <b>and</b> duodenal biopsies showed different grades of inflammatory infiltration and reduced number of EC. Mean serotonin serum levels were near the lower limit of the normal range. In all TPHAbs+ patients the biopsies showed a reduced number of chromogranin-A positive cells consistent with enteroendocrine cells depletion. TPHAbs- patients without GID showed normal gastrointestinal mucosa and serotonin serum levels. Conclusions:TPHAbs appear to be markers of a distinct autoimmune component of APS- 1. Progressive involvement of the gastrointestinal EC leads to the transition from preclinical to clinical disease, characterized by <b>GID</b> <b>and</b> reduced serotonin serum levels...|$|R
