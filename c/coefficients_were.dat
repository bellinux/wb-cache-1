5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of {{earthquakes}} constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes {{in the development of}} the earthquake swarm. Correlation <b>coefficients</b> <b>were</b> around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.|$|E

The {{concept of}} {{frequency}} <b>coefficient</b> <b>is</b> built up based on theory，the formula between frequency coefficient and strain <b>coefficient</b> <b>is</b> established, {{and it was}} revised by the regression relational expression {{on the base of}} statistics results of 173 samples.

The results shows that the structure is secure and with some safety margin when the frequency <b>coefficient</b> <b>is</b> greater than 1. 111, the structure is dangerous when the frequency <b>coefficient</b> <b>is</b> less than 1. 079, and the bearing capacity needs to be evaluated further when the <b>coefficient</b> <b>is</b> between 1. 111 and 1. 079...|$|R

25|$|Harmonic {{analysis}} {{was discovered by}} Joseph Fourier, who published an extensive treatise of his research {{in the context of}} heat transfer in 1822. The theory found an early application in prediction of tides. Around 1876, Lord Kelvin constructed a mechanical tide predictor. It consisted of a harmonic analyzer and a harmonic synthesizer, as they were called already in the 19th century. The analysis of tide measurements was done using James Thomson's integrating machine. The resulting Fourier <b>coefficients</b> <b>were</b> input into the synthesizer, which then used a system of cords and pulleys to generate and sum harmonic sinusoidal partials for prediction of future tides. In 1910, a similar machine was built for the analysis of periodic waveforms of sound. The synthesizer drew a graph of the combination waveform, which was used chiefly for visual validation of the analysis.|$|E

In the original model EBITA, <b>coefficient</b> <b>was</b> 3.3, and it ranks first to contribute in the overall index, whereas re-estimated coefficient (-. 063) becomes negative and ranks fifth. In case of BVEBVD, the original <b>coefficient</b> <b>was</b> 0.6 and re-estimated <b>coefficient</b> <b>is</b> 3.474 which is significantly different.
