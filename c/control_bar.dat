Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the right direction. This is accomplished by pressing the left or the right arrow key or moving the mouse to rotate the direction of the units as they move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially important when using formations, of which there are nine available. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and then click on the ground where they want the units to form. The player can also order all selected units to scatter and to retreat. All formations, as well as commands such as stopping, guarding, scattering, retreating, and reversing direction, are also available via a single click in the <b>Control</b> <b>Bar</b> {{at the bottom of the}} screen.|$|E

50|$|Both C and CX {{models are}} {{equipped}} with six pinwheels.

The C model had a fixed stepping system with a large wheel cycle due to the prime numbers of the six wheels. The CX-52 version has 6 pinwheels with 47 pins each and a flexible wheel movement system. The lug cage of both models contains 32 movable bars: 27 of the bars are used for encryption and the remaining 5 <b>bars</b> <b>control</b> the stepping of the pinwheels. The early CX models used the <b>control</b> <b>bars</b> also for encryption but due to complications in creating acceptable lug settings later CX models used these <b>bars</b> only for <b>controlling</b> of the wheel stepping.

40|$|Aspartame is a {{commonly}} used intense artificial sweetener, being approximately 200 times sweeter than sucrose. There have been concerns over aspartame since approval in the 1980 s including a large anecdotal database reporting severe symptoms. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare the acute symptom effects of aspartame to a control preparation. This was a double-blind randomized cross over study conducted in a clinical research unit in United Kingdom. Forty-eight individual who has self reported sensitivity to aspartame were compared to 48 age and gender matched aspartame non-sensitive individuals. They were given aspartame (100 mg) -containing or <b>control</b> snack <b>bars</b> randomly at least 7 days apart. The main outcome measures were acute effects of aspartame measured using repeated ratings of 14 symptoms, biochemistry and metabonomics. Aspartame sensitive and non-sensitive participants differed psychologically at baseline in handling feelings and perceived stress. Sensitive participants had higher triglycerides (2. 05 ± 1. 44 vs. 1. 26 ± 0. 84 mmol/L; p value 0. 008) and lower HDL-C (1. 16 ± 0. 34 vs. 1. 35 ± 0. 54 mmol/L; p value 0. 04), reflected in 1 H NMR serum analysis that showed differences in the baseline lipid content between the two groups. Urine metabonomic studies showed no significant differences. None of the rated symptoms differed between aspartame and <b>control</b> <b>bars,</b> or between sensitive and control participants. However, aspartame sensitive participants rated more symptoms particularly in the first test session, whether this was placebo or control. Aspartame and <b>control</b> <b>bars</b> affected GLP- 1, GIP, tyrosine and phenylalanine levels equally in both aspartame sensitive and non-sensitive subjects. Using a comprehensive battery of psychological tests, biochemistry and state of the art metabonomics there was no evidence of any acute adverse responses to aspartame. This independent study gives reassurance to both regulatory bodies and the public that acute ingestion of aspartame does not have any detectable psychological or metabolic effects in humans.
