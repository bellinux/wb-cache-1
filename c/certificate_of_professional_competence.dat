The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as about the OECD average in 2015. Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education. In France, education is compulsory from six to sixteen years old, and the public school is secular and free. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are {{the responsibility of the}} state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (école maternelle) and elementary school (école élémentaire). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialisation and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (collège) and leads to the national certificate (...) [...] The second is offered in high schools (lycée) and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (baccalauréat, available in professional, technical or general flavours) or <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> (certificat d'aptitude professionelle).|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} work integrated learning (WIL) {{is the development}} <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence,</b> the ability <b>of</b> students to perform in the work place. Alignment theory therefore suggests that the assessment of WIL should include an assessment of students’ demonstration <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in the workplace. The assessment <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL is, however, problematic. It may be impractical for the academic supervisor to directly assess <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> {{if there is a}} large number of students in external placements. If evidence <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> is provided by the student, the student’s ability to articulate his or her own capabilities will interfere with the validity of the assessment. If evidence <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> competency is provided by the supervisor then the assessment is heavily dependent on the individual supervisor and may be unreliable. This paper will examine the literature relating to the assessment <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL. The paper will be informed by the author’s experience in coordinating a WIL subject in an undergraduate law course. It will recommend that a mix of evidence provided by the student, the workplace supervisor and the academic supervisor should be used to assess <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> in WIL...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to explore an ethical view <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> by {{examining}} the <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> physicians in the context of palliative care. A discussion of the four dimensions <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence</b> [...] knowledge, technical skills, relationships, and affective and moral attitude [...] leads us to the conclusion that "habits of mind" are important in every aspect <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence.</b> This observation is then considered in the context of virtue ethics and ethics of care. Virtue ethics focuses on personal qualities and moral attitudes, while the ethics of care concentrates on the way these qualities are lived out in specific care relationships. Our conclusion points up the importance of education in ethics in the development <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>competence,</b> and argues that because palliative care involves intense human interactions, integrating palliative care into the medical curriculum may improve the ethical culture of health care as a whole...|$|R

Moreover, it deals with the historical development of the nursing education until today and with the impact on education of non-medical staff after the Czech Republic joined the European Union.
