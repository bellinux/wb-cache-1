5|$|Although many {{leaders of}} the <b>Congress</b> sought a strong central {{government}} for an Indian state, some Muslim politicians, including Jinnah, were unwilling to accept this without powerful protections for their community. Other Muslims supported the <b>Congress,</b> which advocated a secular state upon independence. Nevertheless, the <b>Congress</b> enjoyed considerable Muslim support up to about 1937.|$|E
5|$|At this <b>congress,</b> Kim Il-sung {{designated}} his son Kim Jong-il as his successor. The {{move was}} {{criticized by the}} South Korean media and ruling communist parties of the socialist states in Eastern Europe and Asia because it was considered nepotist. The <b>congress</b> also saw the WPK and North Korea move away from orthodox communism by emphasizing the Juche idea over Marxism–Leninism, giving the party a nationalistic bent. The next party <b>congress</b> was not convened before 2016, despite party rules that stipulated that a <b>congress</b> had to be held every fifth year.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan next turned Virginia on <b>Congress.</b> Seeing {{what had}} {{happened}} to Cumberland, Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith, captain of <b>Congress,</b> ordered his ship grounded in shallow water. By this time, the James River Squadron, commanded by John Randolph Tucker, had arrived and joined Virginia in the attack on <b>Congress.</b> After an hour of unequal combat, the badly damaged <b>Congress</b> surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of <b>Congress</b> were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on Virginia. In retaliation, Buchanan ordered <b>Congress</b> fired upon with hot shot, cannonballs heated red-hot. <b>Congress</b> caught fire and burned {{throughout the rest of the}} day. Near midnight, the flames reached her magazine and she exploded and sank, stern first. Personnel losses included 110 killed or missing and presumed drowned. Another 26 were wounded, of whom ten died within days.|$|E

50|$|The {{organisation}} of <b>congresses</b> was {{the main}} reason for creating ISBT in 1935. So far, 34 International <b>Congresses</b> and 26 Regional <b>Congresses</b> have been organised. ISBT <b>congresses</b> discuss a wide range of state of the art topics in the field of transfusion medicine, with invited speakers for plenary and parallel sessions. <b>Congresses</b> typically start with a local or regional day on Saturday, followed by a day organised by the ISBT Academy on Sunday. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are dedicated to parallel sessions, plenary sessions, workshops, and specialised group sessions. International <b>congresses</b> are typically one day longer and include Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning in the scientific programming. All ISBT <b>Congresses</b> are complemented by a scientific exhibition with companies relevant to transfusion medicine.|$|R
5|$|<b>Congress</b> {{previously}} held {{office at}} the Old <b>Congress</b> Building. In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, <b>Congress</b> was dissolved; its successor, the unicameral Batasang Pambansa, held {{office at the}} new Batasang Pambansa Complex. When a new constitution restored the bicameral <b>Congress,</b> the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old <b>Congress</b> Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service Insurance System at reclaimed land at Pasay. The Supreme Court will also transfer to its new campus at Bonifacio Global City, Taguig in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the White House (then {{called the}} President's House) was begun in 1792. Washington laid the {{cornerstone}} for the United States Capitol (then called the <b>Congress</b> House) on September 18, 1793. John Adams, Washington's successor, {{moved into the}} White House in November 1800; that same month, <b>Congress</b> held its first session in the Capitol. The following February, <b>Congress</b> approved the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the District of Columbia, and, {{in accordance with the}} Constitution, named <b>Congress</b> as its exclusive governing authority.|$|E
5|$|During {{the almost}} ten years it served as the capitol, <b>Congress</b> Hall {{witnessed}} many historic events including the admittance of three new states. The United States Bill of Rights was ratified at <b>Congress</b> Hall in 1791. The second Presidential inauguration of George Washington {{took place in the}} House chamber in 1793, as did inauguration of John Adams in 1797. <b>Congress</b> also used the time to establish the First Bank of the United States, the Federal Mint, and the United States Department of the Navy. The Jay Treaty, which secured a temporary peace with Great Britain, was also ratified at <b>Congress</b> Hall in 1796. After the capital moved to Washington, <b>Congress</b> Hall returned to its original function as the Philadelphia County Courthouse and served as the location of both state and federal courts during the early 19th century. Also designed by Samuel Lewis, the Burlington County Courthouse in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey was built in 1796 and modeled after <b>Congress</b> Hall.|$|E

50|$|World Archaeological <b>Congresses</b> {{are held}} every four years, with several Inter-Congresses between the main <b>congresses.</b> The <b>congresses</b> {{vary in their}} seasonality, but present the {{opportunity}} to present research, participate in panels, and socialize with other members. <b>Congresses</b> have been held on six continents and attract large, multinational attendance. The locations of the <b>congresses</b> are chosen to encourage inclusivity within the means of {{people from around the}} world. Locating <b>congresses</b> outside of 'First World' venues has led to political and social complications for WAC. For example, WAC-3 in India was besieged by media coverage after the then president of the international executive committee J. Golson banned discussion of the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque during the conference.|$|R

5|$|Gandhi took {{leadership}} of the <b>Congress</b> in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National <b>Congress</b> declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the <b>Congress</b> taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the <b>Congress</b> withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him {{and tens of thousands}} of <b>Congress</b> leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, after {{a series}} of struggles about {{multinational}} nitrate interests, Chilean President José Manuel Balmaceda refused to sign the national budget passed by the Chilean National <b>Congress.</b> Balmaceda then dissolved <b>Congress.</b> The dissolution split both the Chilean Army and Navy, with some forces remaining loyal to <b>Congress</b> and others to the President. An armed conflict ensued after a mutiny by the navy, which at that time was docked at Valparaíso.|$|E

5|$|In June 1783, a {{different}} group of disgruntled soldiers from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sent <b>Congress</b> a petition demanding their back pay. When {{they began to}} march toward Philadelphia, <b>Congress</b> charged Hamilton and two others with intercepting the mob. Hamilton requested militia from Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council, but was turned down. Hamilton instructed Assistant Secretary of War William Jackson to intercept the men. Jackson was unsuccessful. The mob arrived in Philadelphia, and the soldiers proceeded to harangue <b>Congress</b> for their pay. The President of the Continental <b>Congress,</b> John Dickinson, feared that the Pennsylvania state militia was unreliable, and refused its help. Hamilton argued that <b>Congress</b> ought to adjourn to Princeton, New Jersey. <b>Congress</b> agreed, and relocated there. Frustrated with {{the weakness of the}} central government, Hamilton while in Princeton drafted a call to revise the Articles of Confederation. This resolution contained many features of the future U.S. Constitution, including a strong federal government with the ability to collect taxes and raise an army. It also included the separation of powers into the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{convince}} <b>Congress</b> to keep the capital in Philadelphia, the city began construction on a massive new Presidential palace on 9th Street {{as well as an}} expansion to the County Courthouse into what would become <b>Congress</b> Hall. Upon the return of <b>Congress</b> to Philadelphia on December 6, 1790, the first level of <b>Congress</b> Hall had been transformed into the chamber for the House of Representatives and the second floor had been converted into a chamber for the United States Senate. Despite their efforts to construct new buildings for use by the federal government, the city's residents failed to convince <b>Congress</b> to modify the Residence Act and make Philadelphia the permanent capital. <b>Congress</b> Hall served as the capitol building until May 14, 1800, when the offices of the national government moved to Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|On December 1, 1774, the Provincial <b>Congress</b> elected Hancock as a {{delegate}} to the Second Continental <b>Congress</b> to replace James Bowdoin, who {{had been unable to}} attend the first <b>Congress</b> because of illness. Before Hancock reported to the Continental <b>Congress</b> in Philadelphia, the Provincial <b>Congress</b> unanimously reelected him as their president in February 1775. Hancock's multiple roles gave him enormous influence in Massachusetts, and as early as January 1774 British officials had considered arresting him. After attending the Provincial <b>Congress</b> in Concord in April 1775, Hancock and Samuel Adams decided that it was not safe to return to Boston before leaving for Philadelphia.
