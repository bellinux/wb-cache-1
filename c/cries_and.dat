5|$|In Rio de Janeiro, Mr. A and Sunehri {{plan their}} next heist. As Dixit's {{analysis}} has named Rio {{the location of}} Mr. A's next heist, Jai and Ali travel to the city. There they meet Monali (Bipasha Basu), Shonali's twin sister, and Ali immediately falls for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri evolves into romance and he unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, he sees Sunehri and Jai together and realizes that Sunehri has been working undercover for Jai. Aryan forces Sunehri {{to play a game}} of Russian roulette. Sunehri <b>cries</b> <b>and</b> refuses to shoot Aryan because she loves him, but Aryan forces her to play. After six attempted shots from the gun, neither is injured, because Aryan has not loaded the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and confesses her love for him. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early Lydian coins while disguised as performing dwarfs. Sunehri indicates that she does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai and Ali to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up {{on the top of a}} waterfall, where Ali catches Sunehri. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall, after which Jai allows Sunehri to go free.|$|E

25|$|Guanyin is {{immensely popular}} among Chinese Buddhists, {{especially}} those from devotional schools. She is generally {{seen as a}} source of unconditional love and, more importantly, as a saviour. In her bodhisattva vow, Guanyin promises to answer the <b>cries</b> <b>and</b> pleas of all sentient beings and to liberate them from their own karmic woes. Based on the Lotus Sutra and the Shurangama sutra, Avalokitesvara is generally seen as a saviour, both spiritually and physically. The sutras state that through his saving grace even those who have no chance of being enlightened can be enlightened, and those deep in negative karma can still find salvation through his compassion.|$|E

Despite strenuous effort, he realizes that still many unhappy beings were yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, his head splits into eleven pieces. Amitābha, seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear {{the cries of the}} suffering. Upon hearing these <b>cries</b> <b>and</b> comprehending them, Avalokiteśvara attempts to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces.

25|$|France {{had been}} {{undergoing}} {{a revolution in}} its government and social orders. A National Assembly declared itself into being and promulgated their intention to provide France with a fair and liberal constitution. Louis XVI moved to Paris in October of that year but grew to detest Paris and organised an escape plot in 1791. The escape plot known as the Flight to Varennes ultimately failed to materialise and destroyed any positive public opinion for the monarchy. Louis XVI's brothers-in-exile in Coblenz rallied for an invasion of France. Austria and Prussia responded to the royal brothers' <b>cries</b> <b>and</b> released the Declaration of Pillnitz in August. The declaration stated that Prussia and Austria wished to restore Louis XVI to absolute power but would only attempt to do so {{with the assistance of}} the other European powers.|$|E

She later acted, with acclaim, in 10 of his movies, including Persona (1966), The Passion of Anna (1969), <b>Cries</b> <b>and</b> Whispers (1972) and Autumn Sonata (1978), in which her co-actress, Ingrid Bergman, resumed her Swedish cinema career. She co-acted often with Swedish actor and fellow Bergman collaborator, Erland Josephson, with whom she made the Swedish television drama, Scenes from a Marriage (1973), which was also edited to feature-movie length and distributed theatrically. Ullmann acted with Laurence Olivier in A Bridge Too Far (1977), directed by Richard Attenborough.|$|E
40|$|Infant {{excessive}} <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fussing {{has been}} linked to adverse maternal outcomes such as increased depression and stress, and decreased feelings of parenting self-efficacy. Infant crying has also been identified as the number one trigger caregivers report prior to an abusive action, placing infants who cry excessively at risk. Fathers and male caregivers have been identified as the primary offenders in the majority of infant abuse cases, suggesting a particular risk between fathers <b>and</b> infants who <b>cry</b> excessively. However, the relationship between excessive <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fathers has not been explored to the same extent as mothers. In an effort to address the identified risks of infant <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fathers, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how fathers 2 ̆ 7 well-being is impacted by infant <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fussing.

25|$|UNICEF {{has found}} that {{children}} who are forced to beg by third parties are often removed from their families, surrender the majority of their income to their exploiter, endure unsafe work and living conditions, and are at times maimed to increase profits. The process of maiming, popularized by the film Slumdog Millionaire, is common given that according to the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review children with apparent special needs often make upwards of three times as much as other children who beg. In addition to inflictions such as blindness and loss of limbs, other physical abuses for the purposes of heightening profits include pouring chili pepper on a child's tongue to give the appearance of impeded speech, the use of opium to elicit <b>cries,</b> <b>and</b> administering forced injections of drugs that will increase a child's energy and alertness. Testimonies against trafficking ring gang leaders have discussed the detainment of individuals in small cells devoid of food, water, and light to make victims weak and feeble, and thus more likely to elicit donations.|$|E

Emma {{says that he}} won't, that she'll help him fight it together, and that she still wants a future with him. But Hook tells her not to, that their future is now, and that he’s happy just to know that she has one, before going limp. Emma says that it's not enough for her. She holds him and <b>cries,</b> <b>and</b> then takes Excalibur and floods it with magic. In the diner, Merlin tells them it’s too late, and tendrils of darkness emerge from him as he is released from Excalibur (the darkness was what bound Merlin to the fragment of Excalibur). The dark tendrils re-emerge from Excalibur and flow into Killian's heart, bathing him in a golden light. Then, Hook vanishes and his name appears on the blade of Excalibur. Then, a burst of dark magic erupts from the blade of Excalibur, turning Emma into her present-day appearance, with white hair and a dark appearance, signifying the completion of her journey into darkness. At the same time, a flood of dark energy pours into the entrance of the Vault of the Dark One, and reforms into a cloaked Killian.|$|E

At a concentration of 100 μg of toxin per milliliter of artificial diet, six Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ca, Cry 1 Ea, Cry 1 Fa, Cry 1 Ja, <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab) were not toxic at all. Cry 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ja, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth. The other Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 Ba, Cry 1 Da, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca) were toxic to E. insulana larvae. The 50 % lethal concentration values of these toxins ranged from 0. 39 to 21. 13 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, respectively) for an E. insulana laboratory colony originating from Egypt and from 0. 20 to 4. 25 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Da, respectively) for a laboratory colony originating from Spain. The relative potencies of the toxins in the population from Egypt were highest for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>and</b> they were both significantly more toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, followed by <b>Cry</b> 1 Da <b>and</b> finally <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia.
