40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the design, construction and test results of a <b>common</b> <b>coil</b> dipole DCC 017 made using “React & Wind ” Nb 3 Sn technology. It reached the computed short sample field of 10. 2 T at 10. 8 kA after a number of quenches. In order to build high field magnets with brittle pre-reacted superconductors one must develop magnet designs, tooling and construction techniques that keep conductor degradation due to bending and handling to a tolerable level. The successful construction and test of this magnet demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} design and build magnets in the 10 (plus) T range using “React & Wind ” technology. The magnet is based on a 2 -layer <b>common</b> <b>coil</b> design with a clear horizontal space of 31 mm.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the <b>common</b> <b>coil</b> magnet {{system for the}} proposed very large hadron collider (VLHC) [1]. In this system, the high energy booster (HEB), the injector to VLHC, is integrated as the iron dominated low field aperture within the coldmass of the <b>common</b> <b>coil</b> magnet design introduced earlier [2]. This 4 -in- 1 magnet concept for a 2 -in- 1 machine should provide a major cost reduction in building and operating VLHC.

Due to its ''conductor friendly'' nature, the <b>common</b> <b>coil</b> design is attractive for building high field 2 -in- 1 dipoles with brittle materials such as HTS and Nb{sub 3 }Sn. At the current rate of development, it is expected that a sufficient amount of HTS with the required performance would be available in a few years for building a short magnet. In the interim, the first generation dipoles will be built with Nb{sub 3 }Sn superconductor. They will use a ''React and Wind'' technology similar to that used in HTS and will produce a 12. 5 T central field in a 40 mm aperture. The Nb{sub 3 }Sn coils and support structure of this magnet will {{become a part of the}} next generation hybrid magnet with inner coils made of HTS. To develop various aspects of the technology in a scientific and experimental manner, a 10 -turn coil program has been started in parallel. The program allows a number of concepts to be evaluated with a rapid throughput in a cost-effective way. Three 10 -turn Nb{sub 3 }Sn coils have been built and one HTS coil is under construction.

40|$|AbstractFlow-induced {{crystallization}} {{has long}} been an important subject in polymer processing. Varying processing conditions can produce different morphologies, which lead to different properties. Recent studies indicated that the final morphology is in fact dictated by the initial formation of crystallization precursor structures (i. e. shish-kebabs) under flow. In this article, factors that affect the shish-kebab formation in entangled polymer melts are systematically reviewed, including the concept of coil–stretch transition, chain dynamics, critical orientation molecular weight, phase transition during shish and kebab formations. In particular, recent experimental results from in situ rheo-X-ray studies and ex situ microscopic examinations have been presented to illustrate several new findings of flow-induced shish-kebab structures in polymer melts. (1) The shish entity consists of stretched chains (or chain segments) that can be in the amorphous, mesomorphic or crystalline state. (2) The kebab entity mainly arises from the crystallization of <b>coiled</b> <b>chains</b> (or chain segments), which seems to follow a diffusion-control growth process.

Two high field magnet designs have been developed and are currently in the prototyping stage. One of them, the one-layer, <b>common</b> <b>coil</b> dipole model, uses brittle Nb 3 Sn superconductor in the react-and-wind approach. In view of the <b>common</b> <b>coil</b> magnet development a more general react-and-wind R&D program has been launched two years ago, aiming at {{a better understanding of}} the performance degradation of the brittle Nb 3 Sn during the multiple technological steps from virgin strand to the magnet. The racetrack magnet program is part of the react-and-wind development program, whereby the performance degradation is measured in flat racetrack coils, assembled into a simple mechanical structure. The second racetrack magnet has been recently tested. The following note reports on temperature margin measurements performed on the second racetrack model. These measurements were obtained using a combination of a spot heater and a calibrated temperature sensor, fixed onto a turn of the magnet in close proximity to each other. The magnet was operated at a constant current below the short sample limit and the cable temperature was raised, sending a DC current through the spot heater, while measuring the temperature rise in the cable, until a quench occurred. The so found temperature margin can be related to the critical current in the particular spot where the spot heater and temperature sensor were located. Therefore the temperature margin measurement allows for an indirect measurement of the local performance limit of the magnet. The experimental results, as well as the critical surface implementations used to predict the temperature margin for a given strain state in the Nb 3 Sn conductor are discussed in this note...|$|R

For example, there is an obvious change in pH along the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach (pH =  1 – 3) to the intestine (pH =  5 – 8), chronic wounds have pH values between 7.4 and 5.4 [40], and tumour tissue is acidic extracellularly [41, 42]. Therefore, unlike temperature changes, this property can be exploited for a direct response at a certain tissue or in a cellular compartment. The key element for pH responsive polymers {{is the presence of}} ionisable, weak acidic or basic moieties that attach to a hydrophobic backbone, such as polyelectrolytes [6, 10, 43].
