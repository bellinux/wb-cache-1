In the present paper, we calculate the Schur index {{of all the}} irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> some overgroups of the special linear groups. The overgroups in question are the special linear groups extended by diagonal automorphisms, and the subgroups of the general linear group that contain the special linear group. To each conjugacy class <b>of</b> irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> the special linear group in each overgroup is associated a Clifford class. The Clifford class controls all the irreducible <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> the overgroup and intermediate subgroups {{that are related to}} the given irreducible by Clifford theory.

Although character sheaves were devised with <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> representations of finite groups of Lie type in mind, character sheaves are perfectly well defined for reductive algebraic groups over any algebraically closed field. Nevertheless, {{the relation between}} <b>character</b> sheaves <b>of</b> an algebraic group G over an algebraic closure of a field K and <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> representations of G(K) is well understood only when K is a finite field and when K is the field of complex numbers.
