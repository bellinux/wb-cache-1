5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Elements</b> in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} several unknown <b>chemical</b> <b>elements,</b> including one that would fill {{a gap in the}} carbon family in his Periodic Table of the Elements, located between silicon and tin. Because of its position in his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its atomic weight to be about 72.0.|$|E

5|$|This page shows large-cell {{versions}} of the periodic table. For each element name, symbol, atomic number, and mean atomic mass value for the natural isotopic composition of each element are shown. The periodic table of the <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> is a tabular method of displaying the <b>chemical</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E
50|$|The word Ocsigen is a {{homophone}} of the French Oxygène (the <b>chemical</b> <b>element</b> Oxygen). Similarly, Eliom is a homophone of Hélium (the <b>chemical</b> <b>element</b> Helium).|$|R
50|$|A <b>chemical</b> <b>element</b> {{bonded to}} an {{identical}} <b>chemical</b> <b>element</b> {{is not a}} chemical compound since only one element, not two different elements, is involved. Examples are the diatomic molecule hydrogen (H2) and the polyatomic molecule sulfur (S8).|$|R

5|$|The European {{spacecraft}} SMART-1, {{the second}} ion-propelled spacecraft, was in lunar orbit from 15 November 2004 until its lunar impact on 3 September 2006, {{and made the}} first detailed survey of <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> on the lunar surface.|$|E
5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one of the <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> in the first row (or period) of the {{periodic}} table of the <b>chemical</b> <b>elements.</b> The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.|$|E
5|$|During {{early studies}} of the optical {{spectrum}} of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Six {{nonmetals}} occur naturally as monatomic noble gases: helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and {{the radioactive}} radon (Rn). They comprise {{a group of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> with very similar properties. In their standard states they are all colorless, odourless, nonflammable gases with characteristically very low chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is {{composed}} primarily of the <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> hydrogen and helium; {{they account for}} 74.9% and 23.8% {{of the mass of}} the Sun in the photosphere, respectively. All heavier elements, called metals in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodic}} {{table is a}} tabular arrangement of the <b>chemical</b> <b>elements,</b> ordered by their atomic number, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. This ordering shows periodic trends, such as elements with similar behaviour in the same column. It also shows four rectangular blocks with some approximately similar chemical properties. In general, within one row (period) the elements are metals on the left, and non-metals on the right.|$|E

5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other <b>chemical</b> <b>elements.</b> It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E
5|$|For 80 of the <b>chemical</b> <b>elements,</b> {{at least}} one stable isotope exists. As a rule, {{there is only a}} handful of stable {{isotopes}} for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Elements,</b> in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.|$|E

50|$|The {{atomic number}} or proton number (symbol Z) of a <b>chemical</b> <b>element</b> {{is the number}} of protons found in the nucleus of an atom. It is {{identical}} to the charge number of the nucleus. The atomic number uniquely identifies a <b>chemical</b> <b>element.</b> In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.|$|R
50|$|Vasili Evgrafovich Samarsky-Bykhovets (Васи́лий Евгра́фович Сама́рский-Быховец; November 7, 1803 - May 31, 1870) was a Russian mining {{engineer}} {{and the chief}} of Russian Mining Engineering Corps between 1845 and 1861. The mineral samarskite (samarskite-Y, samarskite-Yb and calciosamarskite), and <b>chemical</b> <b>element</b> samarium are named after him. He {{was the first person}} whose name was given to a <b>chemical</b> <b>element.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{contribute to}} antioxidant defense by chelating transition metals and {{preventing them from}} catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important {{is the ability to}} sequester iron, which is the function of iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin. Selenium and zinc are commonly referred to as antioxidant nutrients, but these <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are a group (column) in the {{periodic}} table consisting of the <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of {{the periodic table}} of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide {{the best example of}} group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> {{are often}} {{displayed}} in a periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with {{the same number of}} valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the noble gases.|$|E

5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} (historically also the inert gases) {{make up a}} group of <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> with similar properties; under {{standard}} conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six noble gases that occur naturally are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to relativistic effects; its chemistry {{has not yet been}} investigated.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} and observation of planetary systems around stars {{other than the}} Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> with an atomic number greater than 2 (helium)—is now thought to determine {{the likelihood that a}} star will have planets. Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich population I star will likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor, population II star.|$|E
