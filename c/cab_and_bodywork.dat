50|$|Once the UK economy {{began to}} improve {{in the mid}} 1930s, the Southern Railway had further need for heavy {{shunting}} locomotives in its marshalling yards around London. The Z class steam locomotives had proved successful for this task but Maunsell wanted to compare their performance with diesel-electric alternatives. He therefore sought authorisation {{for the construction of}} three experimental locomotives for use in the busy Norwood marshalling yard where there was a continuous need for such locomotives. No private manufacturer {{was in a position to}} build the new locomotives and so they were jointly constructed by the Southern Railway's Ashford works, who constructed the framing, <b>cabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodywork,</b> <b>and</b> English Electric Ltd of Preston, who fitted the traction motors. The three locomotives were also provided with duplicate controls to enable them to be driven by one man from either side of the cab. They were delivered during September and October 1937.|$|R

40|$|The International Journal of Therapeutic Massage <b>and</b> <b>Bodywork</b> (IJTMB) has as {{its core}} a key {{interest}} in and mission to develop the practice of therapeutic massage <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> by contributing to the field’s body of knowledge. The IJTMB Editorial Board understands that one’s daily practice provides the initial testing ground {{for the development of}} practice-based knowledge and, ultimately, expertise. Consequently, this practicebased knowledge and experience provides fertile ground for research ideas that further refine our understanding and come full circle to enhance clinical efficacy. Ultimately, without discourse and knowledge transference, the possibility of growing the body of knowledge for therapeutic massage <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> or stimulating research in the field is lost. To facilitate discourse and transference of knowledge within the field of therapeutic massage <b>and</b> <b>bodywork,</b> the IJTMB is launching a new journal component entitled Trigger Points: Topical Dialogue amongst Therapeutic Massage & <b>Bodywork</b> Practitioners <b>and</b> Educators. The purpose of IJTMB’s Trigger Points is to “trigger” the sharing and discussion of knowledge and expertise among therapeutic massage <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> practitioners, educators, <b>and</b> researchers about different approaches to treating specific conditions or addressing specific population issues. Each IJTMB issue, starting with this issue, will include a call for responses to the next Trigger Points topic. Publication of the results for each topic will be in the second issue after the initial call for submissions. With your participation, these IJTMB Trigger Points columns will spark dynamic dialogue, perhaps even collaborations, in the therapeutic massage <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> field across practitioners, educators, and researchers...|$|R

50|$|Forty-three states, the District of Columbia {{and five}} Canadian provinces {{currently}} offer {{some type of}} credential to professionals in the massage <b>and</b> <b>bodywork</b> field—usually licensure, certification or registration. Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia require some type of licensing for massage therapists. In the US, 39 states use the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage <b>and</b> <b>Bodywork's</b> certification program {{as a basis for}} granting licenses either by rule or statute. The National Board grants the designation Nationally Certified in Therapeutic Massage <b>and</b> <b>Bodywork</b> (NCTMB). There are two tests available and one can become certified through a portfolio process with equivalent training and experience. Between 10% and 20% of towns or counties regulate the profession. The National Certification offered by the NCBTMB does not mean that someone can practice massage in any state. These local regulations can range from prohibition on opposite sex massage, fingerprinting and venereal checks from a doctor, to prohibition on house calls because of concern regarding sale of sexual services.|$|R
