2500|$|In {{television}} stations, recording studios, {{and other}} installations where signal quality is critical, a special signal ground {{known as a}} [...] "technical ground" [...] (or [...] "technical earth", [...] "special earth", and [...] "audio earth") is often installed, to prevent ground loops. This is basically {{the same thing as}} an AC power ground, but no general appliance ground wires are allowed any connection to it, as they may carry electrical interference. For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio. In most cases, the studio's metal equipment racks are all joined together with heavy copper cables (or flattened copper tubing or busbars) and similar connections are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general <b>chassis</b> <b>grounded</b> appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC ground connection to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy copper pipe, if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} the SPICE modeling of multiple plane structures where the inner layers planes have different shapes than the outer layer planes. These structures are {{often seen in}} {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB), or the space between a PCB and metal chassis. First, a SPICE model is proposed for these structures using 2 -dimensional ladder networks and ideal transformers. Next, the model is expanded to structures including vertical connecting conductors, such as vias in a PCB and grounding posts connecting a PCB to a metal chassis. Coupling properties inside a PCB are calculated using the SPICE model and shown to be consistent with experimental data. Furthermore, radiated emissions from a PCB-chassis system are also calculated based on the SPICE and equivalent magnetic current source models. The results are consistent with experimental data to show the changes in radiated EMI due to the locations of grounding posts.

50|$|Hover mowers are powered rotary push {{lawn mowers}} that use an {{impeller}} above the spinning blades to drive air downward, thereby creating an air cushion that lifts the mower above the ground. The operator can then easily move the mower as it floats over the grass. Hover mowers are necessarily light {{in order to}} achieve the air cushion and typically have plastic bodies with an electric motor. The most significant disadvantage, however, is the cumbersome usability in rough terrain or on the edges of lawns, as the lifting air-cushion is destroyed by wide gaps between the <b>chassis</b> and the <b>ground.</b> Hover mowers are built to operate on steep slopes, waterfronts, and high-weeded areas, so they are often used by golf course greenskeepers and commercial landscapers. Grass collection is often available, but can be poor in some models. The quality of cut can be inferior if the grass is pushed away from the blade by the cushion of air.|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} several decades there have been many {{attempts}} to improve suspension performance due to its importance within vehicle dynamics. The suspension system main functions are to connect the <b>chassis</b> to the <b>ground,</b> and to isolate the <b>chassis</b> from the <b>ground.</b> To improve upon these two functions, large amounts of effort are focused on two elements that form the building blocks of the suspension system, stiffness and damping. With the advent of new technologies, such as variable dampers, and powerful microprocessors and sensors, suspension performance can be enhanced beyond the traditional capabilities of a passive suspension system. Recently, Yin et al. [1, 2] have developed a novel dual chamber pneumatic spring that can provide tunable stiffness characteristics, which is rare compared to the sea of tunable dampers. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a controller {{to take advantage of the}} novel pneumatic spring’s functionality with a tunable damper to improve vehicle dynamic performance. Since the pneumatic spring is a slow-acting element (i. e. low bandwidth), the typical control logic for semi-active suspension systems are not practical for this framework. Most semi-active controllers assume the use of fast-acting (i. e. high bandwidth) variable dampers within the suspension design. In this case, a lookup table controller is used to manage the stiffness and damping properties for a wide range of operating conditions. To determine the optimum stiffness and damping properties, optimization is employed. Four objective functions are used to quantify vehicle performance; ride comfort, rattle space (i. e. suspension deflection), handling (i. e. tire deflection), and undamped sprung mass natural frequency. The goal is to minimize the first three objectives, while maximizing the latter to avoid motion sickness starting from 1 Hz and downward. However, these goals cannot be attained simultaneously, necessitating compromises between them. Using the optimization strength of genetic algorithms, a Pareto optima set can be generated to determine the compromises between objective functions that have been normalized. Using a trade-off study, the stiffness and damping properties can be selected from the Pareto optima set for suitability within an operating condition of the control logic. When implementing the lookup table controller, a practical method is employed to recognize the road profile as there is no direct method to determine road profile. To determine the road profile for the lookup table controller, the unsprung mass RMS acceleration and suspension state are utilized. To alleviate the inherent flip-flopping drawback of lookup table controllers, a temporal deadband is employed to eliminate the flip-flopping of the lookup table controller. Results from the semi-active suspension with tunable stiffness and damping show that vehicle performance, depending on road roughness and vehicle speed, can improve up to 18 % over passive suspension systems. Since the controller does not constantly adjust the damping properties, cost and reliability may increase over traditional semi-active suspension systems. The flip-flopping drawback of lookup table controllers has been reduced through the use of a temporal deadband, however further enhancement is required to eliminate flip-flopping within the control logic. Looking forward, the novel semi-active suspension has great potential to improve vehicle dynamic performance especially for heavy vehicles that have large sprung mass variation, but to increase robustness the following should be considered: better road profile recognition, the elimination of flip-flopping between suspension states, and using state equations model of the pneumatic spring within the vehicle model for optimization and evaluation...|$|R
5000|$|Fig. 1 shows {{a signal}} cable S linking two {{electronic}} components, including the typical line driver and receiver amplifiers (triangles).

5000|$|Typical {{professional}} audio sources, such as microphones, have three-pin XLR connectors. One is {{the shield}} or <b>chassis</b> <b>ground,</b> {{while the other}} two are signal connections. These signal wires carry two copies of the same signal, but with opposite polarity. (They are often termed [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "cold," [...] and the AES14-1992(r2004) Standard EIA Standard RS-297-A suggest that the pin that carries the positive signal that results from a positive air pressure on a transducer will be deemed 'hot'. Pin 2 has been designated as the 'hot' pin, and that designation serves useful for keeping a consistent polarity {{in the rest of the}} system.) Since these conductors travel the same path from source to destination, the assumption is that any interference is induced upon both conductors equally. The appliance receiving the signals compares the difference between the two signals (often with disregard to electrical ground) allowing the appliance to ignore any induced electrical noise. Any induced noise would be present in equal amounts and in identical polarity on each of the balanced signal conductors, so the two signals’ difference from each other would be unchanged. The successful rejection of induced noise from the desired signal depends in part on the balanced signal conductors receiving the same amount and type of interference. This typically leads to twisted, braided, or co-jacketed cables for use in balanced signal transmission.|$|E

40|$|Bats produce {{very low}} {{frequency}} (VLF) radio pulses and display magnetic qualities. Extremely low fre-quency (ELF) radio emissions were observed inside bat caves. Ground return currents from 60 Hz AC power systems run through the ceiling of some bat caves. MATERIALS AND METHODS I developed a metal antenna tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver that could be tuned to the radio electric wave {{to the exclusion of}} a microphone-detected audio wave (Koemel & Callahan, 1994). It is a wide band receiver, but only frequen-cies between 20 Hz and 18, 000 Hz can be heard in the ear-phone. Atmospheric radio emission observations were made in an area not affected by 60 Hz AC power systems. In July, 1993, I began observing extremely low frequency and {{very low frequency}} (ELF) radio emissions in caves and VLF radio pulses produced by flying bats. The pulses pro-duced by bats were observed only during bat flight activity. This article contains preliminary data obtained with the TRF receiver. METHOD OF RECORDING OBSERVATIONS I recorded the observed ELF radio emissions by attaching an electric-shielded patch cable from the TRF receiver ear-phone jack to the microphone input jack of a computer-com-patible cassette tape recorder set in the RECORD mode. This connection prevented the tape recorder from recording sound. I held the TRF receiver motionless while recording ELF radio emissions.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 46) It is {{well known}} that many types of electronic devices are extremely sensitive to the presence of radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic interference (EMI). Electromagnetic interference affects a device either by conduction or radiation. In most cases, the first step in solving the EMI problem in a device is to define the susceptible circuit, the interference transmission path(s) and the source. Once having identified these parameters, it is necessary to reduce the RF energy arriving at the susceptible device. One method for reducing interference is to provide filtering on the device power line. A normal power line filter is built as a classical low pass filter, that is, series inductors and shunt capacitors either in L, T or pi configuration. For adequate insertion loss these filters must have either 20 - 600 microhenries inductance or. 01 to 2 microfarads or more capacitance. Due to safety reasons in commercial equipment, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) limits the shunt capacitance from each power line to <b>chassis</b> <b>ground</b> to a value which allows less than 5 milliamperes of current to flow to the chassis under the most adverse conditions of frequency and voltage. This current limitation is even more stringent in some medical electronic applications. When the shunt capacitance is limited, the inductance in a filter must be increased to retain the same cutoff frequency (fc). However, the inductor will cause a voltage drop equal to IWL. When L is large and I is large due to machine power requirements, this voltage drop may be large enough to impair the function of the machine. In addition, the size of the inductor must be physically large to prevent the saturation of the core. This imposes problems of size and weight which can be objectionable. In some circumstances, a common mode filter can be used to attain the required insertion loss while minimizing size and weight requirements. The non-availability of design aids and the unpredictable behavior of the common-mode filter led to a detailed analysis of the common-mode filter. The common-mode filter circuits were analyzed using the Electronics Circuit Analysis Program...|$|E
