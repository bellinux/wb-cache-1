True, at present, there can come from hence, to them that are thus concerned in the advocateship of Christ, but little comfort; but yet it yields them great security; they have [...] "an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." [...] God knows this, the devil feels this, and the children shall have the comfort of it afterwards. I say, the time is coming when they shall know that even then, when they knew it not, they had an Advocate with the Father; an Advocate who was neither loath, nor afraid, nor ashamed, to plead for their defense against their proudest foe. And will not this, when they know it, yield them comfort? Doubtless it will; yea, more, and of a better kind, than that which flows from the knowledge that one is born to crowns and kingdoms.|$|E

The larger are office spoils, and the more precise is an incumbent’s knowledge of voter opinion, the more likely that she will resort to such populism. My main {{result is that the}} public’s trust or distrust in politicians ’ behavior may be self-fulfilling. When voters assess the quality of an incumbent politician, they will compare her policy choices with their own prior opinion. If voters think that the incumbent was just trying to conform, a failure to do so will be even more damaging for the incumbent’s election chances. However, this only increases the incumbent’s incentives to conform, which indeed confirms voters ’ skepticism. Loosely put, a skeptic voter attitude tends to generate conformist politicians, while a trusting attitude tends to generate <b>confident</b> <b>ones...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Confident {{witnesses}} are deemed more credible than unconfident ones, and accurate {{witnesses are}} deemed more credible than inaccurate ones. But are those effects independent? Two experiments show that errors in testimony damage the overall credibility of witnesses who were {{confident about the}} erroneous testimony more than that of witnesses who were not confident about it. Furthermore, after making an error, less confident witnesses may appear more credible than more <b>confident</b> <b>ones.</b> Our interpretation of these results is that people make inferences about source calibration when evaluating testimony and other social communication. How do you decide whether another person is a reliable source of information? In everyday life, you may rely on the other person’s expressions of confidence, history of accurate (and erroneous) statements, and opportunity to be well informed {{on the subject of}} the assertion, as well as on your own inferences about the person’s motives and character and, in some cases, your beliefs about his or her expertise. Such habits are very general and apply to people’s evaluations of everyone, including their acquaintances, friends, and advisors. Judgments of credibility are especially important in trials. Many behavioral studies show that jurors, or mock jurors, rely on expressed confidence when evaluating eyewitnesses ’ credibilit...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores what competences are {{considered}} by the Spanish young drivers as more relevant to improve their current training as drivers {{as well as the}} relationship of these interests with their current risky driving self- assessment skills. For this purpose, a survey research design was planned with the Spanish young drivers (age between 18 and 24 years; no more than 4 years driving experience) as target population. From the initial near 1300 people sample invited to participate, we finally obtained complete data from 321 subjects. Measurement was based on participants self-report of interests about contents to improve their driving, self-report of their risky driving behaviour, and self¿assessment about their likelihood of being involved in a risky driving situation. Two main results arose from our data analysis: (1) novice drivers showed as their main interest to improve competences related to recognize their strengths and weaknesses as drivers (i. e., self-assessment skills); (2) a significant relationship between novice drivers interests and their current risky driving self-assessment skills was found, more especifically, general interest about post-license training was higher for the under confident self-assessors than for the over <b>confident</b> <b>ones.</b> These results provide a relevant input {{to be taken into account}} in the design of driver training programs for novice drivers; moreover, the relationship between their training interests and their current risky driving self-assessment skills introduces an additional factor to be considered in the implementation of these training program...|$|E
40|$|Typical {{dimensionality}} reduction (DR) {{methods are}} data-oriented, focusing on directly {{reducing the number}} of random variables (or features) while retaining the maximal variations in the high-dimensional data. Targeting unsupervised situations, this paper aims to address the problem from a novel perspective and considers model-oriented dimensionality reduction in parameter spaces of binary multivariate distributions. Specifically, we propose a general parameter reduction criterion, called Confident-Information-First (CIF) principle, to maximally preserve confident parameters and rule out less <b>confident</b> <b>ones.</b> Formally, the confidence of each parameter can be assessed by its contribution to the expected Fisher information distance within a geometric manifold over the neighbourhood of the underlying real distribution. Then we demonstrate two implementations of CIF in different scenarios. First, when there are no observed samples, we revisit the Boltzmann Machines (BM) from a model selection perspective and theoretically show that both the fully visible BM (VBM) and the BM with hidden units can be derived from the general binary multivariate distribution using the CIF principle. This finding would help us uncover and formalize the essential parts of the target density that BM aims to capture and the non-essential parts that BM should discard. Second, when there exist observed samples, we apply CIF to the model selection for BM, which is in turn made adaptive to the observed samples. The sample-specific CIF is a heuristic method to decide the priority order of parameters, which can improve the search efficiency without degrading the quality of model selection results as shown in a series of density estimation experiments...|$|E

40|$|Magister Artium (Social Work) - MA(SW) Adolescence {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a particularly important stage for the continued development of young adults as they start {{to make their own}} life’s decisions and engage in a variety of activities that will influence the rest of their lives. One of the important goals of adolescence is the development of decision-making skills as independence increases, requiring more independent decisions. When an adolescent makes decisions, it is important that s/he has the skills to make <b>confident</b> <b>ones.</b> Various studies identify factors that could affect adolescent decision-making, such as the family environment and family-member relationships, but information pertaining to this subject is still relatively limited. This study examines the role of family functioning in the decision-making styles of adolescents. The theoretical framework used for this study is based on the Family Systems Theory, of which the McMaster Model of Family Functioning (MMFF) is a component. The MMFF is one variation that underlies the family system model, be it nuclear or extended families discussed within chapter 2. A quantitative methodological approach was employed in this study with a cross-sectional correlational research design. The sample consisted of 457 Grade 9 learners from schools in the Overberg area. The data was collected using a self-reported questionnaire that included the Demographic Information, the Family Assessment Device and the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire, as part of the quantitative methodology. The data was then analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences V 22 (SPSS). The results were provided using descriptive and inferential statistics. Participation in this study was voluntary after being well informed, while confidentiality and anonymity was maintained throughout the study. The main results for family functioning indicated the assumption that the participants might have ineffective functioning on all the family functioning variables. The main results for decision-making styles showed an assumption that the vigilant decision-making style was the highest and the Buck-passing decision-making style, the lowest...|$|E
