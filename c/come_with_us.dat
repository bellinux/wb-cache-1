500|$|When The Chemical Brothers {{started to}} write music again after {{finishing}} the album <b>Come</b> <b>with</b> <b>Us</b> (2002), [...] "The Boxer" [...] {{was one of}} the earliest tracks that they wrote for their next album, Push the Button (2005). The Charlatans lead singer Tim Burgess, who had collaborated on the duo's debut album track [...] "Life Is Sweet" [...] ten years earlier, contributed the vocals to this song. According to the group, out of all collaborators, Burgess still remained a close friend to them. [...] "If he's in London, we would probably have a drink together, three of us, or, you know, when we're in LA, he will come to our gig," [...] they shared.|$|E
2500|$|Oh, {{confound}} all this. ... I'm not a scholar, as Master Cromwell never {{tires of}} pointing out, and frankly I don't {{know whether the}} marriage was lawful or not. But damn it, Thomas, look at those names. ... You know those men! Can't you do what I did, and <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> for fellowship? ...|$|E
2500|$|However, as {{recently}} as the first week of March, Chávez called upon Obama to follow the path to socialism, which he termed as the [...] "only" [...] way out of the global recession. [...] "Come with us, align yourself, <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> on the road to socialism. This is the only path. Imagine a socialist revolution in the United States", Chávez told a group of workers in the southern Venezuelan state of Bolívar. He said that people were calling Obama a [...] "socialist" [...] for the measures of state intervention he is taking to counter the crisis, so it would not be too far-fetched to suggest that he might join the project of [...] "21st century socialism" [...] that the Venezuelan leader is heading.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Gladly,' I answered, for I {{was curious}} to see the place, but the noble hesitated awhile, though {{in the end he}} <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> to his ill-fortune.|$|R

2500|$|In June 1936 Churchill {{organised}} a deputation {{of senior}} Conservatives who shared his concern to see Baldwin, Chamberlain, and Halifax. He {{had tried to}} include delegates from the other two parties, and later wrote [...] "If {{the leaders of the}} Labour and Liberal oppositions had <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> {{there might have been a}} political situation so intense as to enforce remedial action." [...] As it was the meeting achieved little, Baldwin arguing that the Government was doing all it could given the anti-war feeling of the electorate. But it showed that more Conservatives shared Churchill's views—he was less isolated then he had been earlier. John Gunther wrote that year that he [...] "may still become prime minister ... Churchill's judgment is faulty, people say; he is too impetuous and 'unstable'; but most people agree that in a great upheaval he would emerge as Britain's national leader." ...|$|E
2500|$|Linguist George Lakoff {{argued that}} the [...] "ad has raised vital {{questions}} that need a thorough and open discussion. The ad worked brilliantly to reveal, via its framing, an essential but previously hidden truth: the Bush Administration and its active supporters have betrayed {{the trust of the}} troops and the American people." [...] Liberal blogger Arianna Huffington argued that [...] "Was the MoveOn ad blunt? Yes. Did it go for the ? No doubt. But while the way it chose to make its points can be debated, the accuracy of those points cannot." [...] Anti-war activist and Congressional candidate Cindy Sheehan stated that [...] "I have often been critical of MoveOn.org, basically because I feel, for the most part that they support Democrats to the detriment of democracy... The occupation of Iraq is a disaster and I applaud MoveOn for moving a little closer to the true 'anti-war' movement and encourage them to <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> farther." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the time}} came to groom a {{successor}} for the king, {{there seemed to be no}} suitable heir. Soldiers were dispatched to the village to find the illegitimate children. After their arrival, they overheard a peasant woman call to her son named Wamba, who was tending cattle with a stick. The soldiers knew they had come upon the youth they sought and declared: [...] "You are the rightful king and we must ask you to <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> to the palace." [...] Wamba was unwilling, or at least pretended to be. He took his stick and thrust it into the ground, saying, [...] "I will only accept the throne if this stick takes root." [...] The stick he carried, was of chopo or black poplar, which easily takes root in fertile soil. When it began to grow, Wamba agreed to go with the soldiers to become the new king of the Visigoths, being elected and crowned in what is today the tiny village of Wamba in the region around Madrid.|$|E

60|$|When {{the time}} had come for our {{departure}} Lettie <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> into the hall to see that we were well wrapped up. Leslie had spoken very few words. She was conscious that he was deeply offended, but her manner was quite calm, and she petted us both brightly.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1936, Churchill {{organised}} a deputation {{of senior}} Conservatives to see Baldwin, Inskip and Halifax. There had been {{demands for a}} Secret Session of the House and the senior ministers agreed to meet the deputation rather than listen to a potential four-hour speech by Churchill. He had tried to have delegates from the other two parties and later wrote, [...] "If {{the leaders of the}} Labour and Liberal oppositions had <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> {{there might have been a}} political situation so intense as to enforce remedial action." [...] Robert Rhodes James writes that this is [...] "not quite the impression" [...] given by the documentary record of the meetings of 28–29 July, and another meeting in November. Churchill's figures for the size of the Luftwaffe, leaked to him by Ralph Wigram at the Foreign Office, were less accurate than those of the Air Ministry and he believed that the Germans were preparing to unleash thermite bombs [...] "the size of an orange" [...] on London. Ministers stressed that Hitler's intentions were unclear, and the importance of maximising Britain's long-term economic strength through exports, whereas Churchill wanted 25–30 percent of British industry to be brought under state control for purposes of rearmament. Baldwin argued that the important thing had been to win the election to get [...] "a perfectly free hand" [...] for rearmament. The meeting ended with Baldwin agreeing with Churchill that rearmament was vital to deter Germany.|$|E

60|$|A {{moment later}} {{and we were}} {{whirling}} up as we had whirled down. I suppose that Yva <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> though I never saw her do so, and the odd thing was that when we arrived in the sepulchre, she seemed already to be standing there waiting to direct us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, if {{my friend}} of the night comes to revisit me, he will find the bird flown. We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes, and you must tell us exactly what you would like done. Perhaps you would prefer that Joseph <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> so as to look after me?" ...|$|R

60|$|This was so {{surprising}} {{to the man}} who had been beating, that he stood looking on with all the tokens of joy and amazement; and, desiring to see the hatchet, looked this way and that way, upon those of his countrymen who <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> as if asking them if ever they saw the like.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] quoth merry Robin, {{rising from}} the grass, [...] "these are certain gentle guests that <b>came</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> from the highroad over by Newstead Abbey.
