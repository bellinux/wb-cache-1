5|$|During {{her second}} year, Geiling was {{retained}} by the FDA to research unusual deaths related to elixir sulfanilamide, a sulfonamide medicine. Kelsey assisted on this research project, {{which showed that}} the 107 deaths were caused {{by the use of}} diethylene glycol as a solvent. The next year, the United States Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. That same year she completed her studies and received a Ph.D. in pharmacology at the University of Chicago. Working with Geiling led to her interest in teratogens, drugs that cause <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> (birth defects).|$|E
5|$|Hibakusha {{and their}} {{children}} were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination in Japan due to public ignorance {{about the consequences of}} radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects or <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A study of the long-term psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors found that even 17–20 years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Two of {{the most}} common <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> {{affecting}} the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the oesophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal fistula – an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea. Both of these conditions usually occur together. These are found in about 1 in 3500 births. Half of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. The other cases occur singly.|$|E
25|$|In males {{previously}} having undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy, {{there appears}} to be no increase in genetic defects or <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> in their children conceived after therapy. The use of assisted reproductive technologies and micromanipulation techniques might increase this risk. In females previously having undergone chemotherapy, miscarriage and <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> are not increased in subsequent conceptions. However, when in vitro fertilization and embryo cryopreservationis practised between or shortly after treatment, possible genetic risks to the growing oocytes exist, and hence it has been recommended that the babies be screened.|$|E

25|$|In {{pregnant}} women, ACE inhibitors {{taken during}} all the trimesters {{have been reported}} to cause <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations,</b> stillbirths, and neonatal deaths. Commonly reported fetal abnormalities include hypotension, renal dysplasia, anuria/oliguria, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary hypoplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and incomplete ossification of the skull. Overall, about half of newborns exposed to ACE inhibitors are adversely affected.|$|E
25|$|Nitrate, {{which is}} found mostly in {{drinking}} water from ground sources, is a powerful teratogen. A case-control study in rural Australia that was conducted following frequent reports of prenatal mortality and <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> {{found that those who}} drank the nitrate-infected groundwater, as opposed to rain water, ran the risk of giving birth to children with central nervous system disorders, muscoskeletal defects, and cardiac defects.|$|E

25|$|Like all {{hexavalent}} uranium compounds, UO3 is hazardous by inhalation, ingestion, {{and through}} skin contact. It is a poisonous, slightly radioactive substance, which may cause shortness of breath, coughing, acute arterial lesions, {{and changes in}} the chromosomes of white blood cells and gonads leading to <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> if inhaled. However, once ingested, uranium is mainly toxic for the kidneys and may severely affect their function.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors are ADEC {{pregnancy}} category D, {{and should}} be avoided in women {{who are likely to}} become pregnant. In the U.S., ACE inhibitors must be labeled with a boxed warning concerning the risk of birth defects when taken during the second and third trimester. Their use in the first trimester is also associated with a risk of major <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations,</b> particularly affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{vary depending on}} the age at which they occur. In children, growth failure and short stature are the major manifestations of GH deficiency, with common causes including genetic conditions and <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations.</b> It can also cause delayed sexual maturity. In adults, deficiency is rare, with the most common cause a pituitary adenoma, and others including a continuation of a childhood problem, other structural lesions or trauma, and very rarely idiopathic GHD.|$|E

25|$|Animal {{reproduction}} {{studies have}} not shown evidence of {{harm to the}} baby or impairment of fertility with use of high daily doses of ondansetron. A study of over 600,000 pregnancies in Denmark found that ondansetron during pregnancy {{was not associated with}} a significantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defect, preterm birth, low birth weight, or small for gestational age. Other studies concluded that there is an increase in major <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> due to an increase in heart problems among the babies.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{contraception}} {{is considered}} as harmless for the embryo. Peterka and Novotná do however state that syntethic progestines {{used to prevent}} miscarriage in the past frequently caused masculinization of the outer reproductive organs of female newborns due to their androgenic activity. Diethylstilbestrol is a synthetic estrogen used from the 1940s to 1971 when the prenatal exposition {{has been linked to}} the clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. Following studies showed elevated risks for other tumors and <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> of the sex organs for both sexes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} found no {{association}} between lamotrigine exposure in utero and birth defects, while those that have found an association have found only slight associations with minor malformations like cleft palates. Review {{studies have found}} that overall rates of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> in infants exposed to lamotrigine in utero are relatively low (1-4%), which is similar to the rate of malformations in the general population. It is known that lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors like methotrexate are known to be teratogenic.|$|E

A total of 26 cases of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformation</b> (including atresia ani- 10, dermoid cyst- 8, contracted tendon- 7 and urethral diverticulum- 1) were reviewed in this study. Incidence of atresia ani was more in male calves, dermoid cyst and contracted tendon were more common in females. Animal with <b>congenital</b> <b>malformation,</b> surgical correction could be attempted, but breeding of these animals should be avoided...|$|R
25|$|Syndactyly / Polydactyly – The {{most common}} of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> {{affecting}} limbs. It {{is believed that}} Syndactyly, exhibits in variation, in which digits can be fused either partially or across its entire length, or as simple as only being connected superficially by skin. It affects 1 in every 2,000 – 3,000 live births. Polydactyly {{is the presence of}} extra fingers or toes at birth, and is believed to affect somewhere around 2 out of every 1,000 live births. However, it is believed that many cases are so minor that they are taken care of shortly after birth and not reported, so actual statistics may be higher.|$|E
25|$|Hand {{surgery is}} {{concerned}} with acute injuries and chronic diseases of the hand and wrist, correction of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> of the upper extremities, and peripheral nerve problems (such as brachial plexus injuries or carpal tunnel syndrome). Hand surgery {{is an important part}} of training in plastic surgery, as well as microsurgery, which is necessary to replant an amputated extremity. The hand surgery field is also practiced by orthopedic surgeons and general surgeons. Scar tissue formation after surgery can be problematic on the delicate hand, causing loss of dexterity and digit function if severe enough. There have been cases of surgery to women's hands in order to correct perceived flaws to create the perfect engagement ring photo.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{chemotherapeutic}} agents, docetaxel administered to pregnant animals causes {{a variety of}} embryofetal toxicities, including death, when given {{during the period of}} organogenesis. Yet adequate studies investigating maternal and fetal effects in humans are lacking. One small systematic review that examined the use of taxanes to treat breast cancer in pregnancy showed that, out of 19 patients, only three <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> occurred. Two cases of cerebral ventriculomegaly observed in the study were documented prior to the administration of chemotherapy, suggesting an alternate cause of congenital malformation. The third case involved pyloric stenosis in an infant whose mother received a combination regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; because the fetus was exposed to multiple drugs in utero, it remains difficult to identify docetaxel as the causative teratogenic agent. Further studies are needed to better assess the safety of docetaxel in pregnancy and determine appropriate dosing in pregnant women.|$|E
