50|$|Ice blast is not abrasive. It {{does not}} remove {{strongly}} adherent tough coatings like abrasive media would. However, ice blast can remove coatings with weakened adhesion resulting from coating defects or corrosion. As an ice particle impacts on a coating, it causes a compressive {{stress on the}} coating and target system. On impact, the ice particle melts. The coating and target system under compressive stress will react in the opposite direction, producing a tensile stress. When the tensile stress exceeds the <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion</b> force, coating lifting takes place. The lifted coating is in the force of chips and would be carried by the residual water.|$|E

50|$|Galvalume {{steel sheet}} is carbon steel sheet coated with aluminium-zinc alloy by a {{continuous}} hot-dip process. The nominal coating composition is 55% aluminium and 45% zinc. A small but important addition of silicon {{is included in}} the coating alloy. It is added not to enhance the corrosion performance, but to provide good <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion</b> to the steel substrate when the product is roll-formed, drawn, or bent during fabrication.Galvalume steel sheet combines the excellent barrier corrosion protection of aluminium with the galvanic protection of zinc. The result is a coating that lasts a long time, a coating that provides cut-edge protection along sheared edges, and therefore, a coating that offers excellent protection to steel sheet. Although there are a few exceptions, for most applications in most types of environment, Galvalume steel sheet is the preferred product when long-term resistance to atmospheric corrosion is desired. It outlasts a galvanized coating of comparable thickness, and offers cut-edge protection that is not available with aluminium-coated sheet. This cut-edge protection means there is less rust-staining along sheared edges, at scratches, and other imperfections in the coating. Also, since the coating is so resistant to corrosion, it retains a very bright surface appearance when exposed to most atmospheres. These attributes make Galvalume steel sheet the preferred material for roofing. The superior corrosion resistance of Galvalume steel sheet is achieved by the presence of microscopic zinc-rich and aluminium-rich areas within the coating. The aluminium-rich areas, which corrode very slowly, provide the long-term durability while the zinc-rich areas, which corrode preferentially, provide galvanic protection. Galvalume metals are made with steel panels having a coating of corrosion resistant aluminium-zinc alloy applied by a continuous hot dip process. The nominal composition of the coating is 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon. Galvalume is the trade name for this patented sheet steel product. The alloy coating of aluminium and zinc combines the best properties of both metals. It has the corrosion resistance and heat reflectivity characteristic of aluminium coatings, with the formability and galvanic protection of cut edges characteristic of zinc coatings.|$|E

Focus lay on comprehending the impact of pigment dispersant on ink-paper <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion</b> and ultimately on the print quality of offset prints. The work covers laboratory studies, a pilot coating trial designed to produce coated material with a span in surface chemistry and structure, and an industrial offset printing trial. The lab scale studies quantified ink-paper <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion</b> failure during ink setting with a developed laboratory procedure based on the Ink-Surface Interaction Tester (ISIT) and image analysis. Additional polyacrylate dispersant resulted in slower ink setting and reduced ink-paper <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion,</b> with a dependence on its state of salt neutralisation and cation exchange, mainly in the presence of moisture/liquid water. The industrial printing trial on pilot coated papers was designed to study how these laboratory findings affected full scale offset print quality. These trials confirmed the dispersant-sensitive effect on ink-paper <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion,</b> especially at high water feeds. Evaluation of prints from the printing trial resulted in two fundamentally different types of ink adhesion failure being identified. The first type being traditional ink refusal, and the second type being a novel mechanism referred to as ink-lift-off adhesion failure. Ink-lift-off adhesion failure occurs when ink is initially deposited on the paper but then lifted off in a subsequent print unit. In this work, ink adhesion failure by this ink-lift-off mechanism was observed to occur more often than failure due to ink refusal. Print quality evaluation of the industrial prints suggested that water induced mottle was caused by a combination of ink-surface adhesion failure, creating white spots on the print, together with variation in ink layer thickness due to emulsified ink.

40|$|Interfacial {{toughness}} of coatings {{is required}} for two reasons: a) to understand quantitatively degradation of adhesion in service; b) for life assessment of the <b>coated</b> components. <b>Adhesion</b> strength of thermal spray coating is usually measured {{in accordance with the}} tensile method specified by the "ISO 14916 ".

By the virtue of its simplicity and practicality, an indentation method is addressed as one of the promising methods to evaluate the interfacial toughness of coatings. In this method, an interfacial toughness value can be evaluated by measuring a length of the crack formed after pushing the indenter on the coating interface. However, a 3 dimensional geometry of the induced crack which affects the interfacial toughness has not been clear.

40|$|Polymer {{coated sheet}} metal {{components}} find diverse applications in many industries. The manufacturing {{of the components}} generally involves forming of sheet metal into the desired shape and coating of the formed part with organic coating. An alternative manufacturing route is to coat the sheet metal first before forming. The change in the manufacturing sequence can potentially improve cost and reduce environmental impact. This approach, however, requires the coating to survive the deformation process. Thus, the effect of plastic deformation on <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion</b> is of primary interest to many engineers and researchers. This research aims at developing a methodology to predict the adhesion of coating after metal forming processes. A pull-off apparatus that measures the coating pull-off stress was used to indicate the <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion</b> strength. Several types of specimen were designed to obtain uniaxial tension, biaxial tension, and tension-compression deformation modes on pre-coated sheet by using a uniaxial tensile tester. Experimental results from two selected polymer coated sheet metals show that <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion</b> was affected by plastic deformation. An analytical model based on a virtual interface crack concept was developed to indicate the adhesion potential of the coating-substrate interface. From interfacial fracture mechanics, the initial adhesion potential {{is defined as the}} energy release rate characterized by the virtual interface crack and the initial pull-off stress. The analytical model was used to predict <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion</b> loss after deformation in uniaxial tension mode. The analytical model predictions agreed well with experimental results.

The stress field near the interface crack tip was used to calculate the energy release rate and predict the adhesion loss under different deformation modes. The predictions obtained from numerical method are also in good agreements with the experimental results in biaxial tension and tension-compression modes. The research has led {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of plastic deformation on <b>coating</b> <b>adhesion.</b> The developed adhesion test methods can be used to generate useful information on coating durability for diverse practical use.

Nevertheless, like in some other neurologic-metabolic disorders, several alterations are found in peripheral tissues. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether cellular properties which can be studied in vitro on skin fibroblast cultures obtained from Alzheimer's disease patients differ from those of age-matched controls. Down syndrome patients were also included, since the same neuropathological findings are present in nearly 100 % of Down syndrome patients. Since Alzheimer's disease is an age-related disorder, we examined the growth characteristics of skin fibroblast cultures. The in vitro senescence of cultured fibroblasts is widely accepted as a model for in vivo ageing. Normal growth properties were found. We can conclude that there is no premature ageing in Alzheimer's disease nor in Down syndrome and that the abnormalities found in peripheral tissues are related to the disease itself. The beta amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) has been shown to have adhesive interactions.

40|$|Teak wood {{is known}} for its {{resistance}} against natural conditions. It is impervious to the effects of snow, ice, rain, sun, heat, cold, and humidity and withstands weather better than any other wood. That is one of the big reasons that teak wood is chosen for ship decks. But the increasing demand of cruises is leading to bigger ships, then lighter and cheaper materials than teak are needed for deck flooring. A valid solution is the use of resinous coatings, which, moreover, provide a range of aesthetic effects that cannot be obtained with traditional materials.
