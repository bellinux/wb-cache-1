40|$|Wood biomass {{is turned}} into {{industrial}} fuel through chipping. The efficiency of chipping depends on many factors, including <b>chipper</b> <b>knife</b> wear. <b>Chipper</b> <b>knife</b> wear was determined through a long-term follow-up study, conducted at a waste wood recycling yard. Knife wear determined {{a sharp drop}} of productivity (> 20 %) and a severe decay in product quality. Dry sharpening with a grinder mitigated this effect, but it could not replace proper wet sharpening. Increasing the frequency of wet sharpening sessions determined a moderate increase of knife depreciation cost, but it could drastically enhance machine performance and reduce biomass processing cost. Since benefits largely exceed costs, increasing the frequency of wet sharpening sessions may be an effective measure for reducing overall chipping cost. If the main goal of a chipper operator is to increase productivity and/or decrease fuel consumption, then managing knife wear should be a primary target...|$|E
40|$|The Authors {{surveyed}} 6 industrial chipping {{operations for}} a whole work year, collecting data about machine usage, product output, fuel consumption and <b>chipper</b> <b>knife</b> wear. Despite the challenging work conditions offered by mountain operations, industrial chipping contractors manage to achieve a high machine use, ranging from 500 to over 2, 500 h year 1. Product output varies between 18, 000 and over 120, 000 m 3 loose chips per year. In order to acquire enough jobs, operators may travel between 1, 500 to over 20, 000 km in a year. Industrial chipping contractors adopt different operational strategies to achieve their production targets, and they equip accordingly. Some operators prefer to tap smaller local areas and opt for smaller tractor-powered chippers, which are less powerful and productive than larger independent-engine units, but cheaper and capable of negotiating low-standard forest roads. Others prefer to explore larger areas and achieve higher product outputs, and they opt for larger independent-engine chippers, often mounted on trucks. Long term productivity varies with machine type: tractor-powered units produce between 40 and 50 m 3 loose chips per hour, whereas larger independent-engine chippers produce between 60 and 90 m 3 loose chips per hour. Specific fuel consumption is about 0. 5 L diesel per m 3 loose chips, regardless of chipper type. A sharp knife set can process between 200 and 1, 500 m 3 loose chips before getting dull. Disposable knives last longer and are cheaper to manage than standard re-usable knives...|$|E

40|$|To {{carry out}} {{experimental}} studies {{of the influence of}} temperature modes on residual deformation of the sample-ing knives were manufactured pilot models of <b>chipper</b> <b>knives</b> 6 HV 2 S steels (basic) and U 8 A 9 HF each in size up to its analog (finished knife). We draw on the modes recommended for these steels. The experimentalresultsshowed that the samples with smallsize and relatively large thickness after THEN do not have any permanent deformations. Samples ments concerning thin and having a rectangularshape (length 300 mm), then there are residual after deformation as Trough. The magnitude of the deflection is greater the smaller the ratio of the thickness of the sample to its length and width. It is found that the samples made from steel 6 HV 2 S have a deflection value smaller than the samples of steel grades and 9 HF U 8 A. Repair any defects in the form of troughs manage curved by heating the samples to the tempering temperature and the subsequent exposure between steel plates in a hydraulic press under a load to cool the workpiece. Thus, {{as a result of the}} research found that the residual deformation-tion (trough) samples of knives from different grades (6 HV 2 S, 9 HF, U 8 A) has a different value, depending on the geometrical parameters of knives (length, thickness, width) and grades. The deflection can be easily eliminated by additional straightening. In the course of the work of steel 6 HV 2 S supplied to the Belarusian market of Russia, at the branch of JSC «Atlant» -BSZ it was manufactured a few sets of prototypes <b>chipper</b> <b>knives,</b> intended for testing in a production environment on the woodworking enterprises of the republic (of «Ivatsevichidrev», JSC «Vitebskdrev/»). Production tests of experimental knives made in accordance with the process technology-mi, developed in Barga, showed their compliance with production requirements and also require-ments of state standards, which allows recommend them for a wide introduction to woodworking factories, specializing in the production of wood chips. </p...|$|R
40|$|The wood of Crateva adansonii DC. (Dabker) as an {{important}} indigenous Sudanese hardwood species was examined to determine its suitability for pulp and papermaking. Physical and morphological studies, basic density, bark-to-wood ratio, and fiber dimensions were studied. The chemical composition of the wood was studied. Soda and soda-anthraquinone pulping as sulfur-free processes were applied. The produced pulp batches were evaluated and papermaking characteristics were tested. C. adansonii wood showed lower basic density (0. 39 g/cm 3). The average bark-to-wood ratio by mass (3. 52 %) and by volume (11. 67 %) was in the normal average for pulpwood. The fibers of C. adansonii were short. The average fiber length was 0. 660 mm with an average cell wall thickness of 0. 001 mm and lower felting ratio (24. 95). The wood showed lower ash content (0. 63 %) which may lead to less consumption of pulping chemicals and reduction of <b>chipper</b> <b>knives</b> wear in paper mills. The wood when pulped with 12 - 16 % alkali charge as Na 2 O for 120 minutes at 170 °C gave bleachable Kappa values. The addition of 0. 13 % anthraquinone (AQ) to pulping liquor reduced the active alkali consumption by 2 - 2. 3 % and increased the pulp yield...|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{how much}} wood was potentially available from short rotation hybrid poplar, {{and how much}} was actually recovered when trees were delimbed and debarked with chain flails and chipped. 31 groups of five trees each were measured and then processed. For trees larger than 50 kg total dry weight, potentially recoverable wood averaged 75 % of total weight. Over 95 % of this wood was converted into chips. Losses due to breakage by the flails, which {{show up in the}} bark dis-charge, amounted to 0. 8 dry kg per tree and were relatively independent of tree size. Chipper reject wood losses aver-aged 2. 3 dry kg per tree, but increased in almost direct proportion to tree size, from 1. 2 kg for 50 kg trees, to 3. 2 kg for 120 kg trees. For trees less than 50 kg total dry weight, potentially recoverable wood fraction was highly variable – from 50 to 75 % of total weight. Because of breakage of small stems by the flail, wood recovery was also relatively low, ranging from 40 to 95 %. Most of the wood loss for smaller trees showed up in the bark discharge rather than as chip-per rejects. For larger trees, the chipper rejects represent the big-gest opportunity for improving the recovery of wood fiber. Sharp <b>chipper</b> <b>knives</b> appear to be important for minimiz-ing losses. Beyond that, {{it is not clear whether}} wood in the chipper rejects is the result of bole damage by the flail or chipper design characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The use of high {{technology}} {{in the manufacture of}} pellets and their use in modern furnace chambers of boiler plants for remote heating and heating of family houses, are the reason why pellets as the energy source find an ever increasing application. The biggest problem and obstacle for increasing their use is the starting investment in the boiler and pellet tank, which is considerably higher than the heating oil installation. In order to obtain the best possible indicators on economic feasibility of manufacturing wood pellets, a comprehensive research has been carried out in a wood processing plant. Pellets are manufactured from beech and oak residues. Beech accounted for about 90 %. In order to get a complete picture of the consumption of electrical power per unit of manufactured pellets and of required power, the operating and idle power was measured at measurement sites during operations of individual electromotors. The measuring results were stored directly into computer and analysed later by a softwarepackage LabVIEW. The machines’ consumption of electrical power in the observed period was derived from the measuring results by numerical integration, based on which the average electrical power was then determined. Regarding the results of measuring carried out on four groups of electromotors, the highest consumption of electrical power has been measured during pressing, and then on electromotor group for the preparation of chips for pelleting. The highest consumption of electrical power has been recorded for the manufacture of one ton of pellets in pressing 138. 98 kWh/t and transport system 74. 25 kWh/t, which makes a total of 213. 23 kWh/t or almost 95 % compared to total consumption of electrical power. The measured electrical power for the manufacture of one ton of pellets in pressing hardwood residues, (in this research – beech), is by 100 % higher than the electrical power referred to in literature, which relates to softwood. Consequently, the difference should be made in each study between the consumption of electrical power in pressing softwood and hardwood. Lower consumption of electrical power has been recorded with <b>chippers</b> with sharpened <b>knives</b> amounting to 24. 3 % compared to unsharpened knives...|$|R
