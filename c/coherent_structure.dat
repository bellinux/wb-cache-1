500|$|Henry {{controlled}} more of France {{than any}} ruler since the Carolingians; these lands, combined with his possessions in England, Wales, Scotland {{and much of}} Ireland, produced a vast domain often referred to by historians as the Angevin empire. The empire lacked a <b>coherent</b> <b>structure</b> or central control; instead, it consisted of a loose, flexible network of family connections and lands. Different local customs applied within each of Henry's different territories, although common principles underpinned some of these local variations. Henry travelled constantly across the empire, producing what the historian John Jolliffe describes as a [...] "government of the roads and roadsides". His travels coincided with regional governmental reforms and other local administrative business, although messengers connected him to his possession wherever he went. In his absence the lands were ruled by seneschals and justiciars, and beneath them local officials {{in each of the}} regions carried on with the business of government. Nonetheless, many of the functions of government centred on Henry himself and he was often surrounded by petitioners requesting decisions or favours.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: GS (grid-scale) and SGS (subgrid-scale) <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> in {{homogeneous}} {{isotropic turbulence}} are identified by a priori test. GS and SGS velocity fields are obtained by filtering the DNS velocity field for Rel = 64. 9 using two classical filters for LES: Gaussian filter and sharp cutoff filter, {{and the most}} important filter width is considered as the length of Kolmogorov microscale in the DNS field with a constant multiplication. <b>Coherent</b> <b>structures</b> in the GS field, i. e., structures larger than filter width are considered as grid-scale <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> and others are subgrid-scale <b>coherent</b> <b>structures.</b> Second invariant Q of the velocity gradient tensor is used for identification of these structures in GS and SGS fields. By visualizing the contour surfaces of second invariant Q, it is shown that GS and SGS fields itself contain lots of distinct tube-like <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The characteristic of GS and SGS <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> is somewhat similar to DNS structures, which indicates that the DNS field may contain multi-scale structures in turbulent flow. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> in three-dimensional (3 D) unsteady laminar flows in a cylindrical cavity is reviewed. The discussion concentrates on two main topics: {{the role of}} symmetries and fluid inertia in the {{formation of}} <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> and the ramifications for the Lagrangian transport properties of passive tracers. We consider a number of time-periodic flows that each capture a basic dynamic state of 3 D flows: 1 D motion on closed trajectories, (quasi-) 2 D motion within (approximately) 2 D subregions of the flow domain and truly 3 D chaotic advection. It is shown that these states and their corresponding <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> are inextricably linked to symmetries (or absence thereof) in the flow. Symmetry breaking by fluid inertia and the resulting formation of intricate <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> and (local) onset of 3 D chaos is demonstrated.

40|$|Shallow flows are {{three-dimensional}} flows {{with two}} dimensions being signifcantly {{larger than the}} third dimension. <b>Coherent</b> <b>structures,</b> also called eddies, are areas in the flow, where velocity fluctuations are correlated, with a certain rotation. Although, generally, <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> {{of the order of}} the waterdepth contain most of the turbulent kinetic energy, compared to <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> of other length-scales, <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> of all length-scales have a certain amount of energy. This research was particularly focussed on the amount of energy of <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> with length-scales larger than the water-depth, the so-called supra-depth length-scales. It turned out, that these <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> are of large importance with regard to the, for quasi-two-dimensional flow characteristic, upcascading to larger length-scales, which is clearly visible by a peak-shift to the low-frequency side of the energy-density spectra. Considering that large-scale <b>coherent</b> <b>structures</b> are less dissipative compared to smaller-scale <b>coherent</b> <b>structures,</b> it can be inferred that imposing perturbations has a clear effect with respect to the conservation of turbulent kinetic energy in (by definition hypothetical) two-dimensional flows. This knowledge can be used and applied in two-dimensional depth-averaged simulations (e. g. RANS, TRANS, etc.,), where the large-scale part of general spectral distributions can be mimicked by a kinematic simulation. This thus formulated and used model (2 D-TRANS+ks) has been applied to a channel flow with a grid of obstacles at the inow boundary. Considering the quantities energy and enstrophy, and the energy-density spectra, the model performed reasonably well. Nevertheless, this model should be applied with care and a critical eye, as three-dimensional effects are difficult to represent in a two-dimensional model.

5000|$|A [...] {{turbulent}} flow is a flow regime in fluid dynamics characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity. Furthermore, a <b>coherent</b> <b>structure</b> {{is defined as}} a {{turbulent flow}} whose vorticity expression, which is usually stochastic, contains orderly components that can be described as being instantaneously coherent over the spatial extent of the flow structure. In other words, underlying the three-dimensional chaotic vorticity expressions typical of turbulent flows, there is an organized component of that vorticity which is phase-correlated over the entire space of the structure. The instantaneously space and phase correlated vorticity found within the <b>coherent</b> <b>structure</b> expressions can be defined as coherent vorticity, hence making coherent vorticity the main characteristic identifier for coherent structures. Another characteristic inherent in turbulent flows is their intermittency, but intermittency is a very poor identifier of the boundaries of a <b>coherent</b> <b>structure,</b> hence it is generally accepted {{that the best way to}} characterize the boundary of a structure is by identifying and defining the boundary of the coherent vorticity.|$|E
