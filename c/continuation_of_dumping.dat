40|$|The WTO Anti-Dumping (AD) Agreement {{requires}} that anti-dumping duties be reviewed {{at least every}} five years (Article 11. 3); pursuant to this requirement, domestic trade authorities in the US are charged {{with the task of}} making a determination as to whether, after five years, revoking the duties would be likely to lead to <b>continuation</b> or recurrence <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> (Commerce) and <b>of</b> material injury (ITC). This is called a Sunset Review; a negative determination of likelihood, either with respect to dumping or injury, will result in the duties expiring, the sun setting, as it were. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Taipower, the Taiwan Power Company, {{completed}} {{construction on}} Orchid Island's storage plant facility. The facility houses waste from Taiwan's three operating nuclear power plants. Since its construction, the storage facility has been met with opposition. Due to language barriers, the Tao {{people were not}} aware that a nuclear storage facility was being erected on their island. During its construction, workers told the islanders that they were building a food cannery that would help the local economy. In 1987, when the Tao people finally learned the danger of nuclear waste, they began a protestation battle that has lasted more than twenty years. Since its erection, 98,700 barrels of waste have been deposited on the island. In the near three decades since the storage facility was constructed, reports have indicated {{that the number of}} incidences of cancer has increased, in addition to higher rates of mutated fish due to the increased radiation levels. As a result, the Tao people are working together to protest the <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> waste <b>dumping</b> on their island as it negatively affects facets of their daily lives. Taipower has since promised to remove all nuclear waste by 2016.|$|R
40|$|Economists have {{increasingly}} {{become involved in}} trade remedy and litigation matters that call for economic interpretation or quantification. The literature {{on the use of}} econometric methods in response to legal requirements of trade policy is rather limited. This article contributes to filling this gap by demonstrating the efficacy of using a simple 2 ̆ 018 probabilistic 2 ̆ 019 model in analyzing the 2 ̆ 018 likelihood 2 ̆ 019 of injury to the local industry concerned, following a finding <b>of</b> <b>continuation</b> or recurrence <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> (or countervailable subsidies). The legal concept of 2 ̆ 018 likelihood 2 ̆ 019 is not only particularly well-suited to illustrate the systemic need for trade lawyers and economists to cooperate. It is also of imminent practical relevance with a groundswell of 2 ̆ 018 sunset 2 ̆ 019 reviews looming on the horizon. We discuss the significance of economic analysis for trade remedy investigations by reviewing the literature, the applicable WTO rules and, in particular, the pertinent case law. The potential value of probabilistic simulations for 2 ̆ 018 likelihood 2 ̆ 019 determinations is exemplified using a real-world application. Using data from past United States International Trade Commission investigations, we find that a probabilistic model that takes account of the uncertainty surrounding economic parameters reduces the risk of misjudging the effect on the domestic industry of a termination of trade remedies...|$|R
30|$|The slope {{geometry}} and the geo-mechanical strength <b>of</b> <b>dump</b> materials mostly control the stability <b>of</b> the <b>dump</b> [7, 19, 42]. Das [18] and McCurthy and David [41] asserted various factors responsible for failure <b>of</b> <b>dump</b> slopes such as geology and hydrogeology <b>of</b> the <b>dumping</b> area, gravitational force, seepage <b>of</b> water from <b>dump</b> to slope, lowering of water {{adjacent to a}} slope, changes of stress and erosion <b>of</b> <b>dump</b> (removal <b>of</b> lateral support) caused by flowing water.

40|$|This work {{contains}} two separate essays. The first essay, 2 ̆ 2 International Patent Length Setting with Shelving Behavior 2 ̆ 2 looks at government choices in patent lengths when invention of a basic technology is distinguished from invention of applications of that technology. The choice of patent length {{in each country}} is shown to depend on relative ability at 2 ̆ 2 applied 2 ̆ 2 vs. 2 ̆ 2 basic 2 ̆ 2 R 2 ̆ 6 D. A country which is relatively superior at 2 ̆ 2 applied 2 ̆ 2 R 2 ̆ 6 D will choose a shorter patent length than a country which is relatively superior at 2 ̆ 2 basic 2 ̆ 2 R 2 ̆ 6 D. If one country can impose its own choice of patent length on another country, it will choose a length that closely resembles its own. When both countries choose to have a finite length patent, but are different in their relative abilities in K 2 ̆ 6 D, a single global patent length will lie between those of the two countries. ^ The second essay, 2 ̆ 2 Equilibrium Dumping with Endogenous Anti-dumping Penalties, 2 ̆ 2 looks at anti-dumping law and its effects. In this paper, price discrimination {{is the basis for}} a margin <b>of</b> <b>dumping.</b> We use a Cournot duopoly model where profits are dependent on past and future margin <b>of</b> <b>dumping.</b> The model is used to investigate the observed phenomenon <b>of</b> a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> intercountry price differences in the face of uncertain anti-dumping penalties. A foreign firm is subject to an anti-dumping fine, where the probability of incurring the fine {{and the size of the}} fine are determined by the previous period 2 ̆ 7 s margin <b>of</b> <b>dumping.</b> In a non-cooperative infinitely repeated game the Markov Perfect Equilibrium can lead to a continuing margin <b>of</b> <b>dumping.</b> Anti-dumping laws that force price equalization, under these conditions are shown to be equivalent to an exclusion of the foreign firm from the market. ...|$|R
