5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising rebates paid to its American franchises by Coca Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these funds to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} <b>corporate</b> <b>advertising</b> costs were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008). The NFA contended that Burger King Corporation improperly redirected 40% of restaurant operating funds (ROF) paid by the two beverage suppliers to franchises since 1990 into the <b>corporate</b> <b>advertising</b> budget. These funds were often used by the franchises to pay for beverage support systems such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the funds would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012. These funds often helped the franchises' bottom lines, as they were often used to offset other costs imposed on the franchises by Burger King, such as the $1 (USD) Double Cheeseburger.|$|E
25|$|Multimedia {{advertising}} {{is the result}} of animation and graphic designs used to sell products or services. There are various forms of multimedia advertising through videos, online advertising and DVDs, CDs etc. These outlets afford companies the ability to increase their customer base through multimedia advertising. This is a necessary contribution to the marketing of the products and services. For instance, online {{advertising is}} a new wave example towards the use of multimedia in advertising that provides many benefits to the online companies and traditional corporations. New technologies today have brought on an evolution of multimedia in advertising and a shift from traditional techniques. The importance of multimedia advertising is significantly increased for companies in their effectiveness to market or sell products and services. <b>Corporate</b> <b>advertising</b> concerns itself with the idea that “Companies are likely to appeal to a broader audience and increase sales through search engine optimization, extensive keyword research, and strategic linking.” The concept behind the advertising platform can span across multiple mediums, yet, at its core, be centered around the same scheme.|$|E

He made AMC observe both the letter and spirit of AMA's resolution, and was against a renewal of the auto industry's horsepower race by offering ever more powerful engines, as well as corporate sponsorship of activities that glamorize speed and performance. AMC's market performance reached record levels in 1964, placing the Rambler brand in third-place position in the domestic sales race. At the same time AMC publicly disavowed any interest in automobile competition. <b>Corporate</b> <b>advertising</b> answered the question [...] "Why don't we enter high-performance Rambler V-8s in racing?"

A brief history of <b>corporate</b> image <b>advertising</b> is provided, and its role, as it relates to corporate identity, and reputation, is explained. Why this marketing communication technique might inspire scrutiny from stakeholder audiences, particularly consumers, is discussed, drawing on extant information-processing theories and the contextual characteristics of corporate social responsibility-based identity portrayal using advertising. Examples are provided to illustrate the discussion. A recent experimental study investigating the manipulation of message variables to inhibit the formation of consumer skepticism toward such advertising messages is described and its results reported.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a set of {{research}} propositions concerned with how the alignment between socially responsible corporate image and corporate identity might be enhanced through the reduction of scepticism by considering diagnostic dimensions of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) image advertising claim. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews <b>corporate</b> image <b>advertising,</b> the tool investigated for informing about the firm 2 ̆ 7 s CSR record, discusses the scepticism construct and theoretical explanations of why this communication approach might induce scepticism, considers extant empirical findings that lend support to these theories, and describes several elements of CSR advertising claims considered to be diagnostic and capable of inhibiting scepticism responses to CSR image advertisements among consumers. Research propositions are advanced and discussed. Findings - The paper provides conceptual insights into reducing consumer scepticism toward CSR-based corporate identity communicated via <b>corporate</b> image <b>advertising.</b> Research limitations/implications - The paper advances four research propositions, and proposes a method for testing these propositions. Practical implications - The paper acknowledges the increase in CSR-based <b>corporate</b> image <b>advertising,</b> discusses why such communication approaches may be prone to consumer scepticism, and considers message elements to inhibit this persuasion-eroding cognitive response. Originality/value - This paper suggests a study to understand how corporate identity based on CSR achievements can be more persuasively communicated via CSR-based corporate image advertisin...|$|R
