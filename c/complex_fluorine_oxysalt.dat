40|$|Polyethylene {{has been}} treated in a CF 4 plasma using two {{configurations}} for the electrodes: parallel-plate electrodes at 13. 56 MHz, and a nonsymmetrical configuration of electrodes at 70 kHz. The chemical species involved in the plasmas and the subsequent surface modifications were characterized. Comparison of the emissions in the range 200 - 450 nm was made with optical emission spectroscopy. The excited radicals' CF 2 bands and the CF+ broad continuum were detected and a comparison of their relative intensities indicated a more energetic aspect to the low-frequency discharge. This was confirmed by comparing the ratio of N 2 +/N 2 in the two cases. Analysis of the surface properties by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS), and contact angle measurements showed rapid fluorination of the surface (t = 0. 1 s) for the nonsymmetrical electrodes. Longer treatment times (up to 15 s) led to more fluorinated surfaces, thereby decreasing the wettability of the treated substrates; fluorine incorporation was, however, more significant at equivalent treatment times in the diode reactor. SSIMS analysis indicated the formation of more <b>complex</b> <b>fluorine</b> compounds {{with an increase in}} the treatment time with no notable modification other than replacement of H by F. Further increases in the treatment time for low-frequency treated samples in the nonsymmetrical configuration of electrodes caused an increase in the surface roughness, as observed by SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis. RBS (Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy) measurements showed that beyond 0. 1 s, which corresponds to the time required for rapid fluorination, fluorine diffuses through the polymeric matrix and its concentration is enhanced with increasing treatment time...|$|R

50|$|Laser {{action in}} an excimer {{molecule}} occurs {{not because it}} has a bound (associative) excited state, but a repulsive (dissociative) ground state. This is because noble gases such as xenon and krypton are highly inert and do not usually form chemical compounds.

The excited compound can give up its excess energy by undergoing spontaneous or stimulated emission, resulting in a strongly repulsive ground state molecule which very quickly (on the order of a picosecond) dissociates back into two unbound atoms.

(3, 4 -Epoxycyclohexane) methyl- 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexylcarboxylate (EPOX) and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) were used as benchmark monomers for cationic and radical photopolymerization.

Remarkably, these catalysts exhibit improved light absorption properties and are characterized by a panchromatic behavior which ensures the photosensitivity of the polymerizable films to blue, green and red lights.

30|$|While Fe-based {{materials}} offer advantages {{with respect}} to environmental and economic considerations, the major difficulty in the electrochemistry of Fe is the lower voltage obtained {{when compared to other}} transition metals such as Co or Ni. A way to overcome this issue was demonstrated in 1989 on a comparative study between the three iron analogues Fe 2 (MoO 4) 3, Fe 2 (WO 4) 3 and Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 [101]. Since all three compounds possess very similar metal–oxygen distances and formal charge, the increased redox potential with lithium from around 3.0  V for the molybdate and tungstate to 3.6  V for the sulfate, came as a surprising effect. The “inductive affect”, as it became known, was originating from the significantly larger electronegativity of the sulfate groups resulting in an increase of the ionic character of the Fe–O bonds. Thus, it is thanks to the inductive effect that sulfide-based electrode materials always display a lower potential than the corresponding oxides, as well as why the fluoride analogues show even higher potentials. In this last case in particular, manipulations axed on the increase of Fe–F bond ionic character by replacement of the anion would be <b>complex</b> since <b>fluorine</b> is already the most electronegative element. Instead, one way to act on the iron-fluorine bond could be the application of chemical pressure [102]. When smaller cations are replaced by larger ones in a close-packed structure, the result {{from the point of view}} of the smaller ion is comparable to an elongation of the bond thereby increasing its ionic nature. This is why accurate doping with Co, Ni or Cu would probably give some result in this direction.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} based on the {{chemical}} synthesis of fluorosaccharide end-products, which could be used potentially as substrates for the combinatorial biosynthesis of novel complex structures like antibiotics. Although fluorine is the most abundant halogen in the earth's crust, the incidence of fluorinated natural products is extremely low. There are no examples of fluorosaccharide end-product molecules in nature, so novel architecture will result from their incorporation within oligosaccharides or <b>complex</b> antibiotics. Introducing <b>fluorine</b> into pharmaceutical compounds can increase the biological activity and stability to metabolism. Enantiomerically enriched and racemic 6 -fluoro and racemic 6, 6 -difluoro analogues of amicetose and rhodinose have been synthesized successfully using different and scaleable strategies from commercially available starting materials. The equilibria between furanoses and pyranoses favoures the smaller rings, due to the inductive electron withdrawing effects of fluorine, so it was necessary to use protection to deliver pyranoses exclusively. Two very efficient new fluorinating methods have been developed, one with in situ cis/trans-isomerisation of a double bond with a mixture of TBAI and TBAF, and another one with high regioselective epoxides ring-opening with a mixture of KHF 2 and TBAF.

Fluorine NMR {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful tool for}} studying biomolecular structure, dynamics, and ligand binding, yet the origins of F- 19 chemical shifts are not well understood. Herein, we use electronic structure calculations to describe the changes in 19 F chemical shifts of 2 F- and 4 F-histidine/(5 -methyl) -imidazole upon acid titration. While the protonation of the 2 F species results in a deshielded chemical shift, protonation of the 4 F isomer results in an opposite, shielded chemical shift. The deshielding of 2 F-histidine/(5 -methyl) -imidazole upon protonation can be rationalized by concomitant decreases in charge density on fluorine and a reduced dipole moment. These correlations do not hold for 4 F-histidine/(5 -methyl) -imidazole, however. Molecular orbital calculations reveal that for the 4 F species, there are no lone pair electrons on the fluorine until protonation. Analysis of a series of 4 F-imidazole analogues, all with delocalized fluorine electron density, indicates that the deshielding of 19 F chemical shifts through substituent effects correlates with increased C-F bond polarity. In summary, the delocalization of fluorine electrons in the neutral 4 F species, with gain of a lone pair upon protonation may help explain the difficulty in developing a predictive framework for fluorine chemical shifts. Ideas debated by chemists over 40 years ago, regarding <b>fluorine's</b> <b>complex</b> electronic effects, are shown to have relevance for understanding and predicting fluorine NMR spectra.

Below 300 ~ the deposits are quite stable, but on annealing at higher temperatures recrystallization takes {{place and a}} duplex structure of Ni 3 Sn~ and Ni~Sn 4 results. In the absence of fluorides, satisfactory alloy deposition is not possible from chloride solutions. Evidence is adduced that the <b>fluorine</b> <b>complexes</b> both the tin ions and the nickel ions. The constancy of composition of the cathode deposit that is {{a feature of the}} recommended electrolyte suggests that deposition is associated with the presence in the electrolyte of a tin-nickel-fluorine complex. Complex ion formation is followed through the medium of cathode potential-current density curves. The effect of the variables of the process on deposit composition is discussed. The conductivity and throwing power of the electrolyte have been determined. The x-ray structure of tin-nickel alloy deposits covering a range of composition has been examined, and it is shown that bright deposits are characterized by a preferred orien-tation of the crystallites. From solutions of this type, tin-nickel alloys can only be obtained by operating at a temperature above 45 ~ the optimum temperature being 65 ~ The metastable struc-ture of these deposits is thought to be explained by the high activation energy of the discharging cations resulting from the high temperature of operation. Tin-nickel alloy deposits as normally obtained contain approximately 65 per cent of tin and 35 per cent of nickel. Such deposits have a pleasing color, showing evidence of a faint rose-pink tint, and are equally as resistant, or even more resistant, than elec-trodeposited chromium to atmospheric tarnishing.

30|$|Fluoride is an {{essential}} element for both humans and animals, and its behavior in drinking water is vital. Optimum content (1.5  mg/L) of F in water is essential for growth of bones and formation of dental enamels. Higher contents (> 1.5  mg/L) {{pose a threat to}} human health, and can cause severe health problems such as dental and skeletal fluorosis, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. For example, F problems occur in some regions of India, China, the Korean Peninsula, East and North Africa, the United Kingdom, and the Western United States (Ayoob and Gupta 2006; Chae et al. 2007; Harrison 2005; Jacks et al. 2005; Kim and Jeong 2005; Reddy et al. 2010; Xiong et al. 2007; Zhu et al. 2007). Conversely, water fluoridation is necessary in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and most South American countries, due to lack of natural fluoride. However, Scandinavian countries where dental awareness is very high, use alternative sources, such as fluoride-rich toothpaste (Lennon et al. 2004). Fluorine is available in soils and waters due to the weathering of fluoride-bearing minerals predominantly of igneous origin (Breiter and Kronz 2004; Breiter et al. 2006; Lukkari and Holtz 2007; Reddy et al. 2010; Totsche et al. 2000; Zhu et al. 2007). Apatite [Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F] and fluorite [CaF 2] are the most common fluoride-bearing minerals. However, zircon [ZrSiO 4] is also a possible source for fluoride in water or soil, as igneous zircons contain <b>fluorine</b> <b>complexes</b> (Farges 1996; Keppler 1993). Biotite [K(Mg,Fe) 3 AlSi 3 O 10 (F,OH) 2], hornblende [(Ca,Na) 2 – 3 (Mg,Fe,Al) 5 (Al,Si) 8 O 22 (OH,F) 2] and soils that consist mainly of clay minerals such as vermiculite [(MgFe,Al) 3 (Al,Si) 4 O 10 (OH)], kaolinite [Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4] and montmorillonite [(Na,Ca) 0.33 (Al,Mg) 2 (Si 4 O 10)(OH) 2 ·nH 2 O] are also major sources of fluoride (Wodeyar and Sreenivasan 1996; Zhu et al. 2007). The problems associated with high fluoride content in groundwater in the dry zone of Sri Lanka are well known (Lennon et al. 2004). It has been found that both shallow and deep groundwater exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended levels in drinking water (> 1.5  mg/L). Agrawal (1997) reports that in Sri Lanka, fluoride has a strong geographical control linked to climatic conditions, with high fluoride waters being restricted to the dry zone on {{the eastern side of the}} island. In some parts, wells have fluoride content > 10  mg/L.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{environmental}} pollution by industrial waste products {{has become a}} significant environmental factor that essentially limits the vital functions of plants and reduces their species diversity. The antioxidant system is of special importance for tolerance reactions of plants to stressful environmental conditions, in particular, contamination by industrial pollutants. One of the constituents of this system is oxidoreductase, including catalase. Consequently, we have conducted experiments {{to determine how the}} nature of the <b>complex</b> compounds of <b>fluorine,</b> nitrogen and sulfur influences catalase activity in leaves of selected species of trees and shrubs. The investigation was made according to the complete factorial experiment that allowed us to study the effect of these pollutants both individually and in combination. We used the iodometric method to determine the level of catalase activity. Statistical analysis of the obtained results was performed by means of dispersion analysis with the comparison according to the Duncan method. The results of the research showed the possible impact of pollutants on the activity of catalase, which depends on the resilience of the plants, structure and duration of potency of the pollutants. With less resilient plant species (Sorbus aucuparia L., Fraxinus lanceolata Borkh.) air pollution with a combination of fluorine, sulfur and nitrogen in most cases caused a reduction of catalase activity. Thus, in S. aucuparia a 5 -hour exposure to low concentrations of pollutants (HF – 0. 2 ml/m 3, NH 3 – 1. 2 ml/m 3, SO 2 and H 2 SO 4 – 0. 9 – 1. 0 ml/m 3) caused an inhibition of catalase activity by 40. 5 %, and a ten-hour exposure caused a 61. 4 % inhibition compared with the control plants. With increased concentrations of pollutants  catalase function was inhibited by 35. 8 – 73. 6 %, depending on the duration of their fumigation. For F. lanceolata, the pollutants’ effect on catalase activity caused a decrease in function of this enzyme by 20 – 77 % compared with non-fumigated plants. In contrast to the less resilient plants, the species resilient against pollution (Ligustrum vulgare L., Quercus robur Sol., Lonicera tatarica L., Eleagnus angustifolia L., Philadelphus coronaria L.) were characterized by absence of possible changes in catalase activity caused by fumigation or by increase in catalase by 11 – 118 %. A significant increase of catalase functions in these species mostly occurs because of the short-term effect (5 hours) of pollutants. In the absence of damage, the enzyme activity of species of variable resilience (Aesculus hippocastanum L., Acer negundo L., Populus simonii Carriere) remained {{at the level of the}} control plants. The gas mixture that damages leaves (necrosis) caused catalase functions to decrease by 11 – 80 % compared with the control plants. Therefore, we can state that in the absence of visible damage to plants' enzyme activity either remained unchanged or increased compared with the control plants. Formation of necrosis caused a decrease in catalase functions. The patterns of changes in catalase activity we have identified allow us to conclude that this enzyme plays a significant role in liquidation of damage caused by air pollutants...|$|R
