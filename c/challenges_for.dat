40|$|It is {{commonly}} suggested that evolutionary considerations generate an epistemological <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> moral realism. At first approximation, the <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> the moral realist is to explain our having many true moral beliefs, given that those beliefs are {{the products of}} evolutionary forces that would be indifferent to the moral truth. An important question surrounding this challenge {{is the extent to}} which it generalizes. In particular, it is of interest whether the Evolutionary <b>Challenge</b> <b>for</b> moral realism is equally a <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> mathematical realism. It is widely thought not to be. In this paper, I argue that the Evolutionary <b>Challenge</b> <b>for</b> moral realism is equally a <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> mathematical realism. Along the way, I substantially clarify the Evolutionary Challenge, discuss its relation to more familiar epistemological challenges, and broach a number of foundational issues in metaphysics. The paper should be of interest to ethicists because it places pressure on anyone who rejects moral realism on the basis of the Evolutionary Challenge to reject mathematical realism as well. And the paper should be of interest to philosophers of mathematics because it presents a new epistemological <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> mathematical realism that bears, I argue, no simple relation to Paul Benacerraf's familiar challenge...|$|R
5|$|Functional {{genomics}} using RNAi is {{a particularly}} attractive technique for genomic mapping and annotation in plants because many plants are polyploid, which presents substantial <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> more traditional genetic engineering methods. For example, RNAi has been successfully used for functional genomics studies in bread wheat (which is hexaploid) {{as well as more}} common plant model systems Arabidopsis and maize.|$|E

5|$|After {{his injury}} healed, Orton joined the Evolution stable, which {{consisted}} of Ric Flair, Triple H, and relative newcomer, Batista. The group was pushed on Raw from 2003 to 2004, with the height of their dominance occurring after Armageddon in 2003 {{when all of the}} men's titles on Raw were held by the members of Evolution. In 2003, Orton spent much of his time helping Triple H overcome <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> the World Heavyweight Championship. Orton joined Triple H in a six-man Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, involved primarily to secure Triple H's title defense, and was eliminated by Goldberg, but the stable managed to fulfill its purpose and Triple H went on to eliminate Goldberg and thus retain his title.|$|E
5|$|Crytek {{contracted}} Ruffian Games {{to develop}} a competitive multiplayer mode for Ryse, but the feature was later cut from the final game. Despite that, a co-operative multiplayer mode was introduced, and tasked players to fight against waves of increasingly difficult human enemies. The team originally hoped to add sea battles and animals to the game, but after internal testing, these features were removed. A Xbox SmartGlass feature called the Challenge Editor was set to be introduced to the game after its launch. It allowed players to create custom <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> the game's co-operative multiplayer. However, Crytek announced {{that the development of}} this feature had been ceased in February 2014.|$|E
50|$|España's next {{fight was}} another <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> the WBA {{lightweight}} title, {{but this time}} Ray Mancini knocked him out in six rounds in July 1982. España never <b>challenged</b> <b>for</b> a world title again and retired in 1988.|$|R

5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> the developers. LucasArts {{requested the}} game to be produced for both DOS and Macintosh with the same system requirements, specifically the random-access memory (RAM). The Mac OS runs a graphical user interface which uses up RAM while DOS does not, meaning the Macintosh version has less RAM available for Dark Forces to use. Aaron Giles, who was the Macintosh programmer for Dark Forces, explained that to resolve this problem the memory had to be managed more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, when Edward I died in 1307 {{he left a}} {{range of}} <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> his son to resolve. One of the most {{critical}} was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. Edward's control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings should give homage to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved. Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.|$|E
5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, the NFB {{launched}} Filmmaker-in-Residence a cross-media project {{based on}} the <b>Challenge</b> <b>for</b> Change model, with frontline health care workers, in partnership with St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto. <b>Challenge</b> <b>for</b> Change was also cited as an inspiration for the NFB's 2011 web documentary, One Millionth Tower.|$|R
5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines. For these reasons, , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Flytoget {{announced}} that they had ordered a fourth car {{for each of the}} units. This increased the capacity of each unit by 40% to 244 seats, and allows the company to manage the annual 10% growth in passengers. The delivery of the fourth cars started in 2008 and were built by Bombardier Transportation, who has bought ADtranz, with the rebuilding scheduled to be completed during 2009. The rebuilding created several <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> Bombardier, since most of the components used in the class were no longer available. Significant components such as the car body and rectifiers had to be built by Bombardier based on abandoned production lines, and many of the original manufacturers for the interior have become defunct.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, 2006, a {{settlement}} was reached {{in which the}} trophy could be awarded to non-NHL teams should the league not operate for a season. The dispute lasted so long that, {{by the time it}} was settled, the NHL had resumed operating for the 2005–06 season, and the Stanley Cup went unclaimed for the 2004–05 season. Furthermore, when another NHL lockout commenced in 2012 the Trustees stated that the 2006 agreement did not oblige them to award the Cup in the event of a lost season, and that they were likely to reject any non-NHL <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> the Cup in the event the 2012–13 season were cancelled, which it was not.|$|E

5|$|The data {{generated}} by metagenomics experiments are both enormous and inherently noisy, containing fragmented data representing {{as many as}} 10,000 species. The sequencing of the cow rumen metagenome generated 279 gigabases, or 279 billion base pairs of nucleotide sequence data, while the human gut microbiome gene catalog identified 3.3 million genes assembled from 567.7 gigabases of sequence data. Collecting, curating, and extracting useful biological information from datasets of this size represent significant computational <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> researchers.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> the Memorial in {{the post-war}} years were {{integrating}} the World War II collections {{with those from}} World War I and securing funding to expand its building. Treloar did not seek to increase the Memorial's holdings of World War II artefacts beyond supporting the completion of works commissioned from the official war artists. As a result, the Memorial's collection of World War II memorabilia was inferior to that assembled during and after World War I, {{and many of its}} best-known items such as the bomber G for George were acquired as donations from the Government rather than through Treloar's efforts. It was not until October 1948 that the Government agreed to fund an expansion of the AWM after lobbying by Treloar and the Memorial's board.|$|E
5|$|The {{proximity}} of the Peak to major conurbations and urban areas (an estimated 20 million people live within an hour's drive) poses unique <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> managing the area. The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust, with other landowners, attempt to balance keeping the upland landscape accessible to visitors for recreation, whilst protecting it from intensive farming, erosion and pressure from visitors themselves. An inevitable tension exists between {{the needs of the}} 38,000 residents of the Peak District National Park, the needs of the many millions of people who visit it annually, and the conservation requirements of the area.|$|E
