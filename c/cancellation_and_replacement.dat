40|$|Two {{decades after}} the advent of {{electronic}} journals and databases, librarians are still grappling with ways to best manage these resources in conjunction with their print resources. In addition, economic pressures at many institutions of Higher Education are resulting in librarians having to justify their spending on collections and resource management. Furthermore, ebooks are becoming yet another stream of purchasing and management with the added complexity of patron driven acquisitions. All of these issues result in the need to codify the management of electronic resource management more than ever. Techniques in Electronic Resource Management (TERMS) is a project to encourage open peer commentary and crowd sourcing of areas of best practice {{for each of the}} stages of the E-resources lifecycle. This poster will describe the 6 stages that have been posted on the TERMS blog ([URL] 1. Investigating New Content for purchase/addition 2. Acquire New Content 3. Implement 4. Evaluation and Ongoing Access 5. Annual Review 6. <b>Cancellation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Replacement</b> Review The project aims to become a reference point for those who are new to e-resource management and for those who may want to implement its recommendations of best practice. Since the launch of TERMS in mid September 2011 we have had some excellent feedback with over 100 followers on Twitter ([URL] over 140 members in our FaceBook group (Group: TERMS) members and 11 direct followers of the blog. This poster aims to encourage further review and comment. Do LIBER delegates agree with what we have found? Does what we have said relate to e-books? Would you be willing to share your local workflows on E-resources management? What are your experiences? Tell us about your areas of best practice and help us refine TERMS for others to use...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{dealing with}} complex {{business}} processes (e. g., {{in the context}} of a workflow implementation or the configuration of some process-aware information system), it is important but sometimes difficult to determine whether a process contains any errors. <b>Cancellation</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins are important features that are common in many business processes. The presence of <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins makes it difficult to perform verification. Therefore, existing approaches and tools are typically restricted to process models without such features. In this paper, we explore verification techniques for processes with <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins. We present these techniques {{in the context of}} workflow language YAWL that provides direct support for these features. We have extended the graphical editor of YAWL with diagnostic features based in the results presented in this paper. The approach relies on reset nets and can easily be adapted to support other languages allowing for <b>cancellations</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to acoustic echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> doubletalk detection for a teleconferencing system including a loudspeaker for which an estimate of the loud-speaker impulse response is available. The approach is general {{in the sense that it}} may be applied to most existing acoustic echo can-cellation and doubletalk detection algorithms. We show that the new approach reduces the computational complexity for both the echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> the doubletalk detection algorithms. Fur-thermore, the numerical examples show that the new approach also may increase the echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> doubletalk detection per-formances.
