25|$|The basic {{utilitarian}} rationalization {{for research}} on human beings is the ends justify the means. This means that any sort of research on a human being is justified {{by the possibility of}} successfully saving others. For example, all cancer research would be justified by the possibility of finding a <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancer,</b> which would inevitably save the life of many others. The utilitarian argument focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number of people or the greater good. Under the utilitarian justification it is a person's duty to sacrifice himself or herself if it would save others as long as the individual person's societal worth is less than the combined societal worth of the others. Therefore, if either a doctor or a homeless person must die to save the lives of many others, the homeless person must sacrifice himself since he is worth less to society than the doctor.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{a genetically}} {{re-engineered}} measles virus, originally {{created as a}} <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancer,</b> turns into a lethal strain which kills 94% of those it infects, mutates 5% into predatory, nocturnal and vampiric mutants called [...] "Darkseekers" [...] who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight and other sources of UV, with only the remaining 1% immune. Three years after the outbreak, US Army virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville (Will Smith) lives an isolated life in the deserted ruins of New York City, unsure if any other uninfected humans are left in the world.|$|E
500|$|Fox made no {{promises}} that his efforts {{would lead to}} a <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancer,</b> but he closed his letter with the statement: [...] "We need your help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to." [...] The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy– an enlarged heart– a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.|$|E

50|$|Ernst Theodore Krebs, Jr. (May 17, 1911 - September 8, 1996) was an American {{biochemist}} who promoted various substances as alternative <b>cures</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancer,</b> including pangamic {{acid and}} amygdalin. He also co-patented the semi-synthetic chemical compound {{closely related to}} amygdalin named laetrile, which was also promoted as a cancer preventative and cure. His medical claims about these compounds are not supported by scientific evidence and are widely considered quackery.|$|R
500|$|Seacology {{was founded}} in 1991 by {{ethnobotanist}} Paul Alan Cox in Hawaii using prize money and consulting fees resulting from his efforts to preserve [...] of rainforest outside the village of Falealupo {{on the island of}} Savai'i in Samoa. [...] He later recorded these events in his book, Nafanua: Saving the Samoan Rain Forest. [...] Cox began his work in Samoa in 1973 during his first Mormon missionary service, at which time he learned from local people about the medicinal properties of the native plants. [...] After working with local communities in other rainforests, Cox returned to Samoa in 1984 with his family. His aim was to find a <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancer,</b> which had claimed the life of his mother earlier that year. [...] In return for the help of the local healers (called fofo), Cox offered to share the revenue generated by his research with the local villages. [...] Over time, his research identified five new drugs, including the therapeutic agent prostratin, a potential treatment for HIV. [...] Prostratin was isolated in a concoction made from the bark of the local mamala tree (Homalanthus nutans) and shared with him by a healer named Epenesa Mauigoa, who used it to treat hepatitis. [...] Cox set up royalty agreements to ensure that the Samoans will share in the revenue.|$|E
500|$|The Lone Gunmen come to Mulder's {{apartment}} in disguise {{and tell him}} that they cannot find Scully. They reveal that they have found e-mails between Scully and a man called Cobra, who is apparently working on a shadow project at the Department of Defense. [...] Meanwhile, Scully wakes up in a cabin in Pennsylvania in pajamas instead of her clothes, and accuses The Smoking Man of drugging her. He claims she was merely exhausted and he was trying to make her comfortable. [...] She attempts to leave but decides to continue when The Smoking Man tells her she's free to go and that the choice of whether to accept his help or not is hers. Mulder and The Lone Gunmen go to Skinner to figure out why Scully was communicating with Cobra. They find that an anonymous person has hacked into Scully's computer and has been sending Cobra messages calling for a meeting. The group believe that it is the work of The Smoking Man, but Skinner still does not know how {{to get a hold of}} him. At dinner, The Smoking Man tells Scully that the cure he possesses is not just the <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancer,</b> but for all human disease, and that it is extraterrestrial. The Smoking Man goes outside and tells the man who has been following them that Cobra has not shown. Scully finds a note under her dessert plate saying to meet at Calico Cove at dawn. She goes alone and is stopped by Cobra, who gives her a disc before being shot and killed by a sniper. The sniper also attempts to kill Scully, but is killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E

2500|$|Hoxsey Therapy, {{a mixture}} of herbs, was first marketed as a purported <b>cure</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancer</b> in the 1920s by Harry Hoxsey, a former coal miner and {{insurance}} salesman, and Norman Baker, a radio personality. Hoxsey himself traced the treatment to his great-grandfather, who observed a horse with a tumor on its leg cure itself by grazing upon wild plants growing in the meadow. John Hoxsey gathered these herbs and mixed them with old home remedies used for cancer. Among the claims made in his book, he purports his therapy aims to restore [...] "physiological normalcy" [...] to a disturbed metabolism throughout the body, with emphasis on purgation, to help carry away wastes from the tumors he believed his herbal mixtures caused to necrotize.|$|E

In a geographic switch, Keaton shifted the story's setting from the New York of Lidz's book to the Southern California of her own childhood. And the four mad uncles were reduced to a whimsical odd couple. In an essay for The New York Times, Lidz said that the cinematic Selma had died not of cancer, but of 'Old Movie Disease'.
