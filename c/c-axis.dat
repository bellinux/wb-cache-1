The unusually short distances (0.4733 and 0.4788nm) between the neighboring icosahedra in this direction result in the relatively small <b>c-axis</b> lattice constant of 0.95110(7) nm in this compound – other borides with a similar icosahedral chain have this value larger than 1.0nm.

25|$|There {{are seven}} {{structurally}} independent icosahedra I1–I7 which are formed by B1–B8, B9–B12, B13–B20, B/C21–B24, B/C25–B29, B30–B37 and B/C38–B42 sites, respectively; B43–B46 sites form the B9 polyhedron and B47–B53 sites construct the B10 polyhedron. B54–B59 sites form the irregularly shaped B16 polyhedron {{in which only}} 10.7 boron atoms are available because most of sites are too {{close to each other}} to be occupied simultaneously. Ten bridging sites C60–B69 interconnect polyhedron units or other bridging sites to form a 3D boron framework structure. One description of the crystal structure uses three pillar-like units that extend along the <b>c-axis</b> that however results in undesired overlaps between those three pillar-like units. An alternative is to define two pillar-like　structure units. Figure 29 shows the boron framework structure of　Sc3.67–xB41.4–y–zC0.67+zSi0.33–w viewed along the <b>c-axis,</b> where the pillar-like units P1 and P2 are colored in dark green and light green respectively and are bridged by yellow icosahedra I4 and I7.|$|E
25|$|Rare-earth borides REB15.5CN, REB22C2N and REB28.5C4 are homologous, i.e. have {{a similar}} crystal {{structure}}, to B4C. The latter has a structure typical of icosahedron-based borides, {{as shown in figure}} 11a. There, B12 icosahedra form a rhombohedral lattice unit (space group: Rm (No. 166), lattice constants: a = 0.56nm and c = 1.212nm) surrounding a C-B-C chain that resides {{at the center of the}} lattice unit, and both C atoms bridge the neighboring three icosahedra. This structure is layered: as shown in figure 11b, B12 icosahedra and bridging carbons form a network plane that spreads parallel to the c-plane and stacks along the <b>c-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Figure 19a {{shows the}} network of boron icosahedra in the boron {{framework}} of ScB19+xSiy. In this network, 4 icosahedra form a supertetrahedron (figure 18b); its one edge {{is parallel to the}} a-axis, and the icosahedra on this edge make up a chain along the a-axis. The opposite edge of the supertetrahedron is parallel to the b-axis and the icosahedra on this edge form a chain along the b-axis. As shown in figure 19, there are wide tunnels surrounded by the icosahedron arrangement along the a- and b-axes. The tunnels are filled by the B22 units which strongly bond to the surrounding icosahedra; the connection of the B22 units is helical and it runs along the <b>c-axis</b> as shown in figure 19b. Scandium atoms occupy the voids in the boron network as shown in figure 19c, and the Si atoms bridge the B22 units.|$|E
2500|$|There are two inequivalent B12 icosahedra, I1 and I2, {{which are}} {{constructed}} by the B1–B5 and B8–B12 sites, respectively. A [...] "tube" [...] is another characteristic structure unit of ScB17C0.25. It extends along the <b>c-axis</b> and consists of B13, B14, B17 and B18 sites where B13 and B14 form 6-membered rings. B17 and B18 sites also form 6-membered rings; however, their mutual distances (0.985 Å for B17 and 0.955 Å for B18) are too short for a simultaneous occupation of the neighboring sites. Therefore, boron atoms occupy 2nd neighbor site forming a triangle. The occupancies of B17 and B18 sites should be 50%, but the structure analysis suggests larger values. The crystal structure viewed along the a-axis {{is shown in figure}} 20, which suggests that the ScB17C0.25 is a layered material. Two layers, respectively {{constructed by the}} icosahedra I1 and I2, alternatively stack along the <b>c-axis.</b> However, the ScB17C0.25 crystal is not layered. For example, during arc-melting, ScB17C0.25 needle crystals violently grow along the <b>c-axis</b> – this never happens in layered compounds. The crystal structure viewed along the <b>c-axis</b> is shown in figure 21a. The icosahedra I1 and I2 form a ring centered by the [...] "tube" [...] shown in figure 21b, which probably governs the properties of the ScB17C0.25 crystal. B/C15 and B/C16 mixed-occupancy sites interconnect the rings. A structural similarity can be seen between ScB17C0.25 and BeB3.|$|E
2500|$|The {{unit cell}} of {{titanium}} disulfide is 3.407 by 5.695 angstroms. The {{size of the}} unit cell decreased at 17.8 GPa. The decrease in unit cell size was greater than was observed for [...] MoS2 and WS2, indicating that titanium disulfide is softer and more compressible. The compression behavior of titanium disulfide is anisotropic. The axis parallel to S-Ti-S layers (<b>c-axis)</b> is more compressible than the axis perpendicular to S-Ti-S layers (a-axis) because of weak van der waals forces keeping S and Ti atoms together. At 17.8 GPa, the <b>c-axis</b> is compressed by 9.5% and the a-axis is compressed by 4%. [...] The longitudinal sound velocity is 5284m/s in the plane parallel to S-Ti-S layers.

Because of this symmetry {{and the fact that it}} has a dipole moment, the rotational selection rules are ΔJ=±1 and ΔK=0.
