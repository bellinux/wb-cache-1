5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E

Nocturnal moths {{on the other}} hand are usually plain brown, grey, white or black and often with obscuring patterns of zigzags or swirls which help camouflage them from predators as they rest during the day. However, many day-flying moths are brightly coloured, particularly if they are toxic. These diurnal species evolved to locate their mates visually and not primarily by pheromone as their drab nocturnal cousins. A few butterflies are also plain-coloured, like the <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> or the baron butterfly.|$|E

40|$|Plants employ various defences {{killing the}} insect {{attacker}} {{in an early}} stage. Oviposition by <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterflies</b> (Pieris spp.) on brassicaceous plants, including Brassica nigra, induces a hypersensitive response (HR) - like leaf necrosis promoting desiccation of eggs. To gain a deeper insight into the arms race between butterflies and plants, we conducted field and greenhouse experiments using different B. nigra genotypes. We investigated variation in HR and consequent survival of P. brassicae egg clusters. Impact of egg density, distribution type and humidity on HR formation and egg survival was tested. HR differed among plant genotypes as well as plant individuals. Egg density per plant did not affect HR formation. Remarkably, egg survival did {{not depend on the}} formation of HR, unless butterflies were forced to lay single eggs. Larval hatching success from single eggs was lower on plants expressing HR. This may be due to increased vulnerability of single eggs to low humidity conditions at necrotic leaf sites. We conclude that effectiveness of HR-like necrosis in B. nigra varies with plant genotype, plant individual and the type of egg laying behaviour (singly or clustered). By clustering eggs, <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterflies</b> can escape the egg-killing, direct plant defence trait...|$|R

50|$|Ultraviolet {{light is}} not only an {{activator}} of male sexual behavior: Its absence may also stop an approaching male and his attempt to copulate. Female <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies</b> are not always receptive to male <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies</b> and to communicate this message, they assume the mate refusal posture. This behavior consists of opening the wings and straightening the abdomen. Opening of the wings in this manner exposes the dorsal side of the female wings which are known to be unable to reflect ultraviolet light. In effect, females are removing the ultraviolet signal that initiates male sexual behavior, resulting in the abrupt halt of male sexual behavior. Female <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies</b> take advantage of the personal butterfly ultraviolet communication system to also reject males by removing an ultraviolet reflectance signal.|$|R
40|$|Males of {{a variety}} of insects {{transfer}} an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone to females during mating that renders them less attractive to conspecific males.

Mealybugs have white hairs covered with a mealy coating. They are up to 8 mm across and suck sap from many plants, especially indoor plants. The pear slug or cherry slug is a sawfly larva.

50|$|Red admirals are {{relatively}} common throughout New Zealand where their food plants occur. Anecdotal evidence suggest their {{numbers have been}} declining since the early 1900s, and the species has reportedly disappeared from Auckland. This is linked to spraying {{and the decline of}} native nettle plants, although nettle numbers are also affected by drought; nettle species are now being cultivated by NZ Forest & Bird and some councils as a butterfly food. Another factor in red admiral decline has been exotic parasitic wasps. The Australian white-spotted ichneumon wasp Echthromorpha intricatoria is self introduced, and the pteromalid wasp Pteromalus puparum was introduced by government entomologists in 1932-33 to control the adventive <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieris rapae), a serious agricultural pest in New Zealand.

40|$|Phoretic insects utilize {{other animals}} to {{disperse}} to new environments. We recently discovered how egg parasitoids use an exciting phoretic strategy to reach egg-laying sites of their butterfly hosts. In the laboratory, female Trichogramma wasps detect and mount mated female <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterflies</b> that emit an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone. Hardly any information exists about the natural occurrence of phoresy in wasps of this genus. Therefore, we monitored {{the presence of}} phoretic Trichogramma wasps on lepidopteran hosts in the field. Only female wasps were found at low prevalence on six lepidopteran species. Wasps were mostly found on female hosts and mainly on abundant solitary host species. This is the first report of phoretic Trichogramma wasps on butterflies in nature.

5000|$|Most B. vulgaris genotypes are {{naturally}} resistant to some insect {{species that are}} otherwise specialized on the crucifer family. In the case of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the flea beetle Phyllotreta nemorum, the resistance is caused by saponins. Glucosinolates such as glucobarbarin and glucobrassicin are used as a cue for egg-laying by female <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterflies</b> such as Pieris rapae. Indeed, the larvae of this butterfly thrive well on this plant.

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies,</b> Pieris rapae crucivora, {{use their}} private {{ultraviolet}} communication system to initiate mating behavior. In this species, ultraviolet reflection is sexually dimorphic with females exhibiting {{the ability to}} reflect ultraviolet light of 380 nm to 400 nm and males being less able to reflect UV. Males who perceive an ultraviolet reflection from a female initiate a courtship behavior that involves approaching the female and attempting to copulate. Females communicate their receptivity to males using their ultraviolet communication system. The ultraviolet reflection {{is thought to be}} concentrated to the ventral side of a female’s hind wing. Yoshiaki Obara determined this experimentally by comparing the number of approaches to different parts of butterfly wings. The results showed that the female’s ventral hind wing was the greatest releaser of male sexual behavior. Although ultraviolet reflectance releases the sexual behavior, the strongest reflection of UV light is not the strongest releaser for the behavior. As a result, male <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> <b>butterflies</b> must have a preference for a certain level of UV reflectance from females. Using a private ultraviolet communication system, female <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Butterflies</b> signal their receptivity and initiate male mating behavior.|$|R
40|$|Parasitic wasps {{employ a}} wide range of {{chemical}} cues to find their hosts. Very recently, we discovered how 2 closely related egg parasitoids, Trichogramma brassicae and Trichogramma evanescens, exploit the anti-aphrodisiac pheromone benzyl cyanide of one of their hosts, the gregarious large <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> Pieris brassicae that deposits a clutch of more than 20 eggs per oviposition bout. The pheromone is transferred by male butterflies to females during mating to enforce female monogamy. On detecting the anti-aphrodisiac, the tiny parasitic wasps ride on a mated female butterfly to a host plant and then parasitize her freshly laid eggs. The present study demonstrates that both wasp species similarly exploit the anti-aphrodisiac mixture of methyl salicylate and indole of another host, the more common solitary small <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> Pieris rapae that deposits only one egg at a time. Interestingly, this behavior is innate in T. brassicae, whereas T. evanescens learns it after one successful ride on a mated female butterfly. Moreover, we show that the wasps only respond to the anti-aphrodisiacs of the 2 cabbage white butterflies when the ubiquitous compounds are part of a complete mated female odor blend. Obviously, parasitic wasps use the sophisticated espionage-and-ride strategy to find eggs of different gregarious and solitary host species. From the wasps' perspective {{there seems to be a}} trade-off between the abundance and egg-laying behavior of the butterflies. Our findings suggest that Pieris butterflies are under strong selective pressure to minimize the use of an anti-aphrodisiac. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{communities}} typically vary {{in composition}} and structure over space and time. Little {{is known about}} the inherent characteristics of communities that govern various drivers of these changes, such as random variation, changes in response to perturbation, or susceptibility to invasion. In this study, we use 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequences to describe variation among bacterial communities in the midguts of <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieris rapae) larvae and examine the influence of community structure on susceptibility to invasion. We compared communities in larvae experiencing the same conditions at different times (temporal variation) or fed different diets (perturbation). The most highly represented phylum was Proteobacteria, which was present in all midgut communities. The observed species richness ranged from six to 15, and the most abundant members affiliated with the genera Methylobacteria, Asaia, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Pantoea. Individual larvae subjected to the same conditions at the same time harbored communities that were highly similar in structure and membership, whereas the communities observed within larval populations changed with diet and over time. In addition, structural changes due to perturbation coincided with enhanced susceptibility to invasion by Enterobacter sp. NAB 3 R and Pantoea stewartii CWB 600, suggesting that resistance to invasion is in part governed by community structure. These findings along with the observed conservation of membership at the phylum level, variation in structure and membership at lower taxonomic levels, and its relative simplicity make the <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> larval community an attractive model for studying community dynamics and robustness...|$|E
40|$|Germ line {{transformation}} {{is a powerful}} research tool to probe and manipulate gene function but currently the number of insect species transformed is small and biased towards Diptera.

Germ line transformation of pierids is useful because butterfly wing patterns have become model systems in evolutionary developmental biology, and the previously transformed butterflies {{are members of a}} different family, the nymphalids. We used a piggyBac[3 xP 3 -EGFP] construct as a marker for germ line transformation and obtained a single transformed adult that did not reproduce but which displayed fluorescence in its eyes.

40|$|Jasmonic acid (JA) {{is a key}} hormone {{involved}} in plant defense responses. The effect of JA treatment of cabbage plants on their acceptability for oviposition by two species of <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterflies,</b> Pieris rapae and P. brassicae, was investigated. Both butterfly species laid fewer eggs on leaves of JA-treated plants compared to control plants. We show that {{this is due to}} processes in the plant after JA treatment rather than an effect of JA itself. The oviposition preference for control plants is adaptive, as development time from larval hatch until pupation of P. rapae caterpillars was longer on JA-treated plants. Total glucosinolate content in leaf surface extracts was similar for control and treated plants; however, two of the five glucosinolates were present in lower amounts in leaf surface extracts of JA-treated plants. When the butterflies were offered a choice between the purified glucosinolate fraction isolated from leaf surface extracts of JA-treated plants and that from control plants, they did not discriminate. Changes in leaf surface glucosinolate profile, therefore, do not seem to explain the change in oviposition preference of the butterflies after JA treatment, suggesting that as yet unknown infochemicals are involved. ...|$|R

Foliar water and nitrogen contents increased with increased nutrient availability. Concentrations of total glucosinolates, however, decreased with increased nutrient availability. For the most part, insect performance varied significantly between the 2 nutrient treatments. Both insect species performed well on the fertilized treatments which contained high water and nitrogen, but low glucosinolate contents. Ovipositional female butterflies of both species were also found to prefer fertilized plants.

40|$|Evolutionary {{theory of}} plant defences against herbivores predicts a {{trade-off}} between direct (anti-herbivore traits) and indirect defences (attraction of carnivores) when carnivore fitness is reduced. Such a trade-off {{is expected in}} plant species that kill herbivore eggs by exhibiting a hypersensitive response (HR) -like necrosis, which should then negatively affect carnivores. We used the black mustard (Brassica nigra) to investigate how this potentially lethal direct trait affects preferences and/or performances of specialist <b>cabbage</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterflies</b> (Pieris spp.), and their natural enemies, tiny egg parasitoid wasps (Trichogramma spp.). Both within and between black mustard populations, we observed variation in the expression of Pieris egg-induced HR. Butterfly eggs on plants with HR-like necrosis suffered lower hatching rates and higher parasitism than eggs that did not induce the trait. In addition, Trichogramma wasps were attracted to volatiles of egg-induced plants that also expressed HR, and this attraction depended on the Trichogramma strain used. Consequently, HR {{did not have a}} negative effect on egg parasitoid survival. We conclude that even within a system where plants deploy lethal direct defences, such defences may still act with indirect defences in a synergistic manner to reduce herbivore pressure. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.
