40|$|Recent archaeological {{research}} has discovered well preserved historic and pre-Columbian art covering numerous walls inside caves on Mona Island. Human visits can pose {{a serious threat}} to the long term conservation of these fragile engravings and paintings by increasing <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> rates. The quantification of environmental changes to caves related to human visitation is relevant for prediction of <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> processes and cave site management policies. This study addresses the threat of increased <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> to cave art. Data collected in two caves show changes in cave air temperature (T), relative humidity (RH) and CO 2 partial pressure (pCO 2) caused by visitation. Based on the environmental observations, cave air exchange times and <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> rates of different visitor group sizes were quantified. The corrosion rates increase with the number of visitors and also depend on the chamber ventilation characteristics. Periods of visitation might be the only times when <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> can occur, especially in cave chambers distant from the cave entrance. This evidence points out the need to develop a conservation management plan that takes account of visitation levels to ensure preservation for future generations. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|E
40|$|<b>Condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> is the {{dissolution}} of carbonate by acidic vapors condensing above the water table. This process is rarely noted and receives little attention in the mainstream cave literature. The oolitic limestone walls in Movile Cave’s upper dry passages are severely altered by a selective corrosion mechanism. Temperature differences between {{the water in the}} lower passages and the walls in the upper passages and high concentrations of CO 2 in the cave atmosphere create favorable conditions for con-densation corrosion to take place. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope data support the hypothesis that <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> is the major mechanism currently affecting the morphology of Movile Cave’s upper dry level. <b>Condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> is {{the dissolution}} of carbonate by acidic vapors condensing above the water table (Ford & Williams, 1989).

40|$|<b>Condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> is {{a little}} studied, but {{important}} dissolutional process that occurs within caves in many karst settings around the world (for a review see Dublyansky and Dublyansky, 2000). <b>Condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> occurs when air equilibrates with the cave atmosphere, becomes acidic and dissolves the bedrock and speleothems. It is a later vadose process that apparently depends on air circulation patterns, number of entrances and general configuration (vertical range, presence of ponded water, passage shape, etc) of the cave.

The chains were replaced as part of a valve and piston examination at around 30,000 to 36,000 mi, by which time they were considerably worn. This wear, in the chain pins and sprockets, could result in an elongation of the chains by as much as 6 in.

40|$|Many speleothems {{in caves}} on Cayman Brac and Isla de Mona have {{suffered}} considerable dissolution. It {{is suggested that}} this is a consequence of <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> rather than of aqueous flooding of the entire cave. A program of temperature and relative humidity measurements during the rainy seasons showed that the entrance zones are areas of comparatively large diurnal variation where condensation from warm air onto cooler walls may occur. Artificial condensation was induced using ice bottles: chem-ical analysis of the condensation waters determined that they were generally undersaturated with respect to calcite and/or dolomite but that this changes over space and time. Gypsum tablets were suspended inside three sample caves on Cayman Brac and one on Isla de Mona for 16 and 13 months, respective-ly. At the end of this period, tablets close to the entrances and to the floor were found to have under-gone considerable dissolution; this could only have been the result of <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> Where water condensing onto cave walls in soluble rocks is undersaturated with respect to the mineral (calcite, dolomite, gypsum, etc.), the potential exists for dissolution to occur; the process is termed “condensation corrosion ” (Ford & Williams 1989 : 309).

The contract for R100's construction was a fixed price one {{and it was}} obvious from very early on that the project would incur a loss, and so economies were made; for instance, only a dozen machine tools were in use for construction of the airship. There were also difficulties in finding skilled workers due to the remoteness of the location, and {{a large proportion of}} the workers were local people who had to be trained. Conditions in the unheated airship shed were also poor: the roof leaked, ice formed on the girders in winter, and <b>condensation</b> caused <b>corrosion</b> of the airship's duralumin structure, so that the girders had to be varnished.

Tubes can be replaced individually without stopping the entire system. There is no <b>condensation</b> or <b>corrosion</b> within the tubes. One hurdle to wider adoption of evacuated tube collectors in some markets is their inability to pass internal thermal shock tests where ISO 9806-2 section 9 class b is a requirement for durability certification. This means that if unprotected evacuated tube collectors are exposed to full sun for too long prior to being filled with cold water the tubes may shatter due to the rapid temperature shift. There is also the question of vacuum leakage. Flat panels have been around much longer and are less expensive. They may be easier to clean. Other properties, such as appearance and ease of installation are more subjective.|$|R

Most of the 211 shafts and shaft-related depressions located on the plateau have similar characteristics and no shaft has a known accessible connection to an active horizontal cave system.

Then corrosive and erosive action of dripping water takes place and the wall troughs develop downwards - the shaft develops progressively now.

40|$|Condensation is an {{important}} process in karst environments, especially in caves where carbon dioxide enriched air can lead to high rates of <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion.</b> The problem is there has been very little research {{reported in the literature}} dealing with condensation as a microclimate process.

The size of the gradient is largely determined by air exchange with the outside. The results show that the numerical model to predict condensation works well.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{importance}} of visitors in Eagle Cave temperature, a tourist cavern in Ávila, central Spain. Cave air temperature was measured during a year and natural and anthropogenic thermal effects were identified. Eagle Cave has a rather stable temperature around 15. 6 ºC with an annual cycle which amplitude is < 0. 4 ºC. Recorded seasonality in the cave is related to external temperatures due to thermal conduction through the bedrock, with an expected delay of several years for the external signal to be transferred into the cave. The visitors cause increases in diurnal temperature up to 0. 15 ºC, although thermal anomalies are normally recovered overnight. During vacation periods, where consecutive days with large number of visitors increases, thermal anomalies are prolonged for some days or weeks, with amplitudes < 0. 1 ºC. Although visitors have a daily impact on the cave temperature, the effect does not cause long term change in Eagle Cave temperature. The reason for this thermal mitigation is related to the high humidity of the environment, which causes the energy supplied by tourists to be partially transferred as latent heat via evaporation and condensation processes. The current condensation processes are insufficient to cause any discernible <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> that could be damaging recent stalagmite...|$|E
40|$|Oil-fired heating {{appliances}} have traditionally used conventional chimney venting systems.

These changes in venting technology have been accompanied by ever improving appliance efficiencies. The successful application of these modern, high efficiency oil-fired appliances depends upon the safe and cost effective integration of the heating appliance and the vent system.

40|$|International audienceCondensation-corrosion is {{an active}} speleogenetical process in thermal caves where high thermal {{gradient}} drives air convection.

The Chevalley Aven belongs to Aix-les-Bains thermal-sulfidic cave system. Condensation occurs at the contact of cool walls of large spheres; conversely, evaporation occurs at the output of the narrow passages where the air sinks down from the upper sphere.

This morphodynamic pattern favors the development of stacked spheres, isolated by narrow necks, and arranged in a bush-like pattern. This development is clearly active in the vadose zone above the thermal wateer table. We propose that some avens above water table hypogenic caves, like Villa Luz (Mexico), may be of condensation-corrosion origin instead of phreatic.

40|$|Condensation in karst occurs over a {{wide range}} of natural settings, at latitudes from 25 º to 70 º and alti-tudes from sea level to 2600 m. In summer (April through September), {{condensation}} introduces a signif-icant amount of water into the karst massifs (from 0. 1 % to as much as 20 % of the total dry-season runoff). Contrary to common belief, in winter evaporation does not withdraw appreciable amounts of water from the massifs. Evaporating at depth, the water condenses near the surface within the epikarstic zone or on the snow cover and flows back. Condensation can sustain springs during prolonged dry peri-ods (such as summer and winter) when there is no recharge by liquid precipitation. Condensation can {{play a significant role in}} speleogenesis, and many forms of cave macro-, meso-, and micromorphologies are attributable to <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion.</b> It can be particularly efficient in the lat-ter stages of hydrothermal cave development (during partial dewatering) when the temperature and the humidity gradients are highest. Coupled with evaporation, air convection, and aerosol mass transfer, condensation can play a crucial role in the formation of a number of speleothems, as well as create pecu-liar patterns of cave microclimate. Early statements advocating the condensation of moisture in caves can be found in texts of the ancient Greek philoso-phers Thales of Miletus, Empedocles, and Aristotle (VI-IV BC). Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (I AD) stated his belief that the moisture can condense from the vapors of hot waters rising from depth of the Earth (Fedoseev, 1975).

40|$|The microclimatic {{effect of}} bats {{roosting}} in bell holes (blind vertical cylindrical cavities in cave roofs) in Runaway Bay Caves, Jamaica, was measured {{and the potential}} impact of their metabolism on dissolution modelled. Rock temperature measurements showed that bell holes with bats get significantly hotter than those without bats during bat roosting periods (by an average of 1. 1 °C). The relationship is clearest for bell holes with more than about 300 g aggregate bat body mass and for bell holes that are moderately wide and deep, of W:D ratio between 0. 8 and 1. 6. Measurement of temperature decay after abandonment showed that rock temperature returns to normal each day during bat foraging periods. Metabolic activity from a typical population of 400 g bat (10 individuals) yields 41 g of CO 2, 417. 6 kJ of heat, and 35. 6 g of H 2 O in each 18 hour roost period, and could produce a water film of ~ 0. 44 mm, that is saturated with CO 2 at ~ 5 %. The resultant rock dissolution is estimated at ~ 0. 005 cm 3 CaCO 3 per day. The metabolic heat ensures that the focus of dissolution remains vertical regardless of geological controls. A typical bell hole 1 m deep may be formed in some 50, 000 years by this mechanism alone. Addition of other erosional mechanisms, such as direct bacterial bio-erosion, or the formation of exfoliative organo-rock complexes, would accelerate the rate of formation. The hypothesis is developed that bell holes are initiated and formed by bat-mediated <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion</b> and are governed by geographic distribution of clustering bats and their roosting behaviour...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the direct absorption of solar radiation by the working fluid of high temperature, high efficiency energy converters has been carried out. Alkali vapors and potassium vapor in particular {{were found to be}} very effective solar absorbers and suitable thermodynamically for practical high temperature cycles. Energy loss via reradiation from a solar boiler was shown to reduce the overall efficiency of radiation-heated energy converters, although a simple model of radiation transfer in a potassium vapor solar boiler revealed that self-trapping of the reradiation may reduce this loss considerably. A study was also made of the requirements for a radiation boiler window. It was found that for sapphire, one of the best solar transmitting materials, the severe environment in conjunction with high radiation densities will require some form of window protection. An aerodynamic shield is particularly advantageous in this capacity, separating the window from the absorbing vapor to prevent <b>condensation</b> and window <b>corrosion</b> and to reduce the radiation density at the window...|$|R

40|$|During {{combustion}} of biomass, alkali and chlorine {{species are}} {{released to the}} gas phase, species which can react to form corrosive salts that potentially may cause severe corrosion problems on heat transfer surfaces upon <b>condensation.</b> This <b>corrosion</b> process {{is referred to as}} high-temperature corrosion (HTC) and it limits steam data in biomass combustion, with corresponding limitation in thermal efficiency. The flue gas composition and also the HTC conditions can be altered by introducing a second fuel, e. g. coal for co-combustion. The flue gas composition can be altered even more drastically when applying oxy-fuel combustion where the concentration of combustion products are higher than in air firing due to the use of pure oxygen and flue gas recycling. In this work, the alkali sulphation process in different oxy-fuel and air-fuel atmospheres has been investigated by modelling the gas phase chemistry. The overall purpose is to examine the combined effects of oxy-combustion and co-combustion on the HTC process and to make a comparison with air-fired conditions. The flue gas composition in oxy-fuel combustion depends on the recirculation strategy used which in turn also influences the sulphation. According to the modelling results the degree of sulphation of gas-phase alkali metals is in general higher for oxy-fuel combustion compared to air-fuel combustion. It is concluded from the modelling results that an increased amount of sulphur and water contribute to a substantial effect on the degree of sulphation of alkali species. On the other hand, the modelling also shows that an increased content of HCl, which is present during wet recirculation, has a negative effect on the sulphation; the degree of sulphation is therefore lower in wet compared to dry recirculation. The effects of other important parameters such as sulphur-to-potassium and air-to-fuel ratios, temperature and residence time are also discussed further in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{concentration}} {{variability in}} caves {{has implications for}} palaeoclimatic research involving stalagmites, the conservation of cave art, <b>condensation</b> <b>corrosion,</b> and safety during cave exploration. Here we present a high-resolution spatial survey of cave air carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO 2) in the 1. 5 km Scoska Cave system in North Yorkshire, UK, constructed using measurements taken during the interval of July 1 – July 5, 2008. According to the spatial PCO 2 survey, 76 % of the cave air PCO 2 increase occurred within the first ~ 50 metres; consequently the PCO 2 gradient {{throughout the rest of}} the cave was slight. As is the case in other caves, this suggests that a ‘front’ exists at this site between high PCO 2 cave air and low PCO 2 outside air, where the PCO 2 increases dramatically over a short distance. Temperature data support this interpretation. This CO 2 ‘front’ is thought to represent the farthest point reached by large-scale advection of air out of the cave, and its position is hypothesized to fluctuate depending on atmospheric conditions. Thus, distinct PCO 2 trends characterize sections of the Scoska Cave system, which result in spatial variability in calcite deposition and redissolution. Modelled stalagmite growth rates vary between negligible and 0. 21 mm yr- 1, depending on unconstrained drip water [Ca 2 +] values and cave atmosphere PCO 2. Assuming constant drip water [Ca 2 +], optimum calcite deposition occurs near to the cave entrance, where ventilation and advection reduce PCO 2 levels most effectively. However, calcite precipitation on the roof of the cave may partially control the [Ca 2 +] of drip water that reaches the floor, so although the link between overall calcite deposition (i. e., on the roof and the floor) and PCO 2 appears robust, the effect of variable cave air PCO 2 on stalagmite growth rates requires more research. These calculations suggest that calcite precipitation rates in different areas of Scoska Cave may differ due to local PCO 2 and temperature variability, highlighting the benefits of thoroughly understanding site-specific cave environmental factors prior to the interpretation of stalagmite-based palaeoclimate records...|$|E

For tanks with fixed roofs, the drop-back signals caused by <b>condensation</b> mix with <b>corrosion</b> signals from the tank floor and interfere with the online AE inspection. The drop-back signals are very difficult to filter out using conventional methods. To solve this problem, a novel AE inner detector, which works inside the storage tank, is adopted and a pattern recognition algorithm based on CRF (Conditional Random Field) model is presented. The algorithm is applied to differentiate the corrosion signals from interference signals, especially drop-back signals caused by condensation. Q 235 steel corrosion signals and drop-signals were collected both in laboratory and in field site, and seven typical AE features based on hits and frequency are extracted and selected by mRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) for pattern recognition. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the recognition result of CRF model was compared with BP (Back Propagation), SVM (Support Vector Machine), and HMM (Hidden Markov Model).

An alkaline material, magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) {sub 2 }), is injected into flue gas upstream of the air heater to control sulfur trioxide (SO{sub 3 }), which prevents acid <b>condensation</b> and <b>corrosion</b> of the air heater and ductwork. The slipstream was taken from a bituminous coal-fired power plant. During this contract, Plant Design and Construction (Task 1), Start Up and Maintenance (Task 2), Baseline Testing (Task 3), Sorbent Testing (Task 4), Parametric Testing (Task 5), Humidification Tests (Task 6), Long-Term Testing (Task 7), and a Corrosion Study (Task 8) were completed. The Mercury Stability Study (Task 9), ESP Report (Task 11), Air Heater Report (Task 12) and Final Report (Task 14) were completed. These aspects of the project, as well as progress on Public Outreach (Task 15), are discussed in detail in this final report. Over 90 % mercury removal was demonstrated by cooling the flue gas to 200 - 210 F at the ESP inlet; baseline conditions with 290 F flue gas gave about 26 % removal. Mercury removal is sensitive to flue gas temperature and carbon content of fly ash. At 200 - 210 F, both elemental and oxidized mercury were effectively captured at the ESP. Mg(OH) {sub 2 } injection proved effective for removal of SO{sub 3 } and eliminated rapid fouling of the air heater. The pilot ESP performed satisfactorily at low temperature conditions. Mercury volatility and leaching tests did not show any stability problems. No significant corrosion was detected at the air heater or on corrosion coupons at the ESP. The results justify larger-scale testing/demonstration of the technology.
