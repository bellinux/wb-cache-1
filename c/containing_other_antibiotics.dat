40|$|HEI-OC 1 {{is one of}} the few mouse {{auditory}} {{cell lines}} available for research purposes. Originally proposed as an in vitro system for screening of ototoxic drugs, these cells have been used to investigate drug-activated apoptotic pathways, autophagy, senescence, mechanism of cell protection, inflammatory responses, cell differentiation, genetic and epigenetic effects of pharmacological drugs, effects of hypoxia, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and expression of molecular channels and receptors. Among other several important markers of cochlear hair cells, HEI-OC 1 cells endogenously express prestin, the paradigmatic motor protein of outer hair cells. Thus, they can be very useful to elucidate novel functional aspects of this important auditory protein. HEI-OC 1 cells are very robust, and their culture usually does not present big complications. However, they require some special conditions such as avoiding the use of common anti-bacterial cocktails <b>containing</b> streptomycin or <b>other</b> <b>antibiotics</b> as well as incubation at 33 °C to stimulate cell proliferation and incubation at 39 °C to trigger cell differentiation. Here, we describe how to culture HEI-OC 1 cells and how to use them in some typical assays, such as cell proliferation, viability, death, autophagy and senescence, as well as how to perform patch-clamp and non-linear capacitance measurements...|$|R

40|$|Certain erythromycin-resistant {{strains of}} Staphylococcus aureus remain {{sensitive}} to <b>other</b> macrolide <b>antibiotics.</b> If these strains {{are exposed to}} low levels of erythromycin, resistance to <b>other</b> <b>antibiotics</b> is induced. The antibiotics to which resistance is induced by erythromycin include: other macrolides as well as lincosaminide, streptogramin (group B) antibiotics but not chloramphenicol, amicetin, streptogramin (group A) antibiotics, tetracyclines, and aminoglycosides. Hence erythromycin induces resistance exclusively towards inhibitors of 50 S ribosomal subunit function and, thus far, only with respect to three of six known classes of inhibitors which act on this subunit. In the four strains tested, erythromycin did not induce resistance to pactamycin or bottromycin, to fusidic acid (which inhibits a function involving both subunits), or to <b>other</b> <b>antibiotics</b> which do not inhibit ribosomal function. Thus, by inducing resistance erythromycin could antagonize the action of <b>other</b> <b>antibiotics,</b> and a consistent pattern of antagonism was observed to each antibiotic class {{in all of the}} strains in which this could be tested, as well as to <b>other</b> <b>antibiotic</b> members of the same chemical class in each bacterial strain...|$|R

Resistance to chloramphenicol in a strain carrying an R-plasmid coding for chlor-amphenicol acetyltransferase was not increased although the same strain showed increased resistance to kanamycin.

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of resistance to}} a single antibiotic is frequently accompanied by increased resistance to multiple other antimicrobial agents. In sharp contrast, very {{little is known about}} the frequency and mechanisms underlying collateral sensitivity. In this case, genetic adaptation under antibiotic stress yields enhanced sensitivity to <b>other</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Using large-scale laboratory evolutionary experiments with Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that collateral sensitivity occurs frequently during the {{evolution of}} antibiotic resistance. Specifically, populations adapted to aminoglycosides have an especially low fitness in the presence of several <b>other</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Whole-genome sequencing of laboratory-evolved strains revealed multiple mechanisms underlying aminoglycoside resistance, including a reduction in the proton-motive force (PMF) across the inner membrane. We propose that as a side effect, these mutations diminish the activity of PMF-dependent major efflux pumps (including the AcrAB transporter), leading to hypersensitivity to several <b>other</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> More generally, our work offers an insight into the mechanisms that drive the evolution of negative trade-offs under antibiotic selection...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, {{our results}} {{demonstrate}} that antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs were {{more effective than}} standard non-impregnated CVCs in decreasing the rate of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days and catheter colonization with the application of bundles.

Despite their demonstrated efficacy, we could not determine whether <b>other</b> <b>antibiotic</b> catheters are superior to chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine-impregnated catheters. Compared to silver ion-impregnated CVCs, chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine antiseptic catheters reduce microbial colonization but do not reduce CRBSIs.|$|R
