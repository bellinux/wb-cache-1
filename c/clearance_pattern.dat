40|$|Abstract] Statements of the problem:  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) -RNA {{is often}} present in saliva of HCV-infected patients, with plasma viral load {{being the only}} known {{predictable}} factor. Interferon plus ribavirin therapy yields a sustained reduction in HCV viremia. This study aimed to assess the presence of HCV in saliva and serum specimens from patients undergoing this combination therapy (CT). Method of study:  Paired serum and saliva specimens were collected from 44 chronic HCV-infected patients at basal time, 4 and 12 weeks after CT onset, {{at the end of}} treatment and 6 months latter. Serum HCV-RNA levels were determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Amplicor system. Presence of HCV-RNA in saliva was tested by a highly sensitive non-commercialized nested-PCR. Results:  The HCV-RNA was detected in 26 saliva specimens at basal time (59. 1 %). In 34. 1 % of cases, a concordance viral <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> in serum and saliva was observed in both responders (pattern 1 a) and non-responders (pattern 1 b). In pattern 2 (13. 6 % of cases), HCV was detected longer during CT in serum than in saliva (pattern 2 a) or in saliva than in serum (pattern 2 b). In 11. 3 % of patients, viral clearance was corroborated either in their serum (pattern 3 a) or in their saliva (pattern 3 b), but not in both fluids. Of the eight primary responders with 1 a <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern,</b> seven were sustained responders. None of the patients with 2 a <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> was a sustained responder. Of the two primary responders showing the 3 b salivary pattern, one had already relapsed in the first 6 months of follow up. Conclusions:  The present results suggest that the monitoring of salivary levels of HCV would be a helpful means of determining sustained antiviral effects of interferon and ribavirin in the treatment of HCV disease...|$|E
40|$|A {{mouse model}} system was {{employed}} to investigate the temporal pattern of pulmonary clearance of Haemophilus influenzae and to evaluate {{the effect of the}} type b polysaccharide capsule on this <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern.</b> The lungs of BALB/c mice were inoculated with boluses of several different H. influenzae strains via an endobronchial catheter. A fully encapsulated H. influenzae type b strain multiplied readily in the lungs for at least 6 h and then was eventually cleared from the lungs over the next 18 h. The pulmonary <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> obtained with an unencapsulated variant of this H. influenzae type b strain was identical to that obtained with the fully encapsulated parent strain. Two nontypable H. influenzae strains isolated by transtracheal aspiration of patients with acute H. influenzae pneumonia also multiplied in the lung and resisted significant clearance for at least 6 h after inoculation. Bolus deposition of either H. influenzae type b or nontypable H. influenzae in the lungs resulted in an eventual influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the alveoli. The observed delay in clearance of all these strains suggests that resident host defense mechanisms must be augmented for clearance to occur. Furthermore, these data indicate that one or more factors other than the Haemophilus capsule are important bacterial determinants of pulmonary clearance of H. influenzae...|$|E

SMX level in albumen diminished linearly to below 0. 1 p. p. m. (sensitivity level) by 5 days after the cessation of medication. On the other hand, SMX level in yolk remained at a plateau until 4 days, and thereafter decreased linearly to below 0. 1 p. p. m. by 10 days. SMX levels in most tissues diminished below 0. 1 p. p. m. by 3 days and those in kidney and skin by 4 days. <b>Clearance</b> <b>patterns</b> in tissue were quite similar to those in egg albumen. Proportion of acetylated-SMX to total-one in both albumen and yolk tended to increase up to 10 % with the lapse of time after drug withdrawal. Acetylation was high in liver (36. 5 — 43. 6 %), spleen skin and fat, but low in breast muscle and kidney (3. 7 — 11 %) in the groups of feed addition; while acetylation was low in liver of the group of intramuscular injection...|$|R

The Al 18 F-NOTA-PRGD 2 was tested recently in nine cancer patients, showing images of lung tumors, as well as illustrating renal excretion of this particular peptide without any noticeable uptake in normal tissues (e.g., bone) to suggest instability of the 18 F [41].

30|$|When {{designing}} an imaging {{agent for}} 18 F, {{it is very}} important that the agent binds rapidly to the desired target and clears from normal tissues. The elimination and non-target tissue-binding properties of a given agent are defined by the structure of the radiolabeled molecule. If a molecule is predominantly lipophilic, it will have a high degree of hepatobiliary excretion; if it is hydrophilic, then renal excretion is more likely. In some cases, small lipophilic targeting molecules that have hepatobiliary excretion can be modified with negatively-charged groups and hydrophilic isotope-binding groups that can greatly reduce hepatobiliary excretion while increasing renal excretion of the non-targeted imaging agent [50 – 53]. With larger molecules, the <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> will be determined mostly by the targeting molecule, but even there, occasionally small changes can have a pronounced impact on biodistribution [54].|$|E

The high uptake {{and retention of}} radioactivity in PSMA+ LNCaP tumors correlates with the reported high inhibitory potency of [18 F]DCFPyL (Ki[*]=[*] 1.1 nM) towards PSMA [15]. The fast clearance of the radiotracer from the blood, muscle, and most tissues and organs is {{in agreement with the}} hydrophilic nature of compound [18 F]DCFPyL as typical for peptidomimetic PSMA inhibitors. Uptake of [18 F]DCFPyL in PSMA+ LNCaP tumors (SUV 60 min[*]=[*] 1.1) was about 11 times higher compared to PSMA− PC 3 tumors (SUV 60 min[*]=[*] 0.1).

Blood, urine and milk samples were collected before, during and after DEHP exposure to examine its <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern.</b> Ovarian follicular dynamics was monitored through an entire estrous cycle by ultra-sonographic scanning. Follicular fluids were aspirated from the preovulatory follicles on days 0 and 29 of the experiment and analyzed for phthalate metabolites and estradiol con-centration. The aspirated follicular fluid was used as maturation medium for in-vitro embryo production. Findings revealed that DEHP impairs the pattern of follicular development, with a prominent effect on dominant follicles.

40|$|Question: How {{does the}} {{evolution}} of host defences to parasitism depend {{on the level of}} disease-induced sterility? Mathematical Methods: Evolutionary invasion analysis (adaptive dynamics) applied to susceptible-infected host-parasite model. Key assumptions: Hosts can evolve defence through avoidance (lower transmission), clear- ance (higher recovery) or tolerance (lower virulence), in isolation or simultaneously, at a cost to their reproductive rate. Separation of ecological and evolutionary timescales and mutations of small phenotypic effect. Conclusions: Avoidance and clearance are maximised when sterility is high, but tolerance is greatest when sterility is low. However when clearance and tolerance co-evolve there is greater tolerance at high sterility as this boosts the effectiveness of <b>clearance.</b> <b>Patterns</b> of investment along other environmental gradients can change as the level of sterility changes. Evolutionary branching to coexistence in avoidance and clearance is most likely when sterility is high...|$|R

40|$|Hemodialysis (HD) {{treatment}} had, {{over many}} years, improved the survival rate {{of patients with}} end-stage renal disease. However, standard or conventional HD prescription {{is far from being}} optimal in replacing the function of normal kidneys. Its unphysiologic <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> and inability to remove all types and sizes of uremic toxins results in inter- and intra-dialysis complications and an unacceptably high rate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Efficiency of HD can be improved by increasing blood and dialysate flow rates, dialyzer size and surface area and duration and frequency of dialysis sessions. Home HD, where short daily or long slow nocturnal HD sessions can conveniently be performed, provides an excellent option for quality of life improvement and reduction in morbidity and mortality. Recent innovations in the specifications of HD machines and improvement in dialysis membranes characteristics and water treatment technology paved the way for achieving quality HD. These advancements have resulted in efficient implementation of adsorption, diffusion and/or convection principles using adsorption HD, hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration (HDF) and online HDF modalities in order to achieve optimum HD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: he {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} transient vascular leak syndrome of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is unknown. We aimed {{to determine whether}} molecular size and charge selectivity, which help restrict plasma proteins within the intravascular space, are altered in patients with DHF and whether a disturbance of the anionic glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer on the luminal endothelial surface contributes to disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We measured serial plasma levels and fractional clearances of proteins with different size and charge characteristics in 48 children with dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and urinary excretion profiles of heparan sulfate, chondroitin- 4 -sulfate, and chondroitin- 6 -sulfate in affected children and healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Compared with convalescent values, acute plasma concentrations of all proteins were reduced, with increased fractional clearances. Smaller proteins were more affected than larger molecules. Albumin, which is normally protected from leakage by its strong negative charge, demonstrated a <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> {{similar to that of}} transferrin, a neutral molecule of similar size. Urinary heparan sulfate excretion was significantly increased in children with DSS. CONCLUSIONS: The endothelial size-dependent sieving mechanism for plasma proteins is at least partially retained, whereas selective restriction based on negative charge is impaired. The increased heparan sulfate excretion suggests a role for GAGs in the pathogenesis of the vascular leak...|$|E
40|$|Brucella abortus is a facultative, {{intracellular}} zoonotic pathogen {{which can}} cause undulant fever in humans and abortions in cattle. A 14 -kDa protein of B. abortus was previously identified to be immunogenic in animals infected with Brucella spp. In this study, we discovered that the 14 -kDa protein possessed immunoglobulin binding and hemagglutination properties {{that appeared to be}} based on the protein's lectin-like properties. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments suggested that the 14 -kDa protein has affinity towards mannose. Disruption of the gene encoding the 14 -kDa protein in virulent B. abortus strain 2308 induced a rough-like phenotype with an altered smooth lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immunoblot profile and a significant reduction in the bacterium's ability to replicate in mouse spleens. However, the mutant strain was stably maintained in mouse spleens at 2. 0 to 2. 6 log 10 CFU/spleen from day 1 to week 6 after intraperitoneal inoculation with 4. 65 log 10 CFU. In contrast to the case for the smooth virulent strain 2308, in the rough attenuated strain RB 51 disruption of the 14 -kDa protein's gene had no effect on the mouse <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern.</b> These findings indicate that the 14 -kDa protein of B. abortus possesses lectin-like properties and is essential for the virulence of the species, probably because of its direct or indirect role in the synthesis of smooth LPS...|$|E

However, the specifics by which senescent cells are recognized and removed are poorly understood. There are multiple competing hypotheses for this process, perhaps the most commonly cited is that senescent RBCs expose neoantigens [or senescent antigen(s) ] that are then recognized by naturally occurring antibodies, which opsonize the senescent cells and result in clearance from circulation. While there are a large volume of published data to indicate that older RBCs accumulate increased levels of antibody on their surface, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the causal role of such antibodies in clearance has not been rigorously assessed. In the current report, we demonstrate that RBC lifespan and <b>clearance</b> <b>patterns</b> are not altered in mice deficient in antibodies, in C 3 protein, or missing both.

We found that C-dots are efficiently and rapidly excreted from the body after all three injection routes. The clearance rate of C-dots is ranked as intravenous > intramuscular > subcutaneous. The particles had relatively low retention in the reticuloendothelial system and showed high tumor-to-background contrast.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about host defense {{mechanisms}} responsible for protective immunity in malaria. The intravascular location of the infection suggested that removal of parasitized erythrocytes by reticuloendothelial organs might be important. To study this possibility, we examined the clearance of 51 Crlabeled Plasmodium berghei-infected erythrocytes in rats. Infected erythrocytes were removed more rapidly from circulation than homologous uninfected erythrocytes. The rate of clearance of infected cells during the 1 st hour after inoculation was approximately three times greater in rats rendered immune by prior infection than in control rats. This accelerated clearance resulted from greater splenic uptake in immune rats and appeared to correlate with spleen size. Since the <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> of infected erythrocytes more closely resembled the clearance of Heinz body-containing uninfected erythrocytes than of antibody-coated (immunoglobulin G) uninfected erythrocytes, rheologic alterations of parasitized erythrocytes might be a more important determinant of clearance than an antibody-dependent process. During the phase of malaria infection in which increasing parasitemia is observed, organ uptake of infected erythrocytes did not increase despite splenic and hepatic enlargement. However during the spontaneous onset of resolution of malaria infection characterized by decreasing parasitemia, a marked enhancement of splenic clearance was noted. These observations suggest that sudden alteration in splenic clearance of parasitized erythrocytes might be important in the resolution of acute malaria...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} the physiology of circulating IgA immune complexes (IgA- IC), {{the dynamics of}} IgA-IC removal by the liver were examined. After intravenous injection, covalently cross-linked IgA antibodies to the dinitrophenyl determinant were rapidly removed from the circulation by the liver. Immunofluorescence microscopy and light and electron microscope autoradiography showed that the IgA-IC were associated with Kupffer cells. With increasing doses of injected IgA-IC the clearance velocity approached a maximum, thus prolonging the circulation of IgA- IC. All these observations indicated a receptor-mediated process. Saturating doses of various potential receptor-blocking agents, heat- aggregated mouse IgG, microaggregated human serum albumin, and purified dimeric IgA did not influence the <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> and hepatic uptake of radiolabeled IgA-IC. Mouse livers were also perfused via the portal vein with 1 microgram of IgA-IC. In {{the presence or absence}} of serum proteins, 43 % of the perfused IgA-IC were removed in a single passage. This liver uptake was not reduced with simultaneous perfusion of large doses of aggregated mouse IgG, aggregated human serum albumin, or purified free dimeric mouse IgA.

Fifteen minutes to 1 h after gal-streptavidin administration the complexes were cleared via the liver alone (as opposed to liver and spleen after native streptavidin). Twenty-four hours after administration of gal-streptavidin, the tumour to blood ratio for biotinylated A 5 B 7 IgG increased from 2. 9 to 13. 2 and for biotinylated F(ab') 2 fragments an increase from 4. 9 to 33. 2 was achieved.

Injection of asialofetuin inhibited clearance. confirming that removal of the gal-streptavidin-biotinylated antibody complexes from the blood was via the asialoglycoprotein receptor on liver hepatocytes. Therefore, galactosylation of the streptavidin clearing agent allows rapid removal of radiolabelled biotinylated antibodies via the liver asialoglycoprotein receptor. as opposed to the reticuloendo-thelial system...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{management of}} patients with non-obstructive dysphagia is notoriously difficult. Esophageal impedance measurement {{can be used to}} measure esophageal bolus transit without the use of radiation exposure to patients. However, validation of measurement of bolus transit with impedance monitoring has only been performed in healthy subjects with normal motility and not in patients with dysphagia and esophageal motility disorders. The aim was, therefore, to investigate the relationship between transit of swallowed liquid boluses in healthy controls and in patients with dysphagia. Twenty healthy volunteers and 20 patients with dysphagia underwent concurrent impedance measurement and videofluoroscopy. Each subject swallowed five liquid barium boluses. The ability of detecting complete or incomplete bolus transit by means of impedance measurement was assessed, using radiographic bolus transit as the gold standard. Impedance monitoring recognized stasis and transit in 80. 5 % of the events correctly, with 83. 9 % of bolus transit being recognized and 77. 2 % of stasis being recognized correctly. In controls 79. 8 % of all swallows were scored correctly, whereas in patients 81. 3 % of all swallows were scored correctly. Depending on the contractility pattern, between 77. 0 % and 94. 3 % of the swallows were scored correctly. Impedance measurement can be used to assess bolus <b>clearance</b> <b>patterns</b> in healthy subjects, but {{can also be used to}} reliably assess bolus transit in patients with dysphagia and motility disorder...|$|R
40|$|Single-cell {{suspensions}} of Nocardia caviae 112 were {{injected into}} normal, athymic, and asplenic mice by several different routes. The 50 % lethal dose values, kill curve characteristics, histological and electron microscopic properties, organ <b>clearance</b> <b>patterns,</b> and induction of L-forms during the acute and chronic phase of disease were determined {{in groups of}} mice for up to 2 years after infection. From these data we concluded the following. (i) Athymic and asplenic animals were significantly more susceptible to N. caviae than their littermate controls regardless of inoculation route. (ii) All mice were most susceptible to lethal infection after intranasal administration and least affected when the organisms were injected into the peritoneal cavity. (iii) Chronic, progressive disease leading {{to the formation of}} mycetomas occurred only in mice injected intravenously. (iv) T-cell-deficient animals were impaired in the development of typical mycetomas. (v) L-forms of N. caviae were induced within immunocompetent hosts, whereas the cell wall-less state of the bacteria was not observed in the immunodeficient animals. (vi) Two colony types of the cell wall-deficient state were isolated from infected animals. (vii) These cell wall-deficient organisms were intimately involved in the pathogenesis of disease and bacterial persistence within the host. Finally (viii), with this strain of Nocardia, cell wall-deficient organisms {{played a major role in}} the development of the characteristic bacterial granule formed within the mycetomatous lesions 6 months to 1 year after intravenous inoculation...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} four-compartment {{model to}} evaluate separate kidney technetium- 99 m-MAG 3 kinetics in humans. BackgroundPharmacokinetic modeling based on compartmentalization {{has provided a}} valuable tool to assess the <b>clearance</b> <b>patterns</b> of various glomerular and tubular agents. However, no models have been proposed thus far that combine vascular data and imaging data {{in order to gain}} a deeper knowledge on renal pathophysiology, and to obtain more diagnostic information of clinical relevance. To this aim, we propose a four-pool model for the evaluation of separate renal function. MethodsIn a group of ten normal volunteers and twenty patients with various renal diseases, we tested the four-pool model based on the identification of the two kidneys as two distinct pools. This approach made it possible to integrate the separate kidney contributions deriving from in vivo imaging data, and allows the researcher to quantitate many parameters specific to each kidney. ResultsThe parameters TERR, TERL, MRTR, MRTL, νR, νL, k 3 R- 1, k 3 L- 1 permit the normal from abnormal states of renal function to be differentiated, as well as monolateral from bilateral renal disease to be separated within the abnormal function group. ConclusionsThe proposed approach combines the advantages of plasma clearance methods with those derived by gamma-camera imaging, and makes it possible to quantitate the differential renal function. This feature may be clinically relevant in renal transplant donors, where full knowledge of renal pathophysiology could guide the procedure...|$|R
40|$|Some {{investigators}} {{have suggested that}} wedge resection (WR) confers {{a higher incidence of}} positive margins and an inferior survival compared with anatomic resection (AR) of colorectal liver metastases (CLM). We sought to investigate the margin status, pattern of recurrence, and overall survival of patients with CLM treated with WR or AR. We identified 253 consecutive patients, in a multi-institutional database from 1991 to 2004, who underwent either WR or AR. WR was defined as a nonanatomic resection of the CLM, and AR was defined as single or multiple resections of one or two contiguous Couinaud segments. Clinicopathologic factors were analyzed with regard to pattern of recurrence and survival. One hundred six WRs were performed in 72 patients and 194 ARs in 181 patients. There was no difference in the rate of positive surgical margin (8. 3 %), overall recurrence rates, or patterns of recurrence between patients treated with WR vs. AR. Patients who had a positive surgical resection margin were more likely to recur at the surgical margin regardless of whether they underwent WR or AR. The median survival was 76. 6 months for WR and 80. 8 months for AR, with 5 -year actuarial survival rates of 61 % and 60 %, respectively. AR is not superior to WR in terms of tumor <b>clearance,</b> <b>pattern</b> of recurrence, or survival. WR should remain an integral component of the surgical treatment of CLM. PublishedN/...|$|E
30|$|Therapy of metastatic RCC with TKIs can be {{monitored}} with non-invasive imaging methods to analyze therapy success {{as well as}} predict patient outcomes [22],[23]. Several preclinical and clinical studies {{have been carried out}} to analyze therapeutic effects of a TKI such as sunitinib or sorafenib utilizing PET [31]-[38]. Besides monitoring tumor metabolism in RCC with [18 F]FDG, [18 F]FMISO was used to analyze effects on tumor oxygenation status and [18 F]FLT for determination of proliferation. During the present study, [18 F]FAZA was used. Although [18 F]FAZA in comparison to [18 F]FMISO may exhibit a better <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> from non-targeting muscle tissue based on its lower lipophylicity, there is still a debate about the radiotracer of choice for imaging tumor hypoxia [26]-[28]. In Caki- 1 tumors, [18 F]FAZA uptake amounted to 1.5 % to 2.2 % ID/g after 3 h p.i. As analyzed from the dynamic PET studies, initial uptake reached a maximum level after approximately 40 to 60 min which did not further increase. Image contrast with [18 F]FAZA is achieved based on the non-target tissue clearance over time. In Caki- 1 tumors, a tumor-to-muscle ratio of approximately 1.5 was reached after 3 h p.i.. The current findings are in line with observations in other murine and human xenograft models of different origin, where 1.3 % to 3 % ID/g or even lower levels were measured at the same time p.i. [26],[27],[44]. Similar to the Caki- 1 model, low uptake of [18 F]FMISO was found in A 498, another human RCC xenografted tumor model [33].|$|E
40|$|Background: Radiolabeled human Immunoglobulin-G (hIgG) has {{demonstrated}} its utility in inflammation and infection imaging. However, the present method of radiolabeling hIgG is time-consuming and complex. Objective: To develop a simplified method of radiolabeling hIgG with technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) via a nicotinyl hydrazine derivative (99 mTc-HYNIC-hIgG) and its biological evaluation. Results: In vitro and in vivo {{studies showed that}} 99 mTc-hIgG prepared by this method was fairly stable in physiological saline and human serum till 24 h. Only 4. 3 % degradation of the radiolabeled drug was seen till 24 h. Blood <b>clearance</b> <b>pattern</b> of the radiopharmaceutical exhibited biphasic exponential pattern. Biodistribution of 99 mTc-HYNIC-hIgG in mice was observed up to 24 h. Significant accumulation of the radiotracer was found in liver (4. 93 %), kidney (3. 67 %) and intestine (2. 12 %) at 4 h interval by 24 h interval, it was reduced to 1. 99 %, 2. 18 % and 1. 93 % respectively. Significant amount of radioactivity in liver, kidney and intestine suggest hepatobilliary as well as renal route of clearance for 99 mTc-HYNIC-hIgG. The anterior whole body and spot scintigraphy images showed increased uptake of 99 mTc-HYNIC-hIgG, with the area seen as a focal hot spot, indicating good localization of the radiolabeled hIgG {{at the site of}} infection. Conclusion: The present findings indicate that 99 mTc-HYNIC-hIgG holds great potential for the scintigraphy localization of inflammation. The shelf life of the developed kit, when stored at (-) 20 °C was found to be at least 3 months...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether CT-guided mucociliary clearance studies allow differentiation between bronchiectasis associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and those unrelated to congenital or genetically transmitted defects. Materials and methods. Fifteen children aged 4 - 18 {{years with a}} CT diagnosis of bronchiectasis {{were included in the}} study. Six had PCD, while in nine cases no congenital disorder was demonstrated. Results. CT showed bronchiectasis in 26 (29 %) of 90 lung regions. Radiolabelled aerosol studies were conducted globally for each lung and on the regions affected by bronchiectasis. Global half-time of activity (t(1 / 2)) values of patients with PCD were significantly higher (P < 0. 001) than those with bronchiectasis unrelated to congenital disorders. Among the 26 lung regions in which CT demonstrated bronchiectasis, regional clearance was abnormal in 24 cases. Patients with PCD showed no statistically significant difference between regional and global t(1 / 2) values. Patients with bronchiectasis unrelated to congenital disorders showed significantly higher regional t(1 / 2) values in the affected regions with respect to the corresponding global pulmonary t(1 / 2) (P < 0. 06). Conclusions. The combination of morphological CT information with functional data concerning the clearance of radiolabelled aerosol adds to our understanding of pulmonary impairment in children with bronchiectasis. In particular, regional studies allow the recognition of different mucociliary <b>clearance</b> <b>patterns</b> in bronchiectasis associated with PCD and those unrelated to congenital or genetically transmitted defects...|$|R

40|$|Fibrinogen Fg-D, {{obtained}} by plasmin-induced cleavage of fibrinogen, was separated and purified by ion exchange chromatography. The in vivo behavior was studied by administering 2 mg of 125 I-labeled Fg-D intravenously {{into each of}} 3 normal, 3 partially hepatectomized, 3 reticuloendothelial system (RES) blockaded, 4 nephrectomized and 2 ureter ligated rabbits. The plasma clearance in normal rabbits showed two components: 66. 0 ± 6. 0 % was cleared with a t½ of 0. 9 ± 0. 2 hours and 32. 3 ± 5. 3 % cleared with a t½ of 3. 6 ± 0. 3 hours. In both the partially hepatectomized and RES-blockaded groups, the <b>clearance</b> <b>patterns</b> {{were similar to those}} observed in the normal animals. In contrast, in the nephrectomized group, while the t½ of the first component was similar to that in the normal group, the second component had a longer t½ (6. 0 ± 1. 0 hours) than the other groups. In the animals with both ureters occluded, the t½'s were similar to the normal animals. Measurements of urinary radioactivity suggested that complete in vivo catabolism had occurred. In vivo subfragments of Fg-D could not be detected in the plasma. Neither Fg-D nor subfragments were found in the urine. These results indicate that Fg-D is rapidly cleared from the plasma, that in vivo subfragmentation does not occur, and that the kidneys are important in the catabolism of a portion of Fg-D...|$|R
