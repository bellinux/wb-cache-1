5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees <b>can</b> <b>clean</b> the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist <b>can</b> <b>clean</b> the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E

Its main {{advantage is that}} the needles automatically adjust themselves to contours, making the tool {{a good choice for}} cleaning irregular surfaces. A needle gun <b>can</b> <b>clean</b> an area to bare metal in seconds, and compares well to other scaling tools in terms of accuracy and precision.|$|E

However it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run out.|$|E
25|$|Myiasis is the {{infestation}} {{of living}} or necrotic tissue {{in a living}} host by fly larvae. Some flies may just lay their eggs in a festering wound, while other may infest unwounded tissue. C. cadaverina has occasionally been found in cases of myiasis but is not a fly that is regularly found. Myiasis is fairly uncommon in the United States, but tends to be very common {{in third world countries}} and can create a major problem with livestock, causing severe economic losses. Myiasis is different from maggot therapy in which physicians purposely use larvae of flies that feed on necrotic tissue in order to clean up a wound and aid healing. Maggot therapy <b>can</b> <b>clean</b> up a wound that has been festering for months very quickly.|$|E

500|$|Lee {{was born}} in Marylebone, London on 26 October 1890, the eldest of three boys, all of whom progressed to play {{first-class}} cricket. His father was a greengrocer and a coal merchant who followed cricket closely in the London evening papers. During Lee's youth, he developed his cricket by playing against lamp-posts, and reflected in his autobiography that: [...] "If a bowler <b>can</b> <b>clean</b> bowl a man {{nine times out of}} ten against a lamp-post, he will not miss a full-sized wicket when he gets the chance." [...] His cricketing talent was encouraged at school; he first attended Barrett Street School and then St. Thomas's School in Portman Square. Both schools had headmasters who were sports enthusiasts, and at St. Thomas's the headmaster, Mr. Despicht, offered a penny to any schoolboy who could bowl him out, a feat Lee achieved regularly. Mr. Despicht also taught Lee to concentrate on bowling a good length, and Lee played primarily as a bowler during his school years. During his final year at St. Thomas's, the school reached the final of the local Church School's League Shield, and Lee earned victory for his school with six wickets. When Lee left school, he worked with his father as a greengrocer, a job he liked, but not enough to stop him writing a letter to the Marylebone Cricket Club, asking for a job on the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground.|$|E

2500|$|The {{machines}} for washing the building windows are stored {{on the roof}} of the building. [...] There are two types: one is automatic and the other is manual. [...] The automatic window washing machines run on rails on the sides of the building. [...] This machine <b>can</b> <b>clean</b> a window in 2.6 seconds. [...] It consumes 426,000 gallons of water per run to clean the entire tower. [...] The other machine is a manual window washing cradle. [...] Both of these {{machines for}} cleaning the windows are supported by rails that run around the outside of the pyramid roof and that are bolted down into the maintenance floor itself.|$|E

50|$|Another {{difference}} between oil and acrylic paint is the cleanup. Acrylic paint <b>can</b> be <b>cleaned</b> {{out of a}} brush with any soap, while oil paint needs a specific type {{to be sure to}} get all the oil out of the brushes. Also, it is easier to let a palette with oil paint dry and then scrape the paint off, whereas one <b>can</b> easily <b>clean</b> wet acrylic paint with water.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{not always}} {{necessary}} to replace the ballast if it is fouled, nor must all the ballast be removed {{if it is to}} be cleaned. Removing and cleaning the ballast from the shoulder is often sufficient, if shoulder ballast is removed to the correct depth. While this job was historically done by manual labour, this process is now, like many other railway maintenance tasks, a mechanised one, with a chain of specially-designed railroad cars handling the task. One wagon cuts the ballast and passes it via a conveyor belt to a cleaning machine, then the cleaning wagon washes the ballast, and deposits the dirt and ballast into other wagons for disposal and re-use, respectively. Such machines <b>can</b> <b>clean</b> up to [...] of ballast in an hour.|$|E
