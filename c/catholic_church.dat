25|$|Catholicism has {{generally}} been less segregated than other denominations. In 1940 only 63% of African Americans went to segregated <b>Catholic</b> <b>churches,</b> as compared to 94% of Protestants. The smaller rates of segregation may be {{due in part to}} the fact that <b>Catholic</b> <b>churches</b> are more religiously than socially focused as compared to Protestant <b>churches.</b> Theologically, <b>Catholic</b> <b>churches</b> also emphasize unity among races. In 1984 American bishops disseminated a letter calling for even further inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities into <b>Catholic</b> <b>churches.</b>|$|R
