40|$|In this research, we {{investigated}} relationships between undergraduate students’ prior topic beliefs and their recall {{of the main}} <b>conclusions</b> from texts on controversial socio-scientific issues, to what extent students trusted the recalled <b>conclusions,</b> and how they justified their trust in those <b>conclusions.</b> While belief-biased recall of text <b>conclusions</b> was not observed in this study, students were found to trust the recalled <b>conclusions</b> more when they were consistent than when they were inconsistent with students’ prior beliefs about the issues. Moreover, students primarily justified their trust in the recalled <b>conclusions</b> by referring to their personal opinions on the issues. Finally, students who correctly recalled text <b>conclusions</b> even when those <b>conclusions</b> were at odds with their prior beliefs about the issues outperformed students who incorrectly recalled <b>conclusions</b> that were consistent with their prior beliefs on measures of cognitive reflection and reported use of critical reading strategies. Theoretical as well as educational implications of these findings are discussed.

American military victories {{in the region and}} the ratification of the Jay Treaty, which called for British withdrawal from the region's forts, caused a formal evacuation, but the British were not fully expelled from the area until the <b>conclusion</b> of the War of 1812.|$|E

We establish the performance bounds by utilizing the partial dependencies between the ideas and the priority distributions on the <b>conclusions.</b> We show that multiple term descriptions of the facts and <b>conclusions</b> improve the compression performance when combined with judicious partitioning of the fact space. ...|$|R
