50|$|In August 2013, Dole {{announced}} that CEO David Murdock would acquire the outstanding {{stock of the}} company for $1.2 billion. The sale closed in October 2013, but was challenged by shareholders who argued {{that the company was}} undervalued, based in part on underestimated cost savings from the 2012 sale of the Asia business. In 2015, the Delaware Chancery Court awarded $148 million in damages to the former shareholders, on the grounds that Murdock and David Carter had misled shareholders regarding the finances of the company. Dole, which had moved its <b>corporate</b> <b>registration</b> from Hawaii to Delaware in 2001, became an outspoken critic of Delaware corporate law {{as a result of this}} litigation.|$|E

5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that another factor {{affecting}} the administration of the Session at the time was the international situation behind the iron curtain. Many of the units attached to the General Conference were unable to send delegates to the Zeist session due to restrictions on religious bodies in communist lands. [...] Proxy letters from a number of Union Conferences were held by the General Conference Secretary enabling the session to convene legally (a provision enabled in the 1949 <b>corporate</b> <b>registration),</b> though the proxy holder still only had one vote regardless of the number of proxies held. Those Units not represented directly accounted for approximately 60% of the organization's membership. Consequently, neither of the two factions that became evident at the Zeist session were {{in a position to make}} any unilateral decisions.|$|E
50|$|On June 6, 2011, the D.C. Attorney General {{released}} a report accusing Thomas of diverting public funds for personal use. Thomas was accused of using $300,000 in city grants that were earmarked for charity and youth baseball groups {{to pay for his}} personal expenses, including golfing vacations and an SUV, which was later seized by the FBI on December 2, 2011, in an ongoing investigation. Those baseball groups included the councilmember's own group, Team Thomas - although the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs revoked <b>corporate</b> <b>registration</b> for Team Thomas in 2009, and the Internal Revenue Service never recognized it as a charity. A civil lawsuit filed against him by the district's attorney general was settled in July 2011 when Thomas agreed to repay the $300,000 in six installments over the next three years. Following this agreement, Thomas remained on the council and continued to maintain he was innocent of criminal behavior as the United States Attorney's Office continued to investigate the case.|$|E
5000|$|The raids in June 2007 enabled corrupt law {{enforcement}} officers to steal the <b>corporate</b> <b>registration</b> documents of three Hermitage holding companies, permitting them to perpetrate a fraud, claiming (and receiving) the $230 million of taxes paid by those companies to the Russian state in 2006. In November 2008 one of Hermitage's auditors, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested. He was charged with the very tax evasion that he was investigating. Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009, after eleven months in pretrial detention. [...] His death eventually led directly to the passage, by the U.S. Congress, of the Magnitsky Act, {{signed into law by}} President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012. The act directly targeted individuals involved in the Magnitsky affair by prohibiting their entrance to the United States and their use of its banking system, and prompted the Russian government to retaliate by prohibiting adoption of Russian children by American citizens, and prohibiting certain individuals from entering Russia.|$|E

50|$|One {{may also}} charter an {{offshore}} corporation {{to provide a}} legal personality, limited liability, transferable shares, a centralized management, and shared ownership. In some cases the investment advantages of such a corporation are offset by legal, <b>corporate</b> and account <b>registration</b> fees imposed by {{the country in which}} the offshore account is established. Further, the officers of the corporation may be required to establish residence, own real estate, or meet an investment minimum (depending upon the country this may range up to $1 million). An advantage which accrues from establishing a corporate structure is that although a citizen may be proscribed from establishing an offshore account, they can establish a corporation that can do so.|$|R
40|$|Poor {{corporate}} practices (despite Law number 1 of 1995 concerning Limited Liability Companies), {{capital market}} and stock exchange rules, and a dismal record {{of law enforcement}} are cited by many quarters of the society as the main culprits for Indonesia's corporate ills. The issue raised by this paper is reform to Indonesia's corporations statutes; regulatory body and judicial system to establish a strong foundation for good corporate governance. This reform is only possible if one has {{a clear understanding of}} what the term `corporate governance' means; the elements of good corporate governance; the parties that play a role in creating and maintaining a good standard of corporate governance; and, most importantly, the benefits a country and its people may reap by adopting and adhering to the principles of good corporate governance. All these issued will be addressed in part II of this paper. Part III will deal with real cases arising from poor corporate practices; weak and, to a certain extent, incompetent regulatory bodies; a <b>corporate</b> and security <b>registration</b> system which fails its purpose; and judiciary which is yet to gain the respect of people it serves for its competence and independence. Part IV will be a look at {{the most common form of}} corporations currently in existence in Indonesia; their governing regulations; regulatory bodies; and how they actually operate in practice. A proposal for reform of those regulations and other related regulations; regulatory bodies; and the judicial system will be outlined in part V of this paper with part VI deals with conclusion.

5000|$|The Association {{was formed}} {{at the same}} klonvokation that {{dissolved}} the Second Era Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The new group was to be an [...] "informal, unincorporated" [...] alliance of klaverns which would remain active {{in the state of}} Georgia. Green was elected to the post of Grand Dragon, the usual designation of a state leader of the KKK. Initially there were only twelve klaverns in the Association. In October 1945 the group conducted the first cross burning since the end of World War II atop Stone Mountain. At the time Green told the press that cross burning had been suspended during wartime because [...] "all factions had to unite to win the war". At the time of the cross burning the Association claimed 20,000 members. On March 21 the Klans attorney, Morgan Telser, filed a <b>corporate</b> <b>registration</b> with the Georgia Secretary of State for the [...] "Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc" [...] and paid up the dues for the period 1943-6. On May 9, 1946 Green held the first large scale initiation ceremony on Stone Mountain. Approximately 1,000 on-lookers watched as 227 aliens were naturalized by 1,000 robed Klansmen under the light of five burning crosses. Green triumphantly announced [...] "We are revived." [...] The initiates included a bus load of visitors from Tennessee. The presence of women among the assembled Klan members was also noted. Some altercations broke out with journalists, as the AGK had granted Look exclusive rights to take pictures.|$|E
40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{decision}} in Daimler AG v. Bauman confirmed what the Court hinted at in its earlier {{decision in}} Goodyear Dunlop Tires v. Brown—that a corporation must be sued “at home” unless the claims being asserted {{relate to the}} corporation’s activity in the forum state. Together, the decisions {{put an end to}} an era of general jurisdiction jurisprudence in the United States. Professor Silberman highlights the impact of these decisions in both interstate and international cases. She examines related areas of jurisdictional doctrine that are likely to be affected, including new ways of defining and interpreting specific jurisdiction. She notes the developing case law raising constitutional challenges to <b>corporate</b> <b>registration</b> statutes that purport to confer general jurisdiction {{on the basis of the}} corporation’s consent. She also identifies problems created for recognition and enforcement of foreign country judgments and awards if the Daimler standard is applied in that context. Professor Silberman concludes with the observation that more comprehensive approach to jurisdiction may be called for, including possible legislative solutions...|$|E
40|$|The United States Supreme Court’s 2014 {{decision}} in Daimler AG v. Bauman changed how the courts {{will determine whether}} companies {{should be subject to}} general personal jurisdiction. In 1945, Pennoyer v. Neff’s geographical fixation gave way to International Shoe Co. v. Washington, which provided a test for courts to determine whether corporations had sufficient contact with a forum to meet the bar for personal jurisdiction there. Specific jurisdiction requires “minimum contacts,” provided the action is satisfactorily related to the forum. However, to be subject to general jurisdiction, a corporation must possess more than just “minimum contacts,” and claimants can bring actions in forums where companies are subject to general jurisdiction regardless of whether those actions have any relationship to that forum. Precisely how much contact a company must have with a forum to be subject to general jurisdiction has evolved since International Shoe, and Daimler is the most current iteration. Analyzing general jurisdiction by pinpointing a company’s level of contact with a particular forum can be a superfluous exercise. The case law has developed such that “consent” can overcome even a remarkable lack of contacts with a particular forum and subject a company to general jurisdiction. Some courts have interpreted a corporation’s registration and appointment of someone to accept service of process in a state as implied consent to general jurisdiction. Others at least require a state’s registration procedure to explicitly mandate the company submit to general jurisdiction. Daimler, and its recent progeny, may have signaled the death knell for at least implied consent to general jurisdiction by virtue of registration and perhaps for explicit consent as well. Some courts and commentators are rightly noting that mandating consent as {{the cost of doing business}} in a particular forum is consent in name only. While courts used to give credence to the legal fictions of corporate consent and corporate presence, they are now striking them down as violations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. This Note seeks to address how states can maintain general jurisdiction over corporations that do not meet Daimler’s apparent demand that a company be “at home” in the forum. The inevitable chipping away of states’ registration statutes as sufficient (impliedly or explicitly) for general jurisdiction potentially leaves a viable alternative intact: genuine consent. States might look to structure a form of incentive based consent by use of their regulatory or taxing authority. States can craft solutions based on how important it is to them to provide their courtrooms to those who would seek redress from corporations operating within their borders. Additionally, an incentive-based genuine consent to jurisdiction serves the ancillary benefit of ensuring more companies go through the proper channels of a state’s registration process, including filling out the appropriate paperwork, instead of operating outside its bounds. After Daimler, states will have to decide whether, and how, to adapt their <b>corporate</b> <b>registration</b> statutes to ensure their courts remain open to claims based on general jurisdiction. This Note will put forward solutions so that states will be able to craft new legislation before the courts invalidate their reliance on fictional consent...|$|E
