5|$|The <b>cohabitation</b> {{lifestyle}} {{is becoming more}} popular in today's generation. It is more convenient for couples not to get married {{because it can be}} cheaper and simpler. As divorce rates rise in society, the desire to get married is less attractive for couples uncertain of their long-term plans.|$|E
5|$|Living as unwed {{partners}} is {{also known}} as <b>cohabitation.</b> The number of heterosexual unmarried couples in the United States has increased tenfold, from about 400,000 in 1960 to more than five million in 2005. This number would increase by at least another 594,000 if same-sex partners were included. Of all unmarried couples, about 1 in 9 (11.1% of all unmarried-partner households) are homosexual.|$|E

The aim of this research was to define the nature of <b>cohabitations</b> in Russia, reveal the factors of entrance to non-marital unions in order to discuss how and why non-marital union is implicated in recent dialogues about family policy. In order to achieve the aim, such methods as Event History Analysis and Sequence Analysis were used...|$|R
5|$|Saint and Elliot {{returned}} to Ecuador to work among the Huaorani (1958-1960), establishing a camp called Tihueno near a former Huaorani settlement. Rachel Saint and Dayuma became bonded in Huaorani eyes through their shared mourning and Rachel's adoption as a sister of Dayuma, taking the name Nemo from the latter's deceased youngest sister. The first Huaorani to settle there were primarily {{women and children}} from a Huaorani group called the Guiquetairi, but in 1968 an enemy Huaorani band known as the Baihuari joined them. Elliot had {{returned to}} the United States in the early 1960s, so Saint and Dayuma worked to alleviate the resulting conflict. They succeeded in securing <b>cohabitation</b> of the two groups by overseeing numerous cross-band weddings, leading to an end of inter-clan warfare but obscuring the cultural identity of each group.|$|E
5|$|Child {{marriage}} (including {{union or}} <b>cohabitation)</b> {{is defined as}} marriage {{under the age of}} eighteen and is an ancient custom. In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been married before they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third of girls are married under age, and 1:9 before 15. The practice is commonest in South Asia (48% of women), Africa (42%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (29%). The highest prevalence is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of girls married before the age of eighteen is as high as 75% in countries such as Niger (Nour, Table I). Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio of girls to boys is 72:1, while in countries such as the United States the ratio is 8:1. Marriage may occur as early as birth, with the girl being sent to her husbands home as early as age seven.|$|E
5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the <b>cohabitation</b> aspect.|$|E

5|$|Following this event, Zwingli {{and other}} humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July {{to abolish the}} {{requirement}} of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, Anna Reinhard, earlier in the year. Their <b>cohabitation</b> was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, {{three months before the}} birth of their first child. They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Zurich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, Apologeticus Archeteles (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.|$|E
5|$|Litorea aurea {{is equally}} and most {{closely related to}} Li. castanes and L. ranaformis. A microcomplement {{fixation}} technique using serum albumins has indicated the species closest to L. aurea is L. ranifomis. Albumin immunological distance data suggest no differentiation between the two, and the green and golden bell frog evolutionally separated from the other two species about 1.1 million years ago. A 1995 study of protein variations showed four of 19 protein systems had variation and only two had differentiation. Scientists believe the different species can still hybridise, as their distribution areas still overlap, and both L. raniformis and L. aurea have been seen sharing ponds in the Gippsland area of Victoria. However, little evidence of hybridisation actually occurring has been found. Although {{there have been reports}} of frogs of mixed appearance in Gippsland, analysis of proteins and sera of the frogs showed two distinct species. Samples in other area of distribution have shown no evidence of hybridisation in spite of <b>cohabitation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Normans and French {{who arrived}} after the conquest saw {{themselves}} as different from the English. They had close family and economic links to the Duchy of Normandy, spoke Norman French and had their own distinctive culture. For many years, to be English was {{to be associated with}} military failure and serfdom. During the 12th century, the divisions between the English and Normans began to dissolve as a result of intermarriage and <b>cohabitation.</b> By the end of the 12th century, and possibly as early as the 1150, contemporary commentators believed the two peoples to be blending, and the loss of the Duchy in 1204 reinforced this trend. The resulting society still prized wider French cultural values, however, and French remained the language of the court, business and international affairs, even if Parisians mocked the English for their poor pronunciation. By the 14th century, however, French was increasingly having to be formally taught, rather than being learnt naturally in the home, although the aristocracy would typically spend many years of their lives in France and remained entirely comfortable working in French.|$|E
40|$|Using {{data from}} the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, a nationally {{representative}} cohort of young adults, the authors analyzed relationship type {{at the time of}} a first birth (N = 4, 044). More than 10 % of births were to a postconception cohabiting household (<b>cohabitations</b> that were initiated between conception and birth), a higher proportion of births than those born to postconception married households. Individuals in postconception and preconception cohabiting relationships (<b>cohabitations</b> that existed prior to conception) were demographically similar; both groups were associated with lower levels of socioeconomic advantage relative to those in preconception and postconception marriage. Postconception and preconception cohabiting relationships were associated with similar levels of dissolution, as 40 % dissolved within 3 years of a child's birth. Having a marital union, rather than whether relationship was established pre- or postconception, was more strongly associated with who selected into the relationship and how long the relationship lasted. © National Council on Family Relations, 2012...|$|R
30|$|Bargaining {{power can}} stem from being legally married. Households {{that are less}} {{characterized}} by assortative mating are expected to last longer and are costly to dissolve, for example, marriages, which will choose to specialize compared to households that have a shorter duration, like <b>cohabitations</b> (Stratton 2005). Hence, bargaining power {{tends to be more}} equally divided between cohabiting partners and less likely along traditional gender lines compared to married partners. Thus, marriages in general will have more specialization.|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{nuptiality}} in chosen non-European {{countries in}} the 2 nd half of the 20 th century Abstract The main aim of this thesis is to compare timing and intensity of nuptiality in chosen non-European {{countries in the}} 2 nd half of 20 th century. Surveyed countries were chosen from all continents. The main criterion was availability of suitable data. The choice cannot be generalized for whole continents. But the differentiation of nuptiality {{and the most important}} trends were described. The analyse contains the portion of single according to age, singulate mean age at first marriage and in some cases distribution of fiancés according to age. This thesis shows that there was a shift of timing of marriage to older age of bridegrooms in most of chosen countries in the 70 s of the 20 th century. However in South America situation was a little bit different because of the high portion of people who lived in <b>cohabitations.</b> Values of mean age at marriage are influenced by level of literacy. Total intensity of nuptiality is influenced by increasing level of <b>cohabitations.</b> Key words: nuptiality, timing of marriages, intensity of nuptiality, portion of single, singulate age at first marriage...|$|R

This is investigated for 3, 586 marital partnerships (marriages or <b>cohabitations)</b> in 15 waves of the British Household Panel Survey. Both short and long term effects are investigated using discrete time hazard regression models. Results indicate that any form of unemployment predicts partnership dissolution. The effect is similar when unemployment hits either a man or a woman. The effect of male unemployment is to a considerable degree mediated by low financial satisfaction among their partners. We find no indications that the unemployment effect can be explained by unobserved heterogeneity. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{status of}} {{same-sex}} relationships were first formally recognized in 2003 under a law dealing with unregistered <b>cohabitations.</b> As {{a result of}} a 2013 referendum, Croatia's Constitution defines marriage solely as a union between a woman and man, effectively reinforcing the prohibition on same-sex marriage.

40|$|THE MARRIAGE DEBATE IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: CHANGING NORMS AND THE EVOLUTION OF CIVIL MARRIAGE, by Charles Kindregan, Jr., Distinguished Professor of Law, Suffolk University Law School, Boston. A work in progress. Continuing a study first written {{shortly after}} the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled that {{marriage}} licenses must be issued to qualifying same-sex couples and published in the Family Law Quarterly in 2004, the author now reviews additional developments affecting changing attitudes about marriage and its equivalents. These include both American developments such as civil unions and registered domestic partnerships and the American Law Institute’s proposal to treat certain long-term <b>cohabitations</b> as having the same consequences as marriage unless the partners opt out of it. It also examines the growing acceptance of same-sex unions in other countries. Other historical developments discussed in the earlier article are further developed. The conclusion of these studies is that marriage is not now and never has been truly static in American law, and that throughout history attitudes about civil marriage have constantly undergone change...|$|R
40|$|Forged {{within the}} {{multifaceted}} forces of social interaction, collectivities {{come in a}} bewildering variety of configurations. They may take form for different reasons, they may {{be made up of}} people whose adherence to the group varies depending on a further host of factors. This contextual nature of social groupings makes collective identity a difficult matter to study and define in a historical perspective. This collection's aim is to offer a summary of these issues. Starting from a seminar held in Naples (Federico II University, February 11, 2014), organized in the context of FIRB Research Project entitled “The Construction of Space and Time in the Transmission of Collective Identities. Religious Polarizations and/or <b>Cohabitations</b> in Ancient World (1 th- 6 th cent. CE) ”, the articles included in this monographic section organize their specific analysis into a more general key component: collective identity as the perception of similarities and differences, so, more generally, communal identity as a social process.  Such a general depiction of group identity serves {{as the basis for the}} examination of identity-formations, also of the so-called “religious” identities, according the perspective of longue durée as it emerges in more recent researches...|$|R
30|$|In the {{analysis}} that follows, we will define three populations, a non-immigrant population, an immigrant population (original {{immigrants and their}} descendants), and a mixed population, and we will employ a simplified or “stylized” demographic projection model to trace the evolution of each population {{from one generation to}} the next under alternative assumptions about the propensity to cross-parent. Although implicit rather than explicit in the model, immigrants could have the same characteristics as non-immigrants or they could differ in various ways—ethnicity, language, education, and others—and such differences could have an important bearing on the mixing pattern. While not directly related to immigration (except historically), we note that many studies of population mixing in the USA have focused on racial intermarriage. Fryer (2007), for example, contrasts the “extraordinary convergence” in relation to black-white economic and political empowerment with much less convergence “in the most intimate spheres of life – religion, residential location, marriage, and cohabitation” and observes that marriage across racial lines is a “rare event” (pp. 71, 72). Torch and Rich (2016) report that the proportion of black-white marriages and <b>cohabitations</b> among couples increased fivefold from 1980 to 2010 but still accounted for only 1.5 % of the total (p. 1).|$|R
