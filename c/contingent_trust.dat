40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} two matters {{pertinent to the}} office of trustee. First, the fiduciary nature of the office of trustee is investigated, with particular reference to the essence of a trustee’s fiduciary duty. Secondly, the protection afforded by a trustee’s fiduciary office to trust beneficiaries, particularly contingent beneficiaries, is examined. It is shown that the protection enjoyed by <b>contingent</b> <b>trust</b> beneficiaries is frequently ascribed to their “vested interests in the proper administration of a trust” (which, it is submitted, means that each <b>contingent</b> <b>trust</b> beneficiary enjoys a personal right against the trust’s trustee for proper trust administration as counterpart to such trustee’s fiduciary duty). The question is then posed whether, as some commentators contend, such an interest in or right to proper trust administration allows extending a direct action, through the actio legis Aquiliae, to <b>contingent</b> <b>trust</b> beneficiaries for claiming delictual damages from an errant trustee in breach of trust...|$|E

40|$|In {{the coming}} decades, highly treated wastewater, known as {{reclaimed}} water, {{is slated to}} be a major element of municipal water supplies. In par-ticular, planners propose supplementing drinking water with reclaimed water as a sustainable solution to the growing challenge of urban water scarcity. Public opposition is currently considered the primary barrier to implementing successful potable water reuse projects; nonetheless, public responses to reclaimed water are not well understood. Based on a survey of over 250 residents of Tucson, Arizona, this article assesses the rela-tionship between trust in the professional institutions responsible for municipal water development and willingness to drink reclaimed water. Results demonstrate that public acceptance of potable reuse is <b>contingent</b> on <b>trust</b> in the authorities who influence design of sociotechnical systems for water supply and reuse—including water and wastewater utilities, regulators, consultants, academics, and elected local officials.

40|$|No liberal {{democracy}} can survive without popular trust in its judicial system.

A UNIQUE AND ORGANIC DUTY: So long as the courts are seen to fulfil their duty to guard against encroachments by the executive on the freedoms and rights of individual citizens with integrity and credibility, they maintain enough public support to retain their normative authority. But support for those with power and privilege is easily undermined.

The study investigates how these decisions {{are influenced by the}} governance structures of the organizations which provide the framework for governance of temporary organizations such as projects. The governance of these temporary organizations provides a basis for ethical decision making. One of the links between governance and ethical decision making is trust. This study investigates the role of personal trust and system trust as a mechanism to steer ethical decision making in different governance settings for temporary organizations. Nine case studies were conducted in Europe, Asia and Australia. The results of this qualitative study show that ethical decision making is <b>contingent</b> on <b>trust</b> which, in turn, is contingent on the fulfillment of personal expectations within a given governance structure. The study provides a related model and a number of propositions.

40|$|How does {{a concept}} acquire its meaning? How does a learner acquire a concept? Answers are {{explored}} through historical review of two social science concepts: tolerance of ambiguity (TA) and educational technology (ET). Each of these concepts accommodates multiple interpretations. Limitations in dominant interpretations of each concept are exposed using three analytic perspectives: theoretical, ecological, and phenomenological. The first concept, TA, originally {{conceived as a}} personality trait, acquires additional meaning when re-interpreted as a metacognitive skill. As such, TA refers to an {{ability to cope with}} increasing sensitization to novel features of a phenomenon in order to redefine prior conceptual interpretations, <b>contingent</b> on <b>trust</b> and motivation. The second concept, ET, concerns the application of technology for purposes of learning. ET is popularly conflated to mean the application of computer technology; however, less intuitively, technology refers to myriad ideas and processes, including cultural, biological, and metacognitive processes. As a metacognitive strategy for conceptual change, TA can be exploited in ET theory and practice. In particular, securely experiencing the ambiguity that is inherent in a phenomenon (for example, the ambiguity inherent in a concept such as TA or ET) equips learners to overcome the restraints of prior knowledge, toward the cultivation of new knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR) is increasingly important to business, including professional team sport organisations. Scholars focusing on CSR in sport have generally examined content related {{issues such as}} implementation, motives or outcomes. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to add to that body of knowledge by focusing on process related issues. Specifically we explore the decision-making process used in relation to CSR-related programs in the charitable foundations of the English football clubs. Employing a grounded theory method and drawing on the analysis and synthesis of 32 interviews and 25 organisational documents, this research explored managerial decision-making with regard to CSR in English football. The findings reveal that decision-making consists of four simultaneous micro-social processes (‘harmonising’, ‘safeguarding’, ‘manoeuvring’, and ‘transcending’) that form the platform upon which the managers in the charitable foundations of the English football clubs make decisions. These four micro-social processes together represent assessable transcendence; a process that is, fortified by passion, <b>contingent</b> on <b>trust,</b> sustained by communication and substantiated by factual performance enables CSR formulation and implementation in this organisational context.

40|$|This {{retrospective}} on the Dyer and Chu (2000) article “The {{determinants of}} trust in supplier–automaker relationships in the US, Japan, and Korea ” attempts to accomplish a number of objectives. First, the paper examines the key findings and impact of the original paper, and provides additional insights behind the original research. Notably, we further clarify why interpersonal trust between organizational boundary spanners does not translate into inter-organizational trust – and why inter-organizational trust is often based upon processes. Second, the paper briefly discusses relevant research on inter-firm trust since 2000, noting that research has shown the <b>contingent</b> value of <b>trust,</b> and notably {{that it is more}} important when asset specificity and uncertainty are high. Third, we discuss {{what has happened in the}} automotive industry over the past 15 years with regard to trust in supplier–buyer relationships. We show a correlation between automaker trustworthiness and automaker market-share performance and suggest a causal link, since some automakers (e. g., Hyundai, Kia) have been increasing trust with suppliers and then improving market performance. Finally, the retrospective discusses opportunities for future research on the topic {{of trust in}} inter-organizational relationships...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to today’s IP-based host-oriented Internet ar-chitecture, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) emphasizes content {{by making it}} directly addressable and routable. Named Data Networking (NDN) is an instance of CCN designed as a candidate next-generation Internet architecture. By oppor-tunistically caching content within the network (in routers), NDN appears to be well-suited for large-scale content dis-tribution and for {{meeting the needs of}} increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry applications that dominate today’s Internet. One key feature of NDN is the requirement for each con-tent object to be digitally signed by its producer. Thus, NDN should be, in principle, immune to distributing fake (aka “poisoned”) content. However, in practice, this poses two challenges for detecting fake content in NDN routers: (1) overhead due to signature verification and certificate chain traversal, and (2) lack of trust context, i. e., what pub-lic key(s) is/are trusted to verify which content. Due to these issues, NDN currently does not force routers to verify content signatures, which makes the architecture susceptible to content poisoning attacks. This paper explores root causes of, and some cures for, content poisoning attacks in NDN. In the process, it becomes apparent that meaningful mitigation of content poisoning is <b>contingent</b> upon a <b>trust</b> management architecture, elements of which we construct while carefully justifying specific de-sign choices. This work represents the initial effort towards comprehensive trust management for NDN. 1...|$|R
40|$|In the introduction, I {{have stated}} the {{motivation}} for the model I will present in this thesis; trust is an important economic asset and may be vital to industrialization, {{which in turn is}} crucial for successful development and increased standards of living in the long run. In the following chapters I will present a model of industrial production and investment, where trust enters the production function and greatly influences investment decisions. In chapter 2, the basic model is presented, firstly, by introducing the economy in which the model unfolds, secondly by presenting the economic agents that enter the model, and lastly, by deducing the agents adjustment and actions. The simple model shows that when successful industrialization is <b>contingent</b> on <b>trust,</b> there are multiple equilibria; the economy may reach either of two possible solutions; one a low trust poverty trap, the other a preferred solution of sustained growth and development. Chapter 3 is an extension of the simple model. The model in this chapter concerns the same economy, and addresses the problems that may arise when there is asymmetric information, and when various types of business contacts differ with respect to trustworthiness. Again two equilibria are possible outcomes. However, it is shown that there are several qualified interpretations of the model; depending on how the population is composed, the predictions of the model will vary. In chapter 3. 3, I examine an economy that consists of producers and predators. The economy may find itself in a crime induced low-trust poverty trap, if the ratio of producers to predators is too low. Conversely, if the ratio is favourable, the economy heads towards a benign equilibrium in which the economy will experience sustained growth and development. The other interpretation is presented in chapter 3. 4; in an economy of advanced producers and cottage producers, the model predicts either coordination failure and a subsequent poverty trap, or a big push out of poverty. Chapter 4 is an extension to the model as interpreted in chapter 3. 4, but the asymmetries of information are less prominent. The predictions of this chapter are that coordination failure (or the big push effect) may occur even when information about business contacts trustworthiness is more readily available. Chapter 5 offers a presentation of the general conclusions, predictions and policy implications of the thesis...|$|R
40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR) has an ever-increasing {{role in the}} way commercial businesses operate. Team sport organisations are not immune to this trend. CSR is a strategic issue for sport organisations, with professional teams {{across a range of}} sports and national contexts now modifying their organisational structure by establishing charitable foundations tasked with delivering their CSR content. These structural changes inevitably bring in new organisational actors who, in varying degrees, influence ̀the actual implementation of CSR in the professional sports team context. Organisational complexity is therefore increasing regarding CSR, as is the need to capture its elements at both cross-organisational and individual levels. This is especially important given that, unlike mainstream (corporate) foundations that deal directly with a ‘parent’ company, professional sport leagues often mandate the implementation of CSR through central funding mechanisms. This in turn emphasises the intricacy of the process and the dynamics amongst organisational actors at various levels. To date, no studies have attempted to address this complexity. The present thesis aims to help fill the gap by examining the managerial decision-making process in the organisational context of charitable foundations established by English professional football clubs. The current study employs a grounded theory methodology as it aims to develop a substantive theory of how managers responsible for the formulation and implementation of CSR-related programmes in English football make professional decisions. The research utilises the Straussian variant of grounded theory, which accepts that humans shape their institutions as much as institutions shape people. The study also seeks cognitive similarity, a concept that implies some form of similar attribution of meaning, understanding or interpretation amongst individuals in multiple organisations. Although its purpose was to develop an individual-based substantive theory grounded in the way managers make decisions regarding CSR, throughout the focus has been on decision-making itself rather than on the individuals who facilitate this process. The study is populated with the top two divisions of English football and employs two data collection techniques: organisational documents and semi-structured interviews. The fieldwork took place in three different phases, with the first ̀consisting of two sub-phases. Phase 1 a emphasised the analysis of organisational documents (a total of 25 documents from 16 football organisations), while the following phases of the fieldwork were based on constant comparative data analysis from 32 interviews. The theoretical framework that emerged from this study is one of assessable transcendence; in a conceptually abstract fashion, ‘assessable transcendence’ concerns a process that, fortified ̀by passion, <b>contingent</b> on <b>trust,</b> sustained by communication and substantiated by factual performance, enables the formulation and implementation of CSR-related programmes in this context. The social process that emerged from this study, therefore, consists of an intrinsic (that is, passion) and an extrinsic (that is, trust) stimulus, both of which are central components of the micro-social process transcending. These two stimuli, however, require the support of both internal and external communication (abstractly expressed through the micro-social process manoeuvring), and thus all three together form a ‘coalition’ which can enhance both business and social performance (largely expressed by the first ̀two micro-social processes, namely safeguarding and harmonising). Accordingly, two interrelated aspects of the decision-making process constitute a common thread in this research: (a) the recognition that social consciousness stimulates the process of assessable transcendence in an indispensable and limitless way, and (b) an understanding that transcendence cannot occur without either continuous achievement or the dissemination of concrete ‘CSR impact’ in social and business forms alike (hence assessable). The significance of this doctoral thesis for the sport management literature is four-fold. First, it focuses on the individual level of analysis, thereby offering a framework that explains the decision-making of those individuals responsible for the application of CSR in professional team sport organisations. By doing so, it bridges the micro/macro divide by integrating the micro-domain’s focus on individuals (i. e., foundation managers) with those of the meso- and macro- domains. Second, it moves away from mono-theoretical approaches that have been mainly used for the examination of CSR in the sporting context. By doing so, it illustrates that different, and often opposing, theoretical approaches may be needed in order to fully capture and theoretically explain {{the way in which the}} CSR practice occurs. Third, it shifts the focus of scholarly activity away from CSR content-based research towards more process-oriented approaches. CSR content research does little to explain how professional teams achieve and maintain such positioning through deliberate and trial-and-error CSR actions initiated by the individuals therein. Fourth, an in relation to the previous point, it employs a process-oriented methodology (namely, grounded theory) whose utilisation in sport management research has been either non-existent or a ‘pick and mix’ practice. By doing so, the current thesis responds to calls for internal consistency and methodological coherence, thereby adding to the limited number of studies that have utilised this methodology in a rounded manner. The theoretical framework presented in this dissertation has emerged from exploratory study. As such, the four micro-social processes, their associative meanings and, more importantly, the four principal concepts that hold assessable transcendence are regarded as tentative and require substantiation through further research. To this end, a number of research propositions are offered that can serve as a starting point towards a continued exploration of those moderating and mediating factors on the formulation and implementation of CSR in team sport organisations...|$|R
