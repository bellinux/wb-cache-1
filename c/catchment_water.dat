Meanwhile the purpose of this research was to know the governmental efforts to protect <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area from sand mining in Sleman Regency, in particularly in Cangkringan Subdistrict. In addition the method used for collecting data was direct interview to the source person and respondent. From the research result, up till now the effort of legal protection conducted by the government towards <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area has not been fully optimal. It is caused by some matters, e. g. the inexistence of particular regulation that rules, the lack of coordination between the related institution, and the lack of employees in governmental institution and also the lack of budget provided by regional government up till now. Thus the government of Sleman Regency should improve the working system in related institution and unify the similar vision and mission, as well as the government should establish a strict regulation for managing and supervising <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area in Sleman Regency.

40|$|The {{process of}} <b>catchment</b> <b>water</b> quality {{management}} must {{be built on}} sound philosophies and appropriate information. Over the last few years, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry in South Africa has been reviewing and developing the philosophical support for <b>catchment</b> <b>water</b> quality management and has initiated a number of catchment plans. The translation of these philosophies into management information needs, which is supported by appropriate assessment of data obtained by monitoring the physical catchment, requires concomitant development. This paper provides a framework to anchor the scientific-technical support to <b>catchment</b> <b>water</b> quality management. The {{first part of the}} framework deals with the classification of the physical system, providing the conceptual 'platform' for monitoring, assessment and management. This is based on the definition of four physical process elements representing the components of water quality management, namely production, delivery, transport and use. The second part of the framework involves the definition of an assessment 'super-structure', building on these elements. This provides the link between the physical system and management in formation needs, through monitoring and assessment. The paper ends by providing an integrated framework, which indicates possible types of assessment associated with the different phases of the <b>catchment</b> <b>water</b> quality management process.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} in predicting whole <b>catchment</b> <b>water</b> balance from observations at patch scales motivate {{a search for}} theories that can account for the complexity of interactions in catchments. In this paper we suggest that the spatial patterns of vegetation may offer a lens through which to investigate scale dependence of hydrology within catchments. Vegetation patterns are attractive because they are observable drivers of evapotranspiration, often a dominant component in <b>catchment</b> <b>water</b> balance, and because the spatial distribution of vegetation is often driven by patterns of water availability. We propose that nontrivial, scale‐dependent spatial patterns in both vegetation distribution and <b>catchment</b> <b>water</b> balance are generated {{by the presence of}} a convergent network of flow paths and a two‐way feedback between vegetation as a driver of evapotranspiration and vegetation distribution as a signature of water availability. Implementing this hypothesis via a simple network model demonstrated that such organization was controlled by catchment properties related to aridity, the network topology, the sensitivity of the vegetation response to water availability, and the point‐scale controls on partitioning between evapotranspiration and lateral drainage. The resulting self‐organization generated spatial dependence in areally averaged hydrologic variables, water balance, and parameters describing hydrological partitioning. This spatial scale dependence provides a theoretical approach to connect water balance at patch and catchment scales. Theoretical and empirical studies for understanding the controls of vegetation spatial distribution, point‐scale hydrological partitioning, and the implications of complex flow network topologies on the spatial scale dependence of <b>catchment</b> <b>water</b> balance are proposed as a research agenda for catchment ecohydrology...|$|E
