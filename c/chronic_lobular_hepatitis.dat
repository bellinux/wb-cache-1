40|$|ABSTRACT. Chronic {{hepatitis}} {{has been}} broadly defined as liver inflammation without improvement {{for at least}} 6 months. A more accurate definition is Hit is a chronic necroinflammatorydisease of variable severity that is not associated with features of chronic cholestasis or with steatasis or Malory body forma-tion. " Histological classification of chronic hepatitis included chronic persis-tent hepatitis. chronic active hepatitis, and <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> The histo-pathologicalaspects of chronic hepatitis are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{classification}} of chronic hepatitis introduced in 1968 is still current, {{but has been}} modified. The concept of bridging hepatic necrosis has been incorporated, and is recognised as an important feature of both acute and chronic aggressive (active) hepatitis (CAH). In the pathogenesis of the latter, piecemeal necrosis is, however, {{thought to be the}} more important factor. The histological picture of CAH varies widely. Several causes of CAH have been identified, including hepatitis B virus. Recognition of surface and core components of the virus in tissue sections has facilitated study of the relationship between host response and pathological lesion in chronic hepatitis. CAH and primary biliary cirrhosis share histological features, and a mixed form has been postulated. Staining for copper sometimes helps to distinguish the two lesions.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{outcome of}} non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis was evaluated in 21 patients {{who developed the}} illness after open-heart surgery and could be followed thereafter up to five years. Histological chronic sequelae were documented in 13 patients, and consisted of chronic persistent hepatitis in one case, <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in two and chronic active hepatitis in 10, five of whom also developed superimposed cirrhosis. Progression to these chronic states was in most cases symptomless, independently {{of the severity of}} liver lesions; one patient, however, died of gastrointestinal bleeding due to cirrhosis of the liver. During follow-up the biochemical pattern of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis was unique, while striking fluctuations of transaminase levels. Liver histology proved essential to identify the severity of chronic liver lesions, as clinical and biochemical features were uniform and not indicative of it. Our results suggest that cirrhosis may develop, often with an asymptomatic course, in a significant number of patients who do not recover after acute post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{characteristics}} of chronic hepatitis in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers with intrahepatic delta antigen, the hepatic histologic findings of 137 patients were reviewed; 101 patients were followed for 2 to 6 years. The predominant liver disease was chronic active hepatitis in 93 patients or cirrhosis in 32; minor forms of <b>chronic</b> persistent or <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> were seen in 12 patients. Eight of the 26 patients with an initial diagnosis of cirrhosis died during the follow-up period. Cirrhosis developed in 31 of 75 patients (41 %) without nodular regeneration seen in the first biopsy specimen; 5 of these patients died. Treatment with prednisone or azathioprine did not induce histologic amelioration of delta hepatitis or prevent cirrhosis. Chronic HBsAg hepatitis with intrahepatic expression o...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels, we used radioimmunoassay, {{and compared}} {{the results obtained}} with other tests in 231 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection to evaluate its clinical implications. All of these patients were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) -positive. Among them, 38 patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 18 had chronic persistent <b>hepatitis,</b> 70 had <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> or active <b>hepatitis</b> (grouped as CAH), 31 had active cirrhosis (AC), 25 had inactive cirrhosis, 20 had decompensated cirrhosis, and 29 were “healthy” HBsAg carriers. Twenty-seven patients with acute hepatitis, 12 with cancer metastasis to the liver, and 81 normal adults served as disease or normal controls. The results showed that serum TBG level increased significantly in patients with CAH, AC, or HCC. Serum TBG did not correlate with albumin or bilirubin level, but correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) positively in patients with CAH (p < 0. 001) and negatively in patients with HCC (p < 0. 01) (slope difference p < 0. 05). Serial determination of serum TBG and ALT also showed parallel changes in 15 patients with CAH, but not in nine patients with HCC. In contrast, the fall and rise of serum TBG levels in patients with HCC coincided with tumor resection and recurrence. The data suggest that serum TBG elevation in patients with hepatitis activity {{is the result of}} hepatocellular damage, whereas that in patients with HCC is due to increased synthesis. Whether serum TBG elevation without concomitant rise of ALT {{could be used as a}} marker of HCC awaits further study...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of active}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection in chronic HBsAg positive hepatitis {{with and without}} hepatitis delta virus (HDV) superinfection was analysed in percutaneous liver biopsy specimens from 50 patients. Each specimen was divided into two [...] one part for histological evaluation and {{for the detection of}} HBcAg and delta antigen; the other part was tested for HBV-DNA using Southern blotting. Ten cases were of <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> 10 of chronic persistent hepatitis, and 30 of chronic active hepatitis. Ten cases were delta antigen positive and showed high grade lobular activity but no evidence of HBV-DNA episomal forms or HBcAg reactivity. Twenty one cases showed HBV-DNA replicative intermediate forms; 19 had high grade lobular activity, which occurred in five cases without evidence of free viral DNA. Of the 21 biopsy specimens with HBV-DNA episomal forms, 14 were positive for HBcAg; only one of the 19 cases without detectable viral DNA was positive for such antigen. These data indicate that the presence of HBV or HDV active infection correlates with the histological finding of prominent lobular necrosis. Moreover, intrahepatic HBV-DNA seems to be a more sensitive marker than the presence of viral antigens for indicating HBV replication...|$|E
40|$|As {{reported}} for other chronic liver diseases, hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection {{might result in}} malnutrition. In order to establish whether this disease could be responsible of malnutrition and hence influence growth, 75 children, chronically infected with HBV, have been followed up for 4 years. Thirty-one of them had chronic active hepatitis (CAH), 25 chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH), 14 <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (CLH), and five cirrhosis (three active, two inactive). The nutritional status was evaluated every 12 months, with careful physical and laboratory examinations. General nutritional status was estimated according to Waterlow criteria (13, 14). At our first observation, 50 children were following a balanced diet with a caloric intake adequate for age and weight, whereas 25 were on a low-fat diet, begun in the belief of its therapeutic value. For seven patients of this second group, the caloric intake was below the daily requirement. The latter group showed a growth failure in weight {{when they were first}} seen at our center and gained weight when the dietary intake was normalized. However, no biochemical feature of malnutrition was observed in all the 75 children. At the end of the follow-up period, the nutritional status was satisfactory for all of them...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-one adult {{patients}} with chronic hepatitis B and active viral replication {{as indicated by the}} presence of hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg), increased DNA polymerase (DNAp) and positive hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA) for more than 6 months, were entered into a prospective trial of recombinant human interferon therapy. Ten patients had chronic persistent or <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> 8 chronic active hepatitis and 3 postnecrotic cirrhosis. All cases were treated with 5 x 10 (6) units of recombinant interferon alfa- 2 B given subcutaneously every other day for 12 weeks. During treatment, 18 patients (86 %) showed a significant reduction of DNAp levels, which reached normal values in 10 patients (48 %). Viral replication was controlled over a 10 -month follow-up period in 7 out of 21 patients (33 %). Of these 7, five patients became HBeAg negative and HBeAb positive. HBsAg disappeared in one patient. The only serious adverse effect was thrombocytopenia in one patient in whom rapid recovery occurred when interferon was withdrawn. Treatment was also terminated in a second patient because of local reactions at the injection sites occurring after 10 weeks of therapy. Our data indicate that relatively small doses of recombinant alfa- 2 B interferon given during a 12 -week period induce a significant reduction in viral replication and might approximately triple the spontaneous seroconversion rate observed in {{patients with}} chronic hepatitis B...|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{define a}} new {{histological}} staging and grading system for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), {{to provide more}} information reflecting clinical laboratory data and the prognosis to hepatologists. Methods and results: First, 17 histological lesions of PBC were scored in 188 needle liver biopsy specimens. Factor analysis yielded three independent groups of factors: factor 1 (fibrosis, fibrous piecemeal necrosis, orcein-positive granules, bile plugs, Mallory bodies, feathery degeneration, bile duct loss and atypical ductular proliferation); factor 2 (portal inflammation, eosinophilic infiltration, lymphoid follicles, epithelioid granulomas, interface hepatitis and chronic cholangitis); and factor 3 (interface <b>hepatitis,</b> <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> acidophilic bodies and pigmented macrophages). The eight findings of factor 1, but not factors 2 and 3, were significantly correlated with clinical laboratory data and scores in the Mayo Clinic's prognostic model. Factor 1 lesions may reflect histological progression (staging), while factor 2 and 3 lesions may relate to necroinflammatory activity (grading). Then, we devised a staging and grading system using three lesions (bile duct loss, fibrosis and orcein-positive granules) from factor 1 and three from factors 2 and 3 (chronic cholangitis, interface <b>hepatitis</b> and <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis).</b> Conclusion: This new system might provide more pathological information on PBC patients for hepatologists. © 2006 The Authors...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The {{classification}} of chronic hepatitis introduced in 1968 is still current, {{but has been}} modified. The concept of bridging hepatic necrosis has been incorporated, and is recognised as an important feature of both acute and chronic aggressive (active) hepatitis (CAH). In the pathogenesis of the latter, piecemeal necrosis is, however, {{thought to be the}} more important factor. The histo-logical picture of CAH varies widely. Several causes of CAH have been identified, including hep-atitis B virus. Recognition of surface and core components of the virus in tissue sections has facil-itated study of the relationship between host response and pathological lesion in chronic hepatitis. CAH and primary biliary cirrhosis share histological features, and a mixed form has been postulated. Staining for copper sometimes helps to distinguish the two lesions. A third histological category, <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> comprises patients with histological lesions like those of acute hepatitis, but with a chronic or recurrent course. Ten years ago De Groote et al. (1968) emphasised the need to subdivide chronic hepatitis, according to histological criteria, into categories with differing prognosis. The more benign form, chronic per-sistent hepatitis (CPH), was characterised by in-flammation largely confined to portal tracts, with or without superimposed features of acute hepatitis in the lobules. The essentially benign nature of the lesion has since been confirmed (Becker et al., 1970; Chadwick et al., 1977), although progression to more serious liver disease is recorded (Vido et al. ...|$|E
40|$|The morphologic {{evolution}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) liver disease in 45 hepatic allograft recipients who were HBV surface-antigen positive (HBs-Ag+) {{at the time}} of liver replacement and who survived for more than 60 days was studied by routine histologic and immunocytochemical analysis of serial pathology specimens. The findings in these patients were compared to a control group of 30 individuals who were immune to the HBV (anti-HBs antibody positive), but required hepatic replacement for other reasons. Eight of the forty-five (18 %) HBsAg-positive patients have no serologic evidence of HBV reinfection after transplantation. All 37 remaining patients are reinfected; 21 (47 %) developed chronic active hepatitis and/or cirhosis, 3 (7 %) developed submassive necrosis, and 6 (14 %) developed <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> One patient lost her graft to chronic rejection, despite reinfection with the B virus. Four other patients (9 %) developed a chronic carrier state. No long-term follow-up biopsies were available in the remaining two patients. The histologic features associated with dysfunction related to recurrent HBV infection evolved from an acute to chronic phase and were similar to hepatitis B seen in nonallografted livers. Furthermore HBV-related lesions could be separated from rejection using routine histology alone. The only exception to this conclusion was the occurrence of a peculiar HBV-related lesion in two recipients, described herein. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in almost all cases. Hepatic inflammation also was commonly present during HBV disease and consisted mostly of accessory cells and T lymphocytes. Analysis of the effect of major histocompatibility complex matching revealed no clear association between the number of class I or II matches or mismatches and the development, or pattern, of active hepatitis in the allograft. Peculiar pathologic alterations in several of the biopsies and failed allografts after HBV reinfection suggests that, under special circumstances, the B virus may by cytopathic...|$|E

40|$|Recurrence of {{autoimmune}} hepatitis after orthotopic liver transplantation and after reduction in immunosuppressive treatment is {{reported in a}} 43 -year-old man. Diagnosis was based on biological, serological and morphological data, {{as well as on}} a complete biological recovery following steroid resumption. Recurrence was observed only 4 months after transplantation, when an abrupt increase in liver function tests was observed in association with a mainly <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in liver biopsy. Such a histological appearance has been previously described in the case of recurrence after immunosuppressive treatment weaning in non-transplanted patients. In contrast, this histological feature has not been reported in the rare transplanted patients in whom such recurrence has been observed. Thereafter, the evolution of the disease in our patient remained slow, likely dampened by the administration of cyclosporine and azathioprine. Morphological features are detailed, and importance of immunosuppressive therapy in patients transplanted for end-stage {{autoimmune hepatitis}} is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|A {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) chronically infected patient {{developed an}} episode of acute hepatitis {{during the course of}} immunosuppressive therapy given for a lymphoproliferative disease. It was noted that anti-HCV antibody response, seen to be relatively stable during the follow-up, lowered dramatically in coincidence with the hepatocytolytic peak. A diagnostic liver biopsy taken {{at the time of the}} acute phase of hepatitis demonstrated a typical feature of <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> with widespread lymphocytic infiltrates, the predominant type of which expressed CD 8 immunophenotype. Cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs may interfere with hepatitis virus infections. However, at variance from hepatitis B virus infection in which acute liver decompensation develops after withdrawal of chemotherapy in our HCV chronically infected patient it appeared during the course of the treatment, suggesting a different hepatocytolytic mechanism. Although the actual frequency of the phenomenon is presently unknown, this observation seems to indicate that immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents should be used with caution in HCV chronic infection in which cell-mediated immune response seems to play a major role in the production of the liver damag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{report the}} case of a 58 -year-old Caucasian Greek man who {{presented}} with dry cough, fever, bilateral alveolar infiltrates and acute hepatitis. Case presentation After a lung biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with Wegener's granulomatosis. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of anti-proteinase- 3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. A liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of mild non-specific <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and periodic acid-Schiff positive Lafora-like inclusions in a large number of his liver cells. The patient was treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide, which was followed by subsequent remissions of chest X-ray findings and liver function studies. Conclusion What makes this case worth reporting is the coexistence of liver inflammation with a biochemical profile of severe anicteric non-viral, non-drug induced hepatitis coinciding with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. Our paper may be the first report of hepatic involvement in a patient diagnosed with Wegener's granulomatosis. The aetiological link between the two diseases is supported by the reversion of hepatitis after the immunosuppression of Wegener's granulomatosis. We favor the hypothesis that hepatic vasculitis may be the cause of acute hepatocellular necrosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{cases of}} ecstasy related acute liver damage {{referred}} to a specialised liver unit are described. Two patients presented after collapse within six hours of ecstasy ingestion with hyperthermia, hypotension, fitting, and subsequently disseminated intravascular coagulation with rhabdomyolysis together with biochemical evidence of severe hepatic damage. One patient recovered {{and the other with}} evidence of hyperacute liver failure was transplanted but subsequently died, histological examination showing widespread microvesicular fatty change. Four patients presented with acute liver failure without hyperthermia. All four fulfilled criteria for transplantation, one died before a donor organ became available, and two died within one month post-transplantation of overwhelming sepsis. Histological examination showed submassive lobular collapse. Two patients presented with abdominal pain and jaundice and recovered over a period of three weeks; histological examination showed a <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> with cholestasis. Patients developing jaundice or with evidence of hepatic failure particularly encephalopathy and prolongation of the international normalised ratio, or both, whether or not preceded by hyperthermia, should be {{referred to a}} specialised liver unit as liver transplantation probably provides the only chance of recovery...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is {{responsible}} for most cases of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis in multi-transfused children, but has been also implicated {{in at least one}} third of cases without history of parenteral exposure. We have recently evaluated the natural history of chronic hepatitis C in 37 children without underlying systemic diseases. None of the patients had a history of acute hepatitis and only 22 were symptomatic at presentation. Liver histology was consistent with active liver disease of mild to moderate activity in 42 % of cases (one child had cirrhosis) and with persistent or <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in the remaining cases. During a mean follow-up period of 3. 4 +/- 3. 2 years symptoms were rarely observed and none of the patients developed liver failure, but 97 % maintained abnormal alanine-aminotransferase levels. These results suggest that chronic hepatitis C in children, at least in its early stage, is a mild disease infrequently associated with severe liver lesions; however the persistence of liver damage over the years raises questions about the long-term outcome of the illness and about the rationale of antiviral therap...|$|R
40|$|Histology of {{autoimmune}} hepatitis (AIH), chronic active hepatitis, {{is characterized by}} portal inflammation with interface hepatitis. Although the basic histology of AIH {{is similar to that}} of virus-related chronic hepatitis, hepatitic changes are usually prominent in AIH compared with chronic viral hepatitis. Clinicopathological diagnosis of AIH requires exclusion of other causes of liver disease, including hepatitis virus, alcohol, drugs, metabolic disorders, and other autoimmune diseases. At present, some criteria systems considering clinicopathological findings are proposed to categorize patients as having either definite or probably/atypical AIH. Among the pathological items of a simplified AIH scoring system of the International AIH Group, in addition to evident chronic hepatitis with interface hepatitis and hepatic rosette formation, emperipolesis, indicating the close immunological interaction of lymphocytes and hepatocytes, is noted but is sometimes difficult to evaluate. In addition to classical AIH, showing chronic active hepatitis, some AIH patients show a clinically acute hepatitis-like clinical course. These patients have mostly acute exacerbation from chronic active AIH, but acute-onset AIH cases, which histologically exhibit diffuse <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and/or confluent necrosis including perivenular zonal necrosis (zone 3 necrosis, centrizonal necrosis), are also encountered. © 2014 Springer Japan.

40|$|Macrophage {{activating}} syndrome (MAS) {{is a rare}} hematological disorder {{associated with}} uncontrolled systemic T-cell activation. Persistent fever, fatigue and hepatosplenomegaly are frequent clinical manifestations, whereas hyperferritinemia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and cytopenia are key criteria for the diagnosis of MAS. The nature of liver pathology in MAS has been partially elucidated but destructive biliary lesions have been rarely described. This report illustrates four cases of MAS developing marked cholestasis, leading to one case of biliary cirrhosis necessitating liver transplantation. Histologically, liver involvement was characterized in all cases by acute <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> marked hepatocyte apoptosis and small bile duct injury similar to the vanishing bile duct syndrome. Immuno-histological studies showed that the inflammatory changes and bile duct lesions were dominated {{by the presence of}} activated macrophages and T-cells, in particular CD 8 + lymphocytes, and in part NK-cells. These findings suggest that in MAS, various T-cell triggers such as infection, autoimmune disease and malignancy might result in the release of cytokines, which in turn activate macrophages to trigger a systemic acute phase response and local tissue damage. This communication suggests that a macrophage, T- and NK-cell network is operational in the pathogenesis of the cholangiocyte, hepatocyte and sinus endothelial cell damage in MAS...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims Non-alcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) is {{a disorder}} that is histologically characterized by macrovesicular steatosis and <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> with necrosis or ballooning degeneration and fibrosis. NASH {{can range from}} a benign condition to end-stage liver disease. The mechanisms promoting transition from steatosis to NASH appear to involve multiple cellular adaptations to the oxidative stress occurring when fatty acid metabolism is altered. We evaluated the relationship between lipid peroxidation and other oxidative stress biomarkers with changes in expression of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) in human hepatic steatosis ranging from simple steatosis to NASH. Methods HO- 1 expression, lipid peroxidation, ferritin and GSH levels were assayed from liver biopsies obtained from 60 subjects: 35 with NASH, 15 with simple steatosis and 10 controls. Results The HO- 1 expression was significantly increased in NASH patients and the increase reflected {{the severity of the}} disease. A significant correlation was observed between the increased levels of HO- 1 and ferritin, and between the increased levels of HO- 1 and lipid peroxidation. Moreover, NASH patients with lower levels of GSH exhibited higher expression of HO- 1. Conclusions The induction of HO- 1 is an adaptive response against oxidative damage elicited by lipid peroxidation and it may be critical in the progression of the disease. </br...|$|R
40|$|A 60 -year-old {{woman with}} end stage liver {{cirrhosis}} caused by genotype 2 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection received an orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The patient was negative for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and {{positive for the}} anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) prior to and {{one and a half}} months following the OLT. Due to reactivation of hepatitis C, treatment with interferon-alpha and Ribavirin started two months following the OLT and resulted in a sustained virological response. We performed a liver biopsy because a biochemical response was not achieved. Surprisingly, liver pathology showed HBsAg-positive hepatocytes with a <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> feature, which had been negative in the liver biopsy specimen obtained one and a half months post-OLT. High titers of both HBsAg and HBeAg were detected, while anti-HBs antibodies were not found. Tests for IgM anti-hepatitis B core antibody and anti-delta virus antibodies were negative. The serum HBV DNA titer was over 1 × 107 copies/mL. A sequencing analysis showed no mutation in the "a" determinant region, but revealed a mixture of wild and mutant strains at an overlapping region of the S and P genes (S codon 213 (Leu/Ile); P codons 221 (Phe/Tyr) and 222 (Ala/Thr)).

40|$|Lamivudine is a {{nucleoside}} analogue with efficacy in {{the suppression of}} hepatitis B viral (HBV) replication. In a previously reported study, lamivudine was administered to patients with chronic, actively replicating HBV infection who subsequently underwent liver transplantation. Patients became serum HBV DNA-negative in response to lamivudine before transplantation, which was continued in the post-transplant period. Two of four patients surviving the immediate postoperative period developed allograft reinfection 240 and 409 days post-transplant. The strain of the reinfecting virus was analyzed, and a mutation in the YMDD region of the viral polymerase conferring resistance to lamivudine was discovered. The long term follow-up of these two patients is reported. The first patient developed ascites 16. 5 months after allograft reinfection. A transjugular liver biopsy performed 18 months after {{the emergence of the}} lamivudine-resistant strain revealed cirrhosis and <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> without rejection. The gradient between hepatic vein wedged and free pressures was 13 mmHg, consistent with portal hypertension. The second patient, 16 months after allograft reinfection with the lamivudine-resistant strain, is without clinical evidence of portal hypertension, although liver enzymes remain elevated. Both patients were given a trial of famciclovir, which did not significantly suppress HBV viremia. In conclusion, lamivudine-resistant HBV strains with the YMDD mutation may have an aggressive clinical course with rapid progression to cirrhosis. Famciclovir {{did not appear to be}} an effective rescue agent in these two patients...|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} is a necroinflammatory {{liver disease}} of unknown etiology. According to the histology {{the disease is}} characterized by <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> in blood chemistry — increasing the level of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and according to serology, increased levels of autoantibodies and immunoglobulin G. We present to discuss the case of autoimmune hepatitis in a previously healthy 59 -year-old woman with acute elevated levels of total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase. In view of these data differential diagnosis {{has been carried out}} between autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis and jaundice. On examination there were no markers of viral hepatitis A, B, and C, the results of computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde choledochopancreatography hadn’t confirm the mechanical nature of jaundice. A liver biopsy showed the presence of periportal hepatitis and bridging necrosis (lymphomacrophagal infiltration in the portal and periportal areas), the typical feature of autoimmune hepatitis. Methylprednisolone therapy with transition to budesonide leads to a reduction and normalization of total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase. Thus, our description concerns autoimmune hepatitis in a patient of middle age, confirming contemporary statement about prevalence of the disease mainly among women in all age groups. Normalization of serum transaminases activity with the use of budesonide was achieved, which correlates with the data of several studies on the effective therapy of autoimmune hepatitis with budesonide...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Aminotransferase {{levels are}} a {{sensitive}} indicator of liver cell injury and is frequently {{used to identify}} patients with liver diseases such as hepatitis. Both aminotransferases are normally present in serum at low levels, usually less than 30 U per liter. Although these enzymes are present in tissues throughout the body, they are most often elevated in patients with liver diseases and may reflect liver injury. Raised aminotransferase levels of unknown origin are common problem in clinical practice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, the variable most commonly measured to assess hepatic disease, fails to identify many patients with hepatic injury. On the other hand, elevated ALT level doesn't always confirm liver disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to show the most common reasons for elevated aminotransferase levels. Material and methods The study included 27 patients with elevated ALT. All of them were followed-up for six months before liver biopsy was performed. All patients underwent routine laboratory tests and ultrasound of the abdomen. Results We found that four patients had a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), four patients had chronic hepatitis of unknown etiology, two of them had autoimmune hepatitis, four had mild <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (three of them unresolved acute hepatitis, one of them had nodular regenerative hyperplasia), six patients had normal results, and three had no specific changes. Conclusion Elevated ALT level doesn't always mean that there is a liver disease. If aminotransferase levels are persistently more than twice the normal value, a biopsy is recommended. Although results of biopsy are unlikely to lead to a diagnosis or to changes in management, they often provide reassurance to the patient and the physician to exclude serious pathology...|$|R
40|$|Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} disorder {{characterized by}} repeated bacterial and fungal infections. Aside from {{a high incidence of}} liver abscess, little is known about hepatic involvement in CGD. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the spectrum of liver abnormalities seen in CGD. The charts of 194 patients with CGD followed at the NIH were reviewed, with a focus on liver abnormalities. Liver enzyme elevations occurred on at least one occasion in 73 % of patients during a mean of 8. 9 years of follow-up. ALT elevations were generally transient. Although transient alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevations were also common, persistent ALP elevations lasting up to 17. 6 years were seen in 25 % of patients. Liver abscess occurred in 35 % of patients. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity was documented in 15 % of patients but likely occurred more frequently. Hepatomegaly was found in 34 % and splenomegaly in 56 % of patients. Liver histology showed granulomata in 75 % and <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in 90 % of specimens. Venopathy of the portal vein was common (80 %) and associated with splenomegaly. Venopathy of the central vein was also common (63 %) and was associated with the number of abscess episodes. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) was seen in 9 patients, including 6 of 12 autopsy specimens. CONCLUSION: Liver enzyme abnormalities occur frequently in patients with CGD. In addition to liver abscesses and granulomata, drug hepatotoxicity is likely underappreciated. Vascular lesions such as venopathy and [...] to a lesser extent [...] NRH are common. The cause and clinical consequences of venopathy await prospective evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: American Cocker Spaniels are {{predisposed}} to chronic hepatitis. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and histological features of chronic hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels. ANIMALS: Thirteen cases examined from 2003 to 2009. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records were searched for American Cocker Spaniels with chronic liver diseases. History, physical examination, clinicopathologic features, hepatic ultrasonographic findings, hepatic histopathology, and immunohistochemistry were evaluated. RESULTS: The median age was 4. 6 (1. 9 - 10. 7) years. Clinical signs included inappetence (11 / 13), ascites (11 / 13), lethargy (9 / 13), diarrhea (7 / 13), and melena (2 / 13). Only 1 / 13 dogs was jaundiced. Clinicopathological abnormalities were increased liver enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase: 9 / 12, aspartate aminotransferase: 7 / 10, alanine aminotransferase: 6 / 13, alkaline phosphatase: 6 / 13), increased total serum bile acid concentrations (10 / 12), and hypoalbuminemia (10 / 13). The liver had an irregular surface in all dogs and acquired portosystemic collaterals were verified in 11 / 13 dogs by abdominal ultrasound (2), laparoscopy (4), or both (5). Liver histology revealed severe fibrosis and cirrhosis in all cases, subdivided in <b>lobular</b> dissecting <b>hepatitis</b> (7), periportal fibrosis (1), micronodular cirrhosis (3), and macronocular cirrhosis (2). Inflammatory activity was low to mild. Immunohistochemical stains showed ductular proliferation. The {{median survival time}} was 913 (range: 63 - 1981) days. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Hepatitis in Japanese American Cocker Spaniels is clinically silent until an advanced stage and is associated with severe hepatic fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, extensive ductular/putative hepatic progenitor cell proliferation, portal hypertension, and acquired portosystemic collateral shunting, but relatively long survival times. <b>Lobular</b> dissecting <b>hepatitis</b> seems more prevalent than in previously reported cases from other countries.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{proposed}} a new grading and staging system for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which {{takes into account}} the degree of both chronic cholangitis activity (CA) and hepatitic activity (HA) for grading disease activity and that of fibrosis, bile duct loss, and chronic cholestasis for staging. In this study, we validated our new system. METHODS: Using liver biopsy specimens from 166 cases of PBC, chronic cholangitis with mild periductal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, including chronic nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis, and the combined activity of interface <b>hepatitis</b> and <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis</b> were categorized into 4 grades {{on the basis of their}} degree and distribution (CA 0 - 3 and HA 0 - 3, respectively). For staging, because orcein staining was not available in this study, 2 criteria (fibrosis and bile duct loss) were independently scored from 0 to 3 on the basis of their degrees, and a final stage score was created from the sum. RESULTS: Although there was a relatively uniform distribution of CA 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 cases, the cases of HA 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 were distributed as 21 %, 64 %, 13 %, and 3 %, respectively, with a prominent number of cases categorized as having none or mild HA. The distribution of stages 1 to 4 using our system was considerably different from that using the classic system and, importantly, showed a correlation with patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our system revealed that the activities of chronic cholangitis and hepatitis did not correlate with each other in terms of degree and that our staging system properly reflected the outcome of PBC patients. The present study could validate the effectiveness of this new system for characterizing the pathologic condition of PBC. Copyright © 2013 by Lippincott Williams &Wilkins...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing the {{fluorescent}} antibody method for the histologic demonstration of localized γ-globulins, {{we have made}} the following observations (in contradistinction {{to the lack of}} such findings in a variety of normal and pathologic, control kidneys). In systemic lupus erythematosus (a) γ-globulins were localized in the thickened capillary walls, the "wire-loop" lesions, and the so called "hyaline thrombi" in glomeruli; (b) these sites of localization of γ-globulins were correlated to a considerable degree with the pattern of accentuated eosinophilia of the glomeruli, as seen in hematoxylin-eosin sections, or with the pattern of PAS-positive areas in the glomeruli in sections stained with the periodic acid-Schiff reaction; (c) and γ-globulins were localized rarely in large cytoplasmic granules in tubular epithelium and occasionally in glomerular capsular crescents, tubular protein casts, and inflammatory cells, particularly in the cytoplasm of cells identified as immature and mature plasma cells. In nephrotic glomerulonephritis (a) γ-globulins were localized in the glomerular basement membrane and appertaining structures in chronic membranous glomerulonephritis; (b) γ-globulins were apparently localized in the altered mesangium in <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> glomerulonephritis; and (c) in the tubular protein casts, presumably representing abnormal glomerular filtrates, γ-globulins were present in a lesser concentration and other serum proteins in a greater concentration than found in the glomeruli. In positive lupus erythematosus preparations the nuclei of leukocytes, while undergoing transformation and subsequent phagocytosis to form lupus erythematosus cells, were the sites of localization of γ-globulin (presumably the lupus erythematosus factor) whereas in control preparations no nuclear localization of γ-globulin occurred. These observations are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of renal lesions in systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic membranous glomerulonephritis, and amyloidosis...|$|R
40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2003. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 12 - 14). An 8 {{year old}} spayed female Jack Russell Terrier presented {{for evaluation of}} previously diagnosed chronic hepatitis. Physical exam revealed jaundice, hepatomegaly, petechiae, and ecchymoses. Bloodwork showed severely increased liver enzymes, prolonged clotting times, and decreased coagulation inhibitory proteins. ELISA and Western blot were strongly positive for Borrelia infection. A liver Tru-cut biopsy revealed <b>lobular</b> dissecting <b>hepatitis,</b> but stains were negative for the Borrelia organism. Differentials included primary immune-mediated hepatitis, or immune-mediated hepatitis secondary to Borrelia, which has never been documented in the dog. Medical management included doxycycline, dexamethasone, azathioprine, ursodiol, SAMe, vitamin E, plasma, vitamin K, aspirin, and famotidine. The dog responded well to medical therapy with normalization of her liver enzymes and improvement in general attitude over the following months.

40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2004. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 15 - 16). A 17 month old castrated male Cocker Spaniel {{was evaluated}} for inflammatory bowel disease, an undefined hepatopathy and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Preliminary diagnostic testing revealed changes consistent with liver disease and gastrointestinal disease. An abdominal ultrasound showed multiple acquired portosystemic shunts {{in the area}} behind the left kidney and minimal small cystic calculi. Because of the concern for varix formation, an exploratory laparotomy was performed {{in an attempt to}} localize the source of gastrointestinal hemorrhage and to obtain liver biopsies for histopathology. The presence of multiple acquired portosystemic shunts was confirmed during surgery, but a clear source of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was not identified. Histopathologic findings were consistent with <b>lobular</b> dissecting <b>hepatitis,</b> a type of idiopathic hepatic fibrosis seen in young dogs. Clinical findings could be attributed to portal hypertension secondary to diffuse hepatic fibrosis. Despite repeated attempts at therapy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage persisted. The dog was humanely euthanized three weeks after discharge. John F. Randolph, D. V. M., A. C. V. I. M., Dr. Tristan Weinkle, D. V. M...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} factors {{associated}} with liver steatosis in severely obese subjects and to test the potential reversibility of fatty liver after weight loss. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. SUBJECT: 528 obese patients before bariatric surgery and 69 obese subjects of the initial cohort evaluated before and 27 +/- 15 months after gastroplasty. MEASUREMENTS: Fatty deposition (scored as mild, moderate or severe) and inflammatory changes were evaluated in liver biopsies; clinical (body mass index (BMI), age, gender, duration of obesity) and biological (glucose, triglycerides, liver enzymes) parameters were related to histological findings. RESULTS: 74 % of the 528 biopsies showed fatty change, estimated as mild in 41 % of cases, moderate in 32 % and severe in 27 %. The prevalence of steatosis was significantly higher in men than in women (91 % vs 70 %, P = 0. 001) and in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes compared with nondiabetics (89 % vs 69 % P = 0. 001). The severity of the steatosis was associated with BMI (P = 0. 002) {{but not with the}} duration of obesity or the age of the patient. When compared with patients without fatty change, those with liver steatosis had significantly higher fasting plasma glucose (5. 5 mmol/l vs 5. 1 mmol/l, P = 0. 007) and triglycerides (1. 8 mmol/l vs 1. 3 mmol/l, P = 0. 002). Mean serum liver enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (gammaGT) were significantly (P < 0. 001) increased in patients with fatty change but remained within laboratory reference values. In the 69 patients who have been evaluated after a marked weight reduction (- 32 +/- 19 kg), 45 % of the biopsies were considered as normal (vs 13 % before, P < 0. 001) while pure fatty change was still observed in 38 % of the patients (vs 83 % before, P = 0. 001). However, the severity of the steatosis was significantly (P < 0. 001) reduced (mild: 62 % vs 21 %; moderate: 23 % vs 37 %; severe: 15 % vs 42 %). In addition, a significant increase of hepatitis was observed in 26 % of the biopsies (vs 14 % before, P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Liver steatosis in obese subjects is associated with men, diabetic status, BMI, higher fasting glucose and hypertriglyceridaemia. Postgastroplasty weight loss reduces liver steatosis, but seems to increase the incidence of inflammatory <b>lobular</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{validate}} spontaneous chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis in dogs as a potential large animal model for fibrotic liver disease in humans by evaluating their molecular pathophysiology. METHODS: Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) signalling was analysed in liver samples of dogs with acute hepatitis (AH), chronic hepatitis (CH), cirrhosis (CIRR), and a specific form of cirrhosis, <b>lobular</b> dissecting <b>hepatitis</b> (LDH), in comparison with human cirrhotic samples from alcohol abuse (ALC) and hepatitis C (HC). RESULTS: Canine samples were investigated with quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and Western blotting on TGF-beta 1 signalling including Smad 2 / 3 phosphorylation. Immunohistochemistry on collagens I and III was performed. Q-PCR showed an increase in TGF-beta 1 levels and downstream effector gene products in CH, LDH, and CIRR. The same fibrotic diseases also showed an increase in phosphorylated Smad 2 / 3 and a higher deposition of collagens I and III. In contrast, in AH neither active TGF-beta 1 signalling nor collagen deposition was observed. Western blot analysis on human ALC and HC indicated a high similarity with canine samples in TGF-beta 1 expression and Smad 2 / 3 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that fibrosis in spontaneous dog liver diseases is highly comparable to their human counterparts and might serve as models for anti-fibrotic strategies. status: publishe...|$|R
