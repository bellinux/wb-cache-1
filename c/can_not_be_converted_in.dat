40|$|The {{manganese}} {{superoxide dismutase}} from lyposarcoma (LSA-MnSOD) is a tumor protein isolated and sequenced, {{for the first}} time, in human lyposarcoma cells (LSA) in the Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, Cancer Institute of Naples, G. Pascale, by Dr. Aldo Mancini. This protein showed a rapid and effective anti-cancer activity consisting of a selective cytotoxicity on certain human breast cancer cells (MCF- 7), and no cytotoxic effect on normal cells, such as normal human mammary epithelium (MCF- 10) and fibroblasts (MRC- 5). This protein was sequenced and produced as recombinant form (rMnSOD). The rMnSOD demonstrated the ability to enter both normal and cancer cells and to perform antioxidant activity by neutralizing free radicals, turning them into hydrogen peroxide that only normal cells are able to transform into molecular oxygen and water, due to their normal levels of catalase. In cancer cells – by their well known catalase underproduction, up to 10 - 100 times, as compared to normal cells – the peroxide <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> oxygen, so that only cancer cells will reach the threshold of toxicity that will cause apoptotic death. The surprising effect of this molecule is, however, due to its ability, following injection in vivo, to penetrate all cells giving off its antioxidant potential, through its enzymatic activity. Both LSA-MnSOD and the rMnSOD were sequenced and compared to the common mitochondrial form. The difference lies {{in the presence of}} a leader peptide detected only in LSA–MnSOD, thus explaining the unusual characteristic of the protein of entering cells, while the native protein remains confined to the mitochondrial compartment. So the leader peptide has been synthesized (rMnSOD-LP) and injected in vitro and in vivo, thus demonstrating its ability to enter cells. These experiments highlighted its role as a molecular carrier. Further studies about its carrier function were performed by conjugation of this peptide to radioactive 68 Ga and its subsequent injection into animals affected by mammary tumors. PET analysis, performed two hours after injection in animals (dogs and cats), demonstrated internalization of the synthetic construct in the tumor and in its metastasis, thus allowing a more accurate identification in the body. Experiments in progress are demonstrating the ability of the leader peptide to deliver a conjugated cysplatin directly inside the tumor cells (as quantitatively demonstrated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) and delivering cisplatin toxic load. This internalization rapidly leads to cell death in vitro and in vivo. As a further demonstration of the ability of rMnSOD to repair the damage caused by radical excess, its topical formulation has been used to treat animals affected by extended necrotic lesions, which quickly returned to the structural and functional integrity of all tissues affected by necrosis. More recently, a significant reduction of tissue injury from X ray damage was demonstrated by using MnSOD-plasmid/liposome treatments in the protection of murine lung. The latter studies demonstrated that rMnSOD not only exerts radioprotective effect on normal cells, but it is also radiosensitizing for tumor cell...|$|E

50|$|While the {{systemic}} effects of testosterone are both expected and desired in both trans men and female body builders, {{they are generally}} undesirable for most women. Thus, {{one of the most}} pressing questions is whether the clitoris can be enlarged without causing other unwanted virilizing effects. To reduce side effects, many women attempt local topical administration. Anecdotal evidence suggests that DHT (Dihydrotestosterone), a very potent androgen, can effectively be used for this purpose with minimal side effects. No scientific studies have confirmed this effect in female anatomy, but research targeting the treatment of micropenis has found that local application of DHT is very effective at stimulating penile growth in microphalli. Due to the biological similarity between penile and clitoral tissue, significant growth of the clitoris is likely.

40|$|Biomass {{feedstocks}} contain roughly 15 - 30 % lignin, {{a substance}} that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> to fermentable sugars. Hence, most schemes for producing biofuels assume that the lignin coproduct will be utilized as boiler fuel. Yet, the chemical structure of lignin suggests that it will make an excellent high value fuel additive, {{if it can be}} broken down into smaller compounds. From Fiscal year 1997 through Fiscal year 2001, Sandia National Laboratories participated in a cooperative effort with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the University of Utah to develop and scale a base catalyzed depolymerization (BCD) process for lignin conversion. SNL's primary role in the effort was to perform kinetic studies, examine the reaction chemistry, and to develop alternate BCD catalyst systems. This report summarizes the work performed at Sandia during Fiscal Year 1999 through Fiscal Year 2001 with aqueous systems. Work with alcohol based systems is summarized in part 1 of this report. Our study of lignin depolymerization by aqueous NaOH showed that the primary factor governing the extent of lignin conversion is the NaOH:lignin ratio. NaOH concentration is at best a secondary issue. The maximum lignin conversion is achieved at NaOH:lignin mole ratios of 1. 5 - 2. This is consistent with acidic compounds in the depolymerized lignin neutralizing the base catalyst. The addition of CaO to NaOH improves the reaction kinetics, but not the degree of lignin conversion. The combination of Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } and CaO offers a cost saving alternative to NaOH that performs identically to NaOH on a per Na basis. A process where CaO is regenerated from CaCO{sub 3 } could offer further advantages, as could recovering the Na as Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } or NaHCO{sub 3 } by neutralization of the product solution with CO 2. Model compound studies show that two types of reactions involving methoxy substituents on the aromatic ring occur: methyl group migration between phenolic groups (making and breaking ether bonds) and the loss of methyl/methoxy groups from the aromatic ring (destruction of ether linkages). The migration reactions are significantly faster than the demethylation reactions, but ultimately demethylation processes predominates...|$|R

40|$|With {{progressive}} climate change, {{the preservation}} of biodiversity is becoming increasingly important. Only if the gene pool is large enough and requirements of species are diverse, there will be species that can adapt to the changing circumstances. To maintain biodiversity, we must understand {{the consequences of the}} various strategies. Mathematical models of population dynamics could provide prognoses. However, a model that would reproduce and explain the mechanisms behind the diversity of species that we observe experimentally and in nature is still needed. A combination of theoretical models with detailed experiments is needed to test biological processes in models and compare predictions with outcomes in reality. In this thesis, several food webs are modeled and analyzed. Among others, models are formulated of laboratory experiments performed in the Zoological Institute of the University of Cologne. Numerical data of the simulations is in good agreement with the real experimental results. Via numerical simulations it can be demonstrated that few assumptions are necessary to reproduce in a model the sustained oscillations of the population size that experiments show. However, analysis indicates that species "thrown together by chance" <b>are</b> <b>not</b> very likely to survive together over long periods. Even larger food nets do not show significantly different outcomes and prove how extraordinary and complicated natural diversity is. In order to produce such a coexistence of randomly selected species—as the experiment does—models require additional information about biological processes or restrictions on the assumptions. Another explanation for the observed coexistence is a slow extinction that takes longer than the observation time. Simulated species survive a comparable period of time before they die out eventually. Interestingly, it can be stated that the same models allow the survival of several species in equilibrium and thus do not follow the so-called competitive exclusion principle. This state of equilibrium is more fragile, however, to changes in nutrient supply than the oscillating coexistence. Overall, the studies show, that having a diverse system means that population numbers are probably oscillating, {{and on the other hand}} oscillating population numbers stabilize a food web both against demographic noise as well as against changes of the habitat. Model predictions <b>can</b> certainly <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> at their face value into policies for real ecosystems.

The validity of many of these previous studies comes into question due to the experimental designs selected. For this reason, this study has been designed to use a research method which is meant to represent the actual clinical situation more accurately. The optimal experimental design for investigating the dosimetric effect of IV contrast in a clinical situation is the pre-test/post-test design. As current protocol at the research location is to take pre- and post-IV contrast scans, both were available for data analysis. Assessment involved comparing dose calculations on contrast-containing CT scans to non-contrast scans. For each patient entered into this study, a plan was completed using both the non-contrast and contrast CT scans, keeping the monitor units (MUs) delivered constant. Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) data from each plan was collected for analysis. Variables recorded included: lung V 5, 20 and 30, mean lung dose (MLD), spinal cord maximum dose, heterogeneity index, conformity index. Previous researchers have found that the impact of IV contrast on dose calculations in the head and neck region was insignificant. However, significant differences have been found using phantoms and in some small studies performed on other anatomical sites. Many of these studies did not accurately reproduce real clinical situations as they employed experimental methods that forced relative electron densities to represent contrast enhancement on non-contrast CT scans. This limits the extent to which results from these studies can be applied to clinical situations. This study found no significant differences between the plans produced on the contrast scans and non-contrast scans...|$|R
