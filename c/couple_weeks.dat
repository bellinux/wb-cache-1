5|$|As the 1992 Kansas City Chiefs season began, the team's {{first big}} move was {{the signing of}} quarterback Dave Krieg to compete with DeBerg and Vlasic. A <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> after Krieg's signing, DeBerg signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, leaving Vlasic as the primary backup to Krieg. The Chiefs went into {{training}} camp {{and went through the}} preseason with Krieg, Vlasic, and rookie draft pick Matt Blundin. Krieg ended up playing every snap of the season, leaving both Vlasic without a year's worth of playing time as his contract expired. The trading of Joe Montana to the Chiefs put a definitive end to Vlasic's time in Kansas City.|$|E

40|$|We {{took a look}} at the {{irrigation}} methods of strawberry farmers in the Pajaro Valley and ways that they could reduce the amount of water that it takes to produce their strawberries. In many areas the limited amount of water is effecting the production of crops. We believed that in an area that was already practicing the “best ” irrigation method of using drip that we could still find inefficiencies and reduce the amount of water they use. The use of sprinklers during the first <b>couple</b> of <b>weeks</b> seemed like an obvious place to start with reducing the water used. By analyzing the first <b>couple</b> of <b>weeks</b> we found a number of gallons that could be saved. By reducing the amount of water used by simply switching to drip during the first <b>couple</b> of <b>weeks.</b> There was no evidence that the sprinklers during the first <b>couple</b> of <b>weeks</b> actually improved the success...|$|R
5|$|There was a {{sense of}} closure for Grove before the {{beginning}} of the 1945 season, as he was awarded $310 ($ today) in damages for the auto accident in 1941. He held out for a new contract in the off-season, and finally signed with the White Sox a <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> before {{the beginning of the season}} after becoming the last remaining holdout. Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox, leading the team in games pitched (33) and started (30), while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster. He finished the season with 217 pitched innings, a career best four shutouts, a 14–12 record, and a 3.44 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{went through}} knee surgery during the offseason, {{but there was}} still concern about whether he had a future in the NFL. That was set aside when he was {{considered}} to be progressing well in his recovery as of early July 1977. During the Buccaneers' offseason, the quarterbacks on the roster changed entirely, with Dickinson being the only holdover; Gary Huff was now the starter, and Dickinson was fighting for a backup role alongside Mike Boryla and Randy Hedberg. After the Buccaneers lost Boryla and Huff to injuries, the former for the season, Dickinson ended up being the starting quarterback for the team's final preseason game against the Bills. In the game, Dickinson completed 2 of 12 passes for -2yards and was sacked three times in a 176 loss. A week after the game against the Bills, Dickinson was released by the Buccaneers along with four other players. The Buccaneers re-signed him after Huff got injured in late October, but Dickinson was again released a <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> later.|$|E
5|$|The Mighty Ducks {{returned}} Getzlaf to the Hitmen for the 2003–04 season. He recorded 75 {{points in}} just 49 games {{and was named}} to the WHL's first all-star team. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, Getzlaf was again returned to Calgary for his fourth season of junior hockey. He was named team captain, but was briefly stripped of the title by the coaches after earning several misconduct penalties for arguing with the officials. The captaincy was restored after a <b>couple</b> <b>weeks,</b> and Getzlaf moderated his interactions with referees. He also missed time during the season after suffering a concussion {{as a result of a}} hit by Dion Phaneuf of the Red Deer Rebels. Getzlaf finished the regular season with 54 points in 51 games, and after the Hitmen were eliminated from the WHL playoffs, was assigned to the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League (AHL) for their own playoff run. Getzlaf appeared in 10 post-season games for Cincinnati in his professional debut. He recorded one goal and four assists.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Christopher {{was part}} of an optimistic 1945 Athletics team, so much so that coach Earle Mack felt that Christopher, Black, Newsom and Jesse Flores were the best quartet of starting pitchers in the league. He spent most of spring training holding out for a new contract, which was eventually agreed on in the middle of March. He missed the first <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> of the season due to injury, and won his season debut on April 18, a 12-inning shutout against the Senators. He followed that up with a victory over the Boston Red Sox, allowing only one earned run in his first 21 innings of the season. In mid-June, Christopher had won ten games, which not only led the league, but was more than the seven the rest of the Athletics pitching staff had combined. On July 21, Christopher {{was part of}} a 24-inning game against the Tigers that ended in a 1–1 tie; he went 13 innings in the game while Joe Berry pitched the other 11. Although Christopher had a strong start to the season, he struggled during the second half. He lost seven straight games over a two-month period before winning another on August 19 against the Tigers. He finished the year with a 13–13 record and a 3.17 ERA. He was selected to the American League All-Star team, however the game was canceled as a result of World War II.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} viticultural hazards in the Muscadet region is {{winter and spring}} time frost and threat of mildew near harvest. The Melon de Bourgogne has adapted well to these {{condition}} being very frost resistant and capable of ripening early. Harvest usually takes place in mid to late September {{but in recent years}} producers have been experimented with harvesting the grapes several days to a <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> later. The traditional method is to harvest early in order to maintain acidity that is a key characteristic of Muscadet wine. The trend to pick later, and risk the threat of rains and mildew rot, is to give the grapes more time to develop sugars and riper phenols that can impart more fruit notes and complexity to the wine. However, these grapes that are picked later will usually experience a dramatic drop in acidity.|$|E
