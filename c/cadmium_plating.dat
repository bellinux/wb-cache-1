40|$|Following the {{discovery}} of severe corrosion of <b>cadmium</b> <b>plated</b> steel bolts in an underground irrigation system, the corrosivity of the surrounding soil and ground water was assessed using the procedures outlined in the standard DIN 50929. This methodology predicted successfully the strongly aggressive nature of the soil from the irrigation system, which contained sulphate reducing bacteria, although the corrosivity of the ground water was low. An evaluation of alternative bolting materials was conducted using both soil from the irrigation network and soil of lower corrosivity from a university campus in Athens. This has shown that general corrosion rates for screws made from type 316 stainless steel or brass are much lower than those for ferritic steel or similar steel coated with cadmium or zinc.

50|$|The {{original}} Evans balance {{was described}} by Dennis F. Evans in 1973 based on a torsional balance developed in 1937 by Alexander Rankine. Evans used Ticonal bars with <b>cadmium</b> <b>plated</b> mild steel yokes as the magnets, a Johnson-Matthey gold alloy (hence the other name of the balance)for the suspension strip, all glued together with epoxy resin onto a phosphor brown spacer. The tubes were made from NMR tubes and the current came from CdS photocells. This original was modified {{with help from the}} Johnson-Matthey company Two pairs of magnets were glued between the arms of an H-frame. The sample was placed into the gap between one pair of magnets and a small coil in the gap between the second pair of magnets. This entire construction pivoted horizontally around a torsion strip. When a sample tube was placed between the first pair of magnets, the torsional force was restored by the current passed through the coil between the second pair of magnets, giving a reading on a display instead of a Helipot (as was used in the original).|$|R
50|$|Galvanization {{consists}} of an application on the object to be protected of a layer of metallic zinc by either hot-dip galvanizing or electroplating. Zinc is traditionally used because it is cheap, adheres well to steel, and provides cathodic protection to the steel surface in case of damage of the zinc layer. In more corrosive environments (such as salt water), <b>cadmium</b> <b>plating</b> is preferred. Galvanization often fails at seams, holes, and joints where there are gaps in the coating. In these cases, the coating still provides some partial cathodic protection to iron, by acting as a galvanic anode and corroding itself instead of the underlying protected metal. The protective zinc layer is consumed by this action, and thus galvanization provides protection only for a limited period of time.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{that contain}} {{depleted}} uranium trim weights for stabilizing wings and control surfaces (such as the Boeing 747-100) may contain between 400 and 1,500 kg of DU. This application is controversial because the DU might enter the environment if the aircraft crashes. The metal can also oxidize {{to a fine}} powder in a fire. Its use has been phased out in many newer aircraft. Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas discontinued using DU counterweights in the 1980s. Depleted uranium was released during the crash of El Al Flight 1862 on 4 October 1992, in which 152 kg was lost, but a case study {{concluded that there was}} no evidence to link depleted uranium from the plane to any health problems.

5000|$|Drain rods are {{plumbing}} equipment used {{to attempt to}} unblock drains and sewers. The set normally consists of several stiff, but flexible, rods, each approximately one meter long, which may be screwed together end-to-end. The material is often polypropylene heavy gauge tubing. Jointing of the plastic to metal is done in hydraulic presses and these joints are the achilles heel of this rod type. Often, when subjected to force, the joint breaks. Better quality ends have securing pins through the differing materials. More expensive rods are high tensile steel. End connections are often brass or steel, the better steel type having <b>cadmium</b> <b>plating</b> for corrosion resistance. Two types of threaded end can be purchased. Cheaper ones simply screw together, male to female but have the disadvantage of needing one-way rotation in use to prevent unscrewing. Better quality rods have their ends formed into a square peg, mating in a matching square hole in the adjacent rod. A captive threaded nut then screw locks both lengths together making a firm joint. A spanner tightens the joint firmly.|$|E

40|$|The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{needs to}} enhance its {{capabilities}} for safeguarding {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) stored in dry cask storage facilities and for maintaining persistent continuity of knowledge (CoK) about it. The current safeguards approach relies heavily upon containment and surveillance measures, where seals are placed {{inside and outside the}} dry cask. The disadvantage of this approach is that, if a seal is broken, no method currently exists to verify the dry cask content other than opening it and checking the internal seal and the SNF inside. This is a costly and difficult activity. Thus other measures need to be developed. This study focused on the development of a remote monitoring system (RMS) for dry cask storage which is capable of detecting neutron and gamma radiation emitted by the SNF and the signal thus generated can then be continually transmitted to the IAEA to maintain the CoK about the dry cask content. The remote option was chosen after reviewing the current IAEA needs. A computational approach was used to develop the proposed RMS. Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code (MCNP) was employed to develop a dry cask model with 32 SNF assemblies inside. The ORIGEN-ARP, fuel burn-up and depletion code, was used to generate a radiation source-term. A series of MCNP simulations were performed to investigate the neutron and gamma flux behavior inside the dry cask. The results of these simulations aided the design of the RMS and determination of the optimal location for its components. The RMS was placed inside the dry cask {{on the top of the}} multi-purpose canister (MPC). The final conceptual design of the RMS included two fission chambers (to detect neutrons) and one ionization chamber (to detect gamma radiation) enclosed in a polyethylene box with a thin <b>cadmium</b> <b>plate</b> inside, so the sequence of layers starting from the MPC lid was: polyethylene bottom layer, <b>cadmium</b> <b>plate,</b> chambers enclosed in polyethylene and polyethylene layer on top. Such configuration provided a suppression effect for thermal neutron flux coming from the bottom SNF assemblies and made system more sensitive to the opening of the dry cask lid and removal of SNF assemblies from the peripheral MPC cells. The proposed RMS design was tested through diversion analysis. The fission chamber unit design was successfully able to detect all the SNF diversion scenarios studied. The ionization chambers were able to detect only removal of SNF assemblies located just below it. However, the ionization chamber was found to be able to identify the opening of the dry cask lid through reduction in signal whenever the lid was opened. Therefore, the ionization chamber was kept in the RMS design to provide secondary confirmation for the detection of dry cask lid opening...|$|R

The effects of bath composition and pH were studied and compared with results for electrodeposited cadmium and zincÃ¢Â Â 10 %nickel. It was found that zincÃ¢Â Â 1 %cobalt alloy coatings caused serious hydrogen embrittlement (EI 0. 63); almost as severe as that of cadmium (EI 0. 78).
