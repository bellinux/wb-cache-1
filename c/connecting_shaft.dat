These criteria resulted in terminal connections at Shafts D, 5A and W, respectively, and definition of the general alignment of the tunnel facility. Additional major connections to existing MWRA transmission facilities resulted in Shaft E, Shaft L, Shaft NW and Shaft NE.

40|$|The {{epicyclic}} gear dynamics program was expanded {{to add the}} option of evaluating the tooth pair dynamics for two {{epicyclic gear}} stages with peripheral components. This was a practical extension to the program as multiple gear stages are often used for speed reduction, space, weight, and/or auxiliary units. The option was developed for either stage to be a basic planetary, star, single external-external mesh, or single external-internal mesh. The two stage system allows for modeling of the peripherals with an input mass and shaft, an output mass and shaft, and a <b>connecting</b> <b>shaft.</b> Execution of the initial test case indicated an instability in the solution with the tooth paid loads growing to excessive magnitudes.

A transmission housing envelops two epicyclic gear assemblies, and has shafts extending from it. One shaft {{is attached to a}} sun gear within the first epicyclic gear assembly. Planet gears are held symmetrically about the sun gear by a planet gear carrier and are in mesh with both the sun gear and a ring gear. Two unidirectional clutches restrict rotation of the first planet gear carrier and ring gear to one direction. A <b>connecting</b> <b>shaft</b> drives a second sun gear at the same speed and direction as the first planet gear carrier while a connecting portion drives a second planet gear carrier at the same speed and direction as the first ring gear.

The slider crank mechanism is simulated in ADAMS software to observe {{the response of the}} slider block and the reaction forces at joint R 2 (joint between crank shaft and connecting rod). The dynamic analysis has been performed by applying moment of 4. 2 Nm at joint R 1 (the revolute joint between <b>connecting</b> <b>shaft</b> and connecting plate). The applied moment is removed by imposing rotational motion at joint R 1 with angular velocity of 6 rad/sec to perform dynamic analysis. These simulations were performed with different time steps and durations. The friction was assumed to be negligible during these simulations. As a result of this work, the longitudinal response of the slider block is observed with applied moment as well as slider block response along with reaction forces at joint R 2 is investigated in case of imposed rotational motion. presents a multibody dynamics approach that uses a simulation of crank-slider mechanism in ADAMS software [5].

40|$|The multi-piston axial {{reciprocating}} compressor using the Sanderson-Rocker Arm Motion (S-RAM) mechanism {{is expected to}} have high volumetric efficiencies due to the application of a new type of seal to prevent the in-cylinder refrigeration gas leaking through the clearance between piston and cylinder wall. The stroke of the compressor can be controlled by adjusting the inclination angle between the <b>connecting</b> <b>shaft</b> and machine driving shaft. Â This allows the control of the delivered refrigerant mass flow rate to match the capacity requirement in the field. A comprehensive simulation model for a prototype {{reciprocating compressor}} using the S-RAM mechanism has been developed. The natural refrigerant carbon dioxide (CO 2) is used as the working fluid. The comprehensive model is comprised of a kinematics model, compression process model, dynamics model and an overall energy balance model. In the kinematics model, the movement of the piston is given including its displacement, velocity and acceleration. It is found that the moving path of the center of the ball in the ball-socket joint is moving around a corresponding cylinder centerline with a â€˜figure 8 â€™ motion instead of moving along the cylinder centerline. In the compression process model, the system of governing equations is solved, which incorporates a valve sub-model, leakage sub-model and gas pulsation sub-model. The classical 4 th order Runge-Kutta method and Broydenâ€™s method are employed to solve the non-linear system of equations to find the in-cylinder refrigerant state (temperature, pressure) at each rotational angle of the machine driving shaft. The variations of suction and discharge valve movements with respect to driving shaft rotational angle are also given. The values of the cylinder wall temperature, the actual suction and discharge temperatures in the connecting pipes are required to initiate the solving of the compression process model. These temperatures are solved simultaneously by incorporating the overall energy balance model with the compression process model. A lumped temperature assumption is employed in the overall energy balance model to assume there is no temperature gradient in each compressor component at steady-state. The dynamics model, which focuses on the frictional power loss, uses the in-cylinder refrigerant pressure determined from the solution of the compression process model. ...|$|E
40|$|The multi-piston axial {{reciprocating}} compressor using the Sanderson-Rocker Arm Motion (S-RAM) mechanism {{is expected to}} have less leakage from the cylinder to the shell space due to the vertical motion of the piston assembly in the cylinder. The main frictional power loss is located at the ball-socket joints connecting the piston with the wobble plate of the S-RAM mechanism. The stroke of the compressor can be changed by altering the inclined angle between the <b>connecting</b> <b>shaft</b> and machine driving shaft, to change the delivered refrigerant mass flow rate to match the capacity requirement in industry. ^ A comprehensive simulation model for a prototype {{reciprocating compressor}} using the S-RAM mechanism has been developed. The natural refrigerant carbon dioxide (CO 2) is used as the working fluid. The comprehensive model is comprised of a kinematics model, compression process model, dynamics model and an overall energy balance model. In the kinematics model, the movement of the piston is given including its displacement, velocity and acceleration. It is found that the moving path of the center of the ball in the ball-socket joint is moving around a corresponding cylinder centerline with a ‘figure 8 ’ motion instead of moving along the cylinder centerline. In the compression process model, the system of governing equations is solved, which incorporates a valve sub-model and a leakage sub-model. The variable step size RKF 45 method and Broyden’s method are employed to solve the non-linear system of equations to find the in-cylinder refrigerant state (instantaneous temperature and pressure) at each rotational angle of the machine driving shaft. The variations of suction and discharge valve movements with respect to driving shaft rotational angle are also given. The values of the cylinder wall temperature, the actual suction and discharge temperatures in the connecting pipes are required to initiate the solving of the compression process model. These temperatures are solved simultaneously by incorporating the overall energy balance model with the compression process model. A lumped temperature assumption is employed in the overall energy balance model to assume there is no temperature gradient in each compressor component at steady-state. The dynamics model, which focuses on the frictional power loss, runs based on the in-cylinder refrigerant pressure determined in the solution of the compression process model. ^ The presented modeling methodology is validated by modeling a conventional reciprocating piston compressor instead of the S-RAM compressor since there are no test data available for the prototype S-RAM compressor. The simulation model was updated to predict the performance of a conventional reciprocating compressor. Required modifications are made to account for the difference between these two compressors. The simulation results are validated using test data obtained from a hot-gas bypass test stand and the data from the published compressor map. ^ Using this validated methodology, the simulation results for the S-RAM compressor are given. Moreover, the effects of different parameters on the compressor performance are investigated in the parametric studies (such as the effect of the valve spring stiffness and the effect of stroke-to-bore ratio) so that proper parameters are chosen to optimize the compressor. ...|$|E
