40|$|The {{effects of}} holes and notches on the fatigue {{life of an}} {{advanced}} SylramicTM/SiC composite at 815 C have been examined. At this temperature, fracture occurs by an oxidative embrittlement mechanism, common to most SiC-based composites. In unnotched specimens, embrittlement is manifested at stresses above the matrix <b>cracking</b> <b>limit,</b> mc, leading to fracture following relatively short exposure times (100 h). As a consequence, a fatigue threshold is obtained at a stress, th mc. This threshold {{is due to the}} absence of an easy path for oxygen ingress when matrix cracks are not present. In center-hole specimens, an analogous threshold is obtained, at a stress, th mc=ke, where ke is the elastic stress concentration factor (= 2. 5). That is, once the <b>cracking</b> <b>limit</b> is exceeded at the hole edge, embrittlement and fracture ensue. The threshold stress for center-notch specimens with stress con-centration ke 7 is numerically {{similar to that of the}} center-hole specimens with ke 2 : 5, indicating some tolerance to local stress levels above the global matrix <b>cracking</b> <b>limit</b> in sharply notched geometries. Non-linear finite-element calculations of the stresses in the center-hole and center-notch specimens are used to infer the local conditions associated with the threshold. A key result is that the damage tolerance and notch insensitivity normally associated with inelastic straining cannot be exploited at temperatures at which the embrittlement mechanism operates. The implication is that composite structures with holes and notches must be designe...|$|E

The necessary condition of the <b>crack</b> tip <b>limit</b> equilibrium is the equality of the energy release rate and the rate of the energy dissipation by the bonds (the first condition of fracture).

The sources of uncertainty can be classified as: (1) inalienable spatial and fleeting fluctuation; (2) estimation and observing blunders; (3) demonstrating vulnerability; (4) load and stresses vulnerability (Brown 2012). In geotechnical engineering it is perceived that stone disfigurement is imperative in deciding the advancement of characteristic structures and structural highlights.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, an {{increasing}} number of integral bridges have been built. This is justified by the various advantages of integral bridges in comparison with standard bridges equipped with expansion joints and bearings. In particular, integral bridges require less maintenance because they do not have mechanical elements and they have an enhanced structural performance because of the frame action and contribution to the stiffness of the embankment at the abutments. However, the structural behaviour of integral bridges is at present not fully understood. This is due to the complexity of the complete system, which must be studied considering the soil-structure interaction. Piers monolithically connected to the bridge deck undergo large displacements caused by creep, shrinkage and temperature effects. This paper investigates the structural behaviour of piers of integral bridges considering the interaction between the foundations of the piers and the surrounding soil.

40|$|Shielding {{interaction}} effects of two parallel edge cracks in finite thickness plates subjected to remote tension load is analyzed using a developed {{finite element analysis}} program. In the present study, the <b>crack</b> interaction <b>limit</b> is evaluated based on the fitness of service (FFS) code, and focus {{is given to the}} weak crack interaction region as the crack interval exceeds the length of cracks (b > a). Crack interaction factors are evaluated based on stress intensity factors (SIFs) for Mode I SIFs using a displacement extrapolation technique. Parametric studies involved a wide range of crack-to-width (0. 05 ≤ a/W ≤ 0. 5) and crack interval ratios (b/a > 1). For validation, crack interaction factors are compared with single edge crack SIFs as a state of zero interaction. Within the considered range of parameters, the proposed numerical evaluation used to predict the crack interaction factor reduces the error of existing analytical solution from 1. 92 % to 0. 97 % at higher a/W. In reference to FFS codes, the small discrepancy in the prediction of the crack interaction factor validates the reliability of the numerical model to predict <b>crack</b> interaction <b>limits</b> under shielding {{interaction effects}}.

Secondly we investigate a condition in which artificial defects (drilled hole, FIB notch) {{can be used as a}} <b>crack</b> for fatigue <b>limit</b> evaluation. To achieve the aim, the growth behaviors and the non-propagating crack sizes of small fatigue cracks initiated from a FIB notch and a drilled hole are carefully compared with those of an annealed fatigue crack which imitates an ideally sharp crack. The results show that a FIB notch can be used as a <b>crack</b> for fatigue <b>limit</b> evaluation under some conditions. The results also show that the condition which controls the applicability of an artificial defect as an ideal <b>crack</b> for fatigue <b>limit</b> evaluation is strongly dependent on the relation between (i) the length of a non-propagating fatigue crack and (ii) the crack length when the small fatigue crack growth behaviors from an artificial defect and an ideal pre-crack become almost the same.

For a given dwell time and temperature-internal pressure combination, fatigue life is calculated using the mechanistic fatigue model (MFM) presented. In addition, the influence of pipe wall thickness is also examined. The MFM uses Tresca strain range for initiation and Rankine strain range to account for crack growth rate up to a <b>crack</b> <b>limiting</b> length. The results showed that fatigue life was generally lower for a given load combination in the thinner pipe considered given its smaller surface area compared to the thicker pipe. This led to higher plastic strains and consequently, faster crack growth rates. Also, dwell time influences fatigue life with longer dwell times {{found to be more}} damaging. However, the influence of dwell time is tightly coupled with pipe wall thickness as it determines the nature of the thermal gradients developed...|$|R

It was found that their limit characteristics of ductile crack initiation for materials used were different {{in the case of}} using a conventional method based on stress triaxiality factor and equivalent plastic strain. It is considered that from cross section observations, ductile crack initiation for steels is caused by shear fracture between grown voids at the center of specimen. Therefore, Mohr-Coulomb fracture criterion, which is related to normal stress and shear stress, was applied to the evaluation of steels. As a result, it was found that strain hardening exponent of the materials could be a new parameter.

40|$|Summary A multi-scale bridged crack {{model for}} the {{evaluation}} of fracture and strength parameters of interfaces with cracks is proposed. We suppose that distributed nonlinear bonds link the crack surfaces in some zones starting from the crack tips. The sizes of these zones are not assumed to be small as compared to the crack length on every bridging level. The system of singular integral-differential equations is derived for normal and shear bond stresses evaluation. Two fracture criterions of quasistatic crack growth are considered. The first condition in the both criterions is the same: it is the condition of the bond limit stretching or the limit strain at the trailing edge of the bridged zone. Two types of the second condition of fracture is considered: a) the force condition which is the condition for the critical stress intensity factor and b) the proposed energetic condition based on the equality of the values of the strain energy release rate and the energy dissipation by the bonds at the <b>crack</b> <b>limit</b> equilibrium state.

The model clay liner material has been selected in such a way that it envelopes the material characteristics of the clay liners, which are used for constructing an impermeable barrier in a lining system.
