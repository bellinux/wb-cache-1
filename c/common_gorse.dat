60|$|Such {{cases as}} this afford an {{excellent}} illustration of those changes of distribution, dependent probably on recent changes of climate, {{which may have}} led to the restriction of certain species to our islands. For should any change of climate lead to the extinction of the species in South Europe, where it is far less abundant than with us, we should have a common and wide-spread species entirely restricted to our islands. Other species feed in the larva state on our <b>common</b> <b>gorse,</b> a plant found only in limited portions of Western and Southern Europe; and the presence of this plant in a mild and insular climate such as ours may well be supposed to have led to the preservation of some of the numerous species which are or have been dependent on it. Since the first edition was {347} published many new British species have been discovered, while some of the supposed peculiar species have been found on the continent.

500|$|Kersal Moor {{is one of}} {{the many}} fluvioglacial ridges that formed along the Irwell Valley during the melting of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age. Typically for this type of landform, the subsoil is {{composed}} of sand mixed with coarse gravel. The 19th century botanist Richard Buxton described this as [...] "Mr. E.W. Binney's drift deposit no.2... a deposit of sharp forest sand, parted with layers of gravel composed of Azoic, Palaeozoic and Triassic rocks, well rounded, parted with layers of fine sand, and having every appearance of a regular deposit by water." [...] This deposit is overlaid with a thin topsoil supporting a range of mosses, heathers, grasses, ferns, <b>common</b> broom, <b>gorse</b> and some trees, which are predominantly oak with some rowan, cherry and other broadleaved species. The land to the south is elevated, rising to a high point towards the south-west. From this elevated position there are views across Manchester to the Derbyshire hills in the south, to the Pennines in the north east and across the Irwell Valley and Salford in the west. The land falls away to the north, ending with two drumlin-shaped hills on the northern edge, which were probably formed by sediment from the meltwater of the receding glaciers, in a process known as sedimentary fluting. The moor is criss-crossed with footpaths, many of which cut through to the sand and gravel below. Singleton Brook, to the north of the moor, denotes the boundary between Salford and Prestwich.|$|R
40|$|The {{dominant}} native {{woody species}} forming early successional vegetation on formerly forested sites in lowland New Zealand were kānuka (Kunzea ericoides) and mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium) (Myrtaceae). These {{have been replaced}} extensively by gorse (Ulex europaeus, Fabaceae), a naturalised species in New Zealand. Because gorse typically gives way to native broadleaved (angiosperm) forest in about 30 years, it is often considered desirable for facilitating native forest restoration. We tested three hypotheses, derived from the New Zealand literature, on gorse and kānuka: (1) kānuka stands have a different species composition and greater species richness than gorse stands at comparable successional stages; (2) differences between gorse and kānuka stands do not lessen over time; and (3) several native plant taxa are absent from or less <b>common</b> in <b>gorse</b> than in kānuka stands. We sampled 48 scrub or low-forest sites in two regions, Wellington and Nelson. Sites were classified into one of four predefined categories – young gorse, young kānuka, old gorse, old kānuka – based on canopy height of the succession and the dominant early-successional woody species. Few characteristics of the sites and surrounding landscapes differed significantly among site categories, and none consistently across regions. The vegetation composition of gorse and kānuka and their immediate successors differed in both regions, mainly in native woody species. Species richness was often lower in gorse and there were fewer smallleaved shrubs and orchids in gorse. Persistent differences at the older sites suggest the successional trajectories will not converge in the immediate future; gorse leads to different forest from that developed through kānuka. Gorse-dominated succession is therefore not a direct substitute for native successions. We suggest areas of early native succession should be preserved, and initiated in landscapes where successions are dominated by gorse or other naturalised shrubs...|$|R
6000|$|... "THEY" [...] One view {{called me}} to another; one hill top to its fellow, half across the county, and since I could answer at no more trouble than the {{snapping}} forward of a lever, I let the country flow under my wheels. The orchid- studded flats of the East {{gave way to the}} thyme, ilex, and grey grass of the Downs; these again to the rich cornland and fig-trees of the lower coast, where you carry the beat of the tide on your left hand for fifteen level miles; and when at last I turned inland through a huddle of rounded hills and woods I had run myself clean out of my known marks. Beyond that precise hamlet which stands godmother to the capital of the United States, I found hidden villages where bees, the only things awake, boomed in eighty-foot lindens that overhung grey Norman churches; miraculous brooks diving under stone bridges built for heavier traffic than would ever vex them again; tithe-barns larger than their churches, and an old smithy that cried out aloud how it had once been a hall of the Knights of the Temple. Gipsies I found on a <b>common</b> where the <b>gorse,</b> bracken, and heath fought it out together up a mile of Roman road; and a little farther on I disturbed a red fox rolling dog-fashion in the naked sunlight.|$|R

50|$|Biological control {{programs}} for gorse in New Zealand have existed since {{the introduction of}} the gorse seed weevil (Exapion ulicis) in 1928. Biological pest control is the use of natural mechanisms such as predation to limit the growth and prevalence of a pest. The early research into the biological control of <b>common</b> <b>gorse</b> in New Zealand was among the first of such programs worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of grazing on the cliffs above the bay, the native chalk {{ecosystem}} has thrived. Atop the cliffs, the Island's county flower, the pyramidal orchid, can be encountered, while the rare Glanville fritillary butterfly also lives in large numbers that are supported by the native flowers. Other hardy plants such as <b>common</b> <b>gorse</b> bushes and wild cabbage can also be found.|$|E
50|$|The {{eastern side}} of the site is {{protected}} from the prevailing westerly winds on the Atlantic meaning that less hardy plants are able to grow in areas of cliff scrub. Species include blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) <b>common</b> <b>gorse</b> (Ulex europaeus), wild privet (Ligustrum vulgare) as well as more woodland plants of common dog-violet (Viola riviniana), common honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum), hart's-tongue (Phyllitis scolopendrium) and red campion (Silene dioica).|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>gorse,</b> {{originally}} a hedge plant in Britain, {{was introduced to}} New Zealand for the same purpose. Like the Monterey pine, it has shown a favour to its new climate. It is, however, regarded as a noxious plant that threatens to obliterate native plants {{in much of the}} country and is hence routinely eradicated, though it can also provide a nursery environment for native plants to reestablish themselves.|$|E
50|$|In {{many parts}} of Britain, {{especially}} Devon and Cornwall where it is particularly prevalent on the moors, the expression “kissing's out of fashion when the gorse is out of blossom” is a traditional jest as <b>common</b> <b>gorse</b> {{is thought to be}} always in bloom. Gorse, or rather furze as it was usually known in the Westcountry, sprigs were a traditional May day gift between young lovers in the region, when in fact the blossom is at its peak.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Common</b> <b>gorse</b> flowers {{a little}} in late autumn and through the winter, coming into flower most {{strongly}} in spring. Western gorse and dwarf furze flower in late summer (August-September in Ireland and Great Britain). Between the different species, some gorse is almost always in flower, hence the old country phrase: [...] "When gorse is out of blossom, kissing's out of fashion". Gorse flowers have a distinctive coconut scent, experienced very strongly by some individuals, but weakly by others.|$|E
50|$|Aside from grasses, {{the most}} common plants found in the Mournes are heathers and gorse. Of the former, three species are found: the cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), the bell heather (Erica cinerea), and the ling (Calluna vulgaris). Of the latter, two species: <b>common</b> <b>gorse</b> (Ulex europaeus) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). Other plants which grow in the area are: bog cotton, roseroot (Rhodiola rosea), {{harebell}} (Campanula rotundifolia), marsh St John's wort, wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum), wood sorrel and heath spotted orchids.|$|E
50|$|Among scarce plants {{found on}} Sand Point are smallflower buttercup, and honewort. The range of soils {{at the site}} support various flora and fauna.

50|$|Within Cornwall, Western Rustwort is {{generally}} found growing on micaceous or clay waste substrates which are flat or gently sloping.

It disappeared from at least six Cornish sites between 1971 and 2005 due to shading from <b>Common</b> <b>Gorse</b> Ulex europaeus and Bramble Rubus fruticosus agg.|$|E
50|$|In {{the areas}} of damp heath, the {{predominant}} species when the site was designated an SSSI in 1963 were common heather (Calluna vulgaris), cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), <b>common</b> <b>gorse</b> (Ulex europaeus), western gorse (U. gallii) and purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea).

50|$|The {{most widely}} {{familiar}} species is <b>common</b> <b>gorse</b> (Ulex europaeus), the only species native {{to much of}} western Europe, where it grows in sunny sites, usually on dry, sandy soils. It is also the largest species, reaching 2 - 3 m in height; this compares with typically 20 - 40 cm for western gorse (Ulex gallii). This latter species is characteristic of highly exposed Atlantic coastal heathland and montane habitats. In {{the eastern part of}} Great Britain, dwarf furze (Ulex minor) replaces western gorse. Ulex minor grows only about 30 cm tall, a habit characteristic of sandy lowland heathland.|$|E
5000|$|Dartford warblers first breed {{when they}} are one year old. They are usually monogamous and the pair bond can persist {{from one year to}} the next. The male {{sometimes}} builds several simple nests (cock nests) of which one is chosen by the female, but it is more usual for both birds to participate in constructing the breeding nest. In southern England the birds breed on heathlands, sometimes near the coast, and nest in either <b>common</b> <b>gorse</b> (Ulex europaeus) or common heather (Calluna vulgaris). The compact cup-shaped nest is located in dense bushes, usually within 60 cm of the ground. It is formed mainly of grasses and is lined with a layer of finer material that can include thin roots and feathers. [...] The eggs are laid from early April in southern France and Spain, and from mid-April in southern England. The clutch is typically 3-5 eggs which are smooth and glossy, with a white or occasionally pale green ground and marked with brown speckles which are sometimes concentrated at the larger end. The average size of an egg is 17 x 13 mm with a weight of 1.4 g of which 6 percent is shell. The eggs are incubated for 12-14 days mainly by the female. The chicks are fed arthropods by both parents. The nestlings fledge 10-14 days after hatching and are then fed by their parents for a further two weeks. Usually two and occasionally three broods are raised in a year.|$|E
