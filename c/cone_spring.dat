50|$|Viewed as a whole, the Kayenta {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} from the geologic formations above and below it. It is unlike them in composition, color, manner of bedding, and sedimentary history. Obviously the conditions of sedimentation changed in passing from the Wingate Sandstone formation to the Kayenta and from the Kayenta to the Navajo sandstone, but the nature and regional significance of the changes have not been determined. In some measured sections the transition from Wingate to Kayenta is gradual; the material in the basal Kayenta, beds {{seems to have been}} derived from the Wingate immediately below and redeposited with only the discordance characteristic of fluviatile sediments. But in many sections the contact between the two formations is unconformable; the basal Kayenta consists of conglomerate and lenticular sandstone that fills depressions eroded in the underlying beds. In Moqui Canyon near Red <b>Cone</b> <b>Spring</b> nearly 10 ft of Kayenta limestone conglomerate rests in a long meandering valley cut in Wingate. Likewise, the contact between the Kayenta and the Navajo in places seems to be gradational, but generally a thin jumbled mass of sandstone and shales, chunks of shale and limestone, mud balls, and concretions of lime and iron, lies {{at the base of the}} fine-grained, cross bedded Navajo. Mud cracks, a few ripple marks, and incipient drainage channels were observed in the topmost bed of the Kayenta on Red Rock Plateau; and in west Glen Canyon, wide sand-filled cracks appear at the horizon. These features indicate that, in places at least, the Wingate and Kayenta were exposed to erosion before their overlying geologic formations were deposited, are it may be that the range in thickness of the Kayenta thus in part (is) accounted for.|$|E

40|$|From the {{algebraic}} perspective, {{the basic}} {{concept of the}} classical Leontief I-O (Input-Output) analysis lies in the distinction between two principal kinds of coefficient matrices: 2 ̆ 2 technical 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 structural. 2 ̆ 2 It is not universally recognized that neither of these expresses exactly the total flow (total relationships) between elements of an I-O system. Without knowledge of total flow it has been impossible to answer correctly many important theory and policy questions. In this dissertation, an initial step is taken {{to bridge the gap}} by providing a 2 ̆ 2 third choice. 2 ̆ 2 This is another coefficient (and flow) matrix that quantifies the total flow and thereby depicts adequately the full complexity of I-O relations. It is shown that total flow analysis is a useful tool in dealing with various I-O kinds of problems in economics, ecology, and other disciplines. ^ The dissertation is composed of two parts. ^ Part One: Defining Total Flow in an Ecosystem Input-Output Model. The concept of total flow is introduced. Total flow analysis is treated as a subdomain of ecological flow analysis. Its basic notions are presented and illustrated with empirical data for a particular small aquatic ecosystem [...] that of <b>Cone</b> <b>Spring.</b> The applicability of the total flow concept to specific ecology problems (such as trophic relationships, cycling of nutrients, and others) is indicated. ^ Part Two: Measuring Connectedness of Input-Output Models. The concept of scalar measures of the degree of internal connectedness in I-O models is considered. A number of measures, drawn from the economic and the ecological I-O literatures, are examined. It is shown that none of the measures represent connectedness adequately. The concept of the total flow is reviewed and applied as a basis for calculation of several indexes, such as the average total flow coefficient and the average internal multiplier, both of which are sensitive to (1) number, (2) diversity and (3) volume of I-O linkages and express appropriately the overall connectedness. ...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceGeologyMatthew E. BruesekeThe Upper Wind River Basin (UWRB) {{is located}} in north-central Wyoming, {{to the south of}} the Yellowstone National Park {{boundary}} and east of Jackson Hole. Both Lava Mountain and Spring Mountain are Quaternary volcanoes in the UWRB. Lava Mountain is a shield volcano composed of 26 separate lavas capped by a scoria <b>cone.</b> <b>Spring</b> Mountain is located about ~ 36 km east of Lava Mountain, north of Dubois, WY, where eruptions of basalt cut through Paleocene and Eocene strata. The goal of this study aims to reconstruct the petrogenesis of magmas erupted at both volcanoes using geochemical, petrographic, and isotopic analyses. Important local events in geologic history played a large {{role in the development of}} the UWRB. This includes a long history of ancient and Cenozoic subduction, regional extension, and also the migration of the North American plate over the Yellowstone hotspot. The few previous studies on Lava Mountain claim the rocks are mafic in composition, however this was based solely on reconnaissance geological mapping. Geochemical evidence presented in this thesis show Lava Mountain rocks range from basaltic andesite to dacite. Basaltic andesite and dacite are interstratified at the base until approximately 2774 m; the rest of the volcano is andesite. All Lava Mountain samples are largely aphanitic and crystal-poor. Conversely, at Spring Mountain, localized normal faulting controls the location of eruptions of olivine-rich basalt. Petrographic analysis for both Lava Mountain and Spring Mountain display a range of evidence for open system processes, including sieved and/or resorbed pyroxenes, olivines and feldspars, as well as xenocrysts that suggest an influence from crustal assimilation. A petrogenetic model is introduced that discusses how Lava Mountain magma production occurred via fractional crystallization of basalt to dacite, then magma mixing of basaltic andesite and dacite, coupled with small amounts of crustal assimilation, to form the locally erupted andesites. All samples, including Spring Mountain basalts, have ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr isotopes of 0. 70608 and 0. 70751, with ¹⁴³Nd/¹⁴⁴Nd isotopes of 0. 51149 and 0. 51157 and εNd values of - 18 to - 22. Pb isotopes plot to the left of the Geochron and directly on to slightly above the Stacey-Kramers curve. Strontium, neodymium, and lead isotope data suggest that Spring Mountain basalts are melts of ancient (e. g., 2. 8 Ga Beartooth province) lithospheric mantle. The high ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr values and exceptionally low εNd values separate the UWRB rocks from both Yellowstone and Snake River Plain volcanics, and suggest they originated from a different magma source. Finally, thermal evidence suggests melting genesis for UWRB rocks may not be Yellowstone plume related; rather it is more likely linked to Cenozoic extension...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Travertine {{is quite}} a common {{formation}} {{in the area of}} Budapest (Hungary) indicating strong hydrothermal activity during the Pliocene and Quaternary. It covers former terraces of the Danube River and older geomorphologic horizons; thus, it is an important archive to date fluvial terraces and tectonic movements. Despite numerous investigations performed on these deposits, only few radiometric data are available so far and the absence of the exact timing information hindered paleoclimatic interpretation. The area of Gellért Hill consists mainly of Upper Triassic dolomite, but Quaternary travertine can also be found. In this study a detailed petrographic and stable isotope geochemical study of four travertine sites (1. Ifjúsági Park; 2. Számadó u. (Street); 3. Kelenhegyi u. (Street); 4. Somlói u. (Street)) of the Gellért Hill area is presented, along with analyses on the recent carbonate deposits of Gellért Hill and Sárosfürdő. The travertine of Ifjúsági Park and Számadó u. are <b>spring</b> <b>cone</b> deposits, while the travertine of the Kelenhegyi u. represents a shallow-water depositional environment. Based on the paleontological studies of Jánossy (in Scheuer and Schweitzer, 1988) the Gellért Hill travertine was thought to have been formed during the Lower Pleistocene; however, no radiometric age dating had been performed on these deposits prior our study. Our U/Th analyses yielded ages of 250 ± 44 ky for the Ifjúsági Park travertine (220 m asl) and 180 ± 49 ky for the Számadó u. travertine (195 m asl). These new U/Th ages are in contradiction with the previously assumed Lower Pleistocene age, implying gradual relative decrease in the paleokarst water-level and proving that the elevation of the individual travertine deposits not necessarily show their relative age. The uplift rates of Gellért Hill calculated from the U/Th age data and elevation of travertine occurrences range between 0. 47 and 0. 52 mm/yr, which is significantly higher than the uplift rates calculated for the Rózsadomb area (0. 20 0. 25 mm/yr; Kele et al., submitted). The difference in the incision rates between the individual sub-areas suggests that selective uplift was characteristic for the Buda Hills during the Middle Pleistocene; thus, up-scaling reconstruction of paleokarst waterlevel for the whole area from a given locality is not possible. Oxygen isotope analyses of recent carbonate deposits of Gellért Hill, Sárosfürdő and Rudas Spa revealed that these calcites precipitated under non-equilibrium conditions, and the measured calcitewater oxygen isotope fractionation show the same positive shift relative to “equilibrium values” as was observed {{in the case of the}} recently-forming Egerszalók travertine (Kele et al. 2008). Assuming that the water of the paleo-springs of Gellért Hill derived from precipitation infiltrated during interstadial periods of the Pleistocene and considering non-equilibrium deposition (i. e. using the empirical calcite-water oxygen isotope fractionation of Kele et al. 2008), their calculated paleotemperature could range between 22 (± 4) °C and 49 (± 6) °C.

50|$|The British Motor Corporation {{was also}} an early adopter of {{interconnected}} suspension. A system dubbed Hydrolastic was introduced in 1962 on the Morris 1100 {{and went on to}} be used on a variety of BMC models. Hydrolastic was developed by suspension engineer Alex Moulton and used rubber <b>cones</b> as the <b>springing</b> medium (these were first used on the 1959 Mini) with the suspension units on each side connected to each other by a fluid filled pipe. The fluid transmitted the force of road bumps from one wheel to the other (on the same principle as the Citroen 2CV's mechanical system described above) and because each suspension unit contained valves to restrict the flow of fluid also served as a shock absorber. Moulton went on to develop a replacement for Hydrolastic for BMC's successor, British Leyland. This system manufactured under licence by Dunlop in Coventry, called Hydragas worked on the same principle but instead of rubber spring units it used metal spheres divided internally by a rubber diaphragm. The top half contained pressurised gas and the lower half the same fluid as used on the Hydrolastic system. The fluid transmitted suspension forces between the units on each side whilst the gas acted as the springing medium via the diaphragm. This is the same principle as the Citroen hydropneumatic system and provides a similar ride quality but is self-contained and doesn't require an engine-driven pump to provide hydraulic pressure. The downside is that Hydragas is, unlike the Citroen system, not height adjustable or self-levelling. Hydragas was introduced in 1973 on the Austin Allegro and was used on several models, the last car to use it being the MG F in 2002. The system was changed in favour of coil springs over dampers, due to cost reasons, {{towards the end of the}} vehicle's life. When it was decommissioned in 2006 the Hydragas manufacturing line was over 40 years old.|$|R
