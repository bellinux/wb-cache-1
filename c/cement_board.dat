25|$|The {{demolition}} of buildings containing {{large amounts of}} asbestos based materials pose particular problems for builders and property developers – such buildings often have to be deconstructed piece by piece, or the asbestos has to be painstakingly removed before the structure can be razed by mechanical or explosive means. One such example is the Red Road Flats in Glasgow, Scotland which used huge amounts of asbestos <b>cement</b> <b>board</b> for wall panelling – here British health and safety regulations stipulate that asbestos material has to be removed to a landfill site via an approved route at certain {{times of the day}} in specially adapted vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} [...] "Furnace Trap" [...] came from the house having been a crematorium at some point, but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor, so it was instead decided that the furnace {{would be part of}} the house's boiler system. The furnace was visualized {{in the form of a}} computer model so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed. Using the computer model as a guide, the furnace was constructed in three days using <b>cement</b> <b>board</b> and tin with removable sides and top so Timothy Burd (Obi) could be filmed crawling inside. The furnace produced real flames and, in place of Burd, a stunt man using a fire-retardant gel crawled into the fire.|$|E
50|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of <b>cement</b> <b>board</b> is the weight per square foot. It is approximately {{twice that of}} gypsum board, making handling by one person difficult. Cutting of <b>cement</b> <b>board</b> must also be done with carbide-tipped tools and saw blades. Due to its hardness, pre-drilling of fasteners is often recommended. Finally, <b>cement</b> <b>board</b> is initially more expensive than water resistant gypsum board but may provide better long term value.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cement</b> <b>boards</b> may be {{classified}} as water resistant as in not affected by water exposure; however, they do allow penetration and passage of water and water vapor. To waterproof <b>cement</b> <b>boards,</b> a liquid or membrane waterproofing material is applied over its surface.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cement</b> <b>board</b> is {{hung with}} {{corrosion}} resistant screws or ring-shank nails. <b>Cement</b> <b>board</b> {{has very little}} movement under thermal stress, but the boards are usually installed with a slight gap at joints in shower pans, bathtubs, and each other. These joints are then filled with silicone sealant or the manufacturer's taping compounds before applying a finish. The filled joints are taped like conventional gypsum board, but with fiberglass tapes that provide additional water resistance. Combined with a water impermeable finish, <b>cement</b> <b>board</b> is a stable, durable backing board.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cement</b> <b>boards</b> {{are mainly}} <b>cement</b> bonded {{particle}} <b>boards</b> and <b>cement</b> fibre. <b>Cement</b> bonded particle <b>boards</b> have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in <b>cement</b> fibre <b>boards</b> have cellulose fibre, {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue particle <b>boards</b> and <b>cement</b> fibre <b>boards</b> are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than <b>cement</b> fibre <b>boards.</b> <b>Cement</b> particle <b>boards</b> can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre boards are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain <b>board</b> qualities. Typical <b>cement</b> fiber <b>board</b> is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cement</b> <b>boards</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with gypsum core backer boards. Gypsum core backer boards are affected by water and {{should not be}} used on wet exposure areas.|$|R

30|$|Paints A and B {{were applied}} to birch plywood boards (dimensions: 76  ×  74  ×  1  cm 3). The side faces of the plywood boards were sealed using ‘Pyrotect Lack’. Paint C was applied to fibre <b>cement</b> <b>boards</b> (dimensions: 76  ×  74  ×  1  cm 3). Paint C was also applied to the side faces of the fibre <b>cement</b> <b>boards.</b> All paints were applied {{according}} to the manufacturer’s instructions referring {{to the amount of}} paint per surface area, application of ground coats and the duration of drying phases. Paints dried at room temperature were protected from direct radiation for a period of 5  days until the field experiments were started. Textile samples were fixed to wooden frames of 76  ×  74  cm lateral lengths.|$|R

50|$|As a tile backing board, <b>cement</b> <b>board</b> {{has better}} {{long-term}} performance than paper-faced gypsum core products {{because it will}} not mildew or physically break down in the continued presence of moisture or leaks. <b>Cement</b> <b>board</b> is not actually waterproof, but it is highly resistant to absorbing moisture and has excellent drying properties. In areas continually exposed to water spray (i.e. showers) a waterproofing barrier is usually recommended behind the boards or as a trowel-applied product to {{the face of the}} boards behind the finish system.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cement</b> <b>board</b> is a {{combination}} of cement and reinforcing fibers formed into 4 foot by 8 foot sheets (or 3 foot by 5 foot sheets), 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick that are typically used as a tile backing board. <b>Cement</b> <b>board</b> can be nailed or screwed to wood or steel studs to create a substrate for vertical tile and attached horizontally to plywood for tile floors, kitchen counters and backsplashes. It can be used on the exterior of buildings as a base for exterior plaster (stucco) systems and sometimes as the finish system itself.|$|E
