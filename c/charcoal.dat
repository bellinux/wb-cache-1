5|$|<b>Charcoal</b> {{can be made}} by slow {{pyrolysis}} of wood by heating it in {{the absence}} of air in a kiln. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are burned with a very limited amount of air. The process of converting them into <b>charcoal</b> takes about fifteen hours. <b>Charcoal</b> is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} the most benefit from {{activated}} <b>charcoal</b> is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering activated <b>charcoal</b> later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated <b>charcoal</b> should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give activated <b>charcoal</b> in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated <b>charcoal,</b> and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all. Intravenous acetylcystine has no interaction with activated <b>charcoal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The English name carbon {{comes from}} the Latin carbo for coal and <b>charcoal,</b> whence also comes the French charbon, meaning <b>charcoal.</b> In German, Dutch and Danish, the names for carbon are Kohlenstoff, koolstof and kulstof respectively, all {{literally}} meaning coal-substance.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{compression}} and electrolyte infusion of wood, pyrolysis, and chemical {{activation of the}} resulting <b>charcoals</b> produced enhanced abilities to adsorb lead ion and benzene from model polluted water solutions. Iodine number (F) and methylene blue (E) indices also showed enhancement of surface activity. Ultrasonic techniques revealed a loss of pore structure during wood compression, as water infiltration likewise indicated for the resulting <b>charcoals,</b> but there was not necessarily a loss of adsorption ability for the above adsorbents on subsequent <b>charcoals.</b> Aspen based <b>charcoals</b> activated by pressurized H 2 O 2 showed the most promise among those tested...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that some <b>charcoals</b> possess {{paramagnetic}} centers with an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) linewidth which can be broadened by oxygen. In order to identify potential candidates as sensors for in vivo EPR oximetry, we carried out a systematic study among commercially available <b>charcoals.</b> A total of 34 <b>charcoals</b> were tested. The steps used for the screening were: (1) to check the presence of paramagnetic centers in the material; (2) to measure the EPR linewidth in nitrogen and in air on the dry material and on a aqueous suspension of particles; (3) to calibrate the oxygen sensitive materials (EPR linewidth vs. pO 2); (4) to test the sensitivity and stability of the response to changes of pO 2 in a simple model of hypoxia induced in mice. Seventeen <b>charcoals</b> contained paramagnetic centers detectable by low-frequency EPR (1. 1 GHz). The EPR spectrum consist of one single line which is typical of carbon-centered radicals (g-factor approximately 2). Eight <b>charcoals</b> presented sufficient interesting EPR properties (linewidth in nitrogen 0. 15 mT) to be further characterized in vivo. Only three <b>charcoals</b> presented a stable, reproducible, and sensitive response to pO 2 for more than 2 months. These three coals {{should be considered as}} good candidates to be used as oxygen sensor using in vivo EPR spectroscopy...|$|R

5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the demands for}} <b>charcoal</b> used in the blast and cupola {{furnaces}} of the iron industry led to large amounts of deforestation of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from bituminous coal as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of <b>charcoal</b> derived from wood.|$|E
5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of <b>charcoal</b> and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of <b>charcoal</b> would be light while the air was humid, the bar of <b>charcoal</b> would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of <b>charcoal</b> on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the absorption and preliminary safety of activated carbon(AC) refined from Makino bamboo, Moso bamboo and Japanese cedar <b>charcoals</b> with carbon dioxide(CO 2) at an 800 and 900 °C activation temperature with 90, 120 and 150 min of activation time. The yield ofAC was from 47. 5 to 90. 4 %. The benzene absorption (10. 8 – 37. 4 %) of AC was also higher than that (1. 3 – 9. 4 %) of <b>charcoals.</b> The iodine value (562 – 1088 mg/g) of AC was higher than that (141 – 628 mg/g) of <b>charcoals.</b> The true density (2. 11 – 2. 17 g/cm^ 3) and BET surface area (791. 22 – 829. 78 m^ 2 /g) of AC were obviously higher than those (1. 68 – 1. 86 g/cm^ 3 and 58. 95 – 356. 62 m^ 2 /g) of <b>charcoals.</b> The AC belongs to a mesopore structure because the results of average pore diameters were from 2. 22 to 2. 69 nm. No matter what the relative humidity (RH) was in high/low RH at either 90 or 40 % with a constant temperature of 25 ˚C, the hygroscopic ability of AC was better than that for <b>charcoals,</b> and the water activity of AC was from 0. 45 to 0. 46. The heavy metal content as the Pb (Plumbum) ppm base of AC was below 40 ppm and met the Sanitation Standard of Edible Natural Colorants from the announcement by the Department of Health’s Executive Yuan, in Taiwan. The preliminary safety evaluation using the Ames test for the <b>charcoals</b> and AC had no cytotoxicity and mutagenicity toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. It is suggested that the AC, refined from the <b>charcoals,</b> can be expected to be a natural moisture–proof material...|$|R

40|$|The CO 2 {{gasification}} {{reactivity of}} Norwegian spruce <b>charcoals</b> from stem wood and its forest residue produced at different pressures {{was investigated in}} the present study. The gasification behavior was analyzed thermogravimetrically at different gasification temperatures of 800, 850 and 950 oC, followed by a kinetic modelling applying the random pore model (RPM) and overlapped grain model (OGM). It is found that gasification temperature has a considerable influence on the reactivity of <b>charcoals.</b> Higher carbonization pressures reduce the gasification reactivity of the produced <b>charcoals</b> towards CO 2. The employed kinetic models represents well the experimental data. The initial porosity computed through the OGM is found {{to depend on the}} carbonization pressure. The activation energy is found in the range of 210 to 230 kJ/mol, in line with the values reportedin the literature...|$|R

5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of <b>charcoal</b> are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of <b>charcoal</b> and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated <b>charcoal</b> {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.
