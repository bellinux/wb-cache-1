Upon encountering the <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> as it unwinds DNA, RecBCD cuts the DNA a few nucleotides to the 3’ side of Chi; depending on the reaction conditions, this cut is either a simple nick on one strand or the change of nuclease activity from cutting the 3’-ended strand to cutting the 5’ended strand. In either case the resulting 3’ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is bound by multiple molecules of RecA protein that facilitate [...] "strand invasion," [...] in which one strand of a homologous double-stranded DNA is displaced by the RecA-associated ssDNA. Strand invasion forms a joint DNA molecule called a D-loop. Resolution of the D-loop is thought to occur by replication primed by the 3’ end generated at Chi (in the D-loop). Alternatively, the D-loop may be converted into a Holliday junction by cutting of the D-loop and a second exchange of DNA strands; the Holliday junction can be converted into linear duplex DNA by cutting of the Holliday junction and ligation of the resultant nicks. Either type of resolution can generate recombinant DNA molecules if the two interacting DNAs are genetically different, as well as repair the initially broken DNA.|$|E

The sequence of the Chi site is unique to each group of closely related organisms; in E. coli and other enteric bacteria, such as Salmonella, the sequence is 5'-GCTGGTGG-3'. The existence of Chi sites was originally discovered in the genome of bacteriophage lambda, a virus that infects E. coli, but is now known to occur about 1000 times in the E. coli genome.|$|E

40|$|RecBCD is an ATP-dependent helicase and {{exonuclease}} which generates 3 ′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends used by RecA for homologous recombination. The exonuclease {{activity is}} altered when RecBCD encounters a <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> (5 ′-GCTGGTGG- 3 ′) in double-stranded DNA (ds DNA), an event {{critical to the}} generation of the 3 ′-ssDNA. This study tests the effect of ssDNA oligonucleotides having a <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> (Chi+) or a single base change that abolishes the <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> (Chio), on the enzymatic activities of RecBCD. Our results show that a 14 and a 20 mer with Chi+ {{in the center of}} the molecule inhibit the exonuclease and helicase activities of RecBCD to a greater extent than the corresponding Chio oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides with the <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> at one end, or the <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> alone in an 8 mer, failed to show Chi-specific inhibition of RecBCD. Thus, Chi recognition requires that Chi be flanked by DNA at either end. Further experiments indicated that the oligonucleotides inhibit RecBCD from binding to its dsDNA substrate. These results suggest that a specific site for Chi recognition exists on RecBCD, which binds Chi with greater affinity than a non-Chi sequence and is probably adjacent to non-specific DNA binding sites...|$|E

40|$|In Escherichia coli, eight {{kinds of}} chromosome-derived DNA {{fragments}} (named Hot DNA) {{were found to}} exhibit homologous recombinational hotspot activity, with the following properties. (i) The Hot activities of all Hot DNAs were enhanced extensively under RNase H-defective (rnh) conditions. (ii) Seven Hot DNAs were clustered at the DNA replication terminus region on the E. coli chromosome and had Chi activities (H. Nishitani, M. Hidaka, and T. Horiuchi, Mol. Gen. Genet. 240 : 307 - 314, 1993). Hot activities of HotA, -B, and -C, the locations of which were close to three DNA replication terminus sites, the TerB, -A, and -C sites, respectively, disappeared when terminus-binding (Tau or Tus) protein was defective, thereby suggesting that their Hot activities are termination event dependent. Other Hot groups showed termination-independent Hot activities. In addition, at least HotA activity proved {{to be dependent on}} a <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence,</b> because mutational destruction of the <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> on the HotA DNA fragment resulted in disappearance of the HotA activity. The HotA activity which had disappeared was reactivated by insertion of a new, properly oriented <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> at the position between the HotA DNA and the TerB site.

50|$|The second {{school of}} thought {{describes}} the mechanism of GC and AT skew as resulting from differential selective pressure between the leading and lagging strands. Examination of the prokaryotic genome shows a preference in third codon position for G over C and T over A. This discrimination creates an asymmetric nucleotide composition, if the coding strand is unequally distributed between the leading and lagging strands, {{as in the case}} for bacteria. In addition, the highly transcribed genes, such as ribosomal proteins, {{have been shown to be}} located mostly on the leading strand in bacteria. Therefore, a bias in the third-position codon choice of G over C can lead to GC skew. Additionally, some signal sequences are rich in guanine and thymine, such as <b>chi</b> <b>sequences,</b> and these sequences might have a higher frequency of occurrence in one strand compared to the other.|$|R

40|$|RecBCD is an ATP-dependent helicase and exonuclease, which generates 3 '-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends used by RecA for {{homologous}} recombination. Critical to {{this function}} is its encounter with an regulatory DNA octamer called the <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence,</b> 5 '-GCTGGTGG- 3 ', {{which is known}} to stimulate recombination by the RecBCD pathway. RecBCD undergoes an unexplained modification following Chi encounter that results in attenuation of its 3 '- 5 'exonuclease activity. There are several aspects of the Chi-RecBCD interactions that are still not understood, and most studies addressing these issues have done so by employing Chi- bearing duplexes in various biochemical assays for RecBCD functions. The recognition of Chi on exclusively single-stranded substrates has never been tested before, even though Chi {{is known to be}} recognized as the single stranded sequence 5 ' GCTGGTGG 3 '. This study tests the effect of ssDNA oligonucleotides, having a <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> (Chi+) or a single base mutant of the <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> (Chio), on the enzymatic activities of RecBCD. The results obtained show that Chi is specifically recognized by RecBCD even when part of a single-stranded substrate. However its location within the single strand is important; specific recognition and distinction from the mutant sequence occurs only when Chi {{is in the middle of}} the construct, flanked by DNA at either end. The activities affected included the helicase, and consequently the exonuclease and Chi-recognition activity itself. The effects observed were also found to be dependent on the length of the oligonucleotides. The longer oligonucleotides affect the enzymatic function of RecBCD better than the shorter ones. Preincubation of DNA substrate with RecBCD abolishes the inhibitory effect of the oligonucleotides on RecBCD function however, preincubation of the oligonucleotides themselves with RecBCD does not enhance inhibition by them. This study also presents some preliminary results from photocrosslinking of oligonucleotides to RecBCD, which suggest that RecC may play an important role in binding and recognizing Chi. The results lead to the proposition of a model that explains the location-specific (flank-dependent) recognition of the <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence</b> by RecBCD and discusses the possibility of the existence of a specific site on RecBCD for Chi...|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{physiological}} effects of DNA replication arrest at the terminus (Ter), we constructed a replication-blocked Escherichia coli strain so that both bidirectional replication forks would be impeded at two flanking Ter sites, one artificial {{and the other}} natural. While the blocked strain grew slightly more slowly than a control strain, it had abnormal phenotypes {{similar to those of}} E. coli dam mutants, i. e., hyper-Rec phenotype, recA(+) - and recB+ (C+) -dependent growth, and constitutive SOS induction. The observation that these two apparently unrelated mutants cause similar phenotypes led us to design a model. We propose that the following sequential events may occur in both strains. A double-strand (ds) break occurs at the blocked replication fork in the blocked strain and at the ongoing fork in the dam mutant, through which RecBCD enzyme enters and degrades the ds DNA molecule, and the degradation product serves as the signal molecule for SOS induction. When RecBCD enzyme meets an appropriately oriented <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence,</b> its DNase activity is converted to recombinase enzyme, which is able to repair the ds end, recombinationally. this model (i) explains the puzzling phenotype of recA and recB (C) mutants and the SOS-inducing phenotype of polA, lig, and dna mutants under restrictive conditions, (ii) provides an interpretation for the role of the <b>Chi</b> <b>sequence,</b> and (iii) suggests a possible key role for homologous recombination with regard to cell survival following the arrest of DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|The {{blood group}} ABO gene codes for a glycosyltransferase that adds the {{ultimate}} monosaccharide to a glycoconjugate and forms the A or B blood group specific antigen. The DNA {{structure of the}} three major alleles of the human blood group ABO system was first described in 1990. This review describes the subsequent developments, including the increasing number of variants of these common alleles and the underlying mutations thought to be responsible for the occurrence of some of the weak subgroups of blood group A and B. Several inactive (O) alleles are also now known. Our knowledge of the DNA sequence of the normal A and B alleles and of the rare and intriguing cisAB and B(A) phenotypes has resulted in plausible explanations for these. Allelic variations outside the translated exons have been investigated and resulted in detection of lineage-specific intron mutations and the discovery of an enhancer VNTR region affecting the rate of transcription at this locus. The occurrence of hybrid alleles can also explain hitherto abnormal inheritance in some pedigrees. The detection of hybrid alleles has been made possible by the presence of numerous polymorphisms found in the various ABO alleles. The role of <b>chi</b> (<b>chi)</b> <b>sequences</b> is discussed.

40|$|In Escherichia coli, T:G {{mismatches}} {{in specific}} contexts are corrected {{by a very}} short patch (VSP) repair system. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the product of gene vsr mediates correction of T:G to C:G in the 5 �CTAGG/ 3 �GGTCC context and in some related contexts. Amber mutations that arose in CAG sequences in gene cI of bacteriophage � were used to determine the effect of flanking bases on the repair of T:G mispairs arising during phage recombination. The experimental findings were combined with published data on mismatch repair of mutations in � gene P and E. coli gene lacI. While VSP repair was most efficient in the context 5 �CTAGG, there was very significant correction when either the 5 � C or the 3 � G was replaced by another base. Some mismatch repair of TAG to CAG occurred in all contexts tested. Reduction in VSP repair caused by the lack of MutL or MutS was fully complemented by the addition of vsr � plasmids when the T:G mispair was in the 5 �CTAGG/ 3 �GGTCC context. VSP repair was decreased in bacteria containing mutS � on a multicopy plasmid.

As in Escherichia coli, the recD gene of S. typhimurium lies between the recB and argA genes at min 61 of the genetic map. Plasmids carrying the Salmonella recBCD+ genes restore ATP-dependent exonuclease V activity to an E. coli recBCD deletion mutant. The new Salmonella recD mutations (placed on this plasmid) eliminate the exonuclease activity and enable the plasmid-bearing E. coli deletion mutant to support growth of phage T 4 gene 2 mutants. The Salmonella recD mutations caused a 3 - to 61 -fold increase {{in the ability of}} a recipient strain to inherit (by transduction) a large inserted element (MudA prophage; 38 kb). In this cross, recombination events must occur in the short (3 -kb) sequences that flank the element in the 44 -kb transduced fragment.

40|$|Chi is a hotspot for {{homologous}} recombination {{mediated by the}} RecBCD (Rec) pathway of Escherichia coli.

Employing phage lambda red gam crosses, phage T 4 2 - survival measurements, and exoV assays, it is shown that E. coli cells in which RecBCD has extensive opportunity to interact with linear chi-containing DNA (produced by rolling circle replication of a plasmid with chi or by bleomycin-induced fragmentation of the cellular chromosome) acquire the phenotype of a recD mutant and maintain this for approximately 2 h. It is concluded that RecBCD is converted into RecBC during interaction with chi by irreversible inactivation of RecD. After conversion, the enzyme is released and initiates recombination on other DNA molecules in a chi-independent fashion. Overexpression of recD+ (from a plasmid) prevented the phenotypic change and providing RecD after the change restored chi-stimulated recombination. The observed recA+ dependence of the downregulation of exoV could explain the previously noted "reckless" DNA degradation of recA mutants. It is proposed that chi sites are regulatory elements for the RecBCD to RecBC switch and thereby function as cis- and trans-acting stimulators of RecBC-dependent recombination...|$|R
40|$|Aedes aegypti (L.), {{the main}} vector of dengue fever in Brazil, has been {{controlled}} {{with the use}} of massive chemical products, contributing to the development of resistance and decreasing the insect control efficiency. The control of dipterans with bioinsecticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis has been satisfactory, due to the production of insecticidal proteins denominated Cry (crystal), Cyt (cytolytic) toxins and Chi (chitinase), and to the synergistic effects among them. The present work aimed to select B. thuringiensis isolates efficient against A. aegypti larvae. A bacterial collection containing 1, 073 isolates of B. thuringiensis, obtained from different locations of Brazilian territory, had the DNA isolated and submitted to PCR amplifications using specific primers for cry 4 Aa, cry 4 Ba, cry 11 Aa, cry 11 Ba, cyt 1 Aa, cyt 1 Ab, cyt 2 Aa and chi genes. For the LC 50 and LC 90 determination, the entomopathogenic isolates were evaluated by selective and quantitative bioassays. Only 45 isolates (4. 2 %) presented amplicons for the cry and cyt genes. The <b>chi</b> gene <b>sequence</b> was detected in 25 (54. 3 %) of those isolates. From the 45 isolates submitted to the selective bioassays, 13 caused 100 % mortality of A. aegypti larvae. The identification of cry, cyt and chi genes of B. thuringiensis and the toxicity analysis on A. aegypti led to the selection of a set of isolates that have the potential {{to be used in the}} formulation of new bioinsecticides...|$|R
40|$|The RecBCD enzyme has a {{powerful}} duplex DNA exonuclease activity in vivo. We found that this activity decreased strongly when cells were irradiated with UV light (135 J/m 2). The activity decrease was seen {{by an increase in}} survival of phage T 4 2 − of about 200 -fold (phage T 4 2 − has defective duplex DNA end-protecting gene 2 protein). The activity decrease depended on excision repair proficiency of the cells and a postirradiation incubation. During this time, chromosome fragmentation occurred as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In accord with previous observations, it was concluded that the RecBCD enzyme is silenced during interaction with duplex DNA fragments containing <b>Chi</b> nucleotide <b>sequences.</b> The silencing was suppressed by induction or permanent derepression of the SOS system or by the overproduction of single-strand DNA binding protein (from a plasmid with ssb+) which is known to inhibit degradation of chromosomal DNA by cellular DNases. Further, mutations in xonA, recJ, and sbcCD, particularly in the recJ sbcCD and xonA recJ sbcCD combinations, impeded RecBCD silencing. The findings suggest that the DNA fragments had single-stranded tails of a length which prevents loading of RecBCD. It is concluded that in wild-type cells the tails are effectively removed by single-strand-specific DNases including exonuclease I, RecJ DNase, and SbcCD DNase. By this, tailed DNA ends are processed to entry sites for RecBCD. It is proposed that end blunting functions to direct DNA ends into the RecABCD pathway. This pathway specifically activates Chi-containing regions for recombination and recombinational repair...|$|R
