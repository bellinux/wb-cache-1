5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain <b>crabs</b> and hermit <b>crabs</b> seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and <b>crabs</b> live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|Animals without blood {{were divided}} into soft-shelled Malakostraka (<b>crabs,</b> lobsters, and shrimps); {{hard-shelled}} Ostrakoderma (gastropods and bivalves); soft-bodied Malakia (cephalopods); and divisible animals Entoma (insects, spiders, scorpions, ticks). Other animals without blood included fish lice, hermit <b>crabs,</b> red coral, sea anemones, sponges, starfish and various worms: Aristotle did not classify these into groups.|$|E
5|$|Females {{can produce}} up to 185,000 eggs, and larvae develop {{offshore}} {{in several stages}} before their final moult to juvenile <b>crabs</b> in the intertidal zone. Young <b>crabs</b> live among seaweeds and seagrasses, such as Posidonia oceanica, until they reach adulthood.|$|E

5|$|The {{coconut crab}} {{is the only}} species of the genus Birgus, and {{is related to the}} {{terrestrial}} hermit <b>crabs</b> of the genus Coenobita. It shows a number of adaptations to life on land. Like hermit <b>crabs,</b> juvenile coconut <b>crabs</b> use empty gastropod shells for protection, but the adults develop a tough exoskeleton on their abdomen and stop carrying a shell. Coconut <b>crabs</b> have organs known as branchiostegal lungs, which are used instead of the vestigial gills for breathing and they will drown if immersed in water for long. They have an acute sense of smell, which has developed convergently with that of insects, and which they use to find potential food sources.|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock <b>crabs,</b> cancer <b>crabs,</b> spider <b>crabs,</b> lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E
5|$|Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean has {{the largest}} and densest {{population}} of coconut <b>crabs</b> in the world, although it is outnumbered there by more than 50 times by the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. Other Indian Ocean populations exist on the Seychelles, including Aldabra and Cosmoledo, but the coconut crab is extinct on the central islands. Coconut <b>crabs</b> occur on several of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. They occur {{on most of the}} islands, and the northern atolls, of the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E
50|$|Hemigrapsus oregonensis {{is a small}} shore <b>crab</b> of {{the family}} Varunidae; it was {{formerly}} classified under the family Grapsidae.

5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} <b>crabs,</b> and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe <b>crabs</b> as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
5|$|In the spring, {{the adult}} females {{of this species}} lay eggs in {{tower-shaped}} structures. The eggs hatch as veliger larvae, which can float in the plankton for up to 14 weeks before settling onto the seabed as tiny snails. <b>Crabs</b> are a predator of this sea snail. After {{the death of the}} snails, if the shells are still intact they are often used by hermit <b>crabs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate predators include <b>crabs,</b> starfish and octopuses. <b>Crabs</b> {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both <b>crabs</b> and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
50|$|Common {{names for}} the species include Indo-Pacific {{horseshoe}} <b>crab,</b> Indonesian horseshoe <b>crab,</b> Indian horseshoe <b>crab</b> and Chinese horseshoe <b>crab.</b>|$|R

5|$|Loggerheads have {{numerous}} predators, especially {{early in}} their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost <b>crabs,</b> oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, parasitoid wasp larvae, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, <b>crabs,</b> toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include fish, such as parrotfish and moray eels, and portunid <b>crabs.</b> Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as <b>crabs</b> and spider <b>crabs.</b> Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
