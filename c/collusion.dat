40|$|Algorithmic {{graph theory}} has {{thoroughly}} analyzed how, given a network describing constraints between various nodes, groups can be formed among these {{so that the}} resulting configuration optimizes a global metric. In contrast, for various social and economic networks, groups are formed de facto by the choices of selfish players. A fundamental problem in this setting is the existence and convergence to a self-enforcing configuration: assignment of players into groups such that no player has an incentive to move into another group than hers. Motivated by information sharing on social networks [...] and the difficult tradeoff between its benefits and the associated privacy risk [...] we study the possible emergence of such stable configurations in a general selfish group formation game. Our paper considers this general game for the first time, and it completes its analysis. We show that convergence critically depends {{on the level of}} <b>collusions</b> among the players [...] which allow multiple players to move simultaneously as long as all of them benefit. Solving a previously open problem we exactly show when, depending on <b>collusions,</b> convergence occurs within polynomial time, non-polynomial time, and when it never occurs. We also prove that previously known bounds on convergence time are all loose: by a novel combinatorial analysis of the evolution of this game we are able to provide the first asymptotically exact formula on its convergence. Moreover, we extend these results by providing a complete analysis when groups may overlap, and for general utility functions representing multi-modal interactions. Finally, we prove that <b>collusions</b> have a significant and positive effect on the efficiency of the equilibrium that is attained...|$|R

Any captured Swedish territory—specifically Narva—could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Batory's control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III's wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in <b>collusion</b> with Batory.

Morse was a businessman from Maine who by 1890 had used questionable financial processes to acquire control of the New York City Ice Company and the Consumers' Ice Company of New York, merging them into the Consolidated Ice Company. In turn Morse bought out his major competitor the Knickerbocker Ice Company of New York in 1896, giving him control of around four million tons (four billion kg) of the regional ice harvests each year. Morse incorporated his few remaining rivals into the American Ice Company in 1899, giving him control of all of the natural and plant ice supplies and distribution in the north-east of the US. On the west coast, Edward Hopkins formed the Union Ice Company in San Francisco, bringing together a range of regional ice companies to produce another huge ice company. In contrast, the competition in the British market remained harsh, keeping prices relatively low.|$|E
5|$|A similar episode {{however in}} 1644 had an entirely {{different}} outcome: on 28 September, the Knights of Malta attacked an Ottoman convoy on its way from Constantinople to Alexandria, aboard which {{were a number of}} pilgrims bound for Mecca, including the exiled Kızlar Ağa (Chief Black Eunuch) Sünbül Ağa, the kadi of Cairo and the nurse of the future sultan Mehmed IV. During the fight, Sünbül Ağa and most of the important pilgrims were slain, while 350 men and 30 women were taken to be sold as slaves. The Knights loaded their loot on a ship, which then docked at a small harbor on the southern coast of Crete for a few days, where it disembarked a number of sailors and slaves. The Ottomans were enraged at the incident, and the Porte accused the Venetians of deliberate <b>collusion</b> with the Knights, something the Venetians vehemently denied. With the hawkish party being then dominant in the Ottoman court, the incident was seen as a perfect pretext for war with a weakened Venice. Despite a long period of negotiations, which lasted until well into 1645, and against the objections of the Grand Vizier Sultanzade Mehmed Pasha, war was decided upon. An expedition was quickly assembled with over 50,000 troops and reputedly 416 vessels, under Kapudan Pasha Silahdar Yusuf Pasha, the Sultan's son-in-law. The Ottoman armada sailed from the Dardanelles on 30 April, heading towards the harbor of Navarino in the Peloponnese, where it remained for three weeks. The fleet's target was not announced, but the Ottomans, to allay Venetian fears, implied that it would be Malta.|$|E

Following his return from Egypt, Abu Ishaq joined al-Ma'mun in his 831 campaign against the Byzantines. After rebuffing Theophilos' offers of peace, the Abbasid army crossed the Cilician Gates and divided into three columns, with the Caliph, his son al-Abbas, and Abu Ishaq at their head. The Abbasids seized and destroyed several minor forts as well as the town of Tyana, while al-Abbas even won a minor skirmish against Theophilos in person, before withdrawing to Syria in September. In 832 al-Ma'mun repeated his invasion of the Byzantine borderlands, capturing the strategically important fortress of Loulon, a success that consolidated Abbasid control of both exits of the Cilician Gates. So encouraged was al-Ma'mun by this victory that he repeatedly rejected Theophilos' ever more generous offers for peace, and publicly announced that he intended to capture Constantinople itself. Consequently, al-Abbas was dispatched in May to convert the deserted town of Tyana into a military colony and prepare the ground for the westwards advance. Al-Ma'mun followed in July, but he suddenly fell ill and died on 7 August 833.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{encryption}} provides fine-grained {{access control}} for encrypted data, allowing each user to learn only specific {{functions of the}} encrypted data. We study the notion of hierarchical functional encryption, which augments functional encryption with delegation capabilities, offering significantly more expressive access control. We present a generic transformation that converts any general-purpose public-key functional encryption scheme into a hierarchical one without relying on any additional assumptions. This significantly refines {{our understanding of the}} power of functional encryption, showing (somewhat surprisingly) that the existence of functional encryption is equivalent to that of its hierarchical generalization. Instantiating our transformation with the existing functional encryption schemes yields a va-riety of hierarchical schemes offering various trade-offs between their delegation capabilities (i. e., the depth and width of their hierarchical structures) and underlying assumptions. When start-ing with a scheme secure against an unbounded number of <b>collusions,</b> we can support arbitrary hierarchical structures. In addition, even when starting with schemes that are secure against a bounded number of <b>collusions</b> (which are known to exist under rather minimal assumptions such as the existence of public-key encryption and shallow pseudorandom generators), we can support hierarchical structures of bounded depth and width. ...|$|R
40|$|We analyze group key {{distribution}} protocols for broadcast and multicast scenarios that make blackbox use of symmetric encryption and a pseudorandom generator (PRG) in deriving the group center’s messages. We first show {{that for a}} large class of such protocols, in which each transmitted ciphertext is of the form EK 1 (K 2) (E being the encryption operation; K 1, K 2 being random or pseudorandom keys), security {{in the presence of}} a single malicious receiver is equivalent to that in the presence of <b>collusions</b> of corrupt receivers. On the flip side, we find that for protocols that nest the encrytion function (use ciphertexts created by enciphering ciphertexts themselves), such an equivalence fails to hold: there exist protocols that use nested encryption, are secure against single miscreants but are insecure against <b>collusions.</b> Our equivalence and separation results are first proven in a symbolic, Dolev-Yao style adversarial model and subsequently translated into the computational model using a general theorem that establishes soundness of the symbolic security notions. Both equivalence and separation are shown to hold in the computational world under mild syntactic conditions (like the absence of encryption cycles) ...|$|R
