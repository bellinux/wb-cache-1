40|$|SummaryAminoacyl-tRNA synthetases prevent mistranslation, or {{genetic code}} ambiguity, through {{specialized}} editing reactions. Mutations that disrupt editing in bacteria adversely affect cell growth and viability, and recent {{work in the}} mouse supports the idea that translational errors caused by an editing defect lead to a neurological disease-like phenotype. To further investigate the connection <b>of</b> <b>mistranslation</b> to cell pathology, we introduced an inducible transgene expressing an editing-deficient valyl-tRNA synthetase into mammalian cells. Introducing mistranslation precipitated a disruption of cell morphology and membrane blebbing, accompanied by activation of caspase- 3, consistent with an apoptotic response. Addition of a noncanonical amino acid that is misactivated, but not cleared, by the editing-defective enzyme exacerbated these effects. A special ambiguity-detecting sensor provided direct readout <b>of</b> <b>mistranslation</b> in vivo, supporting the possibility that decreased translational fidelity could be associated with disease...|$|R
40|$|Cells {{maintain}} fidelity {{in protein}} synthesis through various mechanisms including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) that {{are able to}} discriminate tRNAs and their cognate amino acids. Substrate specificity along with editing functions of aaRSs act to prevent or remove incorrect amino acids charged onto tRNAs. Editing domains are highly conserved and found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes; knocking out the editing function of an aaRS does not seem to affect cell viability. To determine the biological relevance of the editing domains found on aaRSs, it is essential to determine the contribution of editing to protein fidelity in vivo. Bacillus subtilis serves as an ideal model to study this phenomenon because it possesses a small gene-enocoded, 10 amino acid pheromone peptide, ComX. ComX is processed, modified, and secreted by B. subtilis as a signaling molecule that can easily be purified. The amino acid sequence of ComX can be altered to some degree while maintaining cellular activity enabling different strains that produce variants of ComX pheromone to be compared for levels <b>of</b> <b>mistranslation.</b> Ultimately future experiments will reveal the impact that editing by an aaRS has on the fidelity of protein synthesis in vivo by quantifying the rates <b>of</b> <b>mistranslation</b> in strains <b>of</b> B. subtilis that express an editing-defective tRNA synthetase and comparing it to levels <b>of</b> <b>mistranslation</b> to wild type strains...|$|R

30|$|The gene bldA for leucyl tRNA^Leu_UAA {{is known}} for almost 30  years as a key {{regulator}} of morphogenesis and secondary metabolism in genus Streptomyces. Codon UUA is the rarest one in Streptomyces genomes and is present exclusively in genes with auxiliary functions. Delayed accumulation of translation-competent tRNA^Leu_UAA is believed to confine the expression of UUA-containing transcripts to stationary phase. Implicit to the regulatory function of UUA codon is the assumption about high accuracy of its translation, e.g. the latter should not occur {{in the absence of}} cognate tRNA^Leu_UAA. However, a growing body of facts points to the possibility <b>of</b> <b>mistranslation</b> <b>of</b> UUA-containing transcripts in the bldA-deficient mutants. It is not known what type of near-cognate tRNA(s) may decode UUA in the absence of cognate tRNA in Streptomyces, and whether UUA possesses certain inherent properties (such as increased/decreased accuracy of decoding) that would favor its use for regulatory purposes.|$|R
