Also, it uses pulse reverse current in increasing nanoparticle content and microhardness. Two different coating layers, Ni and Ni/SiC, were electroplated on brass substrate using four different electroplating parameters. However, a group of the parameters have failed to produce successful coating. After plating, the origin samples are cut into small pieces to test different characteristics. The small samples from corner of the origin one were mounted and taken thickness measurements. The samples from center were taken to measure microhardness and content of nanoparticles. To find out reason of failed samples, a Pourbaix diagram was calculated afterward. The average content of SiC nanoparticles of each sample doesn’t have much differences but the samples using pulse reverse current have a uniform distribution.

30|$|There {{are some}} {{reasons for the}} low silica content of the {{composites}} prepared through the different electroplating parameters (column 2, Table  1). It should be mentioned that silica nanoparticles were used in this work, {{due to the fact}} that their smaller particle sizes tend to further improve the corrosion and mechanical resistance of the composite layers, while increasing the hardness and the lifetime of the coatings, as compared to the larger particles [14, 27]. However, silica nanoparticles significantly tend to be agglomerated in the plating bath due to the high surface free energy, van der Waals forces, and effective compression of the diffused double layer surrounding the particles by the high ionic strength, reducing particle suspension in the bath [31, 32, 33]. Therefore, SiO 2 content in the composite is low. Moreover, silica particles are hydrophilic materials with little tendency toward co-deposition, in comparison to hydrophobic materials, {{due to the fact that}} a separation of the aqueous film from the particles in Helmholtz layer must occur to allow for the embedding of particles in the metallic matrix. As a result, the separation of the aqueous molecules from hydrophilic SiO 2 is too difficult [27, 34]. These may be overcome by adding a surfactant, which increases the zeta potentials of the particles and reduces the surface free energy of the inert particles through adsorbing them on the silica surface. Thus, particle agglomeration would be reduced, promoting the silica incorporation and uniform distribution of the particles through the electrodeposited layer [23, 24, 25, 26]. On the other hand, a surfactant may enhance the incorporation fraction of silica by increasing the hydrophobicity of the particles [27]. This would provide a driving force for the attachment of the particles at the cathode–electrolyte interfaces. To examine this, four surfactants (i.e., CTAC, ALES, CAPB and DG) were selected to be introduced into the electrolyte bath for increasing the silica content of the <b>composite.</b> The <b>electroplating</b> conditions are presented in Table  1 (each experiment was repeated twice and the average results are reported).|$|R

In this study, to study the effect of the magnetic field on the magnetic structure of the electroplated NiFe layers, magnetic controlled plating in which a longitudinal magnetic field ranging from 0 to 400 Oe is applied during nanocrystalline electroplating of permalloy Ni 80 Fe 20 layer of 2 µm thick onto a 20 µm diameter Cu wire. The magnetic structure of the plated layers is studied by investigating the Giant magneto-impedance (GMI) effect of the plated layer. GMI has been measured from a frequency range of 100 kHz to 50 MHz. It is observed that under conventional electroplating without an external magnetic controlling field, the anisotropy of the plated layer is generally circumferential as indicted by the double peaks of the MI curves in testing at high frequency. When a longitudinal magnetic field is applied during electroplating, the plated layer shows single peak MI curves, suggesting that the anisotropy is changed from circumferential to longitudinal. The results also show that the sensitivity and resolution of a magnetic field sensor is improved greatly by changing the anisotropy of the plated layer from circumferential to longitudinal...|$|R
40|$|Polycrystalline silicon {{is mainly}} used for solar cell applications, {{structures}} in micro-electromechanical systems, {{and production of}} single crystal Si. One of the relatively new methods for producing large quantities of polysilicon is fluidized bed reactor (FBR), where two main morphologies are produced, granular solid (1 - 3 mm) and nanopowders (30 - 300 nm). Grinding and fracture occurs in the granular solid during shipping and handling which can affect the final product properties and create safety issues. The microstructure and the morphology of both the granular and the nanopowder forms of Si were examined using scanning and transmission electron microscopes (SEM and TEM). The fracture toughness of the granular silicon was studied, using microindentation and nanoindentation techniques, at different annealing processes, and with different hydrogen concentrations during production. Hydrogen defects in silicon were analyzed using infrared spectroscopy {{to develop a new}} relationship between hydrogen and toughness. Based on the microstructural analysis it was shown that the granular Si are mostly crystalline with some amorphous regions linked to small pores, while the nanopowders are mostly amorphous with some crystalline bits; the porosity in the granular Si ranges between 1 - 4 volume percentage. It was proposed that the primary mechanism in FBR for the granular Si formation is chemical vapor deposition with minor agglomeration associated with pores. It was found that the lower the hydrogen in the production, the higher the fracture toughness where it can be improved up to 45 % (from 0. 6 to 0. 86 MPa. m 0. 5), and lead for less dust during physical contact. New attrition parameters were proposed in order to better understand the fracture mechanisms of Si granules and other brittle microspheres. These parameters provide a relationship between the mechanical properties (indentation techniques), fracture behavior and failure mechanisms using both crushing tests and impact tests. Part of this thesis also focused on making a beneficial use of the Si nanopowders that are considered secondary products from FBR.

The composite consists of an element with shape memory effect (SME) {{in the form of}} ribbon, film or plate connected rigidly to an element of an elastic material. The novel feature in this scheme is that an SME element should be preliminary given the uniaxial pseudoplastic tensile straining. This operation promotes the martensite twins formation along the stretching axis and results in the maximal longitudinal deformation of SME element. Such scheme provides a well-controlled high reversible bending deformation of the composite, though only one-way SME of the material is used.
