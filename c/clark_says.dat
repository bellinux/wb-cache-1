2500|$|Underwood {{had noticed}} {{a couple of}} gaps in the {{coverage}} of the murders. She thought it odd that no one had interviewed Clark's parents. Underwood managed to locate them and they gave her an exclusive interview and photographs. [...] Underwood's interview with Clark's parents appeared in the paper under the headline [...] "Mrs. <b>Clark</b> <b>Says</b> Son is Innocent", earning her a double column by-line.|$|E
2500|$|According to author Jerome Clark, {{the story}} of the Chase Vault appears to {{originate}} from anecdotes told by Thomas H. Orderson, Rector of Christ Church during the 1800s. Orderson gave [...] "conflicting accounts" [...] of the tale, each containing variations. <b>Clark</b> <b>says</b> the story was subsequently repeated in Alexander's 1833 Transatlantic Sketches, and further repeated the same year in the [...] "Anecdote Gallery" [...] section of Reuben Percy's The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.|$|E

5000|$|On 6 August 2016, Kilmarnock {{announced}} they had {{turned down an}} offer of £100,000 possibly rising to £200,000 for Magennis from Charlton Athletic. Earlier that day he had {{been left out of}} Kilmarnock's squad to play Motherwell, with manager Lee <b>Clark</b> <b>saying</b> Magennis had told him he [...] "didn't feel right for today's game." [...] Earlier in the week, Kilmarnock had also rejected a bid from Oldham Athletic.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Clark</b> <b>says</b> {{that most}} stories that proliferated about the Chase Vault {{referred}} back to sources {{that could be}} traced to one of Orderson's accounts, and that folklorist Andrew Lang identified the differing versions told by Orderson in a December 1907 article published in Folk-Lore Journal. After combing through existing documentation to determine the veracity of the Chase Vault stories, Lang reported that he could find nothing to substantiate them, either in the burial register of Christ Church or in contemporary newspapers on Barbados, aside from an [...] "unpublished firsthand account" [...] by a Nathan Lucas, {{who claimed to be}} present {{at the opening of the}} vault in April 1820.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of her essay, Clark {{considers}} the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of [...] "the classics" [...] is important to society as a whole. <b>Clark</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "teachers of English have been so long trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to them very much like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears." [...] She {{goes on to say that}} among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: [...] "What do you understand by the classics in literature?" [...] Two of the answers Clark received were [...] "Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children" [...] and [...] "Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states [...] "Schools and universities ought to help us understand that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite." [...] Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', that in just the act of analysis or as <b>Clark</b> <b>says</b> [...] "the anatomical dissection", the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.|$|E
2500|$|Less subtle was {{the racism}} at school, where <b>Clark</b> <b>says</b> {{he and his}} sister got into fights with schoolmates {{in the first grade}} who called them “niggers” and “cottonheads”. [...] Adding to his sense of {{identity}} confusion was the fact that African Americans did not accept him either, and called him and his sister “wiggers”, on which Clark comments, “It’s real unsettling when you’re young and don’t know which group you belong to.” [...] Today, Clark reflects on his multiethnic heritage with pride, and says he wishes more people were open-minded about interracial dating, saying, “Our family could claim to be the ultimate melting pot,” and that being of so many different ethnicities gave him the ability to [...] "adapt to any situation".|$|E
5000|$|On June 13, 1967, President Johnson {{nominated}} Marshall to the Supreme Court {{following the}} retirement of Justice Tom C. <b>Clark,</b> <b>saying</b> that this was [...] "the right thing to do, {{the right time to}} do it, the right man and the right place." [...] Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69-11 on August 30, 1967. He was the 96th person to hold the position, and the first African American.|$|R
5000|$|Democrat Tarryl Clark, {{the state}} Senate {{assistant}} majority leader, received {{the endorsement of}} the DFL Party and was the sole Democratic challenger to Bachmann's seat, Maureen Reed having dropped out of the race in June 2010. Reed, a former University of Minnesota regent chair and a physician, threw her support behind <b>Clark</b> <b>saying</b> she felt [...] "it is time for the DFL to unify behind one candidate in this race". Independence Party candidate Bob Anderson and independent Aubrey Immelman also ran.|$|R
5000|$|By 2014, Singapore Airlines had {{phased out}} the type, discontinuing SQ21 and SQ22, {{which had been}} the longest {{non-stop}} scheduled flights in the world. Emirates Airlines decided to accelerate the retirement of its A340 fleet, writing down {{the value of the}} A340-500 type to zero despite the oldest -500 only being 10 years old, with president Tim <b>Clark</b> <b>saying</b> they [...] "designed in the late 1990s with fuel at $25-30. They fell over at $60 and at $120 they haven’t got a hope in hell".|$|R
2500|$|The Smallville {{television}} series featured the {{character in the}} episode titled [...] "Krypto" [...] during its fourth season. Although in this version, Krypto's powers seem {{to be limited to}} strength, developed as a product of experiments with kryptonite at Luther Corp, and are temporary. [...] The dog is found by a teenage Lois Lane and brought to the Kent farm. In the final scene when the Kent family and Lois are deciding on a name, Lois drapes a red towel around the dog after giving it a bath, which mimics a cape. Clark [...] considers naming him [...] "Krypto". When Lex asks the meaning behind the name, <b>Clark</b> <b>says</b> that it's because of his [...] origins. Lois dislikes the name, telling him, [...] "You can't name your next dog Krypto." [...] He eventually names the dog [...] "Shelby" [...] after one of Martha's old dogs. Clark feels that it was a better name over Lois' choice: [...] "Clarky." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Robert I. Frost the House of Hohenzollern, Wehlau-Bromberg was a [...] "major geopolitical {{gain and}} surge in wealth and prestige", while Poland had [...] "substantially benefited" [...] from Brandenburgian support during the war., the {{concessions}} Poland made in Wehlau and Bromberg were thought as tactical {{and open to}} later reversal - which however did not happen due to the internal weakness of the commonwealth. Christopher M. <b>Clark</b> <b>says</b> that John Casimir of Poland was {{on the one hand}} [...] "eager to separate Brandenburg from Sweden and to neutralize it as a military threat" [...] when Poland-Lithuania was threatened by the Tsardom of Russia, {{and on the other hand}} was ready to accept the Hohenzollerns' demands due to pressure by the House of Habsburg, who after the emperor's incidental death earlier that year needed to secure the elector's vote, and whose [...] "urgings [...] carried a considerable weight, since the Poles were counting on Austrian assistance in the event of a renewed Swedish or Russian attack." [...] Clark thus views Frederick William as a [...] "beneficiary of international developments beyond his control," [...] and verifies his thesis by the post-Bromberg developments, where the elector lost all further war gains due to French intervention at the Treaty of Oliva.|$|E
2500|$|Stung by the criticism, Gwynn {{was miserable}} {{the rest of}} the season and became {{withdrawn}} and distrustful among his teammates. Conscious of being perceived as selfish, he altered his hitting style by attempting to pull the ball to move runners in situations where he would normally hit to the opposite field. Rumors that he might be traded affected his play. In September, Gwynn was upset when a figurine of his likeness was hanging in effigy in the Padres' dugout, and race became an issue due to the undercurrent of lynchings being evoked with Gwynn being black and Clark being white. The Padres said a groundskeeper was responsible, but Gwynn believed it was a cover-up. Clark denied any involvement. After breaking his right index finger mid-month in Atlanta while trying to make a catch at the wall, Gwynn missed the final 19 games of the season. He left the team for the season to avoid contact with the media and teammates. He was further upset that neither management nor other teammates came to his defense at the time. He later regretted saying he wanted to avoid his teammates in general instead of being more specific which ones he was referring to. [...] "It just involved one great guy, and that's Tony Gwynn, and anything they want to say about Tony Gwynn is going to be news. It got all blown out of proportion", Carter said. Gwynn countered, [...] "I've been doing the same things my whole career, playing the same way. Now, why is it an issue? Because Jack <b>Clark</b> <b>says</b> it is." [...] Gwynn finished the season batting [...]309, ranking sixth in the league but the lowest average of any full season in his career; he had entered the season with a [...]332 career average. However, his 72RBI that season were a then-career high. He also began experiencing soreness and swelling in his left knee. The cartilage under his kneecap was wearing out, which doctors attributed to his playing basketball and baseball year-round for seven years from high school through college.|$|E

[...] Caffall's family also issued statements of apology, with his sister Courtney <b>Clark</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and this is just a senseless tragedy...We are just distraught by the havoc that he has caused." ...|$|R
500|$|Johnson {{appointed}} Marshall to the Supreme Court {{following the}} retirement of Justice Tom C. <b>Clark,</b> <b>saying</b> that this was [...] "the right thing to do, {{the right time to}} do it, the right man and the right place." [...] Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 31, 1967. Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, that a lot of black baby boys would be named [...] "Thurgood" [...] in honor of this choice (in fact, Kearns's research of birth records in New York and Boston indicates that Johnson's prophecy did not come true).|$|R
50|$|Further {{allegations}} of improper behaviour {{were made by}} the Television New Zealand Sunday program on 27 August 2006, which led to Prime Minister Helen <b>Clark</b> <b>saying</b> that Field should reconsider his future as an MP. Police launched an investigation the following day into claims that Field had benefited from helping people with immigration applications. Field was put on indefinite paid leave from Parliament by the Labour Party. After Field made comments to the media that he might run against the Labour Party in a future election, steps were taken on 13 February 2007 by Labour to expel Field from the party.|$|R

It's a song that talks about living life to its fullest, being a man about your responsibilities and not compromising. As soon as I heard it, I knew I had to cut it -- and call the album that -- because it says everything about the way you live your life, and what life can be if you refuse to buy into limits, which, as someone who's read all his books, is everything Hemingway's novels revolved around." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was during}} the hearing that, when {{questioned}} directly on the matter, Meadow made his first public apology for the effect of his 'misleading' evidence. He cited {{the reasons for the}} delay as being 'legal advice' and 'professional etiquette'. The failure to apologise, and not admitting that he was wrong, was the reason why Sally Clark's father, Frank Lockyer, had raised his concerns about Meadow with the GMC. [...] His failure to apologise spontaneously was not his first departure from good ethical conduct in this case; during a break at Clark's committal hearing at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court Meadow had approached the defence team and addressed Sally <b>Clark</b> <b>saying,</b> 'this terrible for me, it must be awful for you.' As a Consultant Paediatrician and experienced court expert witness he must have known this was a disrespectful, inappropriate and inflammatory action. He was instructed by Clark's barrister Michael Mackey to 'go away'.|$|R
