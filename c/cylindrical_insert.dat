30|$|The most {{striking}} observation {{to emerge from}} the data comparison is the difference between dose values obtained with MC codes (namely, MCNP and Raydose) and other algorithms. The foremost cause of the slightly lower dose values obtained with Raydose is most probably due to the resampling of the CT grid from 512  ×  512 to 128  ×  128, executed for efficiency purposes. The larger voxel size, together with the inhomogeneity in the underlying PET images, produced a smoothing of the activity data. This is evident in the fine distribution of the dose (Fig.  6 a–e): DVHs obtained with Raydose do not present any high-dose tail as any hot spots in a single voxel are shared with adjoining voxels. This is likely to produce lower doses especially at the liquid–PMMA interface. On the other hand, the lower doses obtained using MCNP could be interpreted as being a result of: (i) the input activity concentration, supposed to be uniformly distributed over the entire cylindrical object and (ii) the absence of spill-in activity from regions around the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>insert</b> in MCNP simulations. This is likely to result in a lower dose to the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>insert.</b>|$|E

A further advantage is that Region Of Interest (ROI) definition can be limited to only a few axial slices, thus minimizing time averaging. Furthermore, ROI selection requires only approximate placement around the target artery, encompassing both artery and background tissue, so that recovered data values are not operator-dependent.

The impact of the PMMA wall on dose calculations is somehow expected and inevitable, given the non-negligible presence of acrylic material (4.98  g) if compared to the total mass of the insert when filled with 90 YCl 3 (24.1  g). From a computational perspective, there is no substantial material difference between tumor and background liver.
