40|$|This study {{characterizes the}} <b>central</b> {{recirculation}} <b>zones</b> formed under combustion conditions, with natural gas as fuel with different geometries and degrees of premixing using a swirl combustor firing into a confinement representative of gas turbine combustors. Phase-locked particle image velocimetry {{is used as}} the main method of characterization. The technique enables characterization of the time-dependent behavior of the <b>central</b> recirculation <b>zone</b> and a three-dimensional reconstruction of its boundaries. The <b>central</b> recirculation <b>zone</b> typically had an asymmetric lobed shape and precessed about the central axis. Partially premixed combustion at near-stoichiometric equivalence ratios reduced the coherence of the <b>central</b> recirculation <b>zone</b> and often caused it to nearly disappear, although a small remnant of recirculation could still {{be found in the}} three-dimensional space. Lower equivalence ratios strengthened the <b>central</b> recirculation <b>zone</b> considerably, for both non-premixed and partially premixed combustion. Although the <b>central</b> recirculation <b>zone</b> was asymmetric in shape and precessed about the central axis, the precessing vortex core, commonly found in these flows, was found to be significantly suppressed especially when central fuel injectors were used. Its occurrence then became intermittent and irregular. A quarl exit nozzle with a divergent lip was found to reduce flame attachment to the fuel injector...|$|R
