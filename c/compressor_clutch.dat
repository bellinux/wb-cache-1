50|$|Priced {{considerably}} {{higher than the}} Escort, the EXP carried an ample list of standard equipment. It included power brakes, full instrumentation, full carpeting, map lighting, electric back window defroster, power hatchback release, a digital clock, a cargo area security shade , and rims that are noticeably wider than those of Escorts'. Models with a manual transmission had a sport-tuned exhaust. Automatic models had a wide-open throttle cutout switch for the optional air conditioning <b>compressor</b> <b>clutch.</b> Other options include floor vents or air conditioning , AM/FM radio , cruise control , roof luggage rack , rear window wiper , various seat styles and fabrics , removable sunroof , right hand mirror , TRX tires and shocks , child seat , and a very wide variety of colors inside and out with many various pinstripes and other painted decals.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the Air Conditioning system in a heavy duty truck {{and to develop a}} control strategy for the case when low cooling capacity is needed from the AC-system. A model of the AC-system was developed in order for an efficient controller to be designed. The model was designed to comprise of all the basic behaviours that the AC- system has, rather than to be an exact model of the system. As the AC-system showed to be very complex, a number of limitations in the model had to be made. The AC-system has two temperature sensors and is actuated by turning the AC- compressor on or off. Two different control strategies were tested for the control of the AC-compressor. The first was to use a controller to directly control the <b>compressor</b> <b>clutch</b> and the second one utilised a pulswidth modulated control structure were the controller stated the pulswidth to be used. Both control structures were implemented in the computer model, the AC-rig and in a truck in a climate chamber. Both control strategies showed to fulfil the demands on the system in the somewhat idealistic circumstances during which they were tested...|$|E
40|$|Mobile air {{conditioning}} circulating oil concentration and compressor start-up torque were experimentally investigated {{to develop a}} control strategy to improve compressor reliability. An installed electronic expansion valve provided the control actuation. Realtime circulating oil concentration data were obtained for steady-state, quasi-steady, and start-up operating regimes with an installed optical concentration sensor. A two-phase refrigerant-oil model was developed for R 134 a and polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil to predict oil film thickness, average film velocity, and interfacial shear between the refrigerant vapor and the refrigerant-oil liquid film. Experimental and model results were analyzed and compared. Evaporator superheat reduced the circulating oil concentration due {{to an increase in}} the oil film thickness {{on the walls of the}} evaporator and suction line. The model predicted oil film thickness to increase by a factor of four as refrigerant quality approaches one. Increasing the refrigerant-mass flow rate only exhibited secondary effects due to slightly thinner oil films and a correspondingly higher circulating oil concentration. The influences of charge distribution, expansion valve position, compressor head pressure, and refrigerant charge level on start-up torque and initial capacity were investigated. Closing the expansion valve while the <b>compressor</b> <b>clutch</b> is disengaged was found to reduce the start-up torque by retaining the refrigerant in the system high side and preserving a pressure gradient across the expansion valve.

40|$|Even {{if the air}} {{conditioning}} is switched off, {{the internal combustion engine}} in todayâ€™s cars continues to drive the common compressor. To avoid resulting power losses, the automotive industry aspires to apply electromagnetic clutches. When the {{air conditioning}} is used, however, CO 2 -emission increases significantly because the electromag-netic coil consumes electricity. The CO 2 -reduction per year is consequently very low, which is why new <b>compressor</b> <b>clutches</b> were developed that do not require a permanent electric power supply. Additionally, these clutches are characterized by low production costs, a simple functional principle and a small package...|$|R
50|$|The Eland {{was used}} to power various {{aircraft}} including the Westland Westminster heavy-lift helicopter, the Canadair CL-66; a turbine-powered version of the Convair CV-340 for the Canadian military(later converted to Allison T-56 propjets {{after a number of}} engine failures), and the Fairey Rotodyne gyrodyne. In the Rotodyne, the Eland powered the tractor propellors for forward flight and a <b>compressor,</b> via a <b>clutch</b> and shaft arrangement, to feed the rotor tip-jets with compressed air for vertical flight.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} {{engine was}} not officially accepted, {{because at that}} time the US government was informed of British work on jet engines. However, Price was encouraged by USAAF officials at Wright Field to refine his design. His redesign incorporated two sixteen-stage axial compressors with a single stage of intercooling. The first four stages of the forward <b>compressor</b> remained <b>clutched</b> to allow them to operate at optimum speed. The turbine was reduced to four stages. The low-pressure compressor was encased in a two-part cylindrical casing with stiffening ribs, which gave it an odd appearance similar to the bottom of an egg carton. The shorter high-pressure compressor was similarly encased but with ribs running front-to-back only. Power was taken off between the two compressor stages to power accessories, with the gearbox placed {{on the top of the}} engine outside of the compressor casings.|$|R
40|$|Compared {{to other}} {{air-conditioning}} and refrigeration systems, mobile air-conditioning systems are {{unique in the}} respect that they operate almost entirely under transient conditions. The major operating transients include: (i) changes in compressor speed due to variations in vehicle engine speed, (ii) changes in condenser air flow due to ram-air effects {{at the front of}} the vehicle, (iii) changes in the passenger compartment air temperature during a pulldown mode, and (iv) cycling of the <b>compressor</b> <b>clutch</b> to prevent evaporator frosting. A versatile experimental facility has been developed to permit testing of mobile alc systems under a wide variety of both transient and steady-state operating conditions. The facility serves as a flexible test bed for the development and validation of transient system models, advanced mobile alc control techniques, and on-board diagnostic tools for mobile applications. The air- and refrigerant-side loops of the facility are thoroughly instrumented and can accommodate the stock or prototype components of nearly any mobile alc system. The facility makes extensive use of controlled system-input devices which allow the researcher to simulate the majority of the transient operating conditions encountered by mobile alc systems in field usage. Transient demonstration tests show that the facility is an excellent tool for conducting modeling, control, and diagnostic studies. Steadystate validation tests show that the evaporator- and condenser-side energy balances are in need of improvement. Sources of error have been identified, and an appropriate plan of corrective action has been established. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 5...|$|E
40|$|In {{most of the}} Automotive Air Conditioning Systems (AACSs) {{though the}} {{compressor}} is powered by the car engine, the evaporator blower and the condenser fan are run by an alternator. Further, this alternator is powered from engine shaft. If there is any fault in the alternator that must drop the output voltage. This variation in output voltage can be achieved from a car battery by regulating its charging current. Owing to this, a stationary test rig for an AACS is developed with all actual automotive components coupled {{with a large number}} of sensors and additional accessories. However, the present investigation is restricted only to its air conditioning system, the alternator is replaced by a 12 volt lead acid car battery (capacity: 36 Ah) to invigorate the maneuvering of <b>compressor</b> <b>clutch</b> engagement and disengagement as well, empowerment of the prime movers. Now, a continuous monitoring of the system performance is done at different battery charge level. A DC power source is used to keep the battery voltage constant in different levels by varying the charging current. Further, in each battery charge level tests are conducted at three different blower speeds by regulating the existing toggle switch of the automobile. It is observed that the evaporator blower and the condenser fan speeds reduces continuously with the discharging of the storage battery, resulting a certain drop in air flow rate across the heat exchangers. Hence, the discharge pressure and the temperature increases due to lack of proper cooling across the condenser. Here, the continuous monitoring of the battery discharge voltage {{and its impact on the}} deterioration on the system cooling capacity, compression work and the COP are reported...|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, on 19 May 1943 Price {{agreed to}} start a more radical {{redesign}} {{at the urging of}} Wright Field. He produced a much simpler design consisting of two sixteen-stage axial compressors with a single stage of intercooling between them. The first four stages of the frontmost <b>compressor</b> remained <b>clutched</b> to allow them to operate at optimum speed. For testing purposes the compressor blades had no airfoil shaping and were attached to the central hub on rotating mounts to allow their angles to be changed between runs. The turbine was reduced to four stages. The low-pressure compressor was encased in a two-part cylindrical casing with stiffening ribs, which gave it an odd appearance similar to the bottom of an egg carton. The shorter high-pressure compressor was similarly encased but with ribs running front-to-back only. Power was taken off between the two compressor stages to power accessories, with the gearbox placed {{on the top of the}} engine outside of the compressor casings.|$|R
40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} of portable air conditioner which integrated with some available components in automotive air conditioning system. This new idea intends to solve the storage problems {{as well as to}} reduce the price of current portable air conditioner since some devices could directly be used from the automotive air conditioning system. The primary emphasis of this study was on the modification of automotive compressor design so as the system may alternately be operated. The length of conventional compressor shaft is extended to place an additional clutch pulley, a drive plate and a clutch coil. The new concept particularly the shaft and pulley were analysed through slope deflection and computational finite element analyses. The result of engineering analyses exhibited that the new design of <b>compressor</b> shaft and <b>clutch</b> pulleys promote a low risk of failure as the data values recorded are lower than the critical value for each criterion investigated...|$|R
