5000|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Rolls</b> (also {{known as}} CC Rolls) {{are usually the}} mating roll in a press arrangement. They have {{hydraulic}} cylinders in the press rolls that ensure that the roll does not bow. The cylinders connect to a shoe or multiple shoes to keep the <b>crown</b> on the <b>roll</b> flat, to counteract the natural [...] "bend" [...] in the roll shape due to applying load to the edges.|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{compensating}} for roll deformation include continual varying crown (CVC), pair cross rolling, and work roll bending. CVC {{was developed by}} SMS-Siemag AG and involves grinding a third order polynomial curve into the work rolls and then shifting the work rolls laterally, equally, and opposite to each other. The effect is that the rolls will have a gap between them that is parabolic in shape, and will vary with lateral shift, thus allowing for <b>control</b> of the <b>crown</b> of the <b>rolls</b> dynamically. Pair cross rolling involves using either flat or parabolically <b>crowned</b> <b>rolls,</b> but shifting the ends at an angle so that {{the gap between the}} edges of the rolls will increase or decrease, thus allowing for dynamic <b>crown</b> <b>control.</b> Work <b>roll</b> bending involves using hydraulic cylinders at the ends of the rolls to counteract roll deflection.|$|R

30|$|A vector {{evaluation}} method for overall {{control of the}} whole crown and center crown was proposed by Peng, et al. [59]. The method {{can be used to}} analyze {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} 6 -high HC, 6 -high CVC, 4 -high CVC, and ordinary 4 -high mills and thus serves as an analytical tool and an important reference for rolling mill type selection. Xv[60] proposed a set of complete evaluation indexs system for shape control performance. The seven specific indexes are the adjustment range of the <b>roll</b> gap <b>crown,</b> <b>roll</b> gap transverse stiffness, uniformity of contact pressure among <b>rolls,</b> <b>crown</b> <b>control</b> performance of <b>roll</b> bending, edge drop control performance, shape controlling actuator efficiency, and the basic <b>crown</b> of loaded <b>roll</b> gap. This set of index system provides the measure for the comprehensive performance evaluation of various rolling mills. Liu [61] introduced two new indexes including the adjustment range of shape and shape control performance of roll bending, which make the indexs system more scientific and practical.|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Agrobacterium radiobacter K 84, 0341, and a K 84 non-agrocin-producing mutant (K 84 Agr-) in biological <b>control</b> of <b>crown</b> gall on rootstocks of stone fruit trees was determined in three experiments. In experiment 1, K 84 and 0341 <b>controlled</b> <b>crown</b> gall on plum plants in soil inoculated with two strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens resistant to agrocin 84. In experiment 2, K 84 <b>controlled</b> <b>crown</b> gall on peach plants in soils inoculated with strains of A. tumefaciens sensitive or resistant to agrocin 84 {{or with a}} mixture of both. However, the {{effectiveness of}} K 84 was higher against the sensitive strain than against the resistant strain. There was a residual effect of K 84 from one year to another in soil inoculated with the sensitive strains. In experiment 3, K 84 and K 84 Agr- <b>controlled</b> <b>crown</b> gall on plum and peach plants in soils inoculated with strains of A. tumefaciens sensitive or resistant to agrocin 84.

50|$|The {{next day}} is August 21, Crown Day, and the {{children}} wake to find themselves inside the litter being strapped to Holger's back. They are not discovered, and the Crown Day parade commences. The party reaches a bridge and springs the plan into action: Holger uses his trunk to blow a smoke screen, grabs the crown, and passes it to the concealed children. He pretends that the <b>crown</b> <b>rolled</b> off the bridge. The king's party desperately searches the water, which allows the children to escape with the crown. Disgraced, Fatback and Clemens skip town that night.|$|R

The King hopped about till his {{slippers}} flew off, his dressing-gown fluttered like great wings, and his <b>crown</b> <b>rolled</b> {{off from}} his head and across the floor, like a quoit at the fair. As for the Princess, she never danced in all of her life as she danced that morning. They made such a noise that the soldiers of the Royal Guard came running in; but the two tall black men spared them {{no more than the}} King and the Princess. Then came all of the Lords of the Council, and they likewise danced to the same music as the rest.|$|R

40|$|Asymmetric rolling is used {{to produce}} thinner strip, which can reduce rolling force significantly. When a thinner strip is rolled on a rolling mill, work roll edge may contact each other, which affects the {{mechanics}} of this special asymmetric rolling and the <b>crown</b> of the <b>rolled</b> strip. In this paper, the authors developed a numerical model to simulate this special rolling and obtained the rolling force, intermediate force, roll edge contact force, the <b>crown</b> of the <b>rolled</b> strip and the edge contact length. The effects of the initial thickness of strip and the friction variation at upper and lower work rolls on the rolling force and <b>crown</b> of the <b>rolled</b> strip are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} calculating the {{continuously}} variable <b>crown</b> work <b>roll</b> contour and the relevant constraint conditions under CVC cyclical shifting mode are proposed.

Improvement in the continuously variable <b>crown</b> work <b>roll</b> contour has been implemented on the 1800 -mm compact strip production line. This {{has resulted in the}} shifting stroke for the main strip width increasing by 30 %, the work roll wear being more uniform and the strip cross-section shape being better. The qualified rate of strip crown has risen from 98 to 99. 5 %, and the qualified rate of strip head flatness has increased from 80 to 91 %...|$|R
60|$|It was at {{this moment}} that Bilbil, in his mad dash from Regos, turned in {{at the gates of}} the courtyard, and as he was coming one way and Queen Cor was going the other they bumped into each other with great force. The woman sailed through the air, over Bilbil's head, and landed on the ground outside the gates, where her <b>crown</b> <b>rolled</b> into a ditch and she picked herself up, half dazed, and {{continued}} her flight. Bilbil was also somewhat dazed by the unexpected encounter, but he continued his rush rather blindly and so struck poor Rinkitink, who was chasing after Queen Cor. They rolled over one another a few times and then Rinkitink sat up and Bilbil sat up and {{they looked at each other}} in amazement.|$|R

40|$|A carbon ion gantry {{would allow}} the {{irradiation}} of cancer patients with carbon ions from any direction in space best suited for therapy. Till today, such a machine has not been built due to the expected size, mass and cost. A novel design, called "Riesenrad" ion gantry, promises to provide a competitive solution. The {{central part of the}} Riesenrad, which can rotate ± 90 °, is supported (statically determinate) on pendular bearing units with two rollers each. High precision requirements for the structure rule out any plastic deformations in the area of contact. The present report describes the design of the highly-loaded rollers. In order to achieve a large contact area and a uniform distribution of contact stresses, a "barrel shape" for the rollers is proposed.

50|$|Steps can {{be taken}} to <b>control</b> <b>crown</b> gall disease and reduce the risk of infection. Injured sites on vines, such as those caused by {{freezing}} or cutting injuries, are especially susceptible to infection. Planting in frost-prone areas or areas with poor drainage should therefore be avoided. Reducing other grapevine stressors, such as nutrient deprivation and low soil pH, also limits susceptibility. Additionally, some cultivars are resistant to crown gall disease. Vitis vinifera is generally susceptible to crown gall disease, but resistant grape species can be planted preferentially.|$|R
40|$|The non-pathogenic Agrobacterium radiobacter strain K 84 and its genetically {{modified}} (GEM) strain K 1026 were tested for their effectiveness against local Tunisian strains and two reference strains (C 58 and B 6) {{of the crown}} gall bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Tests in planta were carried out on herbaceous plants (tomato and tagetes) and on some sensitive rootstocks (bitter almond, peach almond hybrid GF 677 and quince BA 29). In vitro tests showed that both K 84 and K 1026 were effective and {{that the difference between}} these strains was not statistically significant. On tomato and tagetes, strain K 84 was effective against all crown gall isolates {{with the exception of the}} A. tumefaciens reference strain B 6. GEM strain K 1026 was very effective against all isolates from Tunisia and against the reference strains. Both antagonistic strains significantly reduced the percentage of galled plants as well as the number of galls per plant. Under field conditions, both antagonists <b>controlled</b> <b>crown</b> gall effectively. Best results were obtained on the bitter almond-tree rootstock.

40|$|This work {{presents}} improved {{technology for}} attaining high-quality rolled metal strip. The {{new technology is}} based on an innovative method to model both the static and dynamic characteristics of rolling mill deflection, and it applies equally to both cluster-type and non cluster-type rolling mill configurations. By effectively combining numerical Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with analytical solid mechanics, the devised approach delivers a rapid, accurate, flexible, high-fidelity model useful for optimizing many important rolling parameters. The associated static deflection model enables computation of the thickness profile and corresponding flatness of the rolled strip. Accurate methods of predicting the strip thickness profile and strip flatness are important in rolling mill design, rolling schedule set-up, control of mill flatness actuators, and optimization of ground roll profiles. The corresponding dynamic deflection model enables solution of the standard eigenvalue problem to determine natural frequencies and modes of vibration. The presented method for solving the roll-stack deflection problem offers several important advantages over traditional methods. In particular, it includes continuity of elastic foundations, non-iterative solution when using pre-determined elastic foundation moduli, continuous third-order displacement fields, simple stress-field determination, the ability to calculate dynamic characteristics, and a comparatively faster solution time. Consistent with the most advanced existing methods, the presented method accommodates loading conditions that represent <b>roll</b> <b>crowning,</b> <b>roll</b> bending, roll shifting, and roll crossing mechanisms. Validation of the static model is provided by comparing results and solution time with large-scale, commercial finite element simulations. In addition to examples with the common 4 -high vertical stand rolling mill, application of the presented method to the most complex of rolling mill configurations is demonstrated with an optimization example involving the 20 -high Sendzimir mill...|$|R
6000|$|... "The poor dumb {{beast of}} {{humanity}} rose, and the throne tumbled, and the sceptre was broken, and the <b>crown</b> <b>rolled</b> away into that {{darkness of the}} past. We thought that heaven had descended to us, and that liberty, equality, and fraternity were ours. We could not see what should again alienate us from one another, or how one brother could again oppress another. With a free field and no favor we believed we should prosper on together, {{and there would be}} peace and plenty for all. We had the republic again after so many ages now, and the republic, as we knew it in our dim annals, was brotherhood and universal happiness. All but a very few, who prophesied evil of our lawless freedom, were wrapped in a delirium of hope. Men's minds and men's hands were suddenly released to an activity unheard of before. Invention followed invention; our rivers and seas became the warp of commerce where the steam-sped shuttles carried the woof of enterprise to and fro with tireless celerity; machines to save labor multiplied themselves {{as if they had been}} procreative forces, and wares of every sort were produced with incredible swiftness and cheapness.

25|$|Biological control {{methods are}} also {{utilized}} in managing this disease. In the 1970's and 1980's, A commonly used practice for treating germinated seeds, seedlings, and rootstock was to soak the plant parts in a suspension of K84, a related but not pathogenic species of Agrobacterium, A. radiobacter. K84 produces a bacteriocin (agrocin 84) {{which is an}} antiobiotic specific against related bacteria, including A. tumefaciens.This method, which was successful at controlling the disease on a commercial scale, had the risk of K84 transferring its resistance gene to the pathogenic Agrobacteria. Thus, in the 1990's, use of a genetically engineering strain of K84, known as K-1026, was created. This strain is just as successful in <b>controlling</b> <b>crown</b> gall as K84 without the caveat of resistance gene transfer.|$|R
