5000|$|The Rome Statute {{established}} {{four core}} international crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and {{the crime of}} aggression. Those crimes [...] "shall {{not be subject to}} any statute of limitations". Under the Rome Statute, the ICC can only investigate and prosecute the four <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> in situations where states are [...] "unable" [...] or [...] "unwilling" [...] to do so themselves. The court has jurisdiction over crimes only if they are committed in the territory of a state party or if they are committed by a national of a state party; an exception to this rule is that the ICC may also have jurisdiction over crimes if its jurisdiction is authorized by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E
5000|$|A {{crime against}} peace, in {{international}} law, is [...] "planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of wars of aggression, or {{a war in}} violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment {{of any of the}} foregoing". This definition of crimes against peace was first incorporated into the Nuremberg Principles and later included in the United Nations Charter. This definition would play a part in defining aggression as a crime against peace. It can also refer to the <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> set out in Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, (genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression) which adopted crimes negotiated previously in the Draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind.|$|E
40|$|Armed {{conflicts}} {{result in}} too many atrocities being committed. Once a conflict is over, {{the criminal justice system}} of the affected country should ideally hold accountable those responsible for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> Often, the number of crimes is so high that the criminal justice system simply cannot address all of them through regular criminal procedure. This results in a backlog of such cases within the system. This thesis examines the prospect for introduction of an abbreviated criminal procedure for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> and arrives at a set of components and principles under which such procedure may be developed. It also raises arguments for and against introduction of this mechanism in national law. The purpose of this mechanism would be to assist states to fulfil their international obligation to prosecute and punish <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> without compromising principles of due process...|$|E
40|$|The Alien Tort Statute is a 1789 US {{provision}} {{used for}} raising claims on <b>international</b> <b>core</b> <b>crimes</b> even when committed against foreigners, on foreign soil and with foreign corporations’ complicity.

However, {{most of the cases}} are dismissed on prudential doctrines, subject-matter jurisdiction and extraterritorial application issues. The discussion has generally become highly contested since a circuit court unprecedentedly held that corporations cannot be liable under international law, and the US Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari hearing, subsequently, submissions on corporate immunity for <b>international</b> <b>core</b> <b>crimes.</b> This work seeks to contribute to the discussion on the domestic protection of human rights.

5000|$|The Rome Statute {{established}} four <b>core</b> <b>international</b> crimes: genocide, <b>crimes</b> against humanity, war crimes, {{and crime}} of aggression. Following years of negotiation, aimed at establishing a permanent international tribunal to prosecute individuals accused of genocide and other serious <b>international</b> <b>crimes,</b> such as crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression, the United Nations General Assembly convened a five-week diplomatic conference in Rome in June 1998 [...] "to finalize and adopt a convention on {{the establishment of}} an international criminal court". On 17 July 1998, the Rome Statute was adopted by a vote of 120 to 7, with 21 countries abstaining. Because the way each delegation voted was officially unrecorded, there is some dispute over the identity of the seven countries that voted against the treaty. It is certain that the People's Republic of China, Israel, and the United States were three of the seven because they have publicly confirmed their negative votes; India, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen have been identified by various observers and commentators as possible sources for the other four negative votes, with Iraq, Libya, Qatar, and Yemen being the four most commonly identified.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a gap exists between the universal consensus among all States regarding the criminalisation of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on the one hand, and the prevalence of impunity on the other. It then puts forward the hypothesis that this gap {{may be explained by}} the unsuitability of the approach taken by the international community {{to address the issue of}} responsibility for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> In order to test this hypothesis, this thesis critically examines the different forms of responsibility for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> available in International Law. One of the important characteristics that distinguish <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> from other international crimes or ordinary crimes is that they are often committed with the simultaneous participation of several actors, including individual perpetrators, the State and, in some instances, non-state actors. Addressing the impunity for the commission of <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> cannot, therefore, be limited to the lack of consequences for individual perpetrators. This thesis challenges the focus of International Criminal Justice on individual criminal responsibility and argues for a comprehensive approach to responsibility for international crimes, including State and collective responsibility, in order to convey the collective and political features of these crimes. The issue of responsibility for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes has been widely discussed in the scholarly literature, in particular with the development of International Criminal Law. One can observe, however, an imbalance between the amount of research dedicated to the issue of individual criminal responsibility for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> and the issue of State responsibility for international crimes. This imbalance is partly due to the fact that the notion of State criminal responsibility was rejected by a large majority of States, and discussions on these issues were abandoned. The originality of this thesis comes from the broad approach it adopts to examine the issue of responsibility for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> with the aim of bridging the gap between the distinct academic perspectives. It weaves together different approaches to responsibility, from individual responsibility to State responsibility, in order to identify the weaknesses of the current forms of responsibility and to highlight the complementary aspects of the main questions discussed in these different fields of law. The thesis goes beyond highlighting the complementary aspects of the different forms of responsibility for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> and puts forward a concrete proposal to develop a comprehensive normative framework, based on the model of the Responsibility to Protect concept, to implement a comprehensive approach to responsibility. This framework relies on the emergence of a duty to end impunity that lies with the territorial State as well as the international community. The purpose of this comprehensive normative framework is to promote the cooperation and interactions between the different mechanisms available in International Law and designed to deal with issues of responsibility for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes.</b> The proposal is based on the assumption that including the different norms and measures which aim to end impunity within one framework would optimise their synergy to respond to <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> and protect the interests of humanity as a whole...|$|E

40|$|Armed {{conflicts}} with many <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> committed entail many suspects. There are nearly 2000 opened war crimes cases, including almost 10, 000 suspects in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) {{as a result}} of the war which lasted from 1992 to 1995. Since the ICTY was created to try only those who are the most responsible, the majority of cases were left to the BiH national authorities. In order to systematically and responsibly address this issue, the National War Crimes Strategy was adopted in 2008, with the aim to prevent the impunity and prosecute all or at least most of the perpetrators in 15 years from the adoption of the Strategy. It incorporates the case selection and prioritization criteria which should be used when deciding on the case complexity thereby helping prosecutors and judges to find an appropriate forum for trying a specific case and giving the priority to a certain case if its complexity so requires. The essence of the criteria later became part of the Criminal Procedure Code of BiH and allowed for their direct application in criminal proceedings. This thesis examines the prospects and dangers of case selection and prioritization criteria as an approach undertaken by the BiH criminal justice system to tackle the large backlog of <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> cases on its path towards full accountability for crimes committed...|$|E

40|$|The {{relatively}} young, albeit dynamic, {{field of}} international criminal law, spawned by {{the proliferation of}} international criminal courts and tribunals {{over the last two}} decades, has yet to consolidate its theoretical contours, in particular with respect to the clarification of major substantive law concepts. The doctrine of mens rea is among the fundamental concepts that ought to be clearly defined and construed for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. With no general definition of mens rea in either the Charter of the International Military Tribunal (known as the Nuremberg Charter), the Statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), or the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), only the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) introduced a comprehensive legal provision on the mental element of a crime. The judges of the Court breathed life in Article 30 of the Statute in its early jurisprudence. In broad terms, mens rea is a state of guilty mind that a person entertains while committing a crime. It is the one of the most fundamental doctrines in criminal law, be it national or international, since the absence of mens rea {{on the part of a}} perpetrator while committing a crime precludes the attribution of criminal responsibility. Although the law on mens rea in international criminal law takes inspiration from the laws and jurisprudence of common and continental law jurisdictions, the gravity, magnitude, and complexity of <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> impose an obligation to carefully consider how various mens rea standards are applied and construed in the international law context...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 9 June 2014 Examining Board: Professor Martin Scheinin, EUI (Supervisor) Professor Nehal Bhuta, EUI Professor William Schabas, Middlesex University, London Judge Christine Baroness Van den Wyngaert, International Criminal Court. This PhD thesis {{was awarded}} the Cappelletti Prize. Complicity is a {{criminal}} law doctrine that attributes responsibility {{to those who do}} not physically perpetrate the crime. It is an essential mode of liability for <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> because it reaches out to senior political and military leadership. These persons do not usually engage in direct offending, yet in the context of mass atrocities they are often more culpable than foot soldiers. The Statutes of the ad hoc tribunals, hybrid courts and the International Criminal Court expressly provide for different forms of complicity, and domestic legal systems recognize it in one form or another. This is in contrast with alternative modes of liability implied from the Statutes to address the situations with multiple accused removed from {{the scene of the crime}} / (in) direct co-perpetration, extended perpetration and the joint criminal enterprise...|$|E
40|$|A {{disconnection}} {{has historically}} existed between {{international and domestic}} justice. In China, international justice and domestic justice were long treated as two autonomous yet interconnected systems, akin {{to the concept of}} Yin and Yang. With the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002, the two systems began to increasingly work in tandem. The principle of complementarity is one of the cornerstones of the ICC’s architecture, according to which states have primary jurisdiction over the ICC. So long as the legal system of a state can efficiently investigate and prosecute the <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> prohibited in the Rome Statute, the ICC will not intervene. However, if a state is unwilling or unable to investigate and prosecute these crimes, the ICC will invoke the principle of complementarity to step in. Thus, the principle of complementarity has an impact on the national implementation of international criminal law, as well as on its exercise of jurisdiction in many aspects, including for third party states. As a third party state to the ICC, China has ratified a number of international conventions, including those on genocide and torture; China is therefore obliged to prosecute these international crimes by implementing these international conventions into national law. However, the core crimes have thus far not been incorporated into Chinese criminal law. This research work focuses on the possible impact of the principle of complementarity on the implementation of international criminal law in China as a third party state and the future prospects of the relationship between China and the ICC based on this analysis. By so doing, it aims to contribute to the discourse on complementarity for both scholars and practitioners...|$|E

40|$|LL. M. (International Law) The {{establishment}} of the International Criminal Court (ICC), through the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC/Rome Statute) is proof {{that there is a}} general acceptance that leaders who act as aggressors and violate recognized human rights should face international criminal justice at the ICC. To achieve the ideals of the Rome Statute, the Office of the Prosecutor was established to act as a fore-runner and a bridge to victims of the <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> established by the statute, to have access to international justice. The prosecutor while investigating and prosecuting the ‘core’ international crimes is expected to be independent and avoid undue influence. Furthermore, the prosecutor has to be seen to be acting without fear or fear in the execution of his duties in order for the ICC’s establishment not to be perceived as a futile exercise. He or she also has to guard against disrespecting the fiercely protected sovereignty of states, be they party to the Rome Statute or not, as states {{play a major role in}} the execution of the prosecutor’s requests to the court through cooperating with it. The prosecutorial discretion to choose which situation to investigate and which senior official to prosecute is a very sensitive task, with major political implications as the court’s authority has not been universally accepted. In order to balance the prosecutorial independence and his not acting without control various principles and concepts were incorporated into the Rome Statute. They include the complementarity rule, the jurisdiction of the court, admissibility and cooperation with the court; which will form the basis through which the role and function of the prosecutor shall be discussed to analyze if indeed he is independent...|$|E
40|$|The International Criminal Court (the “ICC”), now one decade old, {{is still}} in the process of setting norms as to scope, jurisdiction, and other issues. One issue that has thus far defied {{resolution}} is a key issue of jurisdiction: the place of complementarity in deciding whether certain criminal issues impacting international standards or interests should be decided before the ICC or national tribunals. Although the Rome Statute crystallizes definitions of <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes</b> that may be tried before the ICC, the process of determining whether to leave jurisdiction with the nation or allowing jurisdiction to the ICC continues to lack structure and the appropriate guidance. Different and conflicting approaches have already been voiced, lending urgency to the project of clarifying complementarity during this norm-setting phase in the work of the ICC. This Article recommends a new normative complementary framework for application of core crimes in national jurisdictions. In doing so, this Article recognizes that the Rome Statute was drafted with the intention of covering a broader range of cases than the ICC is currently handling, including the prosecution of alleged war criminals who were at senior, mid-level, and lower levels of authority in committing such crimes. However, the potential scope of the ICC to reach such actors has been progressively narrowed by prosecutorial discretion, resource constraints, and the lack of norm-setting by domestic courts that would encourage a broad jurisdictional understanding at the ICC. This narrowing is not a new phenomenon, but instead a centuries-old pattern of the international community attempting to define the jurisdiction of international criminal processes broadly, only to see those processes narrowed and limited over time. In order to ensure that the ICC can defy those historical patterns and live up to its potential, States Parties to the Rome Statute must do their part with regard to complementarity by interpreting atrocity crimes broadly thereby enabling the prosecution of more war criminals and assisting the ICC in setting positive norms with regard to its jurisdictional reach...|$|E
40|$|LL. M. (International Law) The {{coming into}} force of the Rome Statute of the ICC (International Criminal Court) created a shift in state {{attitude}} in respect of the implementation and enforcement of International Law. In particular, several issues arise concerning the role to be played by states {{in the context of}} complementarity between the ICC and national courts. The ICC has jurisdiction over crimes of the most concern to the international community and its power is limited by, amongst others, the complementarity principle as well as the jurisdiction and functioning of national courts. States parties agreed to establish a permanent court which would put an end to impunity and prevent acts of <b>core</b> <b>international</b> <b>crimes,</b> as well as ensure effective prosecution of international crimes. Under the Rome Statute, states parties are obliged to develop measures at the national level in order to enhance international cooperation with the ICC. The complementarity principle encompasses, amongst others, the duty of every State to exercise criminal jurisdiction over international crimes, to enhance the capacity of national jurisdiction and to implement an appropriate national legal system which provides the same level of guarantee in investigating and prosecuting international crimes as the ICC. Both the ICC and national courts have jurisdiction over core crimes and this concurrent jurisdiction causes conflict between both institutions. The complementarity principle is based on the basis that states should maintain primary responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However,these conflicts do not arise with Ad Hoc tribunals, whose Statutes emphasise the supremacy of the international criminal tribunals over national courts. The complementarity principle is based on the basis that states should maintain primary responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The complementarity principle provides that prosecutions of crimes stipulated under the Rome Statute are primarily the task of states and the ICC is the court of last resort. 6 This primary competence of national courts and the boundary between the two jurisdictions is given expression in article 17 of the Rome Statute. Prosecutions of core crimes before the ICC are only admissible if, and under condition that, an effective prosecution at the national level is threatened by legal, political and factual obstacles...|$|E
