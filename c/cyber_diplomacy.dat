40|$|The {{field of}} {{diplomacy}} {{and that of}} {{international peace and security}} are twin fields in constant flux and turmoil because of the latent dynamisms underlying the activities which make them worthwhile. Existing and emerging threats have necessitated numerous contributions towards a fuller understanding of these fields such that a lot of confusion too has emerged particularly in relation to the newer trends. One such trend is that of <b>cyber</b> <b>diplomacy</b> which has overtaken the traditional rules of etiquette of old diplomatic protocol which was largely limited to states and official state representatives. <b>Cyber</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> on the other hand, is characterised by a peculiar private society dimension, that novel encapsulation in information interchange through computer systems with the private spheres of national and foreign publics thereby causing a rapid decentralisation of certain information functions to the generality of civilians. Admittedly, <b>cyber</b> <b>diplomacy</b> has skated on the tide of globalisation-a staunch force reputed to have carpet-rolled and receded state borders and influence coupled with increasing porosity at international interfaces. Yet this has not been the final nail because increasingly complex <b>cyber</b> <b>diplomacy</b> has been attended with increasingly sophisticated cyber or computer crime which has posed unprecedented threats to the peace and security of states, private organisations and individuals. It was therefore the imperative chief focus of this paper to take time to study the nexus between <b>cyber</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and cyber crime and to draw applicable theoretical underpinnings from it. Much of the hubris for the research was obtained through content and thematic analysis of existing documents and purposive/judgmental techniques. This research concluded that there is an unmistakable connection between <b>cyber</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and cyber crime and also that cyber crime is rising as global communication network connectivity increases...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} health of our digital economies and {{societies}} depend on the core protocols and infrastructure of the Internet. This technical and logical substructure of our digital existence is now in need of protection against unwarranted interference in order to sustain the growth {{and the integrity of}} the global Internet. The Internet's key protocols and infrastructure can be considered a global public good that provides benefits to everyone in the world. Countering the growing state interference with this 'public core of the Internet' requires a new international agenda for Internet governance that departs from the notion of a global public good. Core ingredients of this strategy are: - To establish and disseminate an international norm stipulating that the Internet's public core - its main protocols and infrastructure- should be considered a neutral zone, safeguarded against unwarranted intervention by governments. - To advocate efforts to clearly differentiate at the national and international level between Internet security (security of the Internet infrastructure) and national security (security through the Internet). - To broaden the arena for <b>cyber</b> <b>diplomacy</b> to include new coalitions of states (including the so called 'swing states') and private companies, including the large Internet companies as well as Internet intermediaries such as Internet Service Providers...|$|E
50|$|The work of The Hague Institute is {{organized}} around three programs - Conflict Prevention, Rule of Law, and Global Governance - and covers {{a wide range}} of issues including R2P, education and conflict, climate change, water <b>diplomacy,</b> <b>cyber</b> security, mass atrocities, illicit financial flows and the role of institutions and governance such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), transitional justice. According to the Institute's website, The Hague Institute provides policy-relevant research, practitioner training and convenes actors from various areas of expertise to facilitate dialogue and stimulate knowledge sharing.|$|R
50|$|Providing a {{part-time}} structure of rigorous, concentrated study, ongoing research practice and continual, practical assessment, the course combines distance learning with {{the advantages of}} face-to-face study. The Professional Doctor of Diplomacy is designed {{to fit into a}} busy schedule whilst ensuring that students have the support and guidance needed to help translate their knowledge and experience into proper academic thinking and writing.The taught element of the programme consists of six face-to-face modules taken over two years when students get to meet, network and share ideas. In the third year, DDipl candidates will then specialise in areas such as cross-border and <b>cyber</b> security, <b>diplomacy</b> of the global economic system, failed states and civil conflicts, human security risks, during the project phase of the course. According to the European higher education standards set by the Bologna Process, it is stated that the normal duration of a doctorate should correspond to 3-4 years of full-time study. A highly experienced practitioner candidate should be able to complete this taught doctorate within that time-frame.|$|R
40|$|This policy brief {{analyses}} China’s ambitions for imposing {{and strengthening}} {{the concept of}} cyber sovereignty in international negotiations on topics related to cybersecurity and Internet governance (IG). The presentation proceeds through four interconnected steps: 1. brief introduction and background to the Chinese ‘cyber sovereignty’ concept. 2. China’s role in defining, developing, and promoting this concept in international politics. 3. international responses to the Chinese use {{of the concept of}} cyber sovereignty, and how this should be seen in conjunction with current trends in Chinese foreign-policy strategies. 4. the use of <b>cyber</b> sovereignty in <b>diplomacy,</b> and how China uses this concept to counter Western dominance in cyberspace. Thus, the policy brief offers a brief examination of how the Chinese idea of state sovereignty in cyberspace influences how China positions itself in international negotiations with regard to issues such as security, economy and trade, and soft power (diplomacy/governance) ...|$|R
