40|$|In {{lead-acid}} battery systems, cycling systems are often managed using float management strategies. There are many differences in battery management strategies for a float environment and battery management strategies for a cycling environment. To complicate matters further, in many cycling environments, such as off-grid domestic power systems, {{there is usually}} not an available charging source capable of efficiently equalizing a {{lead-acid battery}} let alone {{bring it to a}} full state of charge. Typically, rules for battery management which have worked quite well in a floating environment have been routinely applied to cycling batteries without full appreciation of what the cycling battery really needs to reach a full state of charge and to maintain a high state of health. For example, charge target voltages for batteries that are regularly deep cycled in off-grid power sources are the same as voltages applied to <b>stand-by</b> <b>systems</b> following a discharge event. In other charging operations equalization charge requirements are frequently ignored or incorrectly applied in cycled systems which frequently leads to premature capacity loss. The cause of this serious problem: the application of float battery management strategies to cycling battery systems.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} developing inspection schedules to detect non-self- announcing events {{which can only}} detected by inspections. Failures of protective sys- tems,such as electronic equipments, alarms and <b>stand-by</b> <b>systems,</b> incipient failures {{and the emergence of}} certain medical diseases are examples of such events. Inspec- tions are performed at pre-determined times to detect whether or not the event has occurred, and necessary actions are taken upon the detection. In this research, my interest is in developing effective inspection schedules to detect non-self-announcing events that balance system downtime and inspection effort. To evaluate the quality of an inspection schedule, I use the availability (for re- placeable) and the detection delay (for non-replaceable systems) as performance mea- sures. When the monetary cost of inspection and the cost of delay are difficult to determine, non-monetary performance measures become more meaningful. In this research, the focus is on maximizing availability or minimizing detection delay given a limited number of inspections or a limited inspection rate. I show that for replace- able and non-replaceable systems, it is possible to construct inspection schedules that perform better than periodic inspection with respect to our performance measures. The occurrence of the event I would like to detect may be influenced by certain individual characteristics. For instance, the risk of developing a certain type of dis- ease might be different for different subgroups within the population. In this case, because of the non-homogeneity in the population, benefits of performing screening tests may not be fully achieved for each sub-group by using an inspection strategy developed for the entire population. Thus, it may be of value for an individual to learn more information about his/her likehood to have the disease. To address this issue, I analyze the change in the expected delay if schedules are based on the whole population information or the individual information and provide numerical results...|$|R

However, most of these energy sources cannot become continuously available on demand because of their intermittence [3, 4].

Despite the fact that supercapacitors exhibit greater power, longer cycle life, and much faster response time than batteries, their practical application is still limited by the low energy density, which is significantly lower than that of batteries [10]. According to E = CV 2 (E is energy density, C is capacitance, and V is operation voltage window), enhancing C and widening V can be employed to increase energy density of supercapacitors [11, 12].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a variant of}} a spare parts inventory model with cold <b>stand-by</b> redundancy on <b>system</b> level. Redundancy on system level implies that not all systems need to be operational {{in order to have}} the whole system operational. The cold stand-by feature implies that only the minimum required systems are operational. In order to determine a cost effective spare parts package such that in a cold stand-by redundancy situation a sufficient number of systems is operational for a specified period we extend the METRIC methodology. To compute the probability that the number of operating systems during the operational period is sufficient, we present both an exact, but time-consuming method, and a fast approximation method based on fitting distributions on the first two moments. This approximation method shows very small differences when compared to the exact method. Finally, we compare both methods to a simulation model in order to test the validity and impact of our modelling. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{a growing}} demand from remote {{communities}} in Australia {{to increase the amount}} of decentralised renewable energy in their energy supply mix in order to decrease their fuel costs. In contrast to large scale concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, small solar-hybrid gasturbine systems promise a way to decentralise electricity generation at power levels in the range of 0. 1 - 10 MWe, and reduce to cost of energy production for off-grid, isolated communities. Thermal storage provides such CSP systems with an advantage over photovoltaic (PV) technology as this would be potentially cheaper than adding batteries to PV <b>systems</b> or providing <b>stand-by</b> back-up <b>systems</b> such as diesel fuelled generators. Hybrid operation withconventional fuels and solar thermal collection and storage ensures the availability of power even if short term solar radiation is not sufficient or the thermal storage is empty. This paper presents initial modellingresults of a centrifugal receiver (CentRec) system, using hourly weather data of regional Australia for a 100 kWemicroturbine as well as a more efficient and cost effective 4. 6 MWe unit. The simulations involve calculation and optimisation of the heliostat field, by calculating heliostat by heliostat annual performance. This is combinedwith a model of the receiver efficiency based on experimental figures and a model of the particle storage system and turbine performance data. The optimized design for 15 hours of thermal storage capacity results in a tower height of 35 m and a solar field size of 2100 m 2 for the 100 kWe turbine, and a tower height of 115 m and solar field size of 50 000 m 2 for the 4. 6 MWe turbine. The solar field provides a greater portion of the operational energy requirement for the 100 kWe turbine, as the TIT of the 4. 6 MWe turbine (1150 °C) is greater than what the solar system can provide. System evaluations of the two particle receiver systems, with a selection of cost assumptions, are then compared to the current conventional means of supplying energy in such remote locations...|$|R

This thesis investigated the feasibility of a new electrical storage system related to mechanical systems, e. g. pumped hydro storage (PHS), compressed air (CAES) and flywheels (FES). The feasibility analysis indicated the system to be novel and that it could be utilized in all of the above-mentioned scenarios, e. g. intermittent renewables, grid reliability and as stand-by emergency generator. The analysis reviewed a case-scenario where the system was utilized in a household for storing surplus electricity from local renewable generation. The analysis indicated that storing electricity, subsequently to regenerate the electricity to the grid, was not profitable for households at the initial investment cost.

40|$|Fuel cell {{technology}} has undergone significant {{development in the}} past 15 years, spurred in part by its unique energy conversion characteristics; directly converting chemical energy to electrical energy. As fuel cell {{technology has}} past through the prototype/pre-commercialisation development, there is increasing interest in manufacturing and application issues. Of the six different fuel cell types pursued commercially, the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell has received {{the greatest amount of}} research and development investment due to its suitability in a variety of applications. A particular application, to which state-of-the art PEMFC technology is suited, is backup/uninterruptible power supply (UPS) <b>systems,</b> or <b>stand-by</b> power <b>systems.</b> The most important feature of any backup/UPS system is reliability. Traditional backup power systems, such as those utilising valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries, employ remote testing protocols that acquire battery state-of-health and state-of-charge information. This information plays a critical role in system management and reliability assurance. A similar testing protocol developed for a PEM fuel cell would be a valuable contribution to the commercialization of these systems for backup/UPS applications. This thesis presents a novel testing and analysis procedure, specifically designed for a PEM fuel cell in a backup power application. The test procedure electronically probes the fuel cell in the absence of hydrogen. Thus, the fuel cell is in an inactive, or passive, state throughout the testing process. The procedure {{is referred to as the}} passive state dynamic behaviour (PSDB) test. Analysis and interpretation of the passive test results is achieved by determining the circuit parameter values of an equivalent circuit model (ECM). A novel ECM of a fuel cell in a passive state is proposed, in which physical properties of the fuel cell are attributed to the circuit model components. Therefore, insight into the physical state of the fuel cell is achieved by determining the values of the circuit model parameters. A method for determining the circuit parameter values of many series connected cells (a stack) using the results from a single stack test is also presented. The PSDB test enables each cell in a fuel cell stack to be tested and analysed using a simple procedure that can be incorporated into a fuel cell system designed for backup power applications. An experimental system for implementing the PSDB test and evaluating the active performance of three different PEM fuel cells was developed. Each fuel cell exhibited the same characteristic voltage transient when subjected to the PSDB test. The proposed ECM was shown to accurately model the observed transient voltage behaviour of a single cell and many series connected cells. An example of how the PSDB test can provide information on the active functionality of a fuel cell is developed. This method consists of establishing baseline performance of the fuel cell in an active state, in conjunction with a PSDB test and identification of model parameter values. A subsequent PSDB test is used to detect changes in the state of the fuel cell that correspond to performance changes when the stack is active. An explicit example is provided, where certain cells in a stack were purposefully humidified. The change in state of the cells was identified by the PSDB test, and the performance change of the effected cells was successfully predicted. The experimental test results verify the theory presented in relation to the PSDB test and equivalent circuit model...|$|R
40|$|Keeping {{climate change}} actions in mind, the {{reduction}} of energy use in buildings {{is a matter of}} growing interest. The implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive leads to an increasing energy-efficiency in both new and refurbished buildings, at least in theory. While calculations of the building energy use in the design stage are useful to estimate the building energy performance in reference conditions, these theoretically estimated energy use figures often differ significantly from the actual measured energy use of the occupied building. In reality, construction deficiencies may occur, the actual operation and control of the building services may differ, and the building users interact with the building envelope and services according to their personal comfort needs and activities, which in turn may also be driven by energy-efficiency objectives. In order to estimate the actual and case-specific impact of energy-efficiency measures, there is an urgent need to better understand the actual energy use in occupied buildings. The application of energy monitoring and smart metering systems leads to an increasing availability of frequent, hourly or daily, and long-term measurements of the actual energy use in occupied buildings whereas in the past only monthly or yearly meter readings were collected. These energy use time series are the outcome of the system consisting of building, building services and occupants (the ‘occupied building’), and the interaction of this system with ambient conditions such as the weather, which influences especially the energy use for space heating, but also the calendar, which may influence user behaviour. In order to characterise the energy use of the system starting from the measured data, the challenge is to describe it mathematically in function of these ambient conditions. The resulting set of parameters that characterise the energy use of the system is called the Energy Signature of the system. It is the basis for comparing the energy use of an occupied building in different periods, for comparing different occupied buildings, for separating weather-dependent and weather-independent types of energy use, or for estimating the energy use for a given set of ambient conditions. When occasional energy use measurements and weather data are available, widely applied data-driven models are the Heating Degree Day and Energy Signature methods, using basic linear regression techniques. However with the availability of energy monitoring data from smart meters, a first question is whether these classical methods are still applicable when daily or sub-daily data are used. A second question is if these methods can be improved by elaborating on the model structure or the data processing. Eventually these high temporal energy use time series often display energy use time patterns that reflect the effects of behavioural patterns, building and services characteristics in more detail than weekly or monthly measurements would do. Therefore a third question is whether the set of Energy Signature parameters can be extended towards the inclusion of these energy use time patterns. The primary application envisaged for the models is household-specific energy use feedback. In this dissertation, the characterisation of residential Energy Use Signatures is investigated applying regression models and daily or sub-daily energy use smart meter data. The energy use time series in focus are hourly gas meter readings from residential buildings in Belgium, where gas is used mainly for space heating purposes and often also for domestic hot water generation and/or cooking. The main part of the study elaborates on data from 25 dwellings where gas is used only for space heating. First, the applicability of classical Energy Signature methods on daily averaged energy use time series is investigated in terms of predictor variables, model validity, accuracy and training period length. It is found that for linear regression models, the statistical assumptions are not satisfied in about half of the cases, where especially the assumption of the independency of the error is not fulfilled because of serial correlations. A logical step to improve the model with regard to regularly recurrent serial correlations, is by adding auto-regressive terms to the linear regression model, which is then called an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs. This results in an overall model validity {{for the majority of the}} cases. Using valid linear regression or ARX-models, the Energy Signatures for two consecutive years are compared for the 25 cases. Using an example case, the application of linear regression and ARX-models is also illustrated on 2 -hourly averaged energy use time series. While linear regression models as such are not valid (due to non-linearity, dependency of errors in time), ARX models deal with the regularly recurring energy use time patterns in their auto-regressive terms. Some energy use time patterns however do not possess a regular (e. g. weekly) recurrence. Therefore, the third part of the dissertation investigates a different approach for dealing with energy use time patterns in the sub-daily series in a structural way. Using time series decomposition methods, the energy use time series is decomposed into a component that deals with the sub-daily energy use time patterns, a trend component that deals with the seasonal variations, and a residual component. The de-trended data are split into day-length time series that are subjected to cluster analysis. The resulting groups of energy use time patterns with similar shapes are described in function of weather and calendar variables using logistic regression methods. The results are case-specific energy use time patterns for different weather conditions and different days of the week, that indicate start and end of the heating season, <b>stand-by</b> of the <b>system</b> etc. The information from these sub-daily energy use time patterns is entered into the linear regression trend models that use daily average data, by means of adding a categorical predictor indicating the groups of energy use time patterns. It is found that the resulting regression models deal better with both irregular occurring and some of the regular occurring serial correlations. The Energy Signatures are expanded with energy use time patterns and again they are compared for two consecutive years. Finally, in a last part of the study, the data-set is extended with 2 cases where gas is used for both space heating and domestic hot water demand and the decomposition-based methodology is now applied, thus extending the application domain and providing insight in the weather-independent energy use...|$|R
