His books have also been called [...] "dime novels". Bennetts popularity declined significantly during his later life.|$|R

50|$|The film {{had a great}} {{controversy}} {{because it}} {{was made in the}} late time of Franquism. However, it attracted international attention and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1973. José Luis López Vázquez gives a bravura performance with delicacy. The film never degenerates into a <b>cheap,</b> <b>sensational</b> comedy but is full of humor, pathos and humility. Jaime de Armiñán shows his own strong literary and theatrical influences with an originality not seen before in Spanish cinema.|$|R

2500|$|The {{literacy}} rate increased {{around the time}} of the American Civil War, and Beadle's Dime Novels were immediately popular among young, working-class readers. By the end of the war, numerous competitors, such as George Munro and Robert DeWitt, were crowding the field, distinguishing their product only by title and the color of the paper wrappers. Beadle & Adams had their own alternate [...] "brands", such as the Frank Starr line. As a whole, the quality of the fiction was derided by highbrow critics, and the term dime novel came to refer to any form of <b>cheap,</b> <b>sensational</b> fiction, rather than the specific format.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{it is not}} for me to judge, for me to blame. I {{will only}} say that there are those who cannot read <b>sensational</b> <b>novels,</b> or, indeed, any novels at all, just because they see so many <b>sensational</b> <b>novels</b> being enacted round them in painful facts of sinful flesh and blood. There are those, too, who have looked in the mirror too often to wish to see their own {{disfigured}} visage in it any more; who are too tired of themselves and ashamed of themselves to want to hear of people like themselves; who want to hear of people utterly unlike themselves, more noble, and able, and just, and sweet, and pure; who long to hear of heroism and to converse with heroes; and who, if by chance they meet with an heroic act, bathe their spirits in that, as in May-dew, and feel themselves thereby, if but for an hour, more fair.|$|R

5000|$|Penny dreadful is a pejorative {{term used}} to refer to cheap popular serial {{literature}} produced during the nineteenth century in the United Kingdom. The term is roughly interchangeable with penny horrible, penny awful, and penny blood. The term typically referred to a story published in weekly parts, each costing one penny. The subject matter of these stories was typically sensational, focusing on the exploits of detectives, criminals, or supernatural entities. While the term [...] "penny dreadful" [...] was originally used in reference to a specific type of literature circulating in mid-Victorian Britain, it came to encompass a variety of publications that featured <b>cheap</b> <b>sensational</b> fiction, such as story papers and booklet [...] "libraries". The penny dreadfuls were printed on cheap wood pulp paper and were aimed at young working class males.|$|R

Indeed, that natural shyness and reticence which I have found it {{impossible}} to shake off--except when writing to you, good reader--would in any case have prevented my communicating much of my private affairs to them, but particularly in a case like this, which seemed to be assuming the aspect of a wildly romantic hunt after a lost young girl, more like the plot of a <b>sensational</b> <b>novel</b> than an occurrence in every-day life.|$|R

Upon realizing his love for the teenager, the poet goes through emotional turmoil and self-destruction, while willing to give up his fame as one of the nation's most respected literary figures. The 35-year-old actor took on the challenge of nearly eight hours of makeup daily, on top of learning the weary gait and gesture of a man in his 70s.|$|R
5000|$|Hayashi {{was still}} in Beijing {{at the end of}} the war. He {{returned}} to Japan with Jun Yoshida ( [...] , Yoshida Jun) in 1946.

As Hayashi would later describe it, Yoshida would tell publishers that he photographed women, and Hayashi (later renowned for his portraits of men) would tell them that he photographed anything other than women. The ploy seems to have worked: he was frenetically busy, and the photographer Shōji Ueda later termed him “the first professional photographer in Japan”.

50|$|Circulating {{libraries}} {{offered an}} alternative to the large number of readers who could not afford the price of new books in the nineteenth century but also desired to quench their desire for new material. Many circulating libraries were perceived as the provider of <b>sensational</b> <b>novels</b> to a female clientele but that was not always the case. Many private circulating libraries in Europe were created for scientific and/or literary audiences. In Britain, readers in the middle classes depended on these institutions to provide access to the latest fiction novels that required a substantial subscription that many lower class readers couldn't afford.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, {{his third}} directorial Miss Leelavathi {{based on the}} late Korati Srinivasa Rao’s <b>{{sensation}}al</b> <b>novel</b> on premarital sex created a sensation for its bold theme.

The film for which he wrote the screenplay, again won the Certificate of Merit for the Second Best Feature Film at the 13th National Film Awards making his third consecutive win at the National level. His subsequent films Nakkare Ade Swarga, Hannele Chiguridaga and Eradu Mukha won him laurels and awards at the Karnataka State Film Awards.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a selection}} of popular literature for middle-class children written during the 1870 s, a period when new genres of secular magazines provided entertaining alternatives to outmoded moralistic journals and <b>cheap,</b> <b>sensational</b> papers. The stories printed in Aunt Judy's Magazine, Chatterbox, Good Words for the Young, Little Folks and Sunshine purveyed orthodox attitudes to children, the family, and society which were designed to explain and justify to the rising generation the beliefs and values that sustained the prevailing social order. Contemporary journal articles on children's literature, child-rearing, education, and religion outlined {{the social context of}} children's periodical fiction and indicated some of the changing ideas and current preoccupations which infiltrated stories for children. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the contribution made by a small group of writers, editors, and publishers of mid-Victorian children's magazines to the informal education of middle-class children...|$|R

60|$|The {{letter of}} the Times' {{correspondent}} referred to contained an account {{of one of the}} most singular cases of depravity ever brought before a criminal court; but it is unnecessary to bring any of its details under the reader's attention, for nearly every other number of our journals has of late contained some instances of atrocities before unthought of, and, it might have seemed, impossible to humanity. The connection of these with the modern love of excitement in the <b>sensational</b> <b>novel</b> and drama may not be generally understood, but it is direct and constant; all furious pursuit of pleasure ending in actual desire of horror and delight in death. I entered into some fuller particulars on this subject in a lecture given in the spring at the Royal Institution.|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} based on the {{argument}} that Wilkie Collins, in his novel The Woman in White (1859), the first <b>sensational</b> <b>novel</b> and prequel to the detective genre, challenges stereotypical female roles in his presentation of the two sisters Laura Fairlie and Marian Halcombe. Through a comparative analysis of the two sisters, it is shown that Laura represents the traditional Victorian woman, while Marian challenges these ideals, and, through her, Collins creates a new type of literary heroine. The relationship between the sisters is also examined in more detail than has been done before. In addition to this analysis, the essay also contains a didactic chapter which demonstrates how a teacher can use The Woman in White in the language classroom as well as showing how this will benefit the development of students’ language, critical thinking and knowledge of literature. ...|$|R
