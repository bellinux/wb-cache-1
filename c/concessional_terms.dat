The HIPC Initiative represents a step forward in the international community's efforts to relieve poor countries of their heavy debt burdens.

Unless strong, sustained economic growth is achieved, however the initiative will not likely provide recipient countries with a lasting exit from their debt problems. Furthermore, {{as long as the}} initiative links debt relief to poverty reduction strategies, the tension between quick debt relief and comprehensive country-owned strategies is likely to persist. These issues should not be seen, however, as a reason to abandon efforts to provide debt relief to eligible countries. Heavily indebted poor countries continue to carry unsustainable debt burdens that are unlikely to be lessened without debt relief, but participants and observers need to be more realistic about what the initiative may ultimately achieve.

40|$|Historically, one of {{the most}} {{fruitful}} applications of financial and economic cost-benefit analysis has been in electricity systems planning. Because of the capital intensive nature of the production technology and the possibilities of substitution between capital and fuel, the potential for savings through correct choice of timing, technology and scale are immense. This particular project is unique because these decisions involve two political jurisdictions, India and Bhutan. Furthermore, the value of Bhutan’s unique natural resources, its hydro-electric sites, is entirely determined by their potential to save India’s scarce economic resources, both capital and fuel. The 336 MW Chukha hydro-electricity project was built by India on a turnkey basis, with India providing 60 % of the capital in a grant and 40 % in a loan at highly <b>concessional</b> <b>terms</b> and conditions. In the arrangement, India receives in turn all the electricity generated from the project in excess of Bhutan’s demand at much cheaper prices than India’s generation cost from alternative sources.

40|$|IMF lending {{has risen}} {{sharply in the}} wake of the global {{financial}} crisis from the lows in the mid 2000 s. Despite increasing recently, the number of new IMF financing arrangements has been relatively small, but the average size of these arrangements is high by historical standards. Much of the new lending has been to Europe, which has resulted in marked changes in the geographical distribution of outstanding IMF loans. The terms on which lending has been made available have also changed in recent years, with the IMF implementing reforms aimed at making it easier for countries to access large loans, increasing its emphasis on the provision of precautionary financing, and streamlining its use of conditionality. IMF Lending Activity 1 One of the main roles of the IMF is to provide temporary financing to member countries with a balance of payments need. Financing is typically provided under an ‘arrangement’, which stipulates specific policies and measures (known as conditionality) that are intended to resolve a borrowing country’s balance of payments difficulties. Disbursements of IMF loans to a country are generally dependent on the progress made by that country in implementing the agreed measures. While a variety of arrangements are available to low-income countries on <b>concessional</b> <b>terms,</b> this article focuses on the IMF’s non-concessional lending, which is subject to the IMF’s market-related interest rate. Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs) and Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangements have historically accounted for the bulk of the IMF’s non-concessional lending. SBAs are designed to help member countries address short-term balance of payments problems, while EFFs are available for countries with longer-term needs.

40|$|Payments {{problems}} constrained interstate trade {{among the}} Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries in 1992 - 95, {{especially during the}} prolonged demise of the ruble zone. Two kinds of solutions should be sought: 1) more effective stabilization measures to improve the prospects of currency convertibility among CIS countries; and 2) strengthening of institutional arrangements to permit payments and settlements through correspondent bank accounts. Strengthening institutions will require not only strengthening commercial banks but liberalizing foreign exchange markets and promoting the use of letters of credit and other mechanisms to increase the security of trade transactions. A multilateral clearing arrangement operated among central banks {{would have been a}} useful alternative to the chaotic payments prevailing earlier, but such arrangements are no longer needed as considerable progress has been made toward convertibility. Nor is a payments union desirable. Trade deficits are likely to persist in such countries as Belarus and Ukraine. Surplus countries such as Russia and Turkmenistan must develop transparent means of trade financing that take into account the recipient countries'ability to pay. External financing will remain important for practically all CIS countries. The best way to mobilize private financing will be to establish macroeconomic stability and stable, transparent rules on private capital inflows. Improving the flow of public resources requires improving countries'capacity to quickly absorb the large amounts already committed. Donors need to expedite procurement and other procedures and recipient countries must address governance problems and institutional weaknesses that delay disbursements. Certain smaller CIS countries face significant debt servicing problems and often the creditors are other CIS countries that themselves need additional financing. The smaller countries need debt relief on <b>concessional</b> <b>terms,</b> which is possible only if external assistance allows local creditors to offer such relief.

The positive production impact must, however, be balanced against he negative effects of P. L. 480 on commercial wheat imports and the potential disruptions of world wheat markets. Key words: Brazil, multiplier analysis, P. L. 480, wheat. Although the United States has reduced its participation i food aid since 1972, under the P. L. 480 program, food aid continues to be an important foreign policy tool. In addition to sales at <b>concessional</b> <b>terms</b> under Title I of the P. L. 480 program, the United States contrib-utes to the goals of the 1974 World Food Con-ference by distributing annually a minimum of 1. 3 million tons of food assistance in the form ofgrants, under Title II of the P. L. 480 program (USDA 1977, p. 5). Other donor countries, such as those in the European Economic Community (EEC), also are increasing their participation in food aid programs. Increas-ingly, however, the emphasis is on using food aid positively for agricultural development purposes and avoiding detrimental effects on a country's agriculture caused by the introduc-tion of food aid. For this reason, it is important to evaluate the experiences of the P. L. 480 program of the United States in regard to its actual contributions to agricultural develop-ment. Toward doing so, this paper attempts to analyze the effects of P. L. 480 Title I wheat imports on Brazil's grain sector. Brazil's experiences with the P. L. 480 pro-gram provides a good case study.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the role of Multilateral Development Institutions (MDIs) in {{promoting}} economic and social progress in Less Developed Countries (LDC). After examining the activities of the main MDIs (International Monetary Fund, WorldBank Group, Interamerican Development Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) we have come to some conclusions. First, MDIs loans play a catalytic effect in channeling flows of additional public or private resources to LDC. Second, MDIs emphasize both the role of the private sector and an efficient public sector to achieve its objectives (to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, etc.). Third, MDIs provide direct financing for private sector activities, restructuring and privatisation to encourage the development of market economies as well as funding for the infrastructure that supports these activities. Fourth, over the last few years the MDIs have increased their conditionalities on the borrowers, especially in environment and governance areas. Fifth, the resources provided by the MDIs are not enough to cope with the financial needs of LDC; furthermore, a low percentage of total loans are on <b>concessional</b> <b>terms.</b> Sixth, most of the MDIs resources go to the benefit of medium-income countries (South Korea, Mexico, Brazil, etc.) and only a small amount of credits go to the poorest countries; what´s more, in the last few last years MDIs are increasing their financial support of countries in the East. Seventh, MDIs have integrated social sector and environment as a first-order priority in their reports, but the lending reality is far from incorporating such an aim: one thing istheory, the other is practice. Eighth, MDIs’ institutional structures and decision-making processes are similar, as in most of them the principle of one dollar one vote holds. As a result, the MDIs are dominated by the developed countries, which use such institutions as tools to implement their foreign interests. Ninth, regional development banks work closely with many other international organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which have assumed the role of world development organizations without need of formal constitutional amendments: rather merely through introducing new institutional practices are changes effected. And tenth, since the economic growth and development model encouraged by MDIs in developing member countries is very unfair, the model has a negative social and environmental impact: transnational corporations end up the big winners...|$|E
