40|$|Cooking {{represents}} {{an important step}} in food processing for both sensorial and safety aspects. Aim {{of this study was to}} optimise the <b>cooking</b> <b>cycles</b> of a semi-automatic oven by definition and settling of minimum thermal conditions to guarantee safety while keeping sensorial quality of cooked foods. To this purpose, the heat penetration curves and the correspondent thermal lethality effect (FT) of <b>cooking</b> <b>cycles</b> conventionally adopted to prepare some foods and dishes characterised by different microbial risk (high: lasagne pie, meat minced roll, meat filled peppers; standard: spinach and salmon), were determined. On the basis of the microbial quality and the desired safety level, minimum thermal conditions (F 71. 1 = 5 min and T = 75 C at the slowest heating point of the food) were defined and settled in the electronics of the oven. These conditions were found to determine a sufficient number of log reduction of both total microbial count and coliforms able to guarantee safety as well as sensory quality at consumption. The oven with modified electronics during the heating step of <b>cooking</b> <b>cycles</b> records in real time the temperature in the product by a multipoint thermocouple, detects the slowest heat penetration curve and computes, by an internal computer the correspondent F 71. 1. After initial setting of the food category, this semi-automatic oven is able to find automatically the proper process conditions during cooking to obtain the correspondent FT, to let the cooking stop at the end of the recipe or to conduct the thermal treatment till the reaching of the set FT according to the risk category chosen before cooking start...|$|R

40|$|Culinary {{utensils}} may release some inorganic elements during food preparation. Mineral migration can {{be beneficial}} {{for as long as}} it occurs in amounts adequate to the needs of the consumer or no toxicological implications are involved. In this study, the migrations of Fe, Mg, Mn, Cr, Ni and Ca, along seven <b>cooking</b> <b>cycles</b> were evaluated for two food preparations (polished rice and commercial tomato sauce, the latter as an acid food), performed in unused stainless steel, cast iron and soapstone pans, taking refractory glass as a blank. Minerals were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). The utensils studied exhibited different rates, patterns and variability of migration depending on the type of food. Regression analysis of the data revealed that, as a function of the number of cycles, the iron pans released increasing amounts of iron when tomato sauce was cooked (y = 70. 76 x + 276. 75; R 2 = 0. 77). The soapstone pans released calcium (35 and 26 mg/kg), magnesium (25 and 15 mg/kg) into the tomato sauce and rice preparations, respectively. Additionally, the commercial tomato sauce drew manganese (3. 9 and 0. 6 mg/kg) and some undesirable nickel (1. 0 mg/kg) from the soapstone material, whereas the stainless steel pans released nickel at a lower rate than steatite and in a diminishing fashion with the number o <b>cooking</b> <b>cycles,</b> while still transferring some iron and chromium to the food. We conclude that while cast iron and glass could be best for the consumer's nutritional health, stainless steel and steatite can be used with relatively low risk, provided acid foods are not routinely prepared in those materials. © 2007 Archivos Latinoamericanos de Nutrición...|$|R
5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 <b>cooking</b> <b>cycles</b> into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|R
40|$|We used a forced-air {{convection}} oven to cook steaks from two muscles; strip loin (longissimus lumborum) and outside round (biceps femoris). We used {{a mathematical model}} to predict cooking time and temperature profiles for each steak. No differences (P> 0. 05) were found in cooking times between experimental and model values for either of the steaks. Modeled temperature profiles were consistently higher (except {{for the beginning of}} the <b>cooking</b> <b>cycle)</b> than the experimental values up to 65 °C (150 °F) in the <b>cooking</b> <b>cycle</b> for outside round steaks, whereas better agreement between experimental and modeled values was found for strip loin steaks. A highly positive linear relationship was found between experimental and modeled temperature histories for both strip loin (R 2 = 0. 99) and outside round (R 2 = 0. 96) steaks. The developed model should be useful for steak cooking, because the constant time to a given degree of doneness should increase consumer satisfaction by reducing variation in degree of steak doneness...|$|E
40|$|Toxicological {{studies show}} that oral doses of nickel can cause {{allergic}} contact dermatitis, and routes of exposure, such as nickel leached from stainless steel cookware are not well characterized. In this study, four variables: grade of stainless steel, cook time, stainless steel seasoning or cooking cycles, and commercial tomato sauces, were tested to for their effect on nickel leaching and their possible effects on human health. Two grades of stainless steel, two, six, and 20 hour cooking times, ten cooking cycles, and four commercially obtained tomato sauces were tested. The stainless steel grades tested were equivalent to those typically found in cookware (grade 316 and 304). We found after a single <b>cooking</b> <b>cycle</b> of six hours, depending on grade of stainless steel, nickel concentrations increased 30 to 60 fold. Increased cook times of 20 hours resulted in additional nickel leaching, about 70 fold higher than tomato sauce cooked {{in the absence of}} stainless steel. The first <b>cooking</b> <b>cycle</b> resulted in the largest increase in nickel concentration at 5. 8 mg/kg. However, with sequential cooking cycles, the total amount of nickel leached was less than in the first cycle. There was no change in the amount of nickel leached between the sixth and tenth <b>cooking</b> <b>cycle.</b> Nickel was still leaching into tomato sauce after 10 cooking cycles about 10 fold higher than the original tomato sauce. After 10 cooking cycles, each six hours in duration, an average of 88 μg of nickel was leached per 126 g serving of tomato sauce. In addition to dietary intakes, stainless steel can be an overlooked source of nickel, and the amount of additional exposure is dependent on stainless steel grade, cooking time, and repeated usage...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the thermal drying process commonly used by small and very small beef jerky operations in Texas. It {{was intended to}} determine the impact of relative humidity on the production of beef jerky and to provide documentation to beef jerky producers to support their Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point programs. This project was divided into two phases: Phase I provided {{a low level of}} relative humidity (15 - 25 %), whereas Phase II provided a high level (100 %) for 25 % of the <b>cooking</b> <b>cycle.</b> Both phases consisted of three trials, each representing one of the treatments (n= 18) applied to the samples. The first treatment served as the control group and included samples that were non-inoculated, while the other two treatments included inoculations of samples with a bovine fecal slurry and rifampicin-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium. Each of the three treatments for both phases was analyzed for reduction of microbial levels in addition to temperature and product composition. Once the two phases had been completed and all data were analyzed, it was concluded that there was not a statistical difference between the level of reduction for Aerobic Plate Counts, coliforms, Escherichia coli and Salmonella provided by Phase I with low humidity and Phase II with high humidity. Both levels of humidity provided similar levels of reduction within each trial, suggesting that the level of humidity does not have a great impact on the level of microbial reduction achieved. However, this study did not provide the adequate level of initial inoculation levels to support the required 6. 5 log reduction stated in 9 CFR 318. 7. Inoculation levels were lower than 6. 5 logs for all three treatments in both phases, resulting in lower levels of overall reduction. Therefore, based upon the information provided by this study, it cannot be concluded that a low level of humidity will achieve a 6. 5 log reduction as mandated in 9 CFR 318. 17...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} cooking is usually {{estimated}} {{at the end}} of the cooking process from chef evaluating aroma, color, tenderness and so on. When the cooking process is an industrial process a predefined quality cooked foodstuff must be furnished. Three are the main factors that influences cooking quality: the preservation, the <b>cooking</b> <b>cycles</b> and internal food temperature. Safety assurance recommends cooking the foods until the minimum internal temperature is greater than a particular imposed value, so that the microbial concentration is drastically reduced. This threshold value is related only to the food safety and not to the quality estimation of the final product, which is still demanded to the opinion of an expert. This paper shows the first step of a novel method for real time quality assessment and control that emulates the chef visual perception. In particular it describes the monitoring part that is done inside the meat, because the internal visual aspect offers a correct parameter of cooking quality. Measuring the meat reflectance at different wavelengths in conjunction with the internal temperature evolution allows the construction of a pattern of features, for example extracted with a fuzzy system, which leads to the definition of a parameter for quality classification in meat cooking process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze various cooking fuel options {{commonly}} used in Indian households, namely, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG CO) derived from crude oil and (LPG NG) natural gas, kerosene, coal, electricity, firewood, charcoal, crop residues, dung cake and biogas. In this paper, we used life cycle energy analysis approach to determine the life cycle energy efficiency (LCEE) of cooking fuels. The daily heat energy requirement by the Indian households for cooking activities is about 2150 kcal. Amongst the analyzed fossil fuels, LPG derived from natural gas has the highest energy efficiency of 45 % and coal with 14. 7 % is the least energy efficient fossil fuel option for household <b>cooking.</b> The life <b>cycle</b> energy efficiency of traditional biomass fuels is 11. 9 - 7. 5 %, which is much lower than those of commercial cooking fuels like LPG and kerosene. The life cycle energy efficiency of charcoal is found to be 9 % and is lower than that of firewood. The energy efficiency of biogas is found to be comparable to that of LPG and is potentially a sustainable cooking fuel option in Indian context...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} wheat (WT) flour {{replacement}} up to 45 % (weight basis) by incorporation of ternary blends of teff (T), green pea (GP) and buckwheat (BW) flours on the viscometric pasting and gelling profiles of quaternary blended dough matrices was investigated by applying <b>cooking</b> and cooling <b>cycles</b> to rapid viscoanalyser (RVA) canisters with highly hydrated samples (3. 5 : 25, w:w). Viscometric cooking and cooling parameter trends related to suitable patterns for lower and slower starch hydrolysis, and lower and/or slower firming and starch retrogradation kinetics in blended breads mainly include higher viscosity values for peak viscosity, breakdown on cooking and viscosity of hot (95 °C) paste, but lower viscosity values after gelling (50 °C). These visco-metric requirements for achieving suitable textural and thermal features in blended breads, {{were met by}} adding T/GP/BW to replace 22. 5 % of WT flour in blended dough formulations. Larger WT flour replacement by 37. 5 % of the ternary mixture T/GP/BW (7. 5 / 15 / 15) provided hydrated blends with higher values for viscosity of hot (95 °C) paste, and lower viscosity values after gelling (50 °C), in good accordance with poorer formation of rapidly digestible starch and total digestible starch, and more prominent formation of resistant starch and slowly digestible starch in breads, respectively.

40|$|The {{impact of}} heat {{moisture}} treatment (HMT) on the thermoviscous, viscoelastic and mechanical properties of binary flour matrices (wheat:barley, 60 : 40, wt:wt) {{was investigated in}} untreated and HMT (15 % moisture content, 1 h heating time at 120 °C) hydrated samples to assess the potential of HMT to modify dough viscoelasticity and doughmaking functionality in diluted breadmaking wheat matrices. HMT significance was tackled (a) in excess of water, by applying successive <b>cooking</b> and cooling <b>cycles</b> to hydrated samples (14 %, w:w), determination of viscometric parameters, and subsequent determination of textural (compression test) and viscoelastic parameters (stress relaxation test) in pasted and gelled hydrated flours, and (b) under water restrictions by assessing the consistency (forward extrusion test), the primary and secondary mechanical properties (Texture Profile Analysis), and the viscoelastic behaviour (stress relaxation test) of untreated and HMT mixed doughs made at different flour hydration levels (63 and 70 %). In highly hydrated blends, HMT barley flour provided enhanced viscosity patterns regardless {{of the presence of}} native or HMT wheat flour, and harder gels with larger initial stress to reach a defined deformation, particularly in the presence of HMT wheat flour. Under restricted water availability, doughs made at 70 % hydration level when compared to their counterparts made at 63 % explicited lower stress relaxation curves with higher values for both initial decay rate and extent of the decay, shorter relaxation times and higher percent of stress relaxation, giving softer and more cohesive doughs. The most elastic-like dough blends were those prepared with HMT wheat and barley flours at 63 % hydration, while the most viscous-like doughs were those from native flours made at 70 % hydration.
