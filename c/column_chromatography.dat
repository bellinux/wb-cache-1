5|$|Because of {{its high}} neutron cross-section, boron-10 {{is often used to}} control fission in nuclear {{reactors}} as a neutron-capturing substance. Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the dimethyl ether adduct of boron trifluoride (DME-BF3) and <b>column</b> <b>chromatography</b> of borates are being used.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, W. Clark Still {{introduced}} {{a modified version}} of <b>column</b> <b>chromatography</b> called flash <b>column</b> <b>chromatography</b> (flash). The technique is very similar to the traditional <b>column</b> <b>chromatography,</b> except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.|$|E

25|$|Calixarenes with XXYZ or WXYZ {{substitution}} patterns at {{the upper}} rim are inherently chiral and their enantiomers can be resolved by chiral <b>column</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Recently, inherently chiral calixarenes have been synthesised in good yields by asymmetric ortholithiation using a chiral oxazoline directing group. This removes the need for resolution techniques.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} in the {{synthesis}} of Taxol, the material was a racemic mixture. To obtain the desired enantiomer, allylic alcohol 4.9 was acylated with (1S)-(−)-camphanic chloride and dimethylaminopyridine, giving two diastereomers. These were then separated using standard <b>column</b> <b>chromatography.</b> The desired enantiomer was then isolated when one of the separated disatereomers was treated with potassium bicarbonate in methanol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Column</b> <b>chromatography</b> is a {{separation}} technique {{in which the}} stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.|$|E

25|$|At the hospital, the 99mTc {{that forms}} through 99Mo decay is {{chemically}} {{extracted from the}} technetium-99m generator. Most commercial 99Mo/99mTc generators use <b>column</b> <b>chromatography,</b> in which 99Mo {{in the form of}} water-soluble molybdate, MoO42− is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al2O3). When the 99Mo decays, it forms pertechnetate TcO4−, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pulling normal saline solution through the column of immobilized 99MoO42− elutes the soluble 99mTcO4−, resulting in a saline solution containing the 99mTc as the dissolved sodium salt of the pertechnetate. One technetium-99m generator, holding only a few micrograms of 99Mo, can potentially diagnose 10,000 patients because it will be producing 99mTc strongly for over a week.|$|E
25|$|Dextran is a {{polysaccharide}} {{derived from}} bacteria; {{it is usually}} produced by enzymes from certain strains of leuconostoc or Streptococcus. It consists of α-1,6-linked D-glucopyranose residues. Cross-linked dextran hydrogel beads {{have been widely used}} as low protein-binding matrices for <b>column</b> <b>chromatography</b> applications and for microcarrier cell culture technology. However, it has not been until recently that dextran hydrogels have been investigated in biomaterials applications and specifically as drug delivery vehicles. An advantage of using dextran in biomaterials applications include its resistance to protein adsorption and cell-adhesion, which allows specific cell adhesion to be determined by deliberately attached peptides from ECM components. AEMA was copolymerized with Dex-MA in order to introduce primary amine groups to provide a site for attachment of ECM-derived peptides to promote cell adhesion. The peptides can be immobilized using sulfo-SMMC coupling chemistry and cysteine-terminated peptides. Copolymerization of Dex-MA with AEMA allowed the macroporous geometry of the scaffolds to be preserved in addition to promoting cellular interactions.|$|E

The amino acid sequence of the protein was analyzed by Edman degradation and then used to construct a cDNA library {{which could be used}} to clone the channel protein.

2500|$|Vaccine {{production}} has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza) or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A). [...] Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b). Likewise, a recombinant protein {{derived from the}} viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus {{may need to be}} inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and <b>column</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials. Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.|$|E
