25|$|Electrospinning is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} technique {{that can be used}} to produce continuous fibers from submicrometer to nanometer diameters. In a typical electrospinning set-up, a solution is fed through a spinneret and a high voltage is applied to the tip. The buildup of electrostatic repulsion within the charged solution, causes it to eject a thin fibrous stream. A mounted <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> or rod with an opposite or grounded charge draws in the continuous fibers, which arrive to form a highly porous network. The primary advantages of this technique are its simplicity and ease of variation. At a laboratory level, a typical electrospinning set-up only requires a high voltage power supply (up to 30 kV), a syringe, a flat tip needle and a conducting collector. For these reasons, electrospinning has become a common method of scaffold manufacture in many labs. By modifying variables such as the distance to collector, magnitude of applied voltage, or solution flow rate—researchers can dramatically change the overall scaffold architecture.|$|E

50|$|To detect these ions, two {{electrodes}} {{are used}} to provide a potential difference. The positive electrode doubles as the nozzle head where the flame is produced. The other, negative electrode is positioned above the flame. When first designed, the negative electrode was either tear-drop shaped or angular piece of platinum. Today, the design has been modified into a tubular electrode, {{commonly referred to as}} a <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> The ions thus are attracted to the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> and upon hitting the plate, induce a current. This current is measured with a high-impedance picoammeter and fed into an integrator. The manner in which the final data is displayed is based on the computer and software.

50|$|A multigrid, split-collector Faraday cup {{mounted on}} the equator of the {{spacecraft}} was used to study the directional intensity of solar wind positive ions and electrons with particular emphasis on {{the interaction of the}} solar wind with the Moon. Twenty-seven integral current samples (requiring about 4.3 s) were taken in an energy-per-charge window from 80 to 2850 eV. Then the current was sampled in eight differential energy-per-charge windows between 50 and 5400 eV at the azimuth where the peak current appeared in the previous series of integral measurements. These measurements (integral and differential) took about 25 s. Both the sum and difference of collector currents were obtained for positive ions. Only the sum was obtained for electrons. A complete set of measurements (two <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> sums and one difference for protons, and one <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> sum for electrons) required 328 s.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1900s the simple framing methods {{mentioned}} above were gradually replaced by {{more complex and}} sophisticated methods, but the general mode of operation remained the same. The changes of design are most noticeable on systems where both double- and single-deck cars were used on the same system. Single deck trams usually have tall and lightly constructed collectors with complicated frames to support the heavy cast-steel <b>collector</b> <b>plate,</b> while double deck cars usually have heavier collectors with less complicated frames.|$|E
50|$|Ionizer purifiers use charged {{electrical}} surfaces or needles {{to generate}} electrically charged air or gas ions. These ions attach to airborne particles {{which are then}} electrostatically attracted to a charged <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> This mechanism produces trace amounts of ozone and other oxidants as by-products. Most ionizers produce less than 0.05 ppm of ozone, an industrial safety standard. There are two major subdivisions: the fanless ionizer and fan-based ionizer. Fanless ionizers are noiseless and use little power, but are less efficient at air purification. Fan-based ionizers clean and distribute air much faster. Permanently mounted home and industrial ionizer purifiers are called electrostatic precipitators.|$|E

50|$|Properly the bow {{collector}} {{should be}} mounted {{in such a}} way so that the top edge of the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> would rise several inches above the wire when the collector frame is standing straight up. Thus the collector usually leans opposite to the direction of travel; when the time comes to travel in the opposite direction, the collector must be swung over. To allow this to happen, the overhead wire must be raised by several inches at places where the bows are swung over, such as terminals and turn-outs. This operation is usually achieved by ropes and pulleys. The collector is folded down to a horizontal position when the car is not in use.|$|E
5000|$|Scanning atomisers {{have been}} {{developed}} which allow the production of billets of up to 600 mm diameter, approximately twice the diameter possible with a static atomiser. The atomiser head is oscillated mechanically through 5 to 10° at a typical frequency of 25 Hz, to deflect the melt stream creating a spray path that is synchronised with the rotation speed of the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> in order to deposit a parallel-sided billet. By using programmable oscillating atomiser drives {{it was possible to}} improve the shape and shape reproducibility of spray formed deposits. It has been demonstrated that parallel sided, flat topped billets could be sprayed in a reproducible manner if the substrate rotation and atomiser oscillation frequency were synchronised and optimised for specific alloys and melt flow rates. Twin atomiser systems combine a static and scanning atomiser, making it possible to spray billets of up to 450 mm diameter with economic benefits.|$|E

40|$|Water {{is vital}} for human activity. In the past {{abundant}} fresh water supplies {{were believed to be}} limitless. In the last two decades dwindling reserves of freely accessible water at the surface and subsurface environment have raised community awareness about the need to ensure that industrial production operates in a sustainable way that won’t constrain the development and sustainability of regional cities and towns that draw on downstream ground waters for their potable and non potable water requirements. In this paper, a method of augmenting the widely practiced evaporation pond approach is investigated for disposing of brine wastewaters to improve the sustainability of industrial operators employing this practice. The approach involves the adoption of solar plate collector technology. The solar technology referred to as unglazed transpired collectors (UTCs). It may be considered a hybrid concept as it’s a UTC except inclined like a typical solar <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> A pilot scale <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit was designed and constructed to evaluate the enhanced evaporation capabilities of a <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit (UTCs). The experimental program covered a 14 month study period from June 2005 to August, 2006. This research investigated the ability to enhance evaporation using three different brine concentrations (3. 5 % NaCl, 7. 0 % NaCl and 12. 5 % NaCl), and three film heights (0. 15 mm, 0. 2 mm and 0. 3 mm) over a 14 month experimental period between June 2005 and August 2006. The research investigated the relationship between key weather parameters, solar irradiation (MJ/m 2 /d), wind speed (m/s), ambient air temperature (°C), and relative humidity (%), and enhanced evaporation and <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> evaporation from the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit. Data analysis found weather conditions low in relative humidity (less than 40 %), high in total incident solar radiation (greater than 20 MJ/m 2 /d), steady, constant wind speeds (between 1. 1 and 1. 3 m/s), and high daily average air temperatures (greater than 25 °C) would generally produce evaporation enhancement ratio (EER) results between 2. 0 and 3. 0 for brine solutions with concentrations up to 7. 0 % NaCl. The peak EER result of 3. 01 (achieved during summer) equated to the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit achieving a rate of evaporation 301 % higher than an equivalent surface area of evaporation pond containing similar brine wastewater and subject to similar weather conditions. The mean EER result over the 14 month sampling period was 1. 52. The research found in the scenario where 100 nr <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> 1 m 2 units were connected to an evaporation pond covering 20, 000 m 2 and 1 m in depth, subject to typical Melbourne CBD weather conditions, and a testing period of 100 days. The <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit had the potential to reduce the surface area by 0. 44 % representing an 88 m 2 reduction in surface area for the 1 m deep evaporation pond. An energy balance was developed for the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit that considered energy {{in and out of the}} unit, by way of solar radiation, convection and evaporation. It was found the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> lost over 49 % of its energy to evaporation as compared with 76 % by the evaporation pond due to evaporation under the same weather conditions. The research found <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> technology had the potential for augmenting existing and future evaporation ponds located in regions and countries where the meteorological conditions are favourable to evaporation...|$|E

Ogbono seeds were dried using a distributed type, forced convention solar drying system, consisting of a solar <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> of a geometric area (A), thickness (D) and tilt angle (β). The drying rates of the Ogbono seeds were obtained for <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> Areas of 0. 24, 0. 42 and 0. 60 m 2; tilt angles of 0, 5, 10 and 15 º; absorber plate thicknesses of 1. 50, 2. 70 and 4. 20 mm. The graphs of Area (A) of <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> against drying rate showed that the drying rates increased linearly with the increase in the area of <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> From the graphs of angles of tilt against drying rate, it was evident that the drying rate generally increased curvlinearly to a point with the increase in the tilt angle.
