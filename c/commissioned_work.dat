5|$|In 1941, the Kertész {{couple were}} {{designated}} as enemy aliens because of World War II (Hungary was {{fighting on the}} side of the Axis powers). Kertész was not permitted to photograph outdoors or to have any project related to national security. Trying to avoid trouble because Elizabeth had started a cosmetics company (Cosmia Laboratories), Kertész ceased to do <b>commissioned</b> <b>work</b> and essentially disappeared from the photographic world for three years.|$|E

25|$|Guernica {{quickly became}} a world-renowned symbol of {{civilian}} suffering resulting from conflict and inspired Pablo Picasso to adapt one of his existing commissions into Guernica. The Spanish Republican Government had commissioned a work from him for the Spanish pavilion at the Paris International Exposition. Though he accepted the invitation to display a piece, he remained uninspired until he heard of the bombing of Guernica. Before the bombing of Guernica took place, Picasso never cared much for anything {{that had to do}} with politics. Once Picasso heard the news he changed his <b>commissioned</b> <b>work</b> for Spain into a reflection on the massacre.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Hargreaves {{continued}} his media career {{and during the}} 1950s was editor of Lilliput magazine and Picture Post where he <b>commissioned</b> <b>work</b> from Bert Hardy. His brilliance as a communications manager led to his being recruited to the National Farmers Union by Jim Turner, later Lord Netherthorpe, who was celebrated for his success as a lobbyist for farmers. Working closely with Turner, Hargreaves organised and developed the NFU's Information Department, founding the British Farmer magazine during an almost intractable crisis of trust between NFU HQ {{and the members of}} the largest union in the country, many of whom were experiencing seismic change in the agricultural economy.|$|E
25|$|Lowell {{continued}} {{to be in the}} forefront of new industrial technology. In 1828, Paul Moody developed an early belt-driven power transfer system to supersede the unreliable gearwork that was utilized at the time. In 1830, Patrick Tracy Jackson <b>commissioned</b> <b>work</b> on the Boston and Lowell Railroad, one of the Oldest railroads in North America. It opened five years became independent in 1845, patent medicine factories like Hood's Sarsaparilla Laboratory later, making the Middlesex Canal obsolete.

25|$|Nearly 100 years later, {{ideas about}} the meaning of the battle have become more inclusive. The United States {{government}} acknowledged that Native American sacrifices also deserved recognition at the site. The 1991 bill changing the name of the national monument also authorized an Indian Memorial to be built near Last Stand Hill in honor of Lakota and Cheyenne warriors. The <b>commissioned</b> <b>work</b> by native artist Colleen Cutschall is shown in the photograph at right. On Memorial Day 1999, in consultation with tribal representatives, the U.S. added two red granite markers to the battlefield to note where Native American warriors fell.

500|$|Due to German {{persecution}} of the Jews {{and the threat}} of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through <b>commissioned</b> <b>work.</b> In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.
