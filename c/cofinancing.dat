"In 1991, the Work Bank Group, {{international}} financial institution that provides loans to developing countries for capital programs, established the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) to address global environmental issues in partnership with international institutions, private sector, etc., especially by providing funds to developing countries’ all kinds of projects. The GEF provides grants to developing countries and countries with economies in transition for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants. These projects benefit the global environment, linking local, national, and global environmental challenges and promoting sustainable livelihoods. GEF has allocated $10 billion, supplemented by more than $47 billion in <b>cofinancing,</b> for more than 2,800 projects in more than 168 developing countries and countries with economies in transition. Through its Small Grants Programme (SGP), the GEF has also made more than 13,000 small grants directly to civil society and community-based organizations, totalling $634 million.The GEF partnership includes 10 agencies: the UN Development Programme; the UN Environment Programme; the World Bank; the UN Food and Agriculture Organization; the UN Industrial Development Organization; the African Development Bank; the Asian Development Bank; the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; the Inter-American Development Bank; and the International Fund for Agricultural Development.

50|$|Even when {{concentrating on}} {{dedicated}} mobility programmes (or programmes where mobility {{is a distinct}} activity) are we faced with problems.First, problems of definition can make comparability difficult.Second (and partly {{as a consequence of}} this), the way in which information is gathered (and what is gathered) may differ from programme to programme, which makes it yet more difficult to come up with robust and comparable information. It is not possible to see from the statistical material available whether some activities were undertaken as placements or as another form of mobility. Moreover, mobility programmes (or programmes incorporating mobility activities) are undertaken in many different contexts, and there is virtually no national level overview of all mobility activities.The annual Dutch BISON monitoring report of international mobility within education and training remains an isolated initiative, but it includes only mobility taking place within the framework of educational establishments. In addition, all the information available is concerned with outgoing mobility (the sending aspect), and there is no indication of incoming mobility (hosting). This lack of quantitative data makes it very difficult to arrive at any figures concerning both the participation rates and financing involved.For the Leonardo da Vinci programme, we can give very precise indications on participation rates and the amount of funding in the programme, but we do not have figures on funding that also involves national <b>cofinancing.</b> Given the different ways of calculating this from project to project, and the varying percentage of Commission funding, a conservative estimate would put this at a level equal to the Commission’s contribution (e.g. for {{the second phase of the}} Leonardo da Vinci programme, approximately EUR 600 million).|$|E

40|$|The monopartite {{nature of}} the begomovirus tomato leaf {{deformation}} virus (ToLDeV) reported in Peru is demonstrated here. The DNA molecule cloned from an infected plant was shown to be fully infectious in tomatoes inducing leaf curling and stunted growth similar to that observed in field-infected plants. The viral DNA was reisolated from systemically infected tissues of inoculated plants, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. ToLDeV was demonstrated, therefore, as the causal agent of the disease syndrome widespread in tomato crops in Peru. This virus was shown to be present throughout the major tomato-growing regions of this country, both in tomatoes and wild plants. Analyses of the sequences of 51 ToLDeV isolates revealed a significant genetic diversity with three major genetic types co-circulating in the population. S.

40|$|<b>Cofinancing</b> is a {{term used}} in the movie {{industry}} to describe films for which multiple firms share the cost of production and revenues. We find that one-third of movies produced by major studios between 1987 and 2000 are cofinanced. Anecdotal evidence strongly indicates that <b>cofinancing</b> is {{for the purpose of}} risk management. However, the major studios are publicly traded firms, which allows investors to make their own diversification decisions, leading us to question the importance of <b>cofinancing</b> for risk management. Contrary to industry-claims, we find that <b>cofinancing</b> decisions are unrelated to the distribution of individual movie returns—studios do not appear to cofinance relatively risky films. But we do find that studios are more likely to cofinance movies that account for a large fraction of their total annual production budget, which reduces portfolio risk via the law of large numbers. Toward an alternative explanation for <b>cofinancing,</b> we also find that <b>cofinancing</b> between two major studios impacts the release dates of their other movies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how {{a public}} institution chooses the optimal contract (<b>cofinancing</b> rate) in funding agricultural R&D research projects. A theoretical model is developed within a principal-agent framework {{taking into account}} the asymmetric information both players have to handle. The researcher (the agent) initially does not know the <b>cofinancing</b> granted by the funding institution (the principal). This latter, in turn, only observes some objective features of the researchers and of the selected research projects and, ex post, the research outcome, but not the agent's actual effort on the project. The principal uses the available information to offer the <b>cofinancing</b> rate (the contract) that, under specific contractual clauses, induces the agent's effort that maximizes principal's utility. The model eventually assumes the form of a Stackelberg-type game. An empirically testable relation is also derived from the theoretical model and is then applied to the agricultural R&D programme funded by the Italian region Emilia-Romagna over years 2001 - 2006.
