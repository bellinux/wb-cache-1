5000|$|The {{safety profile}} of {{cinoxacin}} {{appears to be}} rather unremarkable. Adverse drug reactions appear {{to be limited to}} the gastrointestinal system and the central nervous system. Hypersensitivity resulting in an anaphylactic reactions (as seen with all drugs found within this class) has also been reported in association with cinoxacin. Animal studies have shown that Cinoxacin is associated with renal damage. Such damage appears to be due to the physical trauma resulting from deposition of cinoxacin crystals in the urinary tract. [...] Such <b>crystaluria</b> has also been reported with other drugs in this class. [...] A review of the literature indicates that patients treated with cinoxacin reported fewer adverse drug reactions than those treated with nalidixic acid, furadantin, amoxicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{case study}} of Sarge, a ten year old male {{castrated}} Dalmation, presented to Cornell University Hospital for Animals Medicine Service for urinary obstruction and cystoscopy. He was obstructed by urinary calculi and the stones were discovered to be 100 % urate due to a primary defect in his purine metabolism. Sarge was managed with a diet change for a period of time. He returned again to Cornell with ammonium biurate <b>crystaluria</b> and presumptive urate uroliths. His uric acid excetion was quantified and it was recommended he start allopurinol therapy.

40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} whether the sex-dependent expression of hepatic and renal oxalate transporter sat- 1 (Slc 26 a 1) {{changes in a}} rat model of ethylene glycol (EG) -induced hyperoxaluria. Methods Rats were given tap water (12 males and 12 females; controls) or EG (12 males and 12 females; 0. 75 % v/v in tap water) for one month. Oxaluric state was confirmed by biochemical parameters in blood plasma, urine, and tissues. Expression of sat- 1 and rate-limiting enzymes of oxalate synthesis, alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh 1) and hydroxy-acid oxidase 1 (Hao 1), was determined by immunocytochemistry (protein) and/or real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (mRNA). Results EG-treated males had significantly higher (in μmol/L; mean ± standard deviation) plasma (59. 7 ± 27. 2 vs 12. 9 ± 4. 1, P < 0. 001) and urine (3716 ± 1726 vs 241 ± 204, P < 0. 001) oxalate levels, and more abundant oxalate <b>crystaluria</b> than controls, while the liver and kidney sat- 1 protein and mRNA expression {{did not differ significantly}} between these groups. EG-treated females, in comparison with controls had significantly higher (in μmol/L) serum oxalate levels (18. 8 ± 2. 9 vs 11. 6 ± 4. 9, P < 0. 001), unchanged urine oxalate levels, low oxalate <b>crystaluria,</b> and significantly higher expression (in relative fluorescence units) of the liver (1. 59 ± 0. 61 vs 0. 56 ± 0. 39, P = 0. 006) and kidney (1. 77 ± 0. 42 vs 0. 69 ± 0. 27, P < 0. 001) sat- 1 protein, but not mRNA. The mRNA expression of Adh 1 was femaledominant and that of Hao 1 male-dominant, but both were unaffected by EG treatment. Conclusions An increased expression of hepatic and renal oxalate transporting protein sat- 1 in EG-treated female rats could protect from hyperoxaluria and oxalate urolithiasis...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} results of nephrological and urological diagnostics {{and treatment of}} 48 children with dismethabolic nephropathy in age 2 - 15 years old. Oxalaturia was diagnosed in 75 % of patients, uraturia – in 25 %, isolated <b>crystaluria</b> – in 47, 5 %, combination with microeritrocyturia and (or) proteinuria – 52, 5 %. Besides, increasing of malonic dialdehyde concentration in blood and urine, protein, beta 2 -microglobulin and nitrites in blood and urine was marked. This fact testifies to instability of cell membranes and presence of disorders of kidney tissue function. Use of Caneohron N in rehabilitation of children with dismethabolic nephropathies in mono- or combined treatment course leads to normalization of level of malonic dialdehyde, nitric oxide, proteinuria and beta 2 -microglobulin.

40|$|Introduction & Background: Urolithiasis in {{children}} {{is not a}} common disease in western countries. Urolithiasis {{in children}} is more located in the upper urinary tract and only 5 - 10 % {{is seen in the}} bladder. The most com-mon stone composition differs in variable age groups but calcium oxalate seems to be the most common type in all children age groups. Clinical manifestations also differ in different age groups. In infants, growth retarda-tion (FTT) and crying during <b>crystaluria</b> are the most common symptoms and signs. High resolution (HR) sonography (7. 5 MHz) is an effective, noninvasive, and easy to access procedure for the diagnosis of infantile urolithiasis. Even with high resolution sonography (7. 5 MHz) we can determine the grading of nephrocalcino-sis in infants. Non radio-opaque stones are also diagnosed by HR sonography. Patients & Methods: This study tries to emphasize the importance and efficacy of high resolution sonography in the diagnosis of infantile urolithiasis by surveillance of 200 infants under 2 years old with urinary tract stones in Markaz-Tebi-Hospital during 1375 to 1383. Results: In this study the mean age was 12 months old (2 to 24 months) and 55 % were boys; 61 % had positive family history; 54. 5 % (109 ones) had no underlying metabolic disorder and among others 41 (20. 5 %) had hy-percalciuria (the most common); 78 (39 %) had hematuria, 61 (30. 5 %) had pyuria and 61 (30. 5 %) had no ab-normality in U/A. In 63 (31. 5 %), urine culture was positive; 39 (31. 5 %) had macroscopic hematuria. Their chief complaint was changing of urine color in 44 (22 %), <b>crystaluria</b> in 37 (18. 5 %), UTI in 37 (31 %), and no complaints in 20 (10 %). FTT and crying during urination were observed in 25 (12. 5 %) and 12 (6 %) of our pa-tients. In 79. 5 % of all infants, there was a positive sonographic finding that confirmed the stone. About the stone location according to the sonographic finding, 124 (62 %) had kidney stone, 10 (4. 5 %) had ureter stone, and 25 (12. 5 %) had bladder stone. In 31 patients (6. 5 %), stone composition was urate, in 48 (24 %) it was cal-cium oxalate, in 5 (2. 5 %) it was cystine, and in 14 (7 %) it was struvite. Among 63 infants with positive urine culture, 49 patients (30. 8 %) and among 137 infants with negative urine culture, 110 (69. 2 %) had positive sonographic findings. Among 39 infants with macroscopic hematuria, 35 (22 %), and among 161 without mac-roscopic hematuria, 124 (78 %) had positive sonographic findings. Among 124 infants with kidney stones, all of them (78 %), among 34 patients with ureter stone only 10 (6. 3 %) and among 25 infants with bladder stone, all of them (15. 7 %) had positive sonographic findings. Among 13 infants with urate stone, 11 (6. 9 %), among 48 patients with oxalate stone, 39 (24. 5 %), among 5 infants with cystine stones, 4 (2. 5 %), among 14 with struvite stones, 12 (7. 5 %), and among 120 infants with undetermined stone composition, 93 (58. 5 %) had positive sonographic findings. Conclusion: According to {{the results of this study}} and based on the importance of diagnosis of infantile uro-lithiasis, it seems necessary or useful to do HR sonography (7. 5 MHz) especially in infants with specific or non-specific symptoms of urolithiasis, infants with FTT with no good reason infants with recurrent UTI, infants with infantile errors of metabolism especially cystinuria, infants with proven urolithiasis during courses of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Mechanism of {{formation}} {{and development of}} intraluminal concretion, also called Randall's plug, extracted from a female patient forming calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) calculi was examined. Some of these calculi were connected to the papillary tip, and had connections with {{the interior of the}} papilla with finger-like extensions in the collecting duct (CD). The intraluminal concretion consisted of inter-grown COD crystals of irregular size (30 – 100 μm), approximately 5 % of biological hydroxyapatite (BHAP) and an organic matter. Urine of the patient was moderately supersaturated with respect to COD and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). Model of kidney, recently refined by Robertson, was used in calculations. Calculated Reynolds number indicated that the flow of liquid through tubules was purely laminar with parabolic velocity profile. COD crystals formed at the beginning of ascending loop of Henle by heterogeneous nucleation. Concentration of COD crystals in urine was limited and considered equal to concentration of crystals during <b>crystaluria.</b> The free particle and the fixed particle mechanisms were considered. The free particle mechanism assumes formation of a single crystal or agglomerate of crystals blocking the CD by virtue of size. The growth of COD crystals at concrete urinary supersaturation was too slow for a single crystal to attain size with settling velocity faster than the translation flow rate of liquid. Hydrodynamic shear caused aggregation of COD solid particles dispersed in a liquid flowing in the nephron. Number of COD crystals present in urine was not sufficient for formation of fractal agglomerate blocking the Bellini duct. Similarly, a fractal agglomerate of urinary phosphate present in the form of Posner's clusters was not large enough to obstruct the Bellini duct. The opening of the CD could not be obstructed by a single crystal of COD or fractal agglomerate composed of either COD crystals or calcium phosphate clusters, formed in urine by virtue of size. Solid objects not immobilised inside the CD were always washed out by urine flow from the CD of any orientation (also upward-draining CD). The {{formation and}} development of plug of our patient was explained by the fixed particle mechanism assuming that Randall's plug developes from crystal(s) attached directly to the tubule wall. The plug was modelled as concretion composed of successive layers of COD crystals originating on the top of underlying layer. When growth of a layer stopped, its surface was covered by organic matter that served as a substrate for nucleation of a new layer. The time of plug development was estimated as the time a COD crystal needed to reach {{the opposite side of the}} duct plus duration of interruptions of crystalline growth when plug surface was covered by a layer of organic matter and phosphatic particles were incorporated into concretion. The flux of Posner's clusters arriving to the concretion surface was estimated from theory of Brownian motion. These calculations suggested that obstruction of the Bellini duct of our patient by the Randall's plug occurred over a period of approximately 4 months after nucleus of concretion became attached to the duct wall or on the papillary tip...|$|E
