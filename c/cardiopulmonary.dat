5|$|First {{responder}} – A {{person who}} arrives {{first at the}} scene of an incident, and whose job is to provide early critical care such as <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation (CPR) or using an automated external defibrillator (AED). First responders may be dispatched by the ambulance service, may be passers-by, or may be dispatched to the scene from other agencies, such as the police or fire departments.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a <b>cardiopulmonary</b> arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. <b>Cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|Rainwater {{collapsed}} after {{a lecture}} at the Pupin Laboratories in 1985 but was revived {{by a student}} {{who knew how to}} administer CPR. In declining health, he retired and became a professor emeritus in February 1986. He died from <b>cardiopulmonary</b> arrest at St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers, New York on May 31, 1986. He was survived by his wife, three sons and half-brother George.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E
5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, {{there have}} been four {{recorded}} deaths, all in Tasmania and all due to anaphylactic shock. All known patients who died from jack jumper stings were at least 40 {{years old and had}} <b>cardiopulmonary</b> comorbidities. Severe laryngeal oedema and coronary atherosclerosis was detected in most of the autopsies of those who died. Most of the victims died within 20 minutes after being stung. Prior to any desensitisation program being established, the fatality rate was one person every four years from the sting.|$|E
5|$|When Bågenholm {{was pulled}} out of the water, her pupils were dilated, her blood was not circulating, and she was not breathing. Falkenberg and Næsheim, both doctors, began giving her <b>cardiopulmonary</b> {{resuscitation}} (CPR). The rescue helicopter soon arrived and Bågenholm was brought to the Tromsø University Hospital in an hour. The helicopter emergency team continued to give her CPR during the flight, and she was ventilated with oxygen. She was also treated with a defibrillator, but to no effect.|$|E
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for <b>Cardiopulmonary</b> Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E
25|$|Persistent free {{radicals}} connected to airborne fine particles {{are linked to}} <b>cardiopulmonary</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cardiopulmonary</b> {{resuscitation}} is {{an important}} life saving first aid skill, practiced throughout the world. It is the only known effective method of keeping someone who has suffered cardiac arrest alive long enough for definitive treatment to be delivered. In 1954, James Elam {{was the first to}} demonstrate experimentally that <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation (CPR) was a sound technique, and together with Dr. Peter Safar he demonstrated its superiority to previous methods.|$|E
25|$|It {{deals with}} the {{anesthesia}} aspects of care related to surgical cases such as open heart surgery, lung surgery, and other operations of the human chest. These aspects include perioperative care with expert manipulation of patient <b>cardiopulmonary</b> physiology through precise and advanced application of pharmacology, resuscitative techniques, critical care medicine, and invasive procedures. This also includes management of the <b>cardiopulmonary</b> bypass (heart-lung) machine, which most cardiac procedures require intraoperatively while the heart undergoes surgical correction.|$|E
25|$|Fellows {{are trained}} to provide {{perioperative}} anesthetic management for patients with severe <b>cardiopulmonary</b> pathology. Some of the cardiac surgeries they train for include the following: coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) both on <b>cardiopulmonary</b> bypass {{as well as on}} a beating heart, heart valve surgery, aortic reconstruction requiring deep hypothermic arrest, mechanical ventricular assist device (VAD) placement, thoracic aortic aneurysm repair, aortic dissection repair, heart transplants, lung transplants, heart/lung transplants, and adult congenital heart surgery.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{management}} for all poisonings includes ensuring adequate <b>cardiopulmonary</b> function and providing treatment for any {{symptoms such as}} seizures, shock, and pain.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cardiopulmonary</b> {{laboratory}} {{consists of}} machines that perform {{a myriad of}} respiratory function tests and aerobic performance measurements that are often recorded before and after pressure and/or thermal exposure.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{application}} of the ABC principle is in first aid, and is used in cases of unconscious patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation.|$|E
25|$|Van Ronk {{received}} a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in December 1997. He {{died in a}} New York hospital of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> failure while undergoing postoperative treatment for colon cancer.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{elements}} of resuscitation for sudden cardiac arrest are <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation (CPR in turn consists of mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compression), defibrillation and {{emergency medical services}} (the means to bring these techniques to the patient quickly).|$|E
25|$|Grandenetti, {{who lived}} in Bellport, New York, on Long Island, died at age 83 at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in nearby East Patchogue, New York. The {{official}} {{cause of death was}} <b>cardiopulmonary</b> arrest, though he also had metastatic cancer.|$|E
25|$|In addition, at high altitude, {{the heart}} beats faster; the stroke volume is {{slightly}} decreased; and non-essential bodily functions are suppressed, {{resulting in a}} decline in food digestion efficiency (as the body suppresses the digestive system in favor of increasing its <b>cardiopulmonary</b> reserves).|$|E
25|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{evidence}} to show that ground-level ozone can harm lung function and irritate the respiratory system. Exposure to ozone (and the pollutants that produce it) is linked to premature death, asthma, bronchitis, heart attack, and other <b>cardiopulmonary</b> problems.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that 3D medical animations may be used to instruct novices on how to perform <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation in an emergency. These reports usually suggest the use of pre-prepared, voice-narrated motion-capture animations that are viewed by means of a cellphone or other portable electronic device.|$|E
25|$|Defibrillation is the {{definitive}} treatment of ventricular fibrillation, whereby an electrical current {{is applied to}} the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles, with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for co-ordinated contractions to occur again. The use of this is often dictated around the world by Advanced Cardiac Life Support or Advanced Life Support algorithms, which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors, nurses and paramedics and also advocates the use of drugs, predominantly epinephrine, after every second unsuccessful attempt at defibrillation, as well as <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation (CPR) in between defibrillation attempts. Though ALS/ACLS algorithms encourage the use of drugs, they state first and foremost that defibrillation should not be delayed for any other intervention and that adequate <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation be delivered with minimal interruption.|$|E
25|$|Exercises {{are aimed}} at {{improving}} posture, strengthening back and chest muscles, and enhancing exercise capacity, ideally also increasing chest expansion. Pectus exercises include deep breathing and breath holding exercises, as well as strength training for the back and chest muscles. Additionally, aerobic exercises to improve <b>cardiopulmonary</b> function are employed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cardiopulmonary</b> bypass (CPB) is a {{technique}} in which heart-lung machine temporarily takes over {{the function of the}} heart and lungs during surgery. The CPB is operated by the perfusionist, during the heart operation the perfusionist takes over the heart function. The perfusionist works in close relation with the anesthesiologist and the surgeon.|$|E
25|$|Delayed {{clamping}} is {{not recommended}} {{as a response to}} cases where the newborn is not breathing well and needs resuscitation. Rather, the recommendation is instead to immediately clamp and cut the cord and perform <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation. The umbilical cord pulsating is not a guarantee that the baby is receiving enough oxygen.|$|E
25|$|On July 31, 2015, Piper died in {{his sleep}} {{at the age of}} 61 at his home in Hollywood, California. His death {{certificate}} attributes this to <b>cardiopulmonary</b> arrest caused by hypertension, listing a pulmonary embolism as a contributing factor; TMZ reported this as a heart attack caused by the embolism.|$|E
25|$|When <b>cardiopulmonary</b> {{status is}} {{compromised}} (i.e. when the fluid or air has its repercussions on {{the function of}} heart and lungs), due to air (significant pneumothorax), fluid (pleural fluid) or blood (hemothorax) outside the lung, then this procedure is usually replaced with tube thoracostomy, the placement of a large tube in the pleural space.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Mower {{served in}} several {{capacities}} at Sinai Hospital. He {{was a research}} associate in the <b>Cardiopulmonary</b> Laboratory, Acting Administrative Director of the Division of Cardiology, Acting Chief of Cardiology, and Chief of Cardiology. Mower also held the positions of Secretary-Treasurer, Vice-President, and President of the Medical Staff at Sinai Hospital.|$|E
25|$|King {{was rushed}} to St. Joseph's Hospital, where doctors opened his chest and {{performed}} <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation. He never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 7:05p.m. According to Taylor Branch, King's autopsy revealed that his heart was in the condition of a 60-year-old man, which Branch attributed to the stress of King's 13 years in the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
25|$|Minimaze {{procedures}} are minimally invasive {{versions of the}} original Cox maze procedure but without cardiac incisions. These procedures do not require a median sternotomy (vertical incision in the breastbone) or <b>cardiopulmonary</b> bypass (heart-lung machine). They use laser, cryothermy, radiofrequency, or acoustic energy to ablate atrial tissue near the pulmonary veins and make other required ablations to mimic the maze.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{longitudinal}} studies {{reveal that the}} most common form of the condition, late-onset idiopathic scoliosis, causes little physical impairment other than back pain and cosmetic concerns, even when untreated, with mortality rates similar to the general population. Older beliefs that untreated idiopathic scoliosis necessarily progresses into severe (<b>cardiopulmonary)</b> disability by old age have been refuted by later studies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cardiopulmonary</b> {{resuscitation}} (CPR) is {{an emergency}} procedure that combines chest compressions often with artificial ventilation {{in an effort to}} manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest. It is recommended in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing, for example, agonal respirations.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{babies who}} are {{eligible}} for kangaroo care include pre-term infants weighing less than , and breathing independently. <b>Cardiopulmonary</b> monitoring, oximetry, supplemental oxygen or nasal (continuous positive airway pressure) ventilation, intravenous infusions, and monitor leads do not prevent kangaroo care. In fact, babies who are in kangaroo care {{tend to be less}} prone to apnea and bradycardia and have stabilization of oxygen needs.|$|E
25|$|MBTA {{police officer}} Richard H. Donohue Jr. (33) was {{critically}} wounded during a firefight with the bombers {{just after midnight}} on April 19. He lost almost all of his blood, and his heart stopped for 45 minutes, during which time he was kept alive by <b>cardiopulmonary</b> resuscitation. The Boston Globe reported that Donohue may have been accidentally shot by a fellow officer.|$|E
25|$|While in the {{intensive-care}} unit, on {{the afternoon}} of September 13, 1996, Shakur died from internal bleeding; doctors attempted to revive him but could not stop the hemorrhaging. His mother, Afeni, made the decision to tell the doctors to stop. He was pronounced dead at 4:03p.m. (PDT). The official causes of death were noted as respiratory failure and <b>cardiopulmonary</b> arrest in connection with multiple gunshot wounds.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{supported}} by methods that certainly maintain enough blood circulation and oxygenation for sustaining life during stopped heartbeat and breathing, such as <b>cardiopulmonary</b> bypass, are not customarily considered clinically dead. All {{parts of the}} body except the heart and lungs continue to function normally. Clinical death occurs only if machines providing sole circulatory support are turned off, leaving the patient in a state of stopped blood circulation.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol is {{commonly}} used in the circuit prime of a heart lung machine during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> bypass. The presence of mannitol preserves renal function during the times of low blood flow and pressure, while the patient is on bypass. The solution prevents the swelling of endothelial cells in the kidney, which may have otherwise reduced blood flow to this area and resulted in cell damage.|$|E
