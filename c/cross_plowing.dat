40|$|Traditional tillage systems {{practiced by}} farmers in {{semi-arid}} regions of Ethiopia {{are characterized by}} repeated and <b>cross</b> <b>plowing</b> with an indigenous plow called Maresha. Repeated and <b>cross</b> <b>plowing</b> have led to land degradation. Conservation tillage systems that advocate minimum soil disturbance can alleviate land degradation problems. However, before introducing reduced tillage systems, it was found necessary to study why farmers undertake repeated plowing. The study was undertaken in two semi-arid areas called Melkawoba and Wulinchity located in the central rift valley of Ethiopia and on two major crops; Tef (Eragrostis Tef (Zucc.)) and maize (Zea mays XX). Fifty farmers from each area were randomly selected and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The results showed that farmers {{in the study area}} plow repeatedly in order to completely disturb unplowed strips of land left between adjacent furrows. Unplowed strips are the results of the V-shaped furrows created by the Maresha plow. Farmers generally do not plow before the soil is wetted by rainfall. Wetting and drying cycles due to dry spells occurring between rainfall events force farmers to plow frequently to avoid moisture losses through surface runoff, evaporation and weed transpiration. Tef fields are plowed 4 ¿ 5 times while maize fields are plowed 3 ¿ 4 times. Tillage frequency increased with the education level and experience of farmers; with their perception about the purpose of tillage such as moisture conservation, weed control and soil warming; and with resource availability such as area of land and family labor. Tillage frequency was higher for Tef than for maize and in heavy soils than in light soils...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} tillage implement, the Maresha plow, and the tillage {{systems that}} require repeated and <b>cross</b> <b>plowing</b> have caused poor rainfall partitioning and hence low water productivity in Ethiopia. Considering the limitations {{to a wider}} application of irrigation schemes among the resource poor farmers, {{it is critical that}} the available rainwater is managed properly by increasing infiltration and water holding capacity of the soil and by minimizing evaporation losses especially during the dry periods. Conservation tillage with no-till has been used by farmers in America (south and North) and Australia to alleviate these problems. However, since no-till could not be easily adopted by smallholder farmers in Africa, due to socio-economic and environmental problems, locally adapted conservation tillage systems have been introduced in several parts of th...|$|E
40|$|Conservation tillage {{systems have}} been adopted by farmers in many {{countries}} {{to solve the problem}} of land degradation and declining water productivity. However, direct application of such tillage systems was not possible among resource poor smallholder farmers in semi arid areas of Ethiopia. Problems such as shortage of rainfall, cost of herbicides, cost of implements and the small seeded crop, tef, which can not be planted in rows required development of locally adapted conservation tillage systems. This book presents the problems of traditional tillage systems and the results of tests carried out on appropriate conservation tillage implements and systems for smallholder farmers in semi arid regions of Ethiopia. The traditional tillage implement, the Maresha Plow and the related tillage systems were identified to be the main causes of repeated and <b>cross</b> <b>plowing</b> that led to land degradation and reduced water productivity. The Maresha modified implements were found to be suitable to undertake conservation tillage systems while being simple, light and affordable. Two types of tillage systems developed for maize and tef were found to reduce surface runoff, increase availability of water to crops and increase yields. The way forward and recommended areas of future research are also presented. More information: [URL] Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

The Spanish colonizers also envisioned the use of the <b>Cross</b> and the <b>Plow</b> in giving the people of the pueblos under the bells an era of peace, {{progress}} and prosperity. In 1763 San Miguel was founded as a town by Miguel Pineda who became the first capitan municipal of the town. Vast tracts of land were cultivated and planted to the golden grain which brought bountiful harvest of the basic food. In 1782 Angat became a separate town from Bocaue.|$|R
40|$|Adoption of soil {{conservation}} structures (SCS) has been low in high rainfall areas of Ethiopia mainly due to crop yield reduction, increased soil erosion following breaching of SCS, incompatibility with {{the tradition of}} <b>cross</b> <b>plowing</b> and water-logging behind SCS. A new type of conservation tillage (CT) involving contour plowing {{and the construction of}} invisible subsoil barriers using a modified Maresha winged "subsoiler" is suggested as a means to tackle these problems {{as an integral part of}} the SCS. We investigated the effect of integrating the CT with SCS on the surface runoff, water-logging, soil loss, crop yield and plowing convenience. The new approach of conservation tillage has been compared with traditional tillage (TT) on 5 farmers' fields in a high rainfall area in the upper Blue Nile (Abbay) river basin. Test crops were wheat [triticum vulgare] and tef [eragrostis tef]. Farmers found CT convenient to apply between SCS. Surface runoff appeared to be reduced under CT by 48 and 15 %, for wheat and tef, respectively. As a result, CT reduced sediment yield by 51 and 9. 5 %, for wheat and tef, respectively. Significantly reduced water-logging was observed behind SCS in CT compared to TT. Grain yields of wheat and tef increased by 35 and 10 %, respectively, although the differences were not statistically significant apparently due to high fertility variations among fields of participating farmers. Farmers who tested CT indicated that they will continue this practice in the future. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

This study was initiated to test strip tillage systems using implements that were modified forms of the Maresha plow, and to evaluate the impacts of the new tillage systems on water balance and grain yields of maize (Zea mays XX). Experiments were conducted in two dry semi arid areas called Melkawoba and Wulinchity, in the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia during 2003 &ndash; 2005. Strip tillage systems that involved cultivating planting lines at a spacing of 0. 75 m using the Maresha plow followed by subsoiling {{along the same lines}} (STS) and without subsoiling (ST) were compared with the traditional tillage system of 3 to 4 times plowing with the Maresha plow (CONV).
