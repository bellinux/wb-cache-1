40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the feasibility of building a simple and inexpensive device to preserve organs or tissues in hyperbaric and hypothermic conditions. Methods. the device was built on a 40 -cm wide, 28 -cm long, and 23 -cm deep stainless steel chassis. the pressure vessel was built by a 7. 8 -cm bore stainless steel cylinder put inside another 12 -cm cylinder welded together and closed by a steel plate on the top and bottom. the inferior plate was welded, and the superior one was fixed by manual clasp nut. the cooling system is made up of air compressor, condenser, expansion area, and cooling worm that is located between the cylinders. the temperature-controlling device is a computer processor contained in an integrated-circuit chip, with a on-off system to maintain the chamber temperature between 2 degrees to 4 degrees C. the compression of the chamber is performed by lateral coupling with the oxygen cylinder and is maintained at 5. 5 absolute atmospheres and controlled by air pressure gauge. the maximal work pressure was evaluated by spreadsheet. Temperature or pressure changes were evaluated by 12 - and 24 -hour assays. Results. the maximal work pressure permitted was 6. 5 absolute atmospheres. Thus, the container was free from danger. the temperature inside the chamber was kept between 2 degrees and 4 degrees C. the production <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> was US$ 1000. Discussion. the manufacture of the refrigerating hyperbaric chamber is viable, simple, and inexpensive.

Main HOST commercial innovation {{is to use}} one vehicle for four different transport service in the 24 hours thus lowering <b>the</b> extra-cost <b>of</b> having a low polluting vehicle. HOST has been dimensioned to supply four different urban transport services: nocturne collective taxi, daytime car sharing, daytime freight collection and distribution and nocturne garbage collection. The user acceptance, energy and environmental and financial evaluation are reported in this paper. The user acceptance evaluation showed that HOST characteristics (transshipment capabilities, enhanced maneuverability and environmental concern) are interesting, but issues as the technological complexity and lack of infrastructures have to be resolved. The powertrain, a hybrid series, has considerably lower emissions levels than conventional vehicles while consumption is comparable for all the services but car-sharing in which HOST consumes more due to its higher weight. The financial evaluation shows that at the moment, to build the HOST powertrain, about 165 000 are needed and a complete vehicle with also the cabin could cost about 290 000.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringRuth Douglas MillerThis {{dissertation}} presents <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a novel multi-level inverter with FACTS {{capability for}} small to mid-size (10 – 20 kW) permanent-magnet wind installations using modular multi-level converter (MMC) topology. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{work is to}} design {{a new type of}} inverter with D-STATCOM option to provide utilities with more control on active and reactive power transfer <b>of</b> distribution lines. <b>The</b> inverter is placed between the renewable energy source, specifically a wind turbine, and the distribution grid in order to fix <b>the</b> power factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grid at a target value, regardless of wind speed, by regulating active and reactive power required by the grid. The inverter is capable of controlling active and reactive power by controlling the phase angle and modulation index, respectively. <b>The</b> unique contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed work is to combine <b>the</b> two concepts <b>of</b> inverter and D-STATCOM using a novel voltage source converter (VSC) multi-level topology in a single unit without additional <b>cost.</b> Simulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed inverter, with 5 and 11 levels, have been conducted in MATLAB/Simulink for two systems including 20 kW/kVAR and 250 W/VAR.

After research into <b>the</b> unique problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project, an examination of a previous design attempt by staff <b>of</b> GM Thailand, <b>the</b> researcher developed a new design, <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> this report. Different solutions for each design problem were investigated before the design was finalised. A three-wheeled vehicle was designed making use of two motors in a differential-drive setup to control motion. Navigation is via a line-following mechanism, using an induction sensor-array in conjunction with a pre-laid metallic strip. To aid the design, the system was modelled to understand the different control elements at play. The researcher developed software for several aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design: for the PLC controlling the system and motors; for a microcontroller that communicates with the PLC and a wireless module; for a computer server that communicates with a second wireless device, receiving information from the PLC; and a web interface to view this information.

40|$|Eye gaze tracker is {{a device}} for {{monitoring}} and recording eye motion and related eye data. It is a hands-off, not intrusive, remote human-computer interface {{that can be}} used to track a user's gazepoint. It allows an operator to interact with their environment using only their eyes. During 2 decades of development, hundreds of eyegaze, eye-controlled, computer/communication systems have been sold around the world, primarily as an assistive device for people with disabilities and as a tool for human factors research. Gaze information plays an important role in identifying a person's focus <b>of</b> attention. <b>The</b> information can provide useful communication cues to a multimodal interface. A person's gaze direction is determined by two factors: <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, and <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyes. While <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head determines <b>the</b> overall direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gaze, <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyes determines the exact gaze direction and is limited by the head orientation. To be applied in general computer interfaces, an ideal eye tracker should: be precise to minutes of arc; have repetitive behaviour; work under different conditions such as lighting fluctuations, operator with glasses and contact etc; allow for free head motion; be easy to use on a variety of subjects. This paper regards <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> an economic and ergonomic eye gaze tracker using time compression techniques. A low cost and custom fit approach is used in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> this Eye gaze tracker: a single low-cost B/W mini-camera (Table 1) is used to acquire video images. A good image contrast is obtained using one IR LED, positioned in proximity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camera, with orientation suitable to produce the dark-pupil effect: this setup allows an easy pupil image identification.

This light has an ideal color rendering index (CRI), so it can be used for any application. The traditional and obsolete incandescent light bulbs, acting as a blackbody radiator, offer a very poor efficiency converting the electricity into light, producing only 10 - 20 lm/W. The developed smart system is controlled by an Arduino Nano equipped with an ATmega 328 microcontroller. It contains 6 different LED types: red, cyan, green, blue, warm white and neutral white. This selection of colors covers almost the whole visible band <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic spectrum, allowing to fit the LED global light to the blackbody curve. The color temperature can be selected through two different graphical user interfaces (GUI) and they are programmed in MATLAB and App Inventor, a programming language for Android devices developed by <b>the</b> Massachussets Institute <b>of</b> Technology (MIT). On these interfaces the user can control <b>the</b> main parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light, such as the color temperature and the global intensity. <b>The</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual LED, the luminous efficacy and <b>the</b> CRI <b>of</b> each selection is given for informational purposes. Furthermore, the GUI developed in MATLAB shows a graphic with the color diagram and the planckian locus plotted inside, changing <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> a pointer for each color temperature selected. Moreover, the MATLAB GUI requires a USB connexion while the Android GUI needs the bluetooth technology. This microcontroller used can only provide 40 mA of electrical intensity per pin. It causes several restrictions on <b>the</b> <b>prototype,</b> resulting in a low luminous flux (10 - 30 lm) and a greater eficiency (30 - 50 lm/W) than a halogen light bulb but smaller than a CFL. These issues can be solved changing the circuit, adding transistors and an external power source able to provide 700 mA per pin, <b>the</b> nominal intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> used LED. This improvement increases the efficiency to values between 50 and 60 lm/W, <b>the</b> typical performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CFL light bulb. Finally, the economical study shows that <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> is approximately 180 €, but an industrial process can reduce the price more than 130 €, giving a final <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> less than 50 € per unit.

The hand designed in this work has a total of 22 degrees of freedom of which 18 are independently drivable. In order to minimise weight and cost the hand has been produced from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) using 3 D printing techniques. This removes the need for extensive machining which would add significantly to <b>the</b> overall <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand. A <b>prototype</b> finger has been produced and tested and a full mechanical design is presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|Up to now, Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) {{had only}} {{little impact on}} {{industrial}} practice. Restricted representations did not allow for capturing all relevant aspects of complex real-life problems, the methods were weak in multi-criteria optimization and, even simple CAPP models became computation-ally prohibitive. Here we present a new, multi-agent based approach that tries to overcome these difficulties. Our method is based on <b>the</b> co-operation <b>of</b> domain-specific geometry and technology related agents and a general purpose optimizer engine. While the specific agents, working on the exact geomet-rical representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> part, available machines and tools, build up <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process plans, the solver extracts solutions from this space. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is applied to find Pareto sets of solutions that are best according to several criteria, such as changeover and production <b>costs.</b> <b>The</b> operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> CAPP system is demonstrated through examples in traditional machining...|$|R
40|$|NASA's new {{unmanned}} SLR 2000 {{system is}} designed to track, with millimeter precision and using single photon returns, a constellation of roughly 24 retroreflector-equipped satellites, which range in altitude from about 300 km to 20, 000 km. Totally autonomous operation and a common engineering configuration are expected to greatly reduce station operations costs relative to NASA's current manned systems. The system has also been designed with a goal of significantly lowering replication <b>costs.</b> All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> components and subsystems have been completed and tested and have substantially met the original specifications. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> system is presently undergoing final integration and testing in a dedicated shelter with an azimuth tracking dome synchronized to the optical tracking mount. The facility also features a number of security features such as security cameras and sensors designed to detect power or thermal control problems or entry by unauthorized personnel. Field tests are in progress. The present paper provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various subsystems and test results to date. The meteorological subsystem, which has operated successfully {{in the field for}} almost three years, consists of several sensors which measure: (1) pressure, temperature, and relative humidity; (2) wind speed and direction; (3) ground visibility and precipitation; and (4) local cloud cover as a function of station azimuth and elevation (day and night). A "pseudo-operator" software program interprets the sensor readings and modifies satellite tracking priorities based on local meteorological conditions...|$|R
40|$|A Reformer Tube is {{a device}} used in {{chemical}} engineering, commonly in {{the fuel cell}} technology, used to perform chemical reactions to produce chemicals products. Commonly the process involves heating the introduced chemicals in the tube to ultra-high temperatures at pressures around 20 bars encouraging rapid reactions. Reformer tube construction is described within which both the desired endothermic catalysed chemical reaction and heat transfer from the reaction products to the incoming reactants are accomplished [10]. <b>The</b> service life <b>of</b> these devices is primary ended when Creeps Shear damage is detected. Due to <b>the</b> complex combination <b>of</b> multiple factors between temperature, stress and aggressive environment during service influencing <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> Creep damage, it is of significant benefit for process companies using condition-based assessment rather than time-based estimation to judge <b>the</b> retirement <b>of</b> reformer tubes. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this research is to investigate a low-cost, mechatronic reformer tube inspection system that can replace the conventional expensive laser based system employed by New Zealand Methanex Ltd. The system must be a non-destructive examination (NDT) instrument capable of making a full inspection of a vertically standing, 110 mm bore, 14 m reformer tube within 5 minutes duration. Specification requirements set by the company state that the new system {{must be able to}} make measurement of at least 2 diametrical axes at axial increments <b>of</b> 25 mm. <b>The</b> measurements are to be of 0. 5 mm accuracy or better. <b>The</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube stands to handle processing of Methanol stored at temperature of 500 degrees Celsius, gathering internal pressure of up to 20 bars. Due <b>the</b> cyclic repetition <b>of</b> these thermal and pressure changes, the tube will overtime result in internal cavity adaption causing tube failure through Creeping Shear. The device will be used to inspect the internal diameter change caused by creep damage and thus forecast the remaining service life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tubes to help schedule <b>the</b> retirement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reformer tubes at the most efficient timing. The project commended with a research investigating <b>the</b> variety <b>of</b> reformer tube inspection techniques available for modern furnaces and reviewed the application methodologies and limitations. Based on the findings, the project proceeded to develop a low cost, mechanical reformer tube inspection system. The new system is branded Reformer Tube Internal Diameter Measuring (RTIDM) system. In <b>the</b> final part <b>of</b> this research, field testing was conducted at the Methanex Ltd furnace to examine the RTIDM systems performance. Analysis performed on the collected data from the field test revealed that the RTIDM system is a working system capable of making diametrical measurement at <b>the</b> precision <b>of</b> +/- 0. 1668 mm. Documented in this thesis is an in-depth discussion on <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformer Tube Internal Diameter Measuring (FTIDM) system. Conclusively, the RTIDM system developed in this research provided new method for reformer tube inspection. With <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> is under $ 2000 NZD, the design is a much cost friendly instrument compared with its rival devices while capable of making diametrical inspection at competitive precision and accuracy...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{experimental}} model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ercoupe was test-flown at College Park {{airport in}} 1937. It {{had a single}} tail (unlike the eventual production Ercoupes, with their characteristic twin tails) and {{was known as the}} [...] "Jeep". In late 1938, ERCO searched unsuccessfully for a suitable engine for its new airplane. ERCO hired Harold Morehouse, former engineer in charge of small engine design at Continental Motors, to design a new engine. He came up with the inverted, in-line I-L 116, which provided good pilot visibility and enhanced aircraft streamlining. ERCO installed the I-L 116 in <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> Ercoupe Model 310 in 1939. The engine performed well, but ERCO discontinued it when Continental introduced the A-65 engine in 1940, which generated comparable horsepower at half <b>the</b> <b>cost.</b> Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production <b>prototype</b> was completed in 1939, and certification by the CAA was completed in 1940. The first Ercoupe, serial No. 1, was owned by George Brinckerhoff, <b>the</b> operator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> College Park Airport, and flown there. It now is at the National Air and Space Museum.|$|R
40|$|Accessibility to {{graphical}} {{user interfaces}} by visually impaired persons is generally enabled through systems, which reproduce <b>the</b> lexical structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> user interface to a non-visual form, mainly employing 3 D audio output techniques. Two main critical issues have been identified: (i) most interfaces address the needs and abilities of sighted users and consequently the reproduction is only a translation from one language to another; (ii) blind users are generally {{not involved in the}} development stage due to <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>prototyping.</b> <b>The</b> present work proposes an interactive user interface to control a multi-sensory shower accessible by both sighted and blind users and able to adapt its control knob to reproduce Braille texts. Such function is realized by <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> an electrotactile feedback device and adopts soft touch finishing to better stimulate touch sensations. Haptic technologies have been exploited to create a virtual high-fidelity prototype to assess individual end-users’ response during the user interface design process. The paper illustrates the designed interface to assist blind users in home environments and <b>the</b> adopted virtual <b>prototyping</b> technique to address the above-mentioned issues...|$|R
