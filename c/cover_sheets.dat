5000|$|The {{differential}} equation of sandwich continuous beams {{can be solved}} {{by the use of}} numerical methods such as finite differences and finite elements. For finite differences Berner [...] recommends a two-stage approach.

Sandwich continuous beam with flexible <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> can also be laid {{on top of each other}} when using this technique. However, the cross-section of the beam has to be constant across the spans.|$|E

50|$|The {{proposal}} was {{to bypass the}} entire process of making paper and impregnating individual sheets, to be subsequently laminated.

50|$|DocuShare is a multi-tier, Java SE-based (rather than Java EE) {{platform}} with an architecture and developer environment that allows interoperability. The platform uses a Tomcat server and various OEM engines including Autonomy Corporation's (for indexing, eForms and BPM) and records management from IBM. Xerox has built out the technology components using a Java SE architecture and adding workflow and search engines. It also contains wiki, blog and comment features, for social networking. For imaging, {{it includes a}} content intake manager (an XMl Parser), ability to e-mail directly to a DocuShare collection, scan <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> (with DataGlyph technology formerly in the Xerox FlowPort and PaperWorks products), and an OCR engine optional add-on (provided by Nuance).|$|E
50|$|After {{exposure}} every {{photograph is}} taken through pinch rollers {{inside of the}} instant camera. Thereby the developer paste contained in the paper 'sandwich' distributes on the image. After a minute, the cover sheet just needs to be removed and one gets a single original positive image with a fixed format. With some systems it was also possible to create an instant image negative, from which then could be made copies in the photo lab. The ultimate development was the SX-70 system of Polaroid, in which a row of ten shots - engine driven - could be made without having to remove any <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> from the picture. There were instant cameras {{for a variety of}} formats, as well as cartridges with instant film for normal system cameras.|$|E

40|$|We {{explored}} a {{new type}} of user interface, interactive cover sheets: computer forms laid out on the banner pages of print jobs that people can mark on, scan back into a multifunction printer/scanner, and use as input to applications. <b>Cover</b> <b>sheets</b> are commonly strewn around printer rooms; with interactivity, they can let people see what others have to say, add their own comments, or play games, all while waiting for their print jobs. We designed three prototype applications and deployed them briefly in our research lab. We found that interactive <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> can be very appealing, that the sheets must be designed so that people can still identify these pages as <b>cover</b> <b>sheets,</b> and that the slow interaction cycle favors asynchronous applications.

40|$|Sandwiches with {{aluminum}} foam core {{have been established}} as lightweight construction material during the last years. These semi-finished products are used particularly {{in the fields of}} engineering, construction, shipbuilding and commercial vehicle design. Commonly steel <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> are used for the sandwich creation because of their high stiffness and the ability to carry heavy loads. In the manufacturing process the two <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> are placed and fixed in a foaming mold realizing the desired spacing. A foamable precursor based upon aluminum and a foaming agent is inserted in between these <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> followed by a heat treatment up to the melting temperature of the Aluminum base alloy. During the foaming process a metallurgical bonding is created resulting in a rigid sandwich called SAS (steel – aluminum foam – steel). The manufacturing process of sandwiches {{with aluminum}} <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> with the method described above (SAS) is rather difficult. For the foaming process the required heat has to be introduced from the outside of the <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> to melt the internal precursor. Even through a skillful choice of alloys, the melting of the aluminum <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> and the foaming of the inserted aluminum precursor usually occurs at the same time. As a result, the desired semi-finished sandwich is not accomplished. That’s why another approach is needed for the sandwich preparation and proved to be feasible. The foamable material is placed in between two aluminum sheets. Afterwards the loose bond is rolled to a single composite with metallic bond. Therefore the heat transfer inside the composite is very good. By choosing alloys of different melting temperature it is possible to foam the inner precursor before the <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> start to melt. So the foaming process can successfully be completed. For this technological process the term AFS (Aluminum Foam Sandwich) has been established. One necessary step for the production of these foamable composite is the rolling, a process that is complex and expensive. Therefor alternative production methods needed to be considered as well. The already successfully tested approach of the SAS production was revisited, to manufacture small sandwiches with aluminum <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> according to the SAS process...|$|E
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating a large contoured structure with complex internal channeling by explosive welding procedures. Structures or nozzles of this nature for wind tunnel applications were designed. Such nozzles vary widely in their complexity. However, in their simplest form, they consist of a grooved base section to which a <b>cover</b> <b>sheet</b> is attached to form a series of internal cooling passages. The <b>cover</b> <b>sheet</b> attachment can be accomplished in various ways: fusion welding, brazing, and diffusion welding. The <b>cover</b> <b>sheet</b> has also been electroformed in place. Of these fabrication methods, brazing has proved most successful in producing nozzles with complex contoured surfaces and a multiplicity of internal channels...|$|R
