40|$|Increases in {{the price}} of fuel and capital {{facilities}} have resulted in pressure for "social " rate-making in the electric utility industry. Southern California Edison has proposed a "lifeii~le " subsidy for half a million low-use consumers, with the revenue deficiency l,"",_novered by increasing the charges for consumption above 300 kwh/month by. 001 c/kwh. An alternative social p!ogram involves the use of fuel stamps; experiments with such a program are now'being carried out in Denver and Leheigh Valley. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to compare the two redistribution policies, using the theory of the consumer under nonlinear budget constraints. Because of conflicting social goals, neither approach is ideal, although stamps appear to be a more specific, and thus cheaper, way to increase electricity consumption and/or utility of low income consumers. 1. Lifeline Rates versus the Declining Block The declining block and lifeline rate structures shown in Figure 1 <b>correspond</b> to the <b>budget</b> <b>lines</b> ABCDE and A'B'C'D E', respectively in Figure 2. For simplicity the price per kwh beyond K 2 for declining blocks is the same as the average price per kwh up to Kl. :for lifeline rates, making the slope of CDE (x) the same as IB!

This essentially means that, good X2 is a normal good as the demand for X2 rose with an increase in the income of the consumer.|$|R

A contract berthing <b>budget</b> <b>line</b> refers to the funding provided under a contract berthing policy to reservists to cover certain lodging and meal expenses. More particularly, selected Reservists (SELRES) are required to conduct drills for pay at their assigned Resdiness Command (REDCOM), including the Naval Air Reserve (NAR) and/or Naval Air Facility (NSF). REDCOMs are typically assigned according to the facility closest to the home of residence of the SELRES. Under current Command Naval Reserves Forces Commond (CNRFC) contract berthing policy, SELRES living more than 50 miles from their assigned NAR are authorized lodging and meals expenses in addition to their drill pay. In this project, REDCOM statistics are analyzed to estimate the increase or decrease in funding required for contract berthing <b>budget</b> <b>line.</b> The current berthing process and the potential futre effects on the 50 -mile radius rule of the contract berthing policy are also examined. The data included in the MBA project were generated in pre-BRAC 2005 decisions; therefore, analyses in this project are based on that data. Finally, based on the foregoing analyses, an assessment in made as to whether changes to the current contract berthing policy are warranted. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
