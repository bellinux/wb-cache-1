25|$|Mexican law {{enforcement}} agencies have not consistently undertaken serious efforts to locate parentally abducted children. Location of the child remains undetermined for eight of the cases included in the September 2000 <b>Compliance</b> <b>Report</b> and in all six of the cases added to this report. In June 2000, Mexico passed a law making familial child abduction a federal crime and forming a federal police unit charged with investigating crimes against children, including the location of missing children. These recent actions may result in improved efforts to locate children.|$|E
25|$|MEXICO: Mexico {{was listed}} in the {{previous}} <b>Compliance</b> <b>Report</b> to Congress as noncompliant with its responsibilities under the Convention. While systemic problems continue {{and a large number}} of cases remain unresolved, Mexico has shown impressive efforts to better meet its Convention responsibilities. Mexican and U.S. Central Authority officials have met four times to discuss better procedures for dealing with cases, resulting in better and more frequent communication and case updates. The Department of State is further encouraged by recent discussions with the Mexican Central Authority regarding plans by the Mexican foreign ministry to allocate additional resources to the program.|$|E

25|$|Twenty-five of the 34 cases {{listed in}} the {{previous}} <b>Compliance</b> <b>Report</b> have been closed, with approximately one-third resulting in {{the return of the}} children to the United States. There have been ten Hague court hearings since Fall 1999, with all children except one returned to the U.S. In one case, children were returned to the United States only six months after the abduction. In addition, there have been voluntary returns in more than 30 cases, with the existence of a pending Hague case a factor in the voluntary return decision. Once a child has been located, the taking parent must be notified of the hearing date. Mexico’s new procedure of taking children into custody at that time has been very effective in ensuring that the taking parent does not go into hiding with the children.|$|E
25|$|Mexico {{remains the}} {{destination}} {{country of the}} greatest number of children abducted from or wrongfully retained outside the United States by parents or other relatives. Despite coordinated efforts undertaken by the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Central Authority, and senior Department of State officials to press for more expeditious processing and resolution of cases, the systemic problems in Mexico's handling of Convention applications that were detailed in the 2002 <b>Compliance</b> <b>Report</b> persisted during the reporting period. The Department’s experience is that, relative to the large number of pending Convention cases in Mexico, the number of cases resolved annually in Mexico is quite small. Most Convention return applications remain pending and never progress to the point of a definitive adjudication. Among the U.S. Central Authority's greatest concerns is Mexico's inability to locate children. Other problems include long delays in adjudication of return applications, the Mexican Central Authority's lack of adequate resources to perform its role effectively, the absence of implementing legislation integrating the Convention into the Mexican legal system, and an apparent lack of understanding of the Convention among many Mexican judges, which has resulted in Convention cases being treated as custody matters or mishandled in other ways.|$|E
2500|$|From the United States. While {{systemic}} problems {{continue and}} a large number of cases remain unresolved, Mexico has shown impressive efforts to better meet its Convention responsibilities. As a result, it was moved from [...] "noncompliant" [...] status (1999 Report to Congress) to [...] "not fully compliant" [...] (2000 Report to Congress). Further progress has been shown since the last report; however, many cases remain unresolved 18 months after the filing of a Hague application. The September 2000 <b>Compliance</b> <b>Report</b> listed 18 such cases; twelve of these remain open. An additional six cases have been added to this report.|$|E

The November 2007 United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) asserted that Tehran halted a nuclear weapons program in fall 2003, but that Iran [...] "at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapon". Russian analyst Alexei Arbatov, said [...] "no hard facts on violation of the NPT per se have been discovered" [...] and also wrote that [...] "all {{this is not enough}} to accuse Iran of a formal breach of the letter of the NPT" [...] and [...] "giving Iran the benefit of the doubt, there is no hard evidence of its full-steam development of a military nuclear program." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spain {{is itself}} a nation cited as a country of concern in the 2002 US State Department <b>Compliance</b> <b>Report.</b> [...] Mexico and Spain both report {{problems}} recovering internationally abducted children from each other's countries. [...] In 2009 Patricia Espinosa, the secretary of Mexican foreign relations, publicly commented that, although both Spain and Mexico had signed the Hague Convention, neither of the countries had returned an abducted child to the other country since 2006 in spite of there being nine abductions of Mexican children to Spain and 12 abductions of Spanish children to Mexico {{during the same time}} period. [...] This mutual noncompliance in honoring the Hague treaty has prompted some to say that both countries are paying each other with the same currency. [...] In 2009 two Spanish fathers made the news in Mexico and Spain for the difficulties they were having in recovering their abducted children from the grandparents of their wives who had recently died of cancer. [...] In both cases the Mexican family filed amparo appeals blocking enforcement of judicial decisions ordering the children returned home to their surviving custodial parent in Spain. [...] One father, after 13 months of litigation and being granted custody of the child in Mexico but denied the ability to leave the country till the decision became final, fled the country and returned to Spain before the legal process finished amidst objections by Mexican authorities that he had acted illegally by removing his son before Mexican courts had finished the lengthy appeal process.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the pact was to ensure that fiscal {{discipline}} would be maintained and enforced in the EMU. All EU member states are automatically members of both the EMU and the SGP, as this is defined by paragraphs in the EU Treaty itself. The fiscal discipline is ensured by the SGP by requiring each Member State, to implement a fiscal policy aiming {{for the country to}} stay within the limits on government deficit (3% of GDP) and debt (60% of GDP); and in case of having a debt level above 60% it should each year decline with a satisfactory pace towards a level below. As outlined by the [...] "preventive arm" [...] regulation, all EU member states are each year obliged to submit a SGP <b>compliance</b> <b>report</b> for the scrutiny and evaluation of the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, that will present the country's expected fiscal development for the current and subsequent three years. These reports are called [...] "stability programmes" [...] for eurozone Member States and [...] "convergence programmes" [...] for non-eurozone Member States, but despite having different titles they are identical in regards of the content. After the reform of the SGP in 2005, these programmes have also included the Medium-Term budgetary Objectives (MTO's), being individually calculated for each Member State as the medium-term sustainable average-limit for the country's structural deficit, and the Member State is also obliged to outline the measures it intends to implement to attain its MTO. If the EU Member State does not comply with both the deficit limit and the debt limit, a so-called [...] "Excessive Deficit Procedure" [...] (EDP) is initiated along with a deadline to comply, which basically includes and outlines an [...] "adjustment path towards reaching the MTO". This procedure is outlined by the [...] "dissuasive arm" [...] regulation.|$|E
