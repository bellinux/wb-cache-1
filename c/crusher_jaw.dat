40|$|Crushers {{are major}} size {{reduction}} equipment used in mechanical, metallurgical and allied industries. They are available in various sizes and capacities ranging from 0. 2 ton/hr to 50 ton/hr. They are classified based on different factors like product size and mechanism used. Based on the mechanism used crushers are of three types namely Cone <b>crusher,</b> <b>Jaw</b> crusher and Impact crusher. Our objective is to design various components of an Impact crusher like drive mechanism, shaft, rotor, hammers, casing, feed and discharge mechanism which will be useful in minimizing weight, cost and maximizing the capacity. Impact crushers: they involve the use of impact rather than pressure to crush materials. The material is contained within a cage, with openings on the bottom, end or side of the desired size to allow pulverized material to escape. This type of crusher is usually used with soft material such as coal, seeds or soft metallic ores. The mechanism applied here is of Impact loading which is applicable when the time of application of force {{is less than the}} natural frequency of vibration of the body. As because here the hammers are rotating at a very high speed, time for which the particles come in contact with the hammers is very small, so here impact loading is applied...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} simple design and easy {{maintainability}} jaw crushers {{are widely used}} as primary size reduction equipments in mechanical and mining industries. As jaw crushers break minerals & ores of high strength and the economy of many industries depends on its performance; {{it is essential to}} improve the efficiency of the present design. The kinematic analysis of single toggle jaw crusher shows that the forces on the moving jaw plate at different crank angle are different and hence power generated varies with crank angle. One way to increase the efficiency is to store the energy in a flywheel when the supply is more than the rate of consumption and to utilize the same when the supply falls down. Hence efforts are made to design a flywheel to minimize the wastage of power and to improvise the performance parameters of single toggle jaw <b>crusher.</b> <b>Jaw</b> plate wear has considerable affect on the life of jaw Crusher which is caused by the slipping motion between the fed material and the jaws. This wear is predominantly serious in the fixed plate and hence the liners of the fixed jaw should be properly chosen. In addition to this the toggle bar which acts as a safety lever has to be precisely designed. The design aspects of flywheel, spring of tension bar and toggle bar are discussed in this paper. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focussed}} on {{the work}} hardening behaviour and microstructure of austenitic manganese steel relative to premature failure of <b>crusher</b> <b>jaws.</b> Samples of sound and failed <b>crusher</b> <b>jaws</b> were taken, the change with depth from the working surface to the sample core was measured and their microstructures observed. The study revealed a sharp hardness gradient in the failed <b>crusher</b> <b>jaws,</b> and presence of large carbides at both the austenite grain boundaries and in the austenite matrix. The failure of <b>crusher</b> <b>jaws</b> was attributed to brittle fracture {{as a result of}} precipitates of carbides from the inability of precipitated carbides to absorb shock during impact working. Finally, we conclude that the failure occurred as a result of inadequate quenching operations during the manufacturing process that resulted in the formation of carbide precipitates which embrittle the austenitic manganese steel, reduce its ability to withstand shock and create a non uniform plastic flow as it is work hardening...|$|R
40|$|Crusher {{is one of}} {{the major}} size {{reduction}} equipment that is used in metallurgical, mechanical, and other similar industries. They exist in various sizes and capacities which range from 0. 1 ton/hr. to 50 ton/hr. They can be classified based on the degree to which they can fragment the starting material and the way they apply forces. Based on the mechanism used crushers are basically of three types namely Cone <b>crusher,</b> <b>Jaw</b> crusher and Impact crusher. Our objective is to design various components of an Impact crusher like drive mechanism, shaft, rotor, hammers, casing, and discharge mechanism which will be useful in minimizing weight, cost and maximizing the capacity and also do their analysis. Impact crushers involve the use of impact rather than pressure to crush materials. Here the material is held within a cage, with openings of the desired size at the bottom, end or at sides to allow crushed material to escape through them. This type of crusher is generally used with soft materials like coal, seeds or soft metallic ores. The mechanism applied here is of Impact loading where the time of application of force is less than the natural frequency of vibration of the body. Since the hammers/blow bars are rotating at a very high speed, the time for which the particles come in contact with the hammers is very small, hence here impact loading is applied. The shaft is considered to be subjected to torsion and bending. The grinding screen is also designed for optimal output from the crusher A performance model is also considered for the horizontal shaft impact crusher so as to find out the relation between the feed, the crusher parameters and the output parameters...|$|E

25|$|In {{the single}} toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on the eccentric shaft {{which leads to}} a much more compact design than that of the double toggle <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher.</b> The swing <b>jaw,</b> suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the <b>crushing</b> <b>jaws.</b> These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} and mechanical characteristics of intact rocks {{depend on the}} way of their formation, sustained deformations {{and the process of}} wearing a specific rock has been exposed to. These characteristics have a rather high influence on the technological process of extraction and dressing of mineral raw materials. However, the mechanical characteristics of rocks due to use of explosives for their extraction in the open pit have a more significant impact. The rock blocks extracted by blasting which are larger than the opening of the primary crusher are usually fragmented by hydraulic hammer. The paper presents the results of the testing of impact of rock hardness on fragmentation of rocks by means of hydraulic hammer and during <b>crushing</b> in <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher.</b> The testing was carried out on the rock samples from five quarries.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} two {{optimal control}} {{models for the}} energy management of a mining crushing process based on jaw crushers. The performance index for both models {{is defined as the}} energy cost to be minimized by accounting for the time-of-use electricity tariff. The first model is referred to as a variable load-based optimal control with the feeder speed and closed-side setting of the <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> as control variables. The second model is the optimal switching control. From the simulation results, it is demonstrated that there is a potential of reducing the energy cost and energy consumption associated with the operation of <b>jaw</b> <b>crushing</b> stations in deep mines while meeting technical and operational constraints. Due to the inefficiency of the <b>jaw</b> <b>crushing</b> machine, whose no-load power consumption is between 40 and 50 % of its rated power, the optimal switching control technique is shown to be a better candidate in reducing both energy cost and consumption of the <b>jaw</b> <b>crushing</b> station.

40|$|In this study, an {{analytical}} perspective {{is used to}} develop a fundamental model of a <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher.</b> Previously, <b>jaw</b> crushers were modelled in regard to certain aspects, for example, energy consumption (Legendre and Zevenhoven, 2014) or kinematics (Oduori et al., 2015). Approaches to date have been mainly property specific. In this work a physical modelling approach {{has been used to}} derive the modules, which are based on established facts of comminution machines, from the literature. A modelling methodology mainly inspired by Evertsson has been applied (Evertsson, 2000). The modules are divided into kinematics, flow, breakage, capacity, pressure and power. Each module has been derived and tested decoupled from the other modules to provide increased transparency of the module and its behaviour. The results of the modelling are presented for a baseline case of one industrial-scale <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> and compared to manufacturer data. Future work will include validation and DEM simulations...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} methods of comminution. Comminution of solid {{materials}} requires {{different types of}} crushers and mills depending on the feed properties such as hardness at various size ranges and application requirements such as throughput and maintenance. The most common machines for the comminution of coarse feed material are the <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> (1m > P80 > 100 mm), cone crusher (P80 > 20 mm) and hammer <b>crusher.</b> Primary <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> product in intermediate feed particle size ranges (100mm > P80 > 20mm) can be ground in Autogenous or Semi-Autogenous (AG or SAG) mills depending on feed properties and application requirements. For comminution of finer particle size ranges (20mm > P80 > 30 μm) machines like the ball mill, vertical roller mill, hammer mill, roller press or high compression roller mill, vibration mill, jet mill and others are used. For yet finer grind sizes (sometimes referred to as [...] "ultrafine grinding"), specialist mills such as the IsaMillTM are used.|$|R

Though these basibranchial and parasphenoid teeth in the two fish groups are {{on opposite sides of}} the oral cavity, it is hypothesized that they both developed as adaptations for gripping a particular category of food items, namely strong-clawed, hard-shelled, active animals that, once within the oral cavity, would try to crawl out again. A corollary to this hypothesis is that higher teleosts with extensive dentition in the central part of the oral cavity have a grasping jaw bite, which, unlike a piercing, shearing, or <b>crushing</b> <b>jaw</b> bite, does not necessarily kill the prey that is taken into the oral cavity...|$|R

2500|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Oviraptor was {{originally}} presumed to have eaten eggs, {{based on its}} association with a fossilized nest (specimen number AMNH FR 6508) thought to belong to Protoceratops. The idea of a <b>crushing</b> <b>jaw</b> was first proposed by H. F.

These bones form part of the main upper jaw bone or maxilla, which converge in the middle to form a pair of prongs. The rest of the bony palate, unlike all other dinosaurs, is extended below the jaw line and would have pushed into the space between the toothless lower jaws. A beak (rhamphotheca) covered the edges of the upper and lower jaws and probably the palate, as proposed by Barsbold and Osborn.|$|R
