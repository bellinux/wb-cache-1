40|$|A plot of pruned Ovensii in the {{foreground}} exhibiting desirable forestry characteristics Page 2 of 14 Summary: Eight different cypress cultivars were grown in a replicated trial near Caveton, South Australia. Form and growth characteristics were measured at year five and analysed. Recommendations are presented about the suitability of the various species for forestry use. Ovensii, a cypress clone hybrid between Chamaecyparis nootkatensis and Cupressus lusitanica, was the best performing cultivar in this trial and is recommended for forestry establishment ahead of the other cypress cultivars tested. Aim: Performance test six cypress clonal cultivars and two <b>cypress</b> <b>seed</b> cultivars in South Australia to identify the best cypress cultivars suitable for use in forestry applications in the region. Objective: o To import New Zealand’s best cypress (Cupressus) genetic material into Australia through the Australian Quarantine process. o To establish nursery stock of the cypress clonal cultivars and cypress species. o Establish a trial for assessment to evaluate growth and form of these trees. o Evaluate the traits of the cypress clonal cultivars and <b>cypress</b> <b>seed</b> cultivars to determine the forestry performance of the cultivars to make recommendations for South Australian conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In {{this paper}} are {{presented}} {{the results of}} an analysis of intrapopulation variability using morphometric markers of 20 Bald cypress test trees originating from seed stand S 01. 10. 01. 01 near Bačka Palanka. The morphometric characters of cones (length, width and number of grains) and seedlings (root collar diameter and height of seedling) that were produced by this seed were analyzed. A mutual biological similarity or distance of mother trees depending on the analyzed charac-ters was tested. The determined values of the dimensions of cones and seedlings indicate the good genetic and adaptive potential of this species, which can be a starting point for the mass production of Bald <b>cypress</b> <b>seed</b> and planting materials in Serbia...|$|E

50|$|Some {{seeds are}} {{produced}} every year, and good seed crops occur at three- to five-year intervals. At maturity, the cone scales with their resin-coated seeds adhering to them, or sometimes entire cones, {{drop to the}} water or ground. This drop of mature seeds is often hastened by squirrels, which eat bald <b>cypress</b> <b>seeds,</b> but usually drop several scales with undamaged seeds still attached to each cone they pick. Floodwaters spread the scales or cones along streams and {{are the most important}} means of seed dissemination.|$|R
40|$|The {{range of}} Taxodium mucronatum Ten. (Mexican bald cypress) is declining rapidly, yet {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about the propagation of this valuable ornamental tree. The objective of this study was to determine whether seed coat treatments could enhance the germination of Mexican bald <b>cypress.</b> <b>Seeds</b> of Mexican bald cypress were collected from Las Cruces and the Gila National Forest, New Mexico. In one experiment, seed coats were knicked or left intact, then germinated on moist filter paper or flooded with water. In another experiment, seed coats from the Las Cruces provenance were treated with sulfuric acid, knicked, left intact, or removed (excised embryos) and germinated on moist filter paper. Knicked and moist seeds had a greater mean cumulative germination percentage (13. 5 %) than intact and flooded seeds (4. 2 %). Final germination percentage of the Las Cruces source was similar among knicked seeds, intact seeds, and excised embryos, but intact seeds took a longer time (15 days) to reach 50 % of final germination percentage than did excised embryos (10 days) and knicked seeds (8 days). Seeds treated with sulfuric did not germinate. Results indicate seed coat pretreatments are needed to release physical dormancy and promote efficient germination of Mexican bald cypress...|$|R
50|$|During the Continuation War, {{the garden}} was hit by three bombs and the {{greenhouses}} were damaged. As a result, all {{of the more than}} 1,500 taxons in the greenhouses, {{with the exception of a}} single <b>cypress</b> and the <b>seeds</b> of a water-lily, died due to freezing temperatures. The seeds survived at the bottom of the water-lily pool and the current water-lily in the pool is the descendant of that water-lily.|$|R
40|$|Enquiries {{are often}} {{made on the}} availability, {{background}} and dates of introduction to this country of the various clones of the intergeneric hybrid x Cupressocyparis leylandii or Leyland cypress. In view of the current interest in cypresses for farm and specialist timber uses (e. g. Haslett et al., 1985), this note sets out the available information. The evidence for the earlier introductions (up to 1963) has been obtained through corre-spondence and file notes, the early import permits having been destroyed (N. Lund, pers. comm., 1989). All the major clones (Haggerston 1 to 6; Leighton Hall 10 and 11; Stapehill 20 and 21) are now in this country with the sole exception of clone 5. Table 1 chronicles their introduction. Haggerston Clones The Haggerston clones, which include the named cultivars 'Green Spire ' and 'Haggerston Grey', arose from a single sowing of Nootka <b>cypress</b> <b>seed</b> at Leighton Hall, Wales, in 1888. Shortly after, the six, atypical seedlings were transferred to Haggerston Castle, Northumberland where they still exist as tall trees...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiscale}} {{model is}} presented to simulate the impact of hydrologic changes on the regeneration of a cypress swamp in southern Illinois. This model, SISM (Southern Illinois Swamp Model), captures three processes that operate at different spatial and temporal scales: <b>cypress</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal and germination, seedling growth and mortality, and the succession of saplings and mature trees. In SISM, the life history of cypress is represented in a coherent manner, spatio-temporal scales are related to different life phases, processes are consistently integrated, and the interactions amongst the multiple processes are effectively simulated. Three scenarios reflecting water management alternatives were tested and discussed. The results show that (1) the modeling output under current water variability is comparable with various field studies, (2) a stable hydrologic scenario restricts the spatial distribution of cypress, and (3) a more variable hydrologic regime does not necessarily result in a wide regeneration of cypress.

40|$|Including urban composts in nursery {{growing media}} could reduce peat use and promote new markets for these products. The {{objective}} of this work was to {{study the effects of}} compost incorporation in forestry nursery growing media. Growing media were prepared mixing composts (0 - 75 % in volume) from biosolids, municipal solid waste and pruning waste with peat. As control treatment, a peat-based substrate was employed. Hydrophysical and chemical properties of growing media were determined. Moreover the effects of these growing media on rosemary and cypress plant growth (height, stem diameter, nutrient contents) in propagation and production trials were monitored. Hydrophysical properties of compost based growing media were adequate up to 50 % compost. The Carbon/Nitrogen ratio of composts (10. 7 - 12. 4) was indicative of compost maturity. Compost EC values frequently surpasses those of standard peat substrates, therefore substrate salinity limited the maximum percentage of compost in substrates. In the case of cutting propagation, rosemary growth was increased to 50 % compost (EC 1. 1 - 1. 3 dS m- 1). <b>Cypress</b> <b>seed</b> germination was not affected until 75 % compost (EC 1. 4 - 1. 9 dS m- 1) and its growth was increased in all compost growing media. Plant growth increased was related to the fertilizing effect of compost. Although composts content of Ni, Zn, and Pb were greater than those of standard peat substrates, only concentration of Zn was greater in compost-media cultivated plants. As a general rule, forestry nursery growing media could incorporate up to 50 % composts from biosolids, municipal solid waste and pruning wastes mixed with peat.

30|$|Current {{understanding}} of historic fire regimes in McNab cypress populations are {{based largely on}} assumptions about the species’ life-history traits. Like all cypress species within the CFP (except San Pedro Matir cypress (H. montana [Wiggins] Battel), McNab <b>cypress</b> retains <b>seeds</b> within persistent closed cones {{for a year or}} more following seed maturation, a trait typically referred to as serotiny. McMaster and Zedler (1981) proposed that serotiny is most strongly favored under a regime of large, spatially uniform, stand-replacing (i.e., very high severity, sensu Romme [1980]) crown fires occurring at intervals longer than the mean juvenile period and shorter than the mean potential life-span of the species. For serotinous species incapable resprouting, these fires are expected to cause complete mortality in the parent generation, induce seed release from storage structures, and produce even-aged stands characterized by unimodal age distributions (Lamont et al. 1991, Veblen 1992).|$|R
