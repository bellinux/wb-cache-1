5000|$|This [...] {{engine was}} {{a version of}} the 3.3 but with a larger bore of 96 mm and the {{important}} addition of overhead cams. The 3.5L version has an intake arrangement with two separate manifolds and throttle bodies connected with a <b>crossover</b> <b>valve.</b> This provides better low and midrange torque. The four valves per cylinder are driven by a single overhead camshaft as opposed to the conventional DOHC arrangement for multivalve engines. Another difference with the 3.5 as opposed to the 3.3 is that it has a timing belt, not a timing chain. The water pump is also driven by the timing belt on the 3.5, whereas on the 3.3, the accessory belt drives it.|$|E
50|$|No {{external}} power is needed: the lift lock functions by gravity alone using the counterweight principle. One caisson always ascends {{and the other}} always descends during each locking cycle. When one caisson reaches the top position, it stops 12 in below the water level of the upper reach, and the control valve is closed; Siemens ultrasonic sensors are used to help determine the differential. The upper reach and top caisson gates open, and water flows into the top caisson until the level equalizes. The weight of the extra foot of water is 144 ST, making the total weight of the upper caisson 1844 ST. Any vessels that just ascended in the top caisson exit into the upper reach, and any new vessels making a transit of the lock then enter the bottom or top caisson from the lower or upper reach respectively. Once the vessels are secured, all gates are closed and the <b>crossover</b> <b>valve</b> in the connecting pipe between the ram shafts is opened. Since the upper caisson weighs more than the lower caisson (1,844 vs 1,700 tons), it pushes down on its ram, forcing out water from its shaft via the connecting pipe into the shaft of the bottom caisson. The force pushes up on the bottom caisson's ram, raising the caisson {{up to the top}} position. When the gate of the newly descended top caisson and lower reach gates open at the bottom, the extra foot of water flows out and equalizes with the water level in the lower reach of the canal, and any descended vessels exit, allowing the cycle to start over again.|$|E
5000|$|Each caisson {{sits on a}} ram, {{the shafts}} for which are sunk into the ground, are filled with water, and are {{connected}} with a pipe that has a <b>crossover</b> control <b>valve.</b> The caissons are guided {{up and down on}} either side by rails affixed to concrete towers.|$|R
5000|$|Technological advancements {{within the}} {{industry}} allow for incorporating timers to limit the operations during specific {{hours of the day}} to reduce energy waste by only operating when occupants are likely to use hot water. Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain hot water temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy. Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of hot water line siphoning in open-loop hot water circulation systems which utilize the cold water line to return water back to the water heater. Hot Water Line Siphoning occurs when water from within the hot water line siphons or is forced into the cold water line due to differences in water pressure between the hot and cold water lines. Utilizing [...] "normally closed" [...] solenoid valve significantly reduces energy consumption by preventing siphoning of non-hot water out of hot water lines during cold water use. Using cold water instantly lowers the water pressure in the cold water lines, the higher water pressure in the hot water lines force water through [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic <b>crossover</b> <b>valves</b> and backflow check valves (which only prevent cold water from flowing into hot water line), increasing the energy demand on the water heater.|$|R
40|$|Intermittently-operated {{water systems}} {{struggle}} to equitably and effectively distribute clean water to customers. One common customer response to intermittency is {{to supplement the}} water system's pressure by using a household, or residential, booster pump. When such booster pumps are directly connected to the water utility's supply pipe, without an underground isolation tank (sump), they often induce negative pressure in the supply pipe which increases the flow rate. Unfortunately, where leakage rates are high, this negative pressure also {{increases the risk of}} contaminant intrusion. This thesis presents the iterative design and field testing of a patent-pending, full-bore, back-pressure regulating valve. The valve's simple mechanism relies on a stabilized collapsing tube, or 'Starling Resistor,'which when installed at a customer's connection, controls the flow rate and prevents booster pumps from creating negative pressure in the supply pipe. In collaboration with the Delhi Jal Board and several private partners, the valve's performance was verified in two rounds of field trials in neighborhoods of New Delhi, India including Pitampura, Azad Market, Vivek Vihar, Malvia Nagar, and Vasant Vihar. Using a <b>crossover</b> study, the <b>valve</b> was found to reduce the total contamination risk across all 19 tested houses during supply times by a median of 80 %. The valve prevented 96 % of pressure below - 1 meter and an average of 53 minutes per day, per connection of total negative pressure. In an estimated worst-case scenario for contaminant intrusion, the presence of the valve reduced the contamination risk by two orders of magnitude at six customer connections - enough to correspond to significant reductions in health risks. by David Donald James Taylor.
