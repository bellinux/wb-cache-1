40|$|Number of lateral {{branches}} and overall development of seedlings {{is a crucial}} parameter for achieving the required quality standards dedicated to modern intensive production systems. Branched seedlings have formed {{the structure of the}} canopy, which is defined and cultivation model for future plantations. In addition to the uniformity of the plantation better and earlier productivity is achieved. The research, in order to standardize the techniques for induction of lateral branching, was conducted in 2013 in the nursery (Koprivna, Eastern Croatia) on 3 cherry cultivars grafted on Gisela 6 rootstock. The treatments included the application of different combinations of Bioregulators 6 -Benzyladenine and gibberellic acid 4 and 7 (BA+GA 4 + 7) as well as <b>cyclanilide</b> on cultivars ´Carmen´, ´Grace Star´ and ´Black Star´. All applied treatments resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of new branches compared to the control. Cultivar Black Star induced the development of the highest number of branches. Treatment BA + GA 4 + 7 increased the number of lateral shoots compared to the control in all the investigated cultivars. The most significant induction in the number of branches has been achieved with <b>Cyclanilide</b> treatment which improved more correct distribution and resulted in a more uniform length of induced shoots. Combination of the treatment <b>cyclanilide</b> and BA + GA 4 + 7 has not resulted in synergistic increase in the number of branches in response to treatment with <b>cyclanilide.</b> The applied treatments also significantly influenced the length of the {{branches and}} the branching angle. Results of this study indicate the need for further testing of <b>cyclanilide</b> as a potential regulator of growth in nursery production...|$|E
