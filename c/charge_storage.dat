25|$|MnO2 and RuO2 {{are typical}} {{materials}} used as electrodes for pseudocapacitors, {{since they have}} the electrochemical signature of a capacitive electrode (linear dependence on current versus voltage curve) as well as exhibiting faradaic behavior. Additionally, the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> originates from electron-transfer mechanisms rather than accumulation of ions in the electrochemical double layer. Pseudocapacitors were created through faradaic redox reactions that occur within the active electrode materials. More research was focused on transition-metal oxides such as MnO2 since transition-metal oxides haves a lower cost compared to noble metal oxides such as RuO2. Moreover, the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> mechanisms of transition-metal oxides are based predominantly on pseudocapacitance. Two mechanisms of MnO2 <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> behavior were introduced. The first mechanism implies the intercalation of protons (H+) or alkali metal cations (C+) in {{the bulk of the}} material upon reduction followed by deintercalation upon oxidation.|$|E

2500|$|Daniel Gralath was {{the first}} to combine several jars in {{parallel}} to increase the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity. Benjamin Franklin investigated the Leyden jar and {{came to the conclusion that}} the charge was stored on the glass, not in the water as others had assumed. He also adopted the term [...] "battery", (denoting the increasing of power with a row of similar units as in a battery of cannon), subsequently applied to clusters of electrochemical cells. Leyden jars were later made by coating the inside and outside of jars with metal foil, leaving a space at the mouth to prevent arcing between the foils. The earliest unit of capacitance was the jar, equivalent to about 1.11 nanofarads.|$|E

Dubbed the Iconoscope by Zworykin, the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75,000 lux, and thus was {{claimed to be}} much more sensitive than Farnsworth's image dissector. However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique [...] "multipactor" [...] device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931. This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. A problem with the multipactor, unfortunately, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.|$|E

2500|$|In 1926, Hungarian {{engineer}} Kálmán Tihanyi {{designed a}} television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements and employing {{the principle of}} [...] "charge storage" [...] within the scanning (or [...] "camera") tube. The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or [...] "camera" [...] tubes would be solved {{with the introduction of}} charge-storage technology by Kálmán Tihanyi beginning in 1924. His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges ("photoelectrons") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed [...] "Radioskop". After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application, Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930, and so he applied for patents in the United States. Although his breakthrough would be incorporated into the design of RCA's [...] "iconoscope" [...] in 1931, the U.S. patent for Tihanyi's transmitting tube would not be granted until May 1939. The patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous October. Both patents had been purchased by RCA prior to their approval. <b>Charge</b> <b>storage</b> remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Navy {{equipped}} the Tribal {{class with}} a comparatively heavy anti-aircraft armament; all eight 4.7in guns could engage aircraft with predicted fire using the FKC computer, and thus provide a powerful augmentation to the battle-fleet's AA defence. The close range AA armament of a quad 2pdr and two quad Vickers machine guns was a marked advance over previous destroyer classes and heavier than most other nations' close range destroyer armament in 1939. However, prewar, the Royal Navy assumed that destroyers would be acting mainly as escorts for the battle-fleet, {{and would not be}} the primary focus of aerial attack. Events soon showed that destroyers often functioned independently and so became the main target of Luftwaffe attack, especially by dive bombers. After the loss of Afridi and Gurkha, the remaining ships were taken in hand to improve the situation. Each ship's 'X' turret, which held a [...] mounting, was removed and replaced by a twin [...] gun QF Mark XVI on the mounting HA/LA Mark XIX. The mainmast was cut down and the rear funnel was lowered to improve the arcs of fire for the anti-aircraft weapons. As they became available, the more effective 20 mm Oerlikon guns were added, at first adding to and eventually replacing the [...]50 in./12.7 mm machine guns. Depth <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> was also increased, from 30 to 46 charges. Furthermore, the class initially had problems with leaks in feedwater tanks; this was traced to issues with the turbine blades caused by structural stress when steaming at high speed in rough weather.|$|E
