5000|$|The scribe of Ms. 3686 {{was likely}} a mapmaker (based {{on the quality}} of the {{freehand}} drawings and the obvious spelling errors indicative of someone who did not thoroughly understand Latin). The scribe likely drew from other classical and contemporary <b>cartographic</b> <b>references,</b> such as the writings of Pliny and another Ptolemaic codex written by Andrea Bianco in 1436. Scholars of Ptolemy’s work in Florence were humanists; neither scholars in Genoa nor Naples used the same cartographic systems displayed in the codex. These facts and the close parallels to Venetian Andrea Bianco’s work determine this unknown cartographer was also from Venice. The unknown Italian cartographer that created the Ms. 3686 codex did add some improvements to his maps beyond making an exact replica of the copy from which he drew. This practice follows the broad rediscovery in Europe of classical knowledge and its use as the foundation of contemporary study. The cartographer cross-referenced Ancient Latin place names for areas around the Mediterranean and Western Europe with contemporary equivalents. The author also provided place names to areas unknown in Ptolemy’s era (such as areas around the Caspian Sea in Central Asia). Because of the author’s apparent cartographic training, he redrew some of the maps to better conform to contemporary map-making practices. This codex improves on Ptolemy’s equi-rectangular and orthographic projections but was written before the publication of the new Mercator projection; re-creating and improving Ptolemy’s regional maps without attempting to create a world map.

40|$|The quality {{assessment}} of thematic maps is no new problem in cartography, but remains a relevant topic. The main task of a thematic map is to communicate spatial {{information to a}} map user. The effectiveness {{to what extent the}} information transfer occurs is called the communicative map quality.

40|$|Changes in {{land cover}} at a {{regional}} {{scale and the}} assessment of the risk of soil degradation at the scale of the basin require not only information on the physical structure of soil but also appropriate tools to evaluate these changes. In order to identify the areas subject to a high risk of degradation in a region of Northern Africa, a geomatics approach integrating the following variables was considered: state of soil degradation, slope length, aspect, presence of vegetation and the erosive potential of overland flow. In order to map the state of soil degradation, the Hue and the Coloration indices were calculated from remotely sensed imagery. The complimentary nature of these two spectral indices allows the identification of the different levels of soil degradation. A vegetation index, MSAVI(2), was used to obtain a map of vegetation. Geomorphometric data (aspect, slope length, stream power index), were derived from a DEM generated in a GIS from a topographic map at a 1 : 50 000 scale. These data were integrated in a GIS by means of a multicriterion model. Multicriterion evaluations were then performed to identify and map areas of potential degradation. Model results were then compared with a <b>cartographic</b> document (<b>reference</b> map) using the Kappa coefficient. Comparisons between modeled potential degradation and the reference map showed overall low levels of agreement. Subsequently, a visual comparison using photographs of the study area was also performed as a way to further evaluate the results of the proposed method. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{automobile}} sector, especially {{in these last}} decade, {{a growing number of}} investigations have taken into account electronic systems to check and correct the behaviour of drivers, increasing road safety. The possibility to identify with high accuracy the vehicle position in a <b>cartographic</b> <b>reference</b> frame for driving directions and best-route analysis is also another topic which attracts lot of interest from the research and development sector. To reach the objective of accurate vehicle positioning and integrate response events, it is necessary to estimate for each time instant the position, orientation and velocity of the system. For this low cost GPS and MEMS sensors can be used. Comparing the dynamics of a four wheel vehicle to the dynamics of a two wheel vehicle, the latter has a higher degree of complexity, The degrees of freedom are more numerous, since the scooter can twist sideways and thus have a roll angle. Also a slight pitch angle which has to be considered because the wheel suspensions have a higher degree of movement in respect to four wheel vehicles. In this paper an accurate real-time reconstruction of the dynamics of “Vespa” scooter is presented. A Bayesian filter provides the means for integrating the data from MEMS.

40|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} and successfully tested for monitoring of the wet snow cover with ERS- 1 / 2 SAR data during {{the length of the}} accumulation and melting season in various watersheds of the Swiss Alps. Based on this experience, the possibilities of snow cover mapping over large mountainous areas- e. g. almost the entire Swiss Alps and Prealps- using RADARSAT ScanSAR, and NOAA-AVHRR for comparison, are now evaluated. Pre-processing includes a careful geocoding of the SAR data on to the Swiss National <b>Cartographic</b> <b>Reference</b> System, applying geometric and radiometric corrections using a DEM and auxiliary data for image simulation and calibration. A change detection approach is employed to compare the two SAR-scenes. It is expected that the most important differences will result from vast changes in the snow cover. Since large parts of the Swiss Plateau were also snow covered in the winter scene, other changes in land cover are expected to have only minor influence. Hence, {{it will be possible to}} assess the total snow cover by combining the information gained from the SAR ratios with the relief information from the DEM. The NOAA-AVHRR images are classified independently by generating snow masks using a threshold-based method. The two resulting snow classifications are compared with each other, and with ground-based meteorological observations. A verification using a finer temporal resolution is desirable. The successful application of RADARSAT ScanSAR to snow mapping over large highly mountainous terrain will be of great significance, especially when clouds hamper the use of electrooptical satellite data. It will therefore be of great value to future snow hydrological applications, considerably widening the availability of remote sensing tools...|$|E

The agreement was focused, between 2010 and 2012, on a “Program of integrated actions of research and training for preservation and valuing of the archeological site of Ostia and Portus”. The result of research consisted in experimentation of a digital system able to manage data coming from bibliographic studies, from reading of cartographic maps and analysis in the field, inside a deputy folder in electronic format, that can be implemented as needed, well structured but also enough flexible to allow transferring of information in data shape to be managed by more diffused software, such as GIS or “open source”. This work program put attention in identification and characterization of analysis subject and {{in the definition of}} an appropriate digital language useful for their archiving. Vectorialization of information has been done to create a kind of language that could express both quantitative and qualitative data, thematic and <b>cartographic.</b> A <b>reference</b> glossary has been prepared to be useful for vectorial and standardized data-gathering. Vectorialization consists in data storing inside a spatial coordinates system that ensure quantification and localization. Data, organized in big groups and sub-cathegories, give information that can be distinguished and superimposed, referring to a cartographical base. The scenario of the considered themes rise from historical and cartographical analysis carried out on territorial, urban and building scale. The set of information, converted to graphical vectorial data, is complete of scientific synthesis and contains the ideal reconstruction of both whole town and single building across several historical phases. The vectorial data are associated to an archive of raster-format documents (historical, bibliographical and site survey documents), and to a repository of digital material (laser scanner survey). Vectorial data refer to an open and compiling glossary that can be implemented as needed too, referring to: Antonio Pugliano, Elementi di un costituendo Thesaurus utile alla conoscenza, alla tutela, alla conservazione dell’architettura, Prospettive edizioni, 2009.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} and recognized that radar interferometry is a promising method for the determination of digital elevation information and terrain slope from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. An important application of Interferometric SAR (InSAR) data in areas with topographic variations is that the derived elevation and slope can be directly used for the absolute radiometric calibration of the amplitude SAR data {{as well as for}} scattering mechanisms analysis. On the other hand polarimetric SAR data has long been recognized as permitting a more complete inference of natural surfaces than a single channel radar system. In fact, imaging polarimetry provides the measurement of the amplitude and relative phase of all transmit and receive polarizations. On board the NASA DC- 8 aircraft, NASA/JPL operates the multifrequency (P, L and C bands) multipolarimetric radar AIRSAR. The TOPSAR, a special mode of the AIRSAR system, is able to collect single-pass interferometric C- and/or L-band VV polarized data. A possible configuration of the AIRSAR/TOPSAR system is to acquire single-pass interferometric data at C-band VV polarization and polarimetric radar data at the two other lower frequencies. The advantage of this system configuration is to get digital topography information {{at the same time the}} radar data is collected. The digital elevation information can therefore be used to correctly calibrate the SAR data. This step is directly included in the new AIRSAR Integrated Processor. This processor uses a modification of the full motion compensation algorithm described by Madsen et al. (1993). However, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with the additional products such as local incidence angle map, and the SAR data are in a geometry which is not convenient, since especially DEMs must be referred to a specific <b>cartographic</b> <b>reference</b> system. Furthermore, geocoding of SAR data is important for multisensor and/or multitemporal purposes. In this paper, a procedure to geocode the new AIRSAR/TOPSAR data is presented. As an example an AIRSAR/TOPSAR image acquired in 1994 is geocoded and evaluated in terms of geometric accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The Chacas Valley Project (Dep. of Ancash, Peru), {{coordinated by}} Prof. Laurencich Minelli of University of Bologna, is a {{partnership}} between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the over mentioned University and the Municipality of Chacas. The aim of such project is to carry out an archaeological and anthropological survey on pre-Columbian cultures of the valley. The collected data will be the base for planning some trekking route between the archaeological sites. In lack of sufficiently detailed maps, it has been necessary to define a <b>cartographic</b> <b>reference</b> system {{to cover all the}} investigated area. The knowledge of a detailed topographical surface is also crucial to build up an architectural model of the pre-Columbian urbanized areas. Consequently, the definition of this surface is necessary to locate the architectonic structures and to define their destination of use, and also to investigate the relationship between the architecture and the morphology of the landscape, a very important element in the urbanization system of pre-Columbian civilizations. Such information will be obviously of primary importance in order to define some tourist trekking paths between the archaeological zones. This paper introduce the topographic survey carried out in two archaeological expeditions (1998 and 2000) on the fortified Recuay citadels (II-VI sec. a. d.) Huacramarca and Riway. During the first expedition a traditional methodology has been applied while in the second one a relative kinematic satellite GPS (Global Positioning System) methodology was employed. The high productivity of the gps methodology allows to acquire many information in short time, also working in difficult situations (the over mentioned citadels are located at 4000 mt above m. s. l. In a very distant position from the nearest villages). Through gps survey was possible to perform {{at the same time a}} survey to define the position of archaeological structures and the morphology of the landscape. This methodology, which allows the space referencing of all the objects and the integrated analysis of the information, is a very powerful tool for the interpretation of the sites. The recollected data could constitute the first step towards the realization of a gis for the cultural heritage valorization of this area, and offer a research opportunity for archaeologist to gather geo-morphological information together with all the other data available from different source of observation...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{presented}} research project is to investigate how present-day EO-technology can support local and regional decision-making, particularly in Belgium, and to develop prototype versions of value-added products that fulfil some of the actual information needs, as expressed by Belgian authorities at the local and at the regional level. To accomplish this goal the proposal addresses both technical and user-oriented issues, and builds {{on the experience of}} five research teams, each with its own background and particular know-how. The most important objectives of the project are: - to define optimal methods for improved spatial information extraction from high- and very-high resolution data, based on innovative processing techniques; - to identify useful EO-applications at the level of local and regional decision making that are made possible by applying the information extraction methods that will be developed; in this case especially 3 D information - to define and develop value-added core data products that will support these applications, and that can be consulted with easy-to-use, widely available IT-tools (CD-ROM, Internet, …). One of the technical research modules is focussing on the geometrical aspects of VHR data processing. In terms of spatial resolution, VHR data have the required level of detail to resolve individual objects in the landscape, in a similar way as airborne data. As such, they have the potential of becoming a useful data source for the extraction of detailed, object-related information, and for the production of large-scale <b>cartographic</b> <b>reference</b> data. The geometry of VHR sensor data, however, completely differs from the geometry of aerial photographs (Bethel et al., 2001). Research is going on to evaluate the geometric qualities of present and future VHR standard data products, from the moment they become available, and to examine what level of geometric accuracy is attained with these data, depending on image parameters, processing strategies, and terrain characteristics (Zhou and Li, 2000). The main objectives of the research module on geometric aspects of VHR data processing are: a) to define an optimal procedure for the derivation of envelope DSMs (Digital Surface Models) and ortho-photoplans from VHR data; b) to develop a theoretical model to study the effect of the oblique viewing angle of VHR data on image displacements caused by building height and relief; c) to evaluate the geometric accuracy of satellite-derived envelope DSMs and ortho-corrected image data in comparison with similar products obtained by means of large-scale aerial photography. The module about geometrical aspects is divided into six specific tasks. a) GPS database creation b) Creation of reference envelope DSMs based on aerial photography c) Ortho-rectification of VHR images and aerial photography based on reference DSMs d) Evaluation of the quality of VHR geo-referenced data e) Modelling of displacements caused by terrain morphology and sensor viewing angle f) Development of envelope DEMs from VHR stereoscopic imagery The project is now in the stage where the quality of the georeferenced and orthorectified data is evaluated...|$|E
