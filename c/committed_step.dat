5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called <b>committed</b> <b>step),</b> thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E

The second step of the process, producing the actual creatine molecule, occurs solely in the cytosol, where the second enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine:guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), is found. The creatine is then transported through the bloodstream and taken up through sodium-dependent creatine transporters by cells that require creatine.|$|E
25|$|In non-photosynthetic eukaryotes such as animals, insects, fungi, and protozoa, {{as well as}} the α-proteobacteria {{group of}} bacteria, the <b>committed</b> <b>step</b> for {{porphyrin}} biosynthesis is the formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA, 5-ALA or dALA) by the reaction of the amino acid glycine with succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle. In plants, algae, bacteria (except for the α-proteobacteria group) and archaea, it is produced from glutamic acid via glutamyl-tRNA and glutamate-1-semialdehyde. The enzymes involved in this pathway are glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamyl-tRNA reductase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase. This pathway is known as the C5 or Beale pathway.|$|E

25|$|As PEPCK acts at the {{junction}} between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, it causes decarboxylation of a C4 molecule, creating a C3 molecule. As the first <b>committed</b> <b>step</b> in gluconeogenesis, PEPCK decarboxylates and phosphorylates oxaloacetate (OAA) for its conversion to PEP, when GTP is present. As a phosphate is transferred, the reaction results in a GDP molecule. When pyruvate kinase - the enzyme that normally catalyzes the reaction that converts PEP to pyruvate - is knocked out in mutants of Bacillus subtilis, PEPCK participates {{in one of the}} replacement anaplerotic reactions, working in the reverse direction of its normal function, converting PEP to OAA. Although this reaction is possible, the kinetics are so unfavorable that the mutants grow at a very slow pace or do not grow at all.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyruvate}} {{produced by}} glycolysis {{is an important}} intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol. This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate) {{is removed from the}} citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate can be used for gluconeogenesis (in the liver), or it can be returned into mitochondrion as malate. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl CoA carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first <b>committed</b> <b>step</b> in the synthesis of fatty acids.|$|E

The mechanism by which the AGAT catalyzes this <b>committed</b> <b>step</b> follows a ping-pong mechanism, and involves the transferring of an amidino group to the Cys407 residue on the protein from L-arginine, which leaves as L-ornithine. [...] The His303 residue then extracts a proton from glycine, which then picks up the amidino group from Cys407 {{in exchange for a}} proton to become guanidinoacetate and renew the catalyst.|$|E

We {{suggest that the}} carotenoid pigments are synthesized mainly via the desaturation of squalene rather than the direct synthesis of dehydrosqualene through the non-reductive condensation of prenyl diphosphate precursors, indicating the possible existence of a “squalene route” and a “lycopersene route” for C 30 and C 40 carotenoids, respectively. Additionally, this finding yields a new method of colorimetric screening for the cellular activity of squalene synthases, which are major targets for cholesterol-lowering drugs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM) is an {{autosomal}} recessive, quadriceps sparing type {{commonly referred}} to as HIBM but also termed h-IBM or Inclusion Body Myopathy 2 (IBM 2). The clinical manifestations begin with muscle weakness progressing over the next 10 - 20 years uniquely sparing the quadriceps until the most advanced stage of the disease. Histopathology of an HIBM muscle biopsy shows rimmed vacuoles on Gomori's trichrome stain, small fibers in groups and tubulofilaments without evidence of inflammation. In affected individuals distinct mutations have been identified in the gene, which encodes the bifunctional enzyme uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) 2 -epimerase/N-acetyl-mannosamine (ManNAc) kinase (GNE/MNK).

40|$|Recent {{proposals}} for determinism-enforcement architectures {{are able to}} honor the dependences between threads through a <b>commit</b> <b>step</b> that often becomes a performance bottleneck. As they commit code blocks (or chunks) in a round-robin order, if one chunk gets squashed due to a conflict, its successors also observe a stall. We call this effect transitive squash delay. This paper proposes a novel, high-performance approach to deterministic execution based on Conflict-Aware commit. Rather than committing chunks in strict round-robin order, {{the idea is to}} skip those chunks with conflicts and deterministically execute them slightly later. The scheme, called BulkCompactor, largely eliminates transitive squash delay, “compacts ” the chunk commits, and substantially speeds-up execution. With BulkCompactor, the squash overhead is O(N) rather than O(N 2) as in round-robin. We describe BulkCompactor designs for machines with centralized or distributed commit. Finally, a simulation-based evaluation shows that BulkCompactor delivers performance comparable to nondeterministic systems. For example, for 32 processors, BulkCompactor incurs an average execution overhead of 22 % over a nondeterministic system. The round-robin scheme’s average overhead is 133 %. 1...|$|R
