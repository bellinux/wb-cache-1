40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study lexical {{semantic}} memory {{in patients with}} amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal controls. METHOD: Fifteen mild AD, 15 aMCI, and 15 normal control subjects were included. Diagnosis of AD was based on DSM-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and that of aMCI, on the criteria of the International Working Group on Mild Cognitive Impairment, using CDR 0. 5 for aMCI and CDR 1 for mild AD. All subjects underwent {{semantic memory}} tests (Boston Naming-BNT, CAMCOG Similarities item), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), neuropsychological tests (<b>counterproofs),</b> and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Data analysis used Mann-Whitney test for intergroup comparisons and Pearson's coefficient for correlations between memory tests and <b>counterproofs</b> (statistical significance level was p< 0. 05). RESULTS: aMCI patients were similar to controls on BNT and Similarities, but worse on MMSE and RAVLT. Mild AD patients scored significantly worse than aMCI and controls on all tests. CONCLUSION: aMCI impairs episodic memory but tends to spare lexical semantic system, which can be affected in the early phase of AD...|$|R

40|$|Side-channel {{attacks are}} severe type of attack against {{implementation}} of cryptographic primitives. Leakage-resilient cryptography {{is a new}} theoretical approach to formally {{address the problem of}} side-channel attacks. Recently, the Continuous After-the-Fact Leakage (CAFL) security model has been introduced for two-party authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols. In the CAFL model, an adversary can adaptively request arbitrary leakage of long-term secrets even after the test session is activated. It supports continuous leakage even when the adversary learns certain ephemeral secrets or session keys. The amount of leakage is limited per query, but there is no bound on the total leakage. A generic leakage-resilient key exchange protocol pi has also been introduced that is formally proved to be secure in the CAFL model. In this paper, we comment on the CAFL model, and show that it does not capture its claimed security. Furthermore, we present an attack and <b>counterproofs</b> for the security of protocol pi which invalidates the formal security proofs of protocol pi in the CAFL model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{analytical}} scanning {{electron microscope}} (SEM) {{has been used to}} deter-mine the presence and distribution of atomic elements in mineralogy. How-ever, the detection of light elements such as carbon is difficult to obtain with standard energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and usual pro-ceedings for SEM. This study proposes a new protocol to detect calcium carbonate by SEM/EDS using sediments from the Jaguaribe River estuary, NE Brazil, as a model. Handmade gold mounting discs (Au stubs) were used as sample support and samples were adhered with inexpensive glue (Loctite Super_Bonder) or directly disposed on the Au stubs. CaCO 3 and NaCl for chemical analysis were used as control and <b>counterproof</b> to the carbon adhesive tape. Control salts EDS analyses indicate that the method was efficient to detect light elements. Sediments obtained from dif-ferent depths in the core sampled at the Jaguaribe River estuary consist of particles and aggregates with diverse morphology that covers a wide range of particle or aggregate size.

40|$|In ancient Greek epic {{tradition}} {{we can see}} strange rhythmic clusters, {{consisting of}} blocks of 4 - 5 verses that share a long syllable at the same position (although the epic verse usually tends to variation). Some of these series interact with the same speech-type, others seem {{to participate in the}} construction of repetition-figures. The older the text, the more frequent these clusters are, occurring less in narrative and more in catalogues. How are we to interpret the fact that almost all epic oaths are linked to such clusters, except some of them that are actually lies? The first solution would be expressiveness, but <b>counterproofs</b> with the discourse of prayer or threatening speeches are less conclusive. This book offers another, rather pragmatic, solution for explaining the phenomenon of rhythmic clusters in Greek epic: oath, prayer, order, but also irony have in common that the locuteur/narrator I/ poet’s voice is speaking behind narrator II or the characters. Singing an epic song is a stressful multitasking job where the metrical engine and telling the story have to be well in tune. When the voice of locuteur is added to all this, the singer seems to put the metrics on auto-pilot and starts to use metrical clusters, in order to manage both to continue the narration and to address the audience from behind his narrator’s mask...|$|R

40|$|TNF-related {{apoptosis}} inducing ligand (TRAIL), {{a member}} of the TNF superfamily released by microglia, appears {{to be involved in the}} induction of apoptosis following focal brain ischemia. Indeed, brain ischemia is associated with progressive enlargement of damaged areas and prominent inflammation. As ischemic preconditioning reduces inflammatory response to brain ischemia and ameliorates brain damage, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the role of TRAIL and its receptors in stroke and ischemic preconditioning and to propose, by modulating TRAIL pathway, a new therapeutic strategy in stroke. In order to achieve this aim a rat model of harmful focal ischemia, obtained by subjecting animals to 100 [*]min of transient occlusion of middle cerebral artery followed by 24 [*]h of reperfusion and a rat model of ischemic preconditioning in which the harmful ischemia was preceded by 30 [*]mins of tMCAO, which represents the preconditioning protective stimulus, were used. Results show that the neuroprotection elicited by ischemic preconditioning occurs through both upregulation of TRAIL decoy receptors and downregulation of TRAIL itself and of its death receptors. As a <b>counterproof,</b> immunoneutralization of TRAIL in tMCAO animals resulted in significant restraint of tissue damage and in a marked functional recovery. Our data shed new light on the mechanisms that propagate ongoing neuronal damage after ischemia in the adult mammalian brain and provide new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Strategies aimed to repress the death-inducing ligands TRAIL, to antagonize the death receptors, or to activate the decoy receptors open new perspectives for the treatment of stroke...|$|E

Physiol Genomics 37 : 225 - 230, 2009. First published March 3, 2009; doi: 10. 1152 /physiolgenomics. 90288. 2008. -We tested the hypothesis that small changes in angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) expression can alter the vascular response to injury. Male mice containing one, two, three, and four copies of the Ace gene with no detectable vascular abnormality or changes in blood pressure were submitted to cuff-induced femoral artery injury. Femoral thickening was higher in 3 - and 4 -copy mice (42. 4 +/- 4. 3 % and 45. 7 +/- 6. 5 %, respectively) compared with 1 - and 2 -copy mice (8. 3 +/- 1. 3 % and 8. 5 +/- 0. 9 %, respectively). Femoral ACE levels from control and injured vessels were assessed in 1 - and 3 -copy Ace mice, which represent the extremes of the observed response. ACE vascular activity was higher in 3 - vs. 1 -copy Ace mice (2. 4 -fold, P < 0. 05) in the control uninjured vessel. Upon injury, ACE activity significantly increased in both groups [2. 41 -fold and 2. 14 -fold (P < 0. 05) for 1 - and 3 -copy groups, respectively] but reached higher levels in 3 - vs. 1 -copy Ace mice (P < 0. 05). Pharmacological interventions were then used as a <b>counterproof</b> and to indirectly assess the role of angiotensin II (ANG II) on this response. Interestingly, ACE inhibition (enalapril) and ANG II AT(1) receptor blocker (losartan) reduced intima thickening in 3 -copy mice to 1 -copy mouse values (P < 0. 05) while ANG II treatment significantly increased intima thickening in 1 -copy mice to 3 -copy mouse levels (P < 0. 05). Together, these data indicate that small physiologically relevant changes in ACE, not associated with basal vascular abnormalities or blood pressure levels, do influence the magnitude of cuff-induced neointima thickening in mice.
