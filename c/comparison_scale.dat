50|$|Pairwise <b>comparison</b> <b>scale</b> - a {{respondent}} is presented with two items {{at a time}} and asked to select one (example : Do you prefer Pepsi or Coke?). This is an ordinal level technique when a measurement model is not applied. Krus and Kennedy (1977) elaborated the paired comparison scaling within their domain-referenced model. The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) can be applied in order to derive measurements provided the data derived from paired comparisons possess an appropriate structure. Thurstone's Law of comparative judgment can also be applied in such contexts.|$|E
5000|$|The ShapeDNA {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{spectral}} shape descriptors. It is the normalized beginning sequence of the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

Competitors of shapeDNA include singular values of Geodesic Distance Matrix (SD-GDM) [...] and Reduced BiHarmonic Distance Matrix (R-BiHDM).However, the eigenvalues are global descriptors, therefore the shapeDNA and other global spectral descriptors cannot be used for local or partial shape analysis.|$|E

40|$|Despite good {{theoretical}} and empirical rationale for assessing tendencies to make upward and downward physical appearance comparisons no measure for these specific constructs exists. The present work developed and tested {{the psychometric properties of}} upward and downward physical appearance comparison scales. The scales were administered to participants (N = 224) along with measures of general appearance comparison tendencies, body image, disordered eating, Antifat and Antigay attitudes. The scales displayed good psychometric properties. Importantly, the upward but not downward physical appearance <b>comparison</b> <b>scale</b> predicted lower Appearance Evaluation and higher EAT- 26 scores. Conversely, the downward but not upward physical appearance <b>comparison</b> <b>scale</b> predicted higher Appearance Evaluation and greater Antifat Attitudes (Dislike). The scales were unrelated to a nonappearance related construct.
