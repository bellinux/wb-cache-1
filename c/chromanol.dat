This is mainly due to reduced vitamin activity of the 4 possible stereoisomers which are represented by the l or S enantiomer at the first stereocenter (an S or l configuration between the <b>chromanol</b> ring and the tail, i.e., the SRR, SRS, SSR, and SSS stereoisomers). The 3 unnatural [...] "2R" [...] stereoisomers with natural R configuration at this 2' stereocenter, but S {{at one of the}} other centers in the tail (i.e., RSR, RRS, RSS), appear to retain substantial RRR vitamin activity, because they are recognized by the alpha-tocopherol transport protein, and thus maintained in the plasma, where the other four stereoisomers (SRR, SRS, SSR, and SSS) are not. Thus, the synthetic all-rac-α-tocopherol in theory would have approximately half the vitamin activity of RRR-alpha-tocopherol in humans. Experimentally, the ratio of activities of the 8 stereoisomer racemic mixture to the natural vitamin, is 1 to 1.36 in the rat pregnancy model (suggesting a measured activity ratio of 1/1.36 = 74% of natural, for the 8-isomer racemic mix).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{large mammals}} and humans, the {{contribution}} of IKs to ventricular repolarization is still incompletely understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vivo and cellular electrophysiological experiments were conducted to study IKs in canine ventricular repolarization. In conscious dogs, administration of the selective IKs blocker HMR 1556 (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg PO) caused substantial dose-dependent QT prolongations with broad-based T waves. In isolated ventricular myocytes under baseline conditions, however, IKs block (<b>chromanols</b> HMR 1556 and 293 B) did not significantly prolong action potential duration (APD) at fast or slow steady-state pacing rates. This {{was because of the}} limited activation of IKs in the voltage and time domains of the AP, although at seconds-long depolarizations, the current was substantial. Isoproterenol increased and accelerated IKs activation to promote APD 95 shortening. This shortening was importantly reversed by HMR 1556 and 293 B. Quantitatively similar effects were obtained in ventricular-tissue preparations. Finally, when cellular repolarization was impaired by IKr block, IKs block exaggerated repolarization instability with further prolongation of APD. CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular repolarization in conscious dogs is importantly dependent on IKs. IKs function becomes prominent during beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, when it promotes AP shortening by increased activation, and during IKr block, when it limits repolarization instability by time-dependent activation. Unstimulated IKs does not contribute to cellular APD at baseline. These data highlight the importance of the synergism between an intact basal IKs and the sympathetic nervous system in vivo. status: publishe...|$|R

We hypothesize that the maintenance of sufficiently high vitamin E concentrations in LDL can be achieved by reducing its chromanoxyl radicals, i. e., by vitamin E recycling. In this study we demonstrate that: i) chromanoxyl radicals of endogenous vitamin E and of exogenously added a-tocotrienol, a-tocopherol or its synthetic homologue with a karbon side-chain, chromanolcl-C 6, can be directly generated in human LDL by ultraviolet (W) light, or by interaction with peroxyl radicals produced either by an enzymic oxidation system (lipoxygenase + linolenic acid) or by an azo-initiator, 2, 2 '-azo-bis(2, 4 dimethylvaleronitrile) (AMVN); ii) ascorbate can recycle endogenous vitamin E and exogenously added <b>chromanols</b> by direct reduction of chromanoxyl radicals in LDL; iii) dihydrolipoic acid is not efficient in direct reduction of chromanoxyl radicals but recycles vitamin E by synergistically interacting with ascorbate (reduces dehydroascorbate thus maintaining the steady-state concentration of ascorbate); and io) barotene is not active in vitamin E recycling but may itself be protected against oxidative destruction by the reductants of chromanoxyl radicals.

At stimulation rates of 3. 33, 1. 0 and 0. 2 [*]Hz, the degree of prolongation of APD evoked by BaCl 2 (10 [*]μM) was comparable in fibres from female and male dogs.

Although the chemistry of the process is well established, {{the role played by}} molecular structure that we address here with atomistic molecular-dynamics simulations remains controversial. The simulations were run in the constant particle NPT ensemble on hydrated lipid bilayers composed of SDPC (1 -stearoyl- 2 -docosahexaenoylphosphatidylcholine, 18 : 0 - 22 : 6 PC) and SOPC (1 -stearoyl- 2 -oleoylphosphatidylcholine, 18 : 0 - 18 : 1 PC) in the presence of 20  mol % αtoc at 37 °C. SDPC with SA (stearic acid) for the sn- 1 chain and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) for the sn- 2 chain is representative of polyunsaturated phospholipids, while SOPC with OA (oleic acid) substituted for the sn- 2 chain serves as a monounsaturated control. Solid-state 2 H nuclear magnetic resonance and neutron diffraction experiments provide validation. The simulations demonstrate that high disorder enhances the probability that DHA chains at the sn- 2 position in SDPC rise up to the bilayer surface, whereby they encounter the <b>chromanol</b> group on αtoc molecules. This behavior is reflected in the van der Waals energy of interaction between αtoc and acyl chains, and illustrated by density maps of distribution for acyl chains around αtoc molecules that were constructed. An ability to more easily penetrate deep into the bilayer is another attribute conferred upon the <b>chromanol</b> group in αtoc by the high disorder possessed by DHA.

D-Sotalol (30 μM) and E- 4031 (1 μM), selective blockers of IKr, in the same preparations markedly (20 – 80 %) lengthened APD in a reverse frequency-dependent manner. In vivo ECG recordings in intact anaesthetized dogs indicated no significant <b>chromanol</b> 293 B (1 mg kg− 1 i. v.) effect on the QTc interval (332. 9 ± 16. 1 ms before versus 330. 5 ± 11. 2 ms, n = 6, after <b>chromanol</b> 293 B), while D-sotalol (1 mg kg− 1 i. v.) significantly increased the QTc interval (323. 9 ± 7. 3 ms before versus 346. 5 ± 6. 4 ms, n = 5, after D-sotalol, P < 0. 05). The current density estimated during the normal ventricular muscle action potential (i. e. after a 200 ms square pulse to + 30 mV or during a 250 ms long ‘action potential-like’ test pulse) indicates that substantially more current is conducted through IKr channels than through IKs channels. However, if {{the duration of the}} square test pulse or the ‘action potential-like’ test pulse was lengthened to 500 ms the relative contribution of IKs significantly increased. When APD was pharmacologically prolonged in papillary muscle (1 μM E- 4031 and 1 μg ml− 1 veratrine), 100 nM L- 735, 821 and 10 μM <b>chromanol</b> 293 B lengthened repolarization substantially by 14. 4 ± 3. 4 and 18. 0 ± 3. 4 % (n = 8), respectively. We conclude that in this study IKs plays little role in normal dog ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibre action potential repolarization and that IKr is the major source of outward current responsible for initiation of final action potential repolarization. Thus, when APD is abnormally increased, the role of IKs in final repolarization increases to provide an important safety mechanism that reduces arrhythmia risk...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{are exposed}} to ever {{changing}} light environments and continuously forced to adapt. Excessive light intensity leads {{to the production of}} reactive oxygen species that can have deleterious effects on photosystems and thylakoid membranes. To limit damage, plants increase the production of membrane soluble antioxidants such as tocopherols. Here, untargeted lipidomics after high light treatment showed that among hundreds of lipid compounds alpha-tocopherol is the most strongly induced, underscoring its importance as an antioxidant. As part of the antioxidant mechanism, a-tocopherol undergoes a redox cycle involving oxidative opening of the <b>chromanol</b> ring. The only enzyme currently known to participate in the cycle is tocopherol cyclase (VTE 1, At 4 g 32770), that re-introduces the <b>chromanol</b> ring of a-tocopherol. By mutant analysis, we identified the NAD(P) H-dependent quinone oxidoreductase (NDC 1, At 5 g 08740) as a second enzyme implicated in this cycle. NDC 1 presumably acts through the reduction of quinone intermediates preceding cyclization by VTE 1. Exposure to high light also triggered far-ranging changes in prenylquinone composition that we dissect herein using null mutants and lines overexpressing the VTE 1 and NDC 1 enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Background - Although {{pharmacological}} {{block of}} the slow, delayed rectifier potassium current (I-Ks) by <b>chromanol</b> 293 B, L- 735, 821, or HMR- 1556 produces {{little effect on}} action potential duration (APD) in isolated rabbit and dog ventricular myocytes, the effect of IKs block on normal human ventricular muscle APD is not known. Therefore, studies were conducted to elucidate the role of IKs in normal human ventricular muscle and in preparations in which both repolarization reserve was attenuated and sympathetic activation was increased by exogenous dofetilide and adrenaline. Methods and Results - Preparations were obtained from undiseased organ donors. Action potentials were measured in ventricular trabeculae and papillary muscles using conventional microelectrode techniques; membrane currents were measured in ventricular myocytes using voltage-clamp techniques. <b>Chromanol</b> 293 B (10 mu mol/L), L- 735, 821 (100 nmol/L), and HMR- 1556 (100 nmol/L and 1 mu mol/L) produced a < 12 -ms change in APD while pacing at cycle lengths ranging from 300 to 5000 ms, whereas the I-Kr blockers sotalol and E- 4031 markedly lengthened APD. In voltage-clamp experiments, L- 735, 821 and <b>chromanol</b> 293 B each blocked IKs {{in the presence of}} E- 4031 to block IKr. The E- 4031 -sensitive current (I-Kr) {{at the end of a}} 150 -ms-long test pulse to 30 mV was 32. 9 +/- 6. 7 pA (n = 8); the L- 735, 821 -sensitive current (I-Ks) magnitude was 17. 8 +/- 2. 94 pA (n = 10). During a longer 500 -ms test pulse, IKr was not substantially changed (33. 6 +/- 6. 1 pA; n = 8), and I-Ks was significantly increased (49. 6 +/- 7. 24 pA; n = 10). On application of an "action potential-like" test pulse, I-Kr increased as voltage became more negative, whereas I-Ks remained small throughout all phases of the action potential - like test pulse. In experiments in which APD was first lengthened by 50 nmol/L dofetilide and sympathetic activation was increased by 1 mu mol/L adrenaline, 1 mu mol/L HMR- 1556 significantly increased APD by 14. 7 +/- 3. 2...|$|E
40|$|SCOPE: Cytochrome-dependent {{metabolism}} {{of vitamin}} E initially forms the long-chain metabolites (LCM) 13 '-hydroxychromanols (13 '-OH) and 13 '-carboxychromanols (13 '-COOH), which occur in human blood. Little {{is known about}} their biological functions. MATERIAL AND RESULTS: A structure-activity relationship study using α- and δ-tocopherol (TOH), their LCM (α- 13 '-OH, δ- 13 '-OH, α- 13 '-COOH, and δ- 13 '-COOH) and representatives of their substructures (α-carboxyethylhydroxychromanol and pristanic acid) is performed to unravel critical structural elements of the LCM for biological activity. Prominent effects are mediated by α- and δ-LCM, as scavenger receptor cluster of differentiation 36 (CD 36) expression is induced in human THP- 1 macrophages and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNos) expression is inhibited in murine RAW 264. 7 macrophages, while the other molecules are less or not effective. CONCLUSION: The LCM effects depend {{on the presence of}} the <b>chromanol</b> ring system and on the modification of the side-chain but not on the substitution pattern of the <b>chromanol</b> ring. Therefore, it can be concluded that for mediation of effects by LCM the entire molecule is needed and that the effects are specific. Wepropose the LCM of the micronutrient vitamin E as a new class of regulatory metabolites, but further studies are needed to corroborate this hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|K(V) LQT 1 (K(V) LQ 1) is a {{voltage-gated}} K+ channel {{essential for}} repolarization {{of the heart}} action potential that is defective in cardiac arrhythmia. The channel is inhibited by the <b>chromanol</b> 293 B, a compound that blocks cAMP-dependent electrolyte secretion in rat and human colon, therefore suggesting expression of a similar type of K+ channel in the colonic epithelium. We now report cloning and expression of K(V) LQT 1 from rat colon. Overlapping clones identified by cDNA-library screening were combined to a full length cDNA that shares high sequence homology to K(V) LQT 1 cloned from other species. RT-PCR analysis of rat colonic musoca demonstrated expression of K(V) LQT 1 in crypt cells and surface epithelium. Expression of rK(V) LQT 1 in Xenopus oocytes induced a typical delayed activated K+ current. that was further activated by increase of intracellular cAMP but not Ca 2 + and that was blocked by the <b>chromanol</b> 293 B. The same compound blocked a basolateral cAMP-activated K+ conductance in the colonic mucosal epithelium and inhibited whole cell K+ currents in patch-clamp experiments on isolated colonic crypts. We conclude that K(V) QT 1 is forming {{an important component of}} the basolateral cAMP-activated K+ conductance in the colonic epithelium and plays a crucial role in diseases like secretory diarrhea and cystic fibrosis...|$|E

While paecilin E (1) was active against S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212, dankastetrone A (2) was only effective against E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and the multidrug-resistant VRE E. faecalis A 5 / 102.

Voltage clamp experiments showed XE 991 inhibited an outward current in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 of 5. 8 [*]μM. Block was voltage independent. <b>Chromanol</b> 293 B and linopirdine also blocked the voltage-dependent K+ current but were less potent than XE 991. At least two components – a linear (Ilinear) and an outward relaxation (Iout) – contributed to the XE 991 -sensitive conductance. XE 991 -sensitive currents were sustained at all test potentials and XE 991 inhibited the enhanced holding current at − 60 [*]mV produced by bathing cells in an external solution containing 36 [*]mM KCl. Current clamp experiments in the perforated-patch configuration showed XE 991 and linopirdine depolarised the resting membrane potential and augmented the evoked response in a concentration-dependent manner. In functional experiments the spontaneous contractile activity of the mPV was increased significantly by XE 991 and linopirdine.
