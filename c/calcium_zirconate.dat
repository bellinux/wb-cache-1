The results indicated that in the non-oriented electric steel slag system with a high ratio of calcia to silica, the slag resistance behavior of MgO-ZrO 2 composite {{could be described as}} follows: the ZrO 2 reacts with CaO forming the <b>calcium</b> <b>zirconate</b> compound which is densification encapsulating periclase lay.

40|$|Abstract. Reinforcement with yttria {{stabilized}} zirconia (YSZ) is {{an alternative}} to improve mechanical strength of hydroxyapatite (HAp) ceramic. However, calcium may react with zirconium to form <b>calcium</b> <b>zirconate.</b> In addition, decomposition of HAp to tricalcium phosphate (TCP) occurs with water loss inhibiting ceramic densification.

Composite nominal compositions were fixed at 90 and 95 HAp wt%. Calcium, zirconium and yttrium chlorides and ammonium hydrogen phosphate were the employed precursors.

30|$|Currently, {{the focus}} is to develop {{advanced}} physical and chemical solvent systems that {{have the potential to}} provide significant improvements in both cost and performance as compared to the Selexol and Rectisol for pre-combustion CO 2 capture. The challenges are to modify regeneration conditions to recover the CO 2 at a higher pressure, improve selectivity to reduce H 2 losses, and develop a solvent that has a high CO 2 loading at a higher temperature, which would increase integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) efficiency. In the same line, another vital task is to develop a new sorbent which could be highly efficient for pre-combustion capture conditions. Consequently, the US Department of Energy (DOE) performed the thermodynamic modeling activities that included screening analyses for a number of different metal oxides, zirconates, silicates and titanates under various operating conditions to identify new solid sorbents for pre-combustion CO 2 capture. About 18 sorbents were modeled and finally seven candidates are chosen—magnesium oxide (MgO), calcium oxide (CaO), lithium zirconate (Li 2 ZrO 3), <b>calcium</b> <b>zirconate</b> (CaZrO 3), barium zirconate (BaZrO 3), barium titanate (BaTiO 3) and barium silicate (BaSiO 3) for further investigations [8].

In addition, the phenolphthalein test has put into evidence the existence of free CaO.

After drying the precipitated complex at 150 ³C for 3 h, a mixture of calcium oxalate and an amorphous zirconia phase is found. Between 200 and 450 ³C, the calcium oxalate decomposes into calcium carbonate. In the temperature range 450 ± 800 ³C, the calcium carbonate decomposes into CaO, while a crystalline zirconia phase appears (CaZr 4 O 9). In this temperature range, the formation of CaZrO 3 is already observed. Further increasing the calcination temperature to 1000 ³C leads to a binary mixture of CaZrO 3 and CaIn 2 O 4.
