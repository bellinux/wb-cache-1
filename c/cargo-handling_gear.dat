25|$|Able seamen and {{ordinary}} seamen operate the vessel and its deck equipment under officer supervision {{and keep their}} assigned areas in good order. They watch for other vessels and obstructions in the ship's path, {{as well as for}} navigational aids such as buoys and lighthouses. They also steer the ship, measure water depth in shallow water, and maintain and operate deck equipment such as lifeboats, anchors, and <b>cargo-handling</b> <b>gear.</b> On tankers, mariners designated as pumpmen hook up hoses, operate pumps, and clean tanks. When arriving at or leaving a dock, they handle the mooring lines. Seamen also perform routine maintenance chores, such as repairing lines, chipping rust, and painting and cleaning decks. On larger vessels, a boatswain — or head seaman — will supervise the work.|$|E

50|$|A {{passenger}} ship is a merchant ship whose primary {{function is to}} carry passengers on the sea. The category does not include cargo vessels which have accommodations for limited numbers of passengers, such as the ubiquitous twelve-passenger freighters once common on the seas in which the transport of passengers is secondary to the carriage of freight. The type does however include many classes of ships designed to transport substantial numbers of passengers as well as freight. Indeed, until recently virtually all ocean liners were able to transport mail, package freight and express, and other cargo in addition to passenger luggage, and were equipped with cargo holds and derricks, kingposts, or other <b>cargo-handling</b> <b>gear</b> for that purpose. Only in more recent ocean liners and in virtually all cruise ships has this cargo capacity been eliminated.|$|E
50|$|The open hatch bulk carrier, often {{referred}} to as OHBC or conbulker, is designed to offer direct access to the hold through hatches which extend the full width of the vessel. As a result, large cargo units can be lowered into place. If it is possible, the holds or hatches are designed around standard cargo unit sizes. Sometimes a gantry crane is fitted. There is special attention for <b>cargo-handling</b> shipping <b>gear.</b> These conbulkers are expensive because there is extra steel necessary to widen the hatches. This is crucial to provide strength. The open hatches are useful for forest products, such as pre-slung timber and logs. The heavy units are more easy to handle than in a conventional bulk carrier. The open hatch bulk carriers {{can also be used to}} carry containers on the outward leg, and dry bulk on the return leg. The first open hatch bulk carrier was built in 1962, for the use of paper trade.|$|R

50|$|Ship's {{engineers}} operate, maintain, {{and repair}} engines, boilers, generators, pumps, and other machinery. Merchant marine vessels usually have four engineering officers: a chief engineer and a first, second, and third assistant engineer. On many ships, Assistant Engineers stand periodic watches, overseeing the safe operation of engines and other machinery. However, most modern ships sailing today utilize Unmanned Machinery Space (UMS) automation technology, and Assistant Engineers are Dayworkers. At night and during meals and breaks, {{the engine room}} is unmanned and machinery alarms are answered by the Duty Engineer.Able seamen and ordinary seamen operate the vessel and its deck equipment under officer supervision and keep their assigned areas in good order.

40|$|Ships, {{the sea and}} {{the coast}} have always been popular {{pictorial}} motifs, even if marine painting did not become established as an independent genre {{until the end of the}} sixteenth century in the Netherlands. Among the painters for whom maritime motifs played an important role even earlier is Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1525 / 30 - 1569), the greatest Netherlandish painter of the sixteenth century. In this context, the grandiose harbour view in Bruegel's painting "The Tower of Babel" (1563) is particularly worthy of mention, as two different phases of harbour development are juxtaposed here: on the one hand the wharf, entirely void of dock constructions, a relic from the earliest stages of harbour development and still prevalent in the Early Middle Ages, on the other hand the harbour of the Late Middle Ages / Early Modern Times, dominated as it was by the shoreline quay with its typical <b>cargo-handling</b> <b>gear</b> (heavy-duty crane, whip-and-skid devices, winches). While the harbour facilities of Antwerp - where Bruegel lived and worked for many years - will have served him as a model for quayage in the highly developed form of a well-fortified fortress, the rural environment of his native Flanders will have provided him with a wealth of visual aids for the more primitive harbour form, the wharf. Excellent descriptions of historical harbour types are now and then to be found in fictional literature. Thomas Mann (1875 - 1955) for example, in his novel cycle Joseph and his Brothers (1948), or Conrad Ferdinand Meyer (1825 - 1898) in his novel Jürg Jenatsch (1874) both brought the shoreline market to life, an archaic harbour form in which the harbour and the market are an indivisible unit, both spatially as well as operationally. Both market scenes take place in out-of-the-ordinary times and places: In Thomas Mann’s trilogy the setting is provided by the Upper Egyptian pharaoh city of Thebes in the middle of the second millennium B. C., in C. F. Meyer's work it is Lake Como on the southern edge of the Alps at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War. By dint of their exceptional powers of intuition, both authors succeed in staging the characteristic atmosphere of a typical waterside market with great mastery. Each in his own way and with his own artistic means, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Thomas Mann and Conrad Ferdinand Meyer all created concordant images of certain specific historical harbour forms - the wharf, the waterside market, the Early Modern shore quay. While artistic designs such as these cannot replace the precise methods of science, they are nevertheless capable of making a welcome contribution to the vivid visualisation of historical harbour development...|$|E
