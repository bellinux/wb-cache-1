5000|$|As train loads, {{gradients}} and speeds increased, braking {{became a}} problem. In the late 19th century, significantly better <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> started to appear.

50|$|More {{sophisticated}} {{technologies in}} use nowadays generally employ couplings {{that have no}} loose slack, although there is elastic movement at the couplings; <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> is provided, so that every vehicle on the train has brakes controlled by the driver. Generally this uses compressed air as a control medium, {{and there is a}} measurable time lag as the signal (to apply or release brakes) propagates along the train.|$|E
50|$|The {{only one}} {{efficient}} line was Košice-Bohumín. The state therefore {{decided to take}} over the operation of all private railways and extend the rail lines. The pressure of competition from the road freight transport stimulated further developments. The speed of freight trains was increased up to 70 km/h by applying <b>continuous</b> <b>braking.</b> Significant progress in passenger traffic was achieved by motorization of local railways.|$|E

50|$|A {{passenger}} brake van originally {{served the}} same purpose as a goods brake van, but, when <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> became standard on passenger trains, its use changed. The van may have equipment {{for the application of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> in an emergency if fitted alongside the hand brake for when the train is parked without a locomotive present. The vehicle also provides a compartment for the guard, a luggage compartment, and sometimes passenger accommodation, as well.|$|R
50|$|A brakeman's cabin (also brakeman's cab) or brakeman's caboose (US) {{was a small}} one-man {{compartment}} {{at one end of}} {{a railway}} wagon to provide shelter for the brakeman from the weather and in which equipment for manually operating the wagon brake was located. They were built in the days before <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> was available and the locomotive brake needed to be augmented by brakemen applying the wagon brakes individually.|$|E
50|$|With {{the demise}} of Decauville, the Société Anonyme des Chemins de Fer Du Calvados (CFC) took over the lines on 1 August 1895. The CFC used rails laid on wooden sleepers, and Westinghouse <b>continuous</b> <b>braking,</b> quite an {{advanced}} piece of technology on such a small gauge. Decauville referred to the line as the Tramway du Calvados but the new company were quite sure that they were running a railway, offering 1st, 2nd and 3rd class accommodation on its trains.|$|E
50|$|The PZ80 is a {{independent}} development of GDR based company Geräte- und Reglerwerk Teltow. There {{was a need}} for efficient train protection systems by the East-German Deutsche Reichsbahn. They wanted to gain independence of the technically obsolete I 60 supply by the West-German Siemens manufacturer and replacement imports of the Romanian I 60 Icret. The PZ80 supported all Indusi 60 modes enhanced with a number of new modes including speed control in steps of 10 km/h, <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> curves and a restrictive mode. In 1990 the developer was sold by Treuhand institution to Siemens. So this system was the foundation of the upcoming PZB90 system.|$|E

50|$|In 1901 No's 9 & 10 were {{retrofitted}} with Westinghouse {{air brakes}} {{as part of}} the company's drive to fit <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> to its entire fleet, completed in 1902. All other changes to the two locos during WMR service were minor, such as replacement of the original pressed steel & copper funnels in cast iron. In December 1908 the Wellington and Manawatu Railway was purchased by the New Zealand Government and incorporated into the government railway system. No.9 was then classified and renumbered N 453. For this role, her WMR insigia was removed, NZR number plates added, tablet hooks were fitted to the cab and the smokebox front replaced with a standard NZR design.|$|E
50|$|The use of four-coupled wheels for a fast express {{was unusual}} by this time, as the Atlantic arrangement, a four-coupled tender {{locomotive}} with a four-wheel leading bogie for high-speeds, had by now largely {{been replaced by}} the larger Pacific. One exception was the US Hiawatha , a 4-4-2 of the same period. US track loadings were higher though, and this locomotive had a driving axle loading twice that of the Hungarian design. With the relatively short range of 250 km required, the Class 242 could afford to be a tank locomotive, even though this reduced the water and fuel capacity available. Avoiding the weight of a tender, and a large fuel capacity, further reduced the axle loading. A modern feature required by these increased speeds, and the lack of braking weight in the locomotive itself, was improved <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> throughout the train, by compressed air brakes to the Knorr system.|$|E
50|$|The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) reached Victoria Bridge in 1852. Plans for {{a narrow}} gauge rail link to Castlederg were agreed {{at a public}} meeting held in the town in August 1881. The line was {{constructed}} shortly prior to {{the enactment of the}} Tramways Act 1883, and opened in April 1883, so the promoters lost out on any financial assistance from the government. Because of a sharp gradient on the approach to Victoria Bridge, all trains had to be equipped with a Westinghouse <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> system - the first trains in Ireland to be so equipped. The line's first two steam locomotives were fitted with enclosed bodywork as tram engines. Throughout its operation, the line was normally served by three return workings every day (except Sundays), with an additional service on Fridays and Castlederg Fair days. It started with two Kitson tramway type 0-4-0T locomotives, but these were both gone by 1912. A third improved Kitson tram locomotive was acquired in 1891, this was withdrawn in 1928.|$|E

50|$|In 1890 the Board of Trade {{ordered that}} the block system and <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> be instituted {{on the lines}} (L&CR and the LLUC line, for which the L&CR had responsibility). The block system is a train control {{procedure}} in which a railway line {{is considered to be}} divided into sections, and no train may enter a section unless it can be verified that no other train is in the section. See Signalling block system. <b>Continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> are brakes that can be controlled throughout the train by the driver, and if they are automatic brakes then they are automatically applied in both portions if the train becomes accidentally divided.

40|$|In this study, two {{different}} ventilated brake discs were manufactured and their braking force performances and heat generations were investigated experimentally {{together with a}} solid disc. Braking force outputs were examined in sudden and <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> conditions and disc temperatures were simply measured in <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> conditions. Fourteen pedal forces were used in sudden braking tests and eight periodic measurements were executed in <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> tests. Experiment results showed that ventilation applications not only increased the brake force outputs up to 42. 6 %, but also reduced the heat formation on discs up to 31. 5 % depending on test conditions...|$|E

40|$|Paper―based {{friction}} materials containing {{four different}} graphite particle sizes were prepared using the wet paper―making process. The effects of graphite particle size on friction performance such as friction torque curves, dynamic friction coefficient, static friction coefficient and wear rate were studied {{by using an}} inertia friction tester. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of friction coefficient to braking pressure and rotating speed was also investigated. Worn surfaces of samples were analyzed by using scanning electron microscope. The results show that with graphite particle size decreasing, braking time increases and torque curves become more stable, while friction coefficient and wear rate decrease. The dynamic friction coefficient declines as braking pressure and rotating speed increase. Samples with proper particle size exhibit more stable friction coefficient in the <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> process. Lubricating film is formed to lower wear rate in the worn surface as the graphite particles size decreases...|$|E
