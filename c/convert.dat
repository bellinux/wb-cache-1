40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether ethnicity impacts graft outcomes in kidney transplant patients <b>converted</b> to sirolimus (SRL) and maintained on either calcineurin inhibitors (CI) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with steroids. METHODS: This study analyzed kidney transplants <b>converted</b> to SRL and transplanted between July 1991 and April 2007. Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI; group 2 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI; group 3 : African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF; group 4 : non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF. RESULTS: A total of 242 patients was included. Demographics, baseline immunosuppression, and reason for SRL conversion were similar among groups. Patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI regimens had significantly higher rates of acute rejection before SRL conversion, but equal rates after conversion. Development of proteinuria was similar across groups. African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF tended to have poorer outcomes compared with African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI. Non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + MMF tended to have better graft outcomes compared with non-African-American patients <b>converted</b> to SRL + CI. CONCLUSIONS: African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL may benefit from continued CI, whereas non-African-Americans <b>converted</b> to SRL seem to have better outcomes with MMF. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings...|$|R
