40|$|Heavy metals (HMs) {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{ecological}} problem related to human activities. Phytoremediation is a promising "green technology" for soil and water reclamation, and it can be improved by means of the use of <b>chelants.</b> In the past particular attention was paid on the effects of HMs and/or <b>chelants</b> on plant health, but much less on their effects on rhizosphere communities. To shed light on the interaction among plant-HM-chelant-rhizobacterial community a pot experiment was set up. Maize plants were grown on uncontaminated, multi-metal (copper and zinc) contaminated and <b>chelants</b> artificially amended soils. A high concentration of HMs was detected in the different maize organs; <b>chelants</b> improved the accumulation capacity of the maize plants. The rhizosphere bacterial community isolated from control plants showed the largest biodiversity in terms of bacterial genera. However, the addition of HMs reduced the number of taxa to three: Bacillus, Lysinibacillus and Pseudomonas. The effects of HM treatment were counteracted by the addition of <b>chelants</b> in terms of the genetic biodiversity.

30|$|Based on {{the earlier}} {{literature}} review, many experiments using chelating agents were conducted and reported by past researchers. These <b>chelants</b> {{could be applied}} to stimulate high-temperature well. The efforts of these past studies, focusing on the effectiveness of <b>chelants</b> at high-temperature condition, were highly appreciated. It was proven that these acid systems were suitable and reliable to gain extensively wide application in real-field practice. However, it should also be alerted that chelating agents are generally less suitable for clean homogeneous sandstones because of the silica precipitation during acidizing. Therefore, they are more suitable for heterogeneous carbonates and clay-rich sandstones. Another point of view that should be noticed is that <b>chelants</b> are very costly products as compared to mud acid, retarded acid and organic acids. Although chelating agents can reduce the cost of corrosion inhibitor used, it is still important to optimize the budget between the costly <b>chelants</b> and corrosion inhibitor.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that chelant-assisted phytoextraction approaches often require a high dosage of <b>chelant</b> applied to soil. The present study focused on optimization of phytoremediation processes to increase the phytoextraction efficiency of metals at reduced <b>chelant</b> applications. Pot experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of increased soil temperature on shoot uptake of heavy metals by corn (Zea mays L.) and mung bean (Vigna radiat L. Wilczek) from heavy metal-contaminated soils. After the application of S,S-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid or ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, soils were exposed to high temperatures (50 or 80 °C) for 3 h, which significantly increased the concentration of heavy metals in shoots. The heating treatment 2 d after the <b>chelant</b> addition resulted in higher concentrations of metals compared with those treatments 2 d before or simultaneously with the <b>chelant</b> application. Irrigation with 100 °C water 2 d after the <b>chelant</b> addition, or irrigation with 100 °C <b>chelant</b> solutions directly, also resulted in significantly higher phytoextraction of metals in the two crops compared with 25 °C <b>chelant</b> solutions. In addition, a novel application method to increase soil temperature using underground polyvinyl chloride tubes would increase the chelant-assisted extraction efficiency of Cu approximately 10 - to 14 -fold in corn and fivefold in mung bean compared with those nonheating treatments. In a field experiment, increasing soil temperature 2 d after <b>chelant</b> addition also increased the shoot Cu uptake approximately fivefold compared with those nonheating treatments.

Hence, the attempts to recover indium from the secondary resources, such as recycling of the indium abundant waste materials, received increasing research focus.

Currently, {{diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid}} (DTPA) is used, along with synergist oxalic acid and potassium hydroxide, {{to remove the}} scale by dissolution. However, the chemical factors affecting this reaction are not known fully, leading to mixed results in terms of treatment effectiveness. This thesis investigates the effect of these factors, by analyzing the change in barite dissolution due to intrinsic factors like variations in formulation composition and extrinsic factors like presence of competing ions. The dissolution reaction is carried out, by taking the barite powder and <b>chelant</b> solution in a teflon round bottom flask and measuring the barite dissolved periodically, with an ICP-OES. The effect of different factors is studied by varying each factor individually and plotting the changes in solubilities. These lab tests show that solubility of barite (0. 01 mM in water), ideally, increases with increasing concentrations of chelating agents, even going as high as 239 mM. However experimental or field constraints lead to significant decrease in dissolution, especially at higher <b>chelant</b> concentrations. Thus, field tests to determine most effective <b>chelant</b> concentrations must precede treatment design. Lab tests also show that combination of DTPA with weaker chelating agents like ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), L-glutamic acid, N,N-diacetic acid (GLDA) or methyl glycine diacetic acid (MGDA) reduces barite dissolution and should be avoided during treatment design. Addition of synergists to the formulations, initially improves dissolution performance, especially for moderate <b>chelant</b> concentrations, but proves detrimental and hence must be avoided, over longer treatments. Finally, presence of competing ions in seawater, calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate, can significantly reduce barite dissolution and must be carefully studied for each formation-fluid system before design of treatments. Thus, this project sets a framework to identify the best <b>chelant</b> formulation and estimate its dissolution profile to ensure, a more informed treatment design for barite scale removal...|$|E
40|$|Heavy metals {{contamination}} of soil {{is a widespread}} global problem. <b>Chelant</b> assisted phytoextraction has been proposed to improve the efficiency of phytoextraction which involves three subsequent levels: transfer of metals from the bulk soil to the root surfaces, uptake into the roots and translocation to the shoots.

A hydroponic experiment, which addresses the latter two levels, was conducted to {{study the effects of}} EDTA, EDDS and IDSA on the uptake and the distribution of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd in the apoplast and the symplast of roots of maize (Zea mays, L). The concentrations of the metals (with exception of Zn) in the shoots were increased significantly by addition of all the chelants. EDTA was most effective for Pb uptake and IDSA was interestingly most effective for Cd uptake. Pb in the roots with EDTA was mostly distributed in the apoplast, while Zn, especially with IDSA, was mostly located in the symplast.

40|$|My {{original}} contribution to knowledge {{is presented in}} this work, in the new application of a previously synthesised manganese (III) complex as an effective and selective oxidation catalyst. Development {{of a series of}} conditions in which epoxidation reactions can successfully be undertaken was established with both hydrogen peroxide and n-tetrabutyl ammonium oxone. Epoxidations undertaken with hydrogen peroxide were commensurate with a competitive catalase like reaction. Establishment of the factors that drive the catalase type of oxidative reaction with the Mn(DMHP) 2. Cl complex, including Michaelis Menten kinetic parameters and the effects of temperature and pH, allowed for a protocol to be set up that can favour epoxidation over catalase-like dismutation of hydrogen peroxide. To coincide with epoxidation work on hydrogen peroxide, a DFT study on the proposed reaction intermediates is presented with a focus on the likely active catalytic species. The role of imidazole was probed and showed that coordination of imidazole is slightly unfavoured and will be in equilibrium in solution, which coincided with experimental observations that imidazole was required in a slight excess for successful epoxidation. This work further demonstrated that in acidic conditions an oxomanganese(V) species is highly favoured and corresponds excellently to what is observed experimentally where very good conversion to epoxide of cyclooctene is achieved at pH 4. 7. Work utilising n-tetrabutyl ammonium oxone as oxidant exhibited good to excellent conversions, and a trend was observed of high selectivity to strained cyclic alkenes. This was further probed by a joint study using a series of strained substrates that were synthesised and computational chemistry to determine the strains over the alkene bond. Collaborative work with the national mass spectrometry service allowed for identification of the intermediates of the reaction my mass spectrometry coupled with a UV/Vis spectroscopy study. Identification of an oxomanganese(V) species is presented in mass spectrometry as the active intermediate in epoxidations using n-tetrabutyl ammonium oxone. A study as to the effects of additive bases using cyclic voltammetry demonstrated a significant electronic effect on the oxidation potential of the catalyst as the source of the inductive effect, identification by mass spectrometry and UV/Vis showed direct evidence of axial ligation of the additive bases. Using an industrial manganese (II) catalyst in the bleaching of red stains (β-carotene and crocin), a protocol for bleaching was established, using UV/Vis as a method of analysis. Synthesis of a series of <b>chelants</b> which are used to stabilise the catalyst in the formulation was undertaken.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mobilization}} of chromium and nickel from an industrial soil was investigated using two biodegradable <b>chelants</b> (citric acid and histidine), {{compared with a}} persistent one (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). Successive metal mobilizations were carried out in batch experiments. The main reactions involved were estimated by modelling the system with MINEQL+. For a single mobilization, citric acid was the most effective for Cr mobilization and EDTA for Ni. Their effectiveness {{could be explained by}} their ability to solubilize the mineral matrix and by the competition for the surfaces sites to desorb Cr(VI). Before and after the mobilizations, the distribution of metals was determined by a sequential extraction procedure. Only slight modifications were observed due to the low percentage of solubilized metal. A concentration of 0. 05 mol. L- 1 (citric acid and EDTA) allows a good compromise between metal mobilization and preservation of the soil mineral integrit...|$|R
40|$|Ex situ {{soil washing}} with {{synthetic}} extractants such as, aminopolycarboxylate <b>chelants</b> (APCs) {{is a viable}} treatment alternative for metal-contaminated site remediation. EDTA and its homologs are widely used among the APCs in the ex situ soil washing processes. These APCs are merely biodegradable and highly persistent in the aquatic environments leading to the post-use toxic effects. Therefore, an increasing interest {{is focused on the}} development and use of the eco-friendly APCs having better biodegradability and less environmental toxicity. The paper deals with the results from the lab-scale washing treatments of a real sample of metal-contaminated soil for the removal of the ecotoxic metal ions (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) using five biodegradable APCs, namely [S,S]-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid, imminodisuccinic acid, methylglycinediacetic acid, DL- 2 -(2 -carboxymethyl) nitrilotriacetic acid (GLDA) and 3 -hydroxy- 2, 2 '-iminodisuccinic acid. The performance of those biodegradable APCs was evaluated for their interaction with the soil minera...|$|R
