25|$|These {{ideas were}} {{arranged}} into a true calculus of infinitesimals by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who was originally accused of plagiarism by Newton.

25|$|This is {{the same}} as the {{definition}} of the derivative for real functions, except that all of the quantities are complex. In particular, the limit is taken as the complex number z approaches z0, and must have the same value for any sequence of complex values for z that approach z0 on the complex plane.

This concept of complex differentiability shares several properties with real differentiability: it is linear and obeys the product rule, quotient rule, and <b>chain</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{this context}} {{function}} composition is complicated to express, because the <b>chain</b> <b>rule</b> {{is not simply}} applied to second and higher derivatives. This matter was known to Woodhouse by 1803, who took from Louis François Antoine Arbogast {{what is now called}} Faà di Bruno's formula. In essence it was known to Abraham De Moivre (1697). Herschel found the method impressive, Babbage knew of it, and it was later noted by Ada Lovelace as compatible with the analytical engine. In the period to 1820 Babbage worked intensively on functional equations in general, and resisted both conventional finite differences and Arbogast's approach (in which Δ and D were related by the simple additive case of the exponential map). But via Herschel he was influenced by Arbogast's ideas in the matter of iteration, i.e. composing a function with itself, possibly many times. Writing in a major paper on functional equations in the Philosophical Transactions (1815/6), Babbage said his starting point was work of Gaspard Monge.|$|E
25|$|The product {{rule and}} <b>chain</b> <b>rule,</b> {{the notions of}} higher {{derivatives}} and Taylor series, and of analytic functions were introduced by Isaac Newton in an idiosyncratic notation which he used to solve problems of mathematical physics. In his works, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus {{to solve the problem}} of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a cycloid, and many other problems discussed in his Principia Mathematica (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and it was clear that he understood the principles of the Taylor series. He did not publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable.|$|E
25|$|The {{basics of}} {{continuous}} backpropagation were derived {{in the context}} of control theory by Kelley in 1960 and by Bryson in 1961, using principles of dynamic programming. In 1962, Dreyfus published a simpler derivation based only on the <b>chain</b> <b>rule.</b> Bryson and Ho described it as a multi-stage dynamic system optimization method in 1969. In 1970, Linnainmaa finally published the general method for automatic differentiation (AD) of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions. This corresponds to the modern version of backpropagation which is efficient even when the networks are sparse. In 1973, Dreyfus used backpropagation to adapt parameters of controllers in proportion to error gradients. In 1974, Werbos mentioned the possibility of applying this principle to ANNs, and in 1982, he applied Linnainmaa's AD method to neural networks in the way that is widely used today. In 1986, Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams noted that this method can generate useful internal representations of incoming data in hidden layers of neural networks. In 1993, Wan was the first to win an international pattern recognition contest through backpropagation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Possibilistic {{networks}} are belief graphical models based on possibility theory.

The paper analyzes different semantics of three-valued networks and provides precise relationships relating the different semantics. More precisely, the paper analyzes two categories of methods for deriving a three-valued joint possibility distribution from a three-valued possibilistic network. The first category of methods is based on viewing the three-valued possibilistic network as a family of compatible networks and defining combination rules for deriving the three-valued joint distribution. The second category is based on three-valued <b>chain</b> <b>rules</b> using three-valued operators inspired from some three-valued logics.
