40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} a new technique for sterilizing nonlumen electrophysiology catheters that uses hydrogen peroxide gas plasma. Background. The reuse of electrophysiology catheters may potentially result in a significant cost savings. While ethylene oxide sterilization appears to be safe and effective from a clinical standpoint, toxic ethylene oxide residuals, which exceed Food and Drug Administration standards, have been reported. Methods. Ten nonlumen electrophysiology catheters were extensively evaluated. Each catheter was used five times and resterilized after each use with hydrogen peroxide gas plasma. Tests for sterility, mechanical and electrical integrity, <b>chemical</b> <b>residuals</b> and standard and electron microscopic inspection were performed. Results. Loss of electrical integrity or mechanical integrity was not observed in any catheter. No evidence of microbial contamination was found. Surface integrity was preserved except for one ablation catheter that exhibited fraying of the insulation at the insulation-electrode interface. Surface inspection using standard magnification and electron microscopy revealed no significant change in surface characteristics associated with the sterilization process. Hydrogen peroxide was the only chemical residual noted, with an average concentration of 0. 22 % by weight, which is within accepted American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation limits. The cost for a standard electrophysiology catheter ranges from $ 200 to $ 800, and one sterilization cycle costs $ 10. If electrophysiology catheters are used five times, resterilization could potentially result in a savings of $ 2, 000 per catheter, or $ 9, 000 for five ablation procedures. Conclusions. Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization may provide a cost-effective means of sterilizing nonlumen electrophysiology catheters without the problem of potentially harmful <b>chemical</b> <b>residuals.</b> However, careful visual inspection of catheters, particularly at the insulation–electrode interface, is required if catheter reuse is performed...|$|E
40|$|Florida citrus {{represents}} approximately 70 {{percent of}} the industry production in the United States; therefore, any associated agricultural and industrial contamination is of concern and a focus of attention. The use of synthetic organic chemicals has become a farmer 2 ̆ 7 s necessity in order to supply consumers with high quality products, free of pest damage. However, industrial citrus wastes and chemical residual levels worry not only government agencies but also consumers since they indicate a serious habitat risk. This study assesses citrus industrial processes and the paths that chemical substances follow {{from the time the}} citrus seed is planted until consumers get a final product as either fresh fruit or processed product. The study is built on information from United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) manuals, Dade County Environmental Resources Management (DERM) inspection records, United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) regulations, Florida standards, journal publications, and research reports. Pollution prevention (P 2 or prevention-of-pollution) alternatives are identified; alternatives are proposed, evaluated, and included.

40|$|Biomaterial-associated infections {{remain a}} {{significant}} complication of medical implants. Of the different strains of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections, 70 % {{are resistant to}} {{at least one of the}} drugs used for treatment (Bren 2002). In 2000 the Center for Disease Control ranked microbial agents as the 4 th leading actual cause of death in the United States of America (Mokdad et al. 2004). In an effort to improve the prevention and treatment of infections, this research has three objectives: the development of an alternative sterilization method for medical devices; assessing a new antimicrobial material for the prevention of infections in situ; and assessing mechanisms of acquired microbial resistance. The biocide being investigated in this body of work is chlorine dioxide gas. While multiple sterilization methods are available, there are limitations to all of these technologies. For example, chemical sterilization can leave residues on the surface of the material. These residuals can be toxic, causing sensitization reactions when the materials are implanted in the body (Dolovich et al. 1984; Marshall et al. 1985; Chapman et al. 1986; Dolovich et al. 1987). Research has shown that materials sterilized with increasing concentrations of the chemical sterilizing agent have increasing quantities of residuals (Lyarskii et al. 1984). The studies presented here will ascertain the environmental parameters required for sterilization of biomaterials with low concentrations of chlorine dioxide gas and assess polymers sterilized using these conditions for the cytotoxicity of possible <b>chemical</b> <b>residuals.</b> Investigations into preventing biomaterial-based infections in situ have focused on changing the biomaterial properties. Materials with altered physicochemical characteristics to prevent bacterial adhesion have been developed, and antibiotics and silver have been incorporated into the biomaterials to inhibit bacterial colonization. Unfortunately, the rapid depletion of incorporated antimicrobial agents, altered bactericidal activity in vivo, and the development of antibiotic resistance, have all limited the effectiveness of current technologies. In these studies a chlorine dioxide generating material was assessed using in vitro and in vivo assays. While assessing the bactericidal efficacy of a selection of chlorine dioxide generating materials, a spontaneous bacterial mutant with a reduced susceptibility to chlorine dioxide was isolated. The final section of this work will investigate a potential mechanism of resistance to chlorine dioxide...|$|E

In recent studies, irregularities {{have been reported}} in the Dutch energy statistics for the chemical industry. We studied in depth the company data that form the basis of the energy statistics in the Netherlands between 1995 and 2004 to find causes for these irregularities. We discovered that chemical products have occasionally been included, resulting in statistics with an inconsistent system boundary. Lack of guidance in the survey for the complex energy conversions in the chemical industry in the survey also resulted in large fluctuations for certain energy commodities.

We suggest to include <b>chemical</b> <b>residual</b> gas as energy commodity in the questionnaire and to include the energy conversions in the chemical industry in the international energy statistics.

40|$|We have {{developed}} expressions for the residual Helmholtz free {{energy and the}} <b>residual</b> <b>chemical</b> potential {{in terms of the}} correlation functions and bridge functions {{in the context of the}} interaction-site formalism for the Chandler-Silbey-Ladanyi equations.

The new expressions are similar in form to those for multicomponent simple fluid mixtures and are found to reduce to them in the extended-atom limit, where the bond lengths approach infinity. We have also found that the residual Helmholtz free energy satisfies a variational principle for a certain class of closure relations. This finding could facilitate the development of more efficient methods for solving the Chandler- Silbey-Ladanyi equations. We have also derived explicit expressions for the residual Helmholtz free energy, <b>residual</b> <b>chemical</b> potential, <b>residual</b> pressure, and residual internal energy in the hypernetted-chain approximation of the Chandler- Silbey-Ladanyi equations. It is noteworthy that the derived expressions depend solely on the correlation functions of the system at full coupling, thus making the computation of the various fluid properties simpler and more efficient by eliminating the need to perform a numerical integration over a coupling constant. We have also found that the residual Helmholtz free energy associated with the hypernetted-chain approximation of the Chandler-Silbey-Ladanyi equations satisfies a variational principle. Furthermore, in the extended-atom limit, all the derived expressions associated with the hypernetted-chain approximation of the Chandler- Silbey-Ladanyi equations reduce to those corresponding to the multicomponent simple fluid mixtures...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{structural}} and bulk thermodynamic properties of hydrocarbon (methane, ethane, and propane) -water systems as well as pure water using the site-site Omstein-Zemike (SSOZ) equation {{under a variety of}} different closure relations in order to compare the quantitative predictive Capabilities of the various closures. For the hydrocarbon-water systems, the simple point-charge (SPC) potential was used to model water, and the optimized potentials for liquid simulation (OPLS) were used to model the hydrocarbons. For pure water, predictions were also made for other water potential models. We solved the SSOZ equation with the hypemetted-chain (HNC) closure to determine the pair correlation functions of water. We then analyzed the structural and bulk thermodynamic properties of methane, ethane, and propane at infinite dilution in water using various closure relations for the hydrocarbonwater pair correlation functions. We find that the HNC closure, which is the closure that has been utilized almost exclusively to predict bulk thermodynamic properties of interaction-site fluids, performs rather poorly. Specifically, we find that the HNC closure consistently underpredicts the magnitudes of both the solute partial molar volume and the solute-solvent interaction energy, grossly overpredicts the magnitude of the <b>residual</b> <b>chemical</b> potential, and gives the incorrect sign of the enthalpy of solution. On the other hand, we find that two recently developed closures, the Martynov-Sarkisov (Mas) and Ballone-Pastore-Galli-Gazzillo (BEG) closures, which have not been utilized so far in conjunction with the SSOZ equation, yield reasonable predictions of the structural and bulk thermodynamic properties of the hydrocarbon-water systems studied. In particular, utilizing the SSOZ-BEG equation, the predicted temperature variation of the <b>residual</b> <b>chemical</b> potential over the relatively broad range 5 - 80 OC was found to be in very good agreement with the experimental data. Note that the <b>residual</b> <b>chemical</b> potential {{is directly related to the}} Henry's law constant, which, in tum, can be utilized to predict solubilities. In addition, we have developed an analytical expression for the <b>residual</b> <b>chemical</b> potential, appropriate for interaction-site fluids, in terms of pair and direct correlation functions at full coupling for the various closures examined in this paper. To date, an expression of this type was available only for the HNC closure. This new expression facilitates the calculation of the <b>residual</b> <b>chemical</b> potential by eliminating the previous need to perform a numerical integration over the coupling constant, thus making the computation of the chemical potential simpler and more efficient. Finally, we have also tested the accuracy of the equivalent-site approximation (ESA), a perturbation method which was developed by Curro and Schweizer to study long polymeric chains by treating all the sites in a given molecule as equivalent, on the predictions of the structural and bulk thermodynamic properties of propane at infinite dilution in water. Note that of all the n-alkanes, propane poses the most severe challenge to the ESA. Interestingly, we find that, already for propane, the ESA yields predictions of bulk thermodynamic properties which are within 5 % of those obtained using the rigorous calculations...|$|R
