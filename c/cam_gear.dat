50|$|The DOHC <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> {{train engine}} from the NC23 was later {{used in the}} NC29 and the CB400F CB-1, model number NC27, a naked bike that is {{credited}} with inspiring the popular 'Hornet' range. However the NC27 bears little mechanical resemblance to those machines and is probably the first true factory streetfighter.|$|E
5000|$|The shorter {{wheelbase}} {{became the}} standard, {{and the engine}} now incorporated a <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> driven [...] "mechanical oiler", and a kick-start. Prices were dropped initially, but due {{to the impact of}} World War I on supplies of material and the costs of production, they were increased by $30, with the standard model costing $295 and the two-speed $325.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{patent for}} a digital alarm clock was registered by D.E Protzmann {{and others on}} October 23, 1956, in the United States. Protzmann and his associates also patented another digital clock in 1970, which was said to use a minimal amount of moving parts. Two side-plates held digital numerals between them, while an electric motor and <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> outside controlled movement.|$|E

50|$|The {{gear drive}} for the {{camshafts}} {{was on the}} right of the motor, while the gear primary drive was on the left. The geared primary drive meant that the motor ran “backwards”. The <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> drive also drove a jackshaft {{at the rear of the}} cylinders, which drove an oil pump, a fuel pump, and (via a chain drive) a Lucas magneto. The four-speed gearbox output {{was on the right}}.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the Tech IV engine {{has proved}} to be a {{reliable}} workhorse for owners when not pushed to its limits. All 1978-1990 Iron Duke L-4's are outfitted with a micarta camshaft gear that meshes directly with a steel gear on the crankshaft (no timing chain), a design also used by the Chevrolet inline six. 1991-92 VIN R and U engines received a timing chain. The timing gear has a tendency to crumble a tooth anytime after 80,000 miles. The <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> simply shears a tooth at startup and the engine won't start; because of the non-interference design of the engine, no further damage occurs. When the <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> loses a tooth, the camshaft AND distributor stop rotating during engine cranking. Replacing the gear requires heating the new gear in hot oil and quickly installing it for a shrink(interference) fit on the cam stub. One upgrade is the use of the aluminum camshaft timing gear from a Chevrolet 250 inline six with the Iron Duke's crankshaft timing gear.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} 1JZ-GTE employs twin CT12A turbochargers arranged in parallel and blowing through a side-mount or front mount air-to-air intercooler. With an 8.5:1 static compression ratio, the factory quoted {{power and torque}} outputs are [...] at 6200 rpm and 363 Nm at 4800 rpm. The bore and stroke {{are the same as}} for the 1JZ-GE: 86 mm bore × 71.5 mm stroke. Yamaha may have had a hand in the development or production of these engines (possibly the head design), hence the Yamaha badging on certain parts of the engine, such as the <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> cover. In 1991, the 1JZ-GTE was slotted into the all-new Soarer GT.|$|E
5000|$|Ignition was {{supplied}} by a Bosch magneto directly driven from the <b>cam</b> <b>gears.</b> The high voltage current was then {{taken to a}} fixed electrode on the front bearing case, from which the sparks would jump to the spark plugs in the cylinder heads as they passed within 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) from it. According to Macomber's literature, it was [...] "guaranteed not to overheat".|$|R
5000|$|The Revetec engine [...] design {{consists}} of two counter-rotating [...] "trilobate" [...] (three lobed) <b>cams</b> <b>geared</b> together, so both cams contribute to forward motion. Two bearings run along the profile of both cams (four bearings in all) and stay {{in contact with the}} cams at all times. The bearings are mounted {{on the underside of the}} two inter-connected pistons, which maintain the desired clearance throughout the stroke.|$|R
25|$|Arbitrary {{functions}} of one variable {{were provided by}} <b>cams,</b> with <b>gearing</b> to convert follower movement to shaft rotation.|$|R
50|$|Given the {{successful}} operation of rotary cam poppet valve gear on the Class 19C, {{it was also}} used on the Class 16E. The valves were driven by outside rotary propshafts from turning mechanisms mounted on the driving coupled wheels. The valves were double-seated and housed {{at each end of}} the cylinders, an arrangement that resulted in short and straight ports between the valves and the cylinder barrels. The admission valves were 8 in in diameter and the exhaust valves 9 in. Most of the detail parts of the rotary <b>cam</b> <b>gear,</b> particularly the main drive and reversing gear, were interchangeable with similar parts on the Class 19C. The poppet valve gear gave the engine extremely free-running characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The CR-X {{equipped}} with the 1.6 DOHC engine (ZC engine) or the 1.6 DOHC VTEC engine (B16A) came with a different hood since the B16A and ZC engines were taller and required additional hood clearances {{in comparison to the}} 1.6 SOHC engines. The ZC engine was only slightly taller than the 1.6 SOHC engine and required additional hood clearance to clear the <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> cover. A CR-X {{equipped with}} the ZC engine had a hood with a bump on one side which offered the additional necessary clearance. Cars equipped with a B16A engine came with a hood that was raised across most of the engine bay to offer additional overall clearance for the taller engine.|$|E
50|$|The Toyota 3S-FE is a 16-valve 2.0 L twin camshaft, single <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> engine {{built by}} Toyota from 1986 to 2000. European version {{produces}} (126 hp) at 5,600 rpm and 179 Nm (132 ft-lbs) at 4,400 rpm. It {{is commonly used}} in the Camry 1987-1992 model, the Celica T160/T180/T200, Carina 1987-1992, Carina 1988-2001, Caldina 1992-2002, Carina ED 1990-1992 and E 1993-1998 models, Corona T170/T190 as well as Avensis 1997-2000 models and RAV4, 1994-2000 and Picnic/Ipsum 1996-2002. The 3S-FE was also used in some MR2 Mk2 cars due to its torque band being suitable for the automatic models. The 3S-FE is fitted with EFI. The 3S-FE engine is fitted with cast aluminum internals, whereas the 3S-GE/GELU engines have forged internals.|$|E
50|$|The ZSU-23-4 has an 1A7 SRP {{electro-mechanical}} fire solution calculator, weighing 180 kg, that occupies all of {{the space}} before the Commander. It contains 60 electric motors driving 110 axles over different potentiometers, shafts, rods, <b>cams,</b> <b>gears</b> and linkages to mechanically calculate ammunition flight time till impact, elevation lead angle, and azimuth lead angle using the target parameters received from the 1RL33 RPK-2 (gun dish) radar, and the correction angle received from the GAG (gyroscope) unit.|$|R

50|$|The 1998 Miata uses a {{modified}} BP, the BP-4W, which replaces the old Hall Effect dual Cam Angle Sensor unit mounted {{at the back}} of the exhaust cam with two separate Hall Effect units at the front - one on the intake <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> and one mounted on the oil pump, to the side of the crankshaft pulley. It also has an improved intake system (a better flowing cylinder head because of the angle of the intake ports being changed). There was also a switch from the earlier problematic hydraulic lifters to solid lifters. The United States 2004-2005 Mazdaspeed MX-5 turbo is based on this engine rather than the newer BP-Z3 and produces 178 hp (133 kW) and 166 lb·ft (225 N·m) with slightly reduced compression. The Mazdaspeed turbo engine has no VICS, but does have VTCS which is often mistaken to be related to VICS.|$|E
5000|$|Honda's {{advanced}} VTEC technology departs {{greatly from}} its previous incarnations by no longer relying on switching between {{two sets of}} lobes on a given camshaft. It instead uses a single cam lobe per valve, and two rocker arms per valve whereby the second rocker arm has a movable pivot point, there by provide the varying cam lift. Advanced VTEC motors still use the now standard oil pressure controlled variable <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> angle mechanism. With these two technologies combined Honda has developed an infinitely variable valve timing and lift system ("VVTL"). Previous versions of VTEC included only staged VVTL i.e. High-Low. With the introduction of i-VTEC the systems gained infinitely variable valve timing but still only staged lift i.e. High-Low. The [...] "infinitely variable" [...] portion of the A-VTEC {{is what makes it}} stand out as a serious evolutionary step in the world of VTEC.|$|E

2500|$|The Cosworth Vega Twin-Cam {{engine is}} a [...] {{inline-four}} with die-cast aluminum alloy cylinder block and Type 356 aluminum alloy, 16-valve cylinder head with double overhead camshafts (DOHC) {{held in a}} removable cam-carrier {{that doubles as a}} guide for the valve lifters. Each camshaft has five bearings and is turned by individual <b>cam</b> <b>gears</b> on the front end. The camshafts, water pump and fan are driven by a fiberglass cord-reinforced neoprene rubber belt, much like the Vega [...] engine. The cylinder head has sintered iron valve seats and iron cast valve seats. Race-bred forged aluminum pistons with heat-treated forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods enhance durability.|$|R

40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a door closer which has a closing spring for automatically closing the door. When the door is opened manually, the closing spring is compressed. An opening resistance is thus produced. The door is then closed automatically through {{the action of the}} closing spring. To obtain greater operating convenience, the invention strives to achieve as low an opening resistance in the door closer as possible when the door is opened manually, but nevertheless closing the door reliably during the closing process. This problem is solved {{by the fact that the}} characteristic of the torque acting on the leaf and depending on the rotary angle of the leaf is different for opening than for closing as a result of the interaction of the sliding spring with a control curve which has separate curve sections for opening and closing. This is achieved by a gear wheel in the form of a <b>cam</b> <b>gear</b> interacting with the closing spring with one opening cam and one closing cam. The separate control curve section for opening is on the opening cam and the separate control curve section for closing is on the closing cam. Between the closing spring and the opening and closing cams there is a pressure piece controlled by a switching spring...|$|E
50|$|Motors that {{directly}} produce linear motion are called linear motors. The advantage of linear motors {{is that they}} can produce linear motion without the need of a transmission system, such as ballscrewsleadscrew, rack-and-pinion, <b>cam,</b> <b>gears</b> or belts, that would be necessary for rotary motors. Transmission systems are known to introduce less responsiveness and reduced accuracy. Direct drive, brushless DC linear motors consist of a slotted stator with magnetic teeth and a moving actuator, which has permanent magnets and coil windings. To obtain linear motion, a motor controller excites the coil windings in the actuator causing an interaction of the magnetic fields resulting in linear motion. Tubular linear motors are another form of linear motor design operated in a similar way.|$|R
