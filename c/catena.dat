The commentary is a <b>catena</b> of quotations of nine church fathers: Origen, Eusebius, Titus of Bostra, Basil, Isidore of Pelusium, Cyril of Alexandria, Sever from Antioch, Victor from Antioch, and Chrysostom. The commentary surrounds the single-column text of Luke on three sides. Patristic text is written in small uncial letters. Most of the quotations are those of Ciril of Alexandria (93 scholia); next comes Titus of Bostra (45 scholia). The commentary was written in a different kind of uncial script than the biblical text.|$|E

25|$|Several {{prominent}} impact craters and catenae {{are located}} within Valhalla structure. At the northern margin of it Gomul <b>Catena</b> {{can be found}} as well as Egdir and Mimir craters. The <b>catena</b> consists of a linear sequence of impact craters and probably resulted from a break-up of a comet (like comet Shoemaker-Levy 9). To the south of Valhalla there are Sarakka and Nar impact craters; {{to the east of}} it (at the boundary between the inner and outer trough zones) are Sculd crater and Svol <b>Catena.</b> To the west of Valhalla another large multi-ring basinAsgard—can be found. The central parts of Valhalla are less cratered than the old plain outside the structure. This indicates that Valhalla is significantly younger than Callisto itself.|$|E
40|$|Soil <b>catenas</b> {{integrate}} and amplify gravity {{transfer and}} differentiation processes of eluviation and illuviation in soil profiles. We quantified differences in these redistribution processes along granitic <b>catenas</b> across an arid to sub-humid climate gradient in Kruger National Park, South Africa. We measured soil properties in nine <b>catenas</b> sampled from three areas receiving annual rainfall of 470 mm (arid zone), 550 mm (semi-arid zone) and 730 mm (sub-humid zone). As rainfall increased, kaolinite replaced smectite {{as the dominant}} clay mineral in all landscape positions across the <b>catenas.</b> Toeslopes showed the strongest evidence of this transition with an excess of smectite in the arid <b>catenas</b> but complete prevalence of kaolinite in toeslopes of sub-humid <b>catenas.</b> The concentration and distribution of clay along the <b>catenas</b> were dependent on landscape position as well - soil profiles at and near the crests were clay depleted (as low as 1 %) while those at the toeslopes had much more clay (up to 60 %). Clay redistribution along <b>catenas</b> was sensitive to climate with {{the least amount of}} redistribution occurring in the dry sites and the most occurring in the wet sites. As a consequence, the sub-humid <b>catenas</b> had clay accumulation only in {{a small part of the}} toeslopes while the bulk of their length was represented by highly leached soils. In contrast, arid zone <b>catenas</b> showed little clay redistribution and semi-arid sites displayed the greatest within-catena clay redistribution and preservation. Clay movement and storage conditioned other soil properties such as CEC, base cation distribution, base saturation and pH. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Techniques that compare short text {{segments}} using dependency paths (or simply, paths) {{appear in}} a wide range of automated language processing applications including question answering (QA). However, few models in ad hoc information retrieval (IR) use paths for document ranking due to the prohibitive cost of parsing a retrieval collection. In this paper, we introduce a flexible notion of paths that describe chains of words on a dependency path. These chains, or <b>catenae,</b> are readily applied in standard IR models. Informative <b>catenae</b> are selected using supervised machine learning with linguistically informed features and compared to both non-linguistic terms and <b>catenae</b> selected heuristically with filters derived from work on paths. Automatically selected <b>catenae</b> of 1 - 2 words deliver significant performance gains on three TREC collections. ...|$|R
