2500|$|Vanderbilt {{was born}} on February 20, 1924, in Manhattan, New York City, {{the only child of}} {{railroad}} heir Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt (1880–1925) and his second wife, Gloria Morgan (1904–1965). When Gloria was born, her father was heard to exclaim in delight, [...] "It is fantastic how Vanderbilt she looks! See the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> how they turn up?" [...] She was baptized in the Episcopal church by Bishop Herbert Shipman as Gloria Laura Vanderbilt. After her father's death, she was confirmed and raised in the Catholic Church, to which her mother belonged. From her father's first marriage, to Cathleen Neilson, she had a half-sister, Cathleen Vanderbilt (1904–1944).|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} head and looked at me. She had a trick of {{contracting}} the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> just a little, which was absolutely bewitching.|$|E
60|$|I looked. Hendrika was {{tramping}} {{along with}} the child {{in her arms and}} staring at me in a most sinister fashion out of the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dora watched <b>her</b> out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> {{as a cat}} {{watches a}} mouse.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Riddel {{gave her}} head a toss, and {{regarded}} {{him from the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Aunt Philippa {{looked at}} me out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> and disdained any {{skirmish}} of flippant epigram.|$|R
60|$|When {{the door}} had shut behind them Madame looked at Juliette, who with her new watch held to her ear, {{observed}} {{her out of the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{poor house}} is for pilgrims and merchants, not for famous knights; yet, sirs, I {{welcome you to}} it," [...] she said presently, {{scanning}} {{them out of the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|And he {{laid his}} large, yet well-shapen workman's hand {{on the top of}} the stove, that was {{polished}} black and smooth as velvet. She would not look at him, yet she glanced out of the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Were those women--Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond--good to you?" [...] asked Marilla, {{looking at}} Anne out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{watched him}} as {{he walked down the}} garden, and then sighed deeply, wiping away a tear from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Effie {{shut her}} book over her hand. [...] "It keeps me wakeful longer," [...] she whispered, {{with a glance}} at her mother from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
60|$|The very faintest of smiles parted her lips, a {{smile that}} {{wrinkled}} at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and suddenly altered her appearance so that Deane was forced to recognize the charm which even to himself he had denied.|$|E
60|$|Here {{and there}} stalwart, quiet policemen {{requested}} loiterers to move on, and the loiterers obeyed and re-formed in groups behind them; {{here and there}} a respectable woman pushed her way through the throng, gathering up her skirts as she did so and glancing covertly at this unaccustomed company out of the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come on, Liza, don't tike on; I didn't mean no offence.' And {{he put his}} arm {{round her}} waist and led her to take their places at the gallery door. Two tears escaped from the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and ran down her nose, but she felt very {{relieved}} and happy, and let him lead her where he would.|$|E
60|$|Now Dickory's {{face was}} like the sky before a shower. His mother saw it out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> but the others {{did not look at}} him.|$|R
60|$|Miss Truefitt {{appeared}} to tremble, and made {{as though to}} rise. Then she sat still and took a gentle peep at Mr. Catesby from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir!" [...] she simpered. And then, {{bursting}} into naturalness, and glancing from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> [...] "'Tis {{the funniest thing}} under the sun! And it costs money." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{swore that}} she was. And indeed {{her cheeks were}} ruddy with outdoors, the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> relaxed. But she was so stiff that they had hobbled a mile, and Father had shucked several tons of corn in return for breakfast, before she ceased feeling as though her legs were made of {{extraordinarily}} brittle glass.|$|E
60|$|Miss Deringham {{understood}} him, {{and reflected}} as {{she glanced at}} {{him out of the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> that her father would do well if he dealt openly with this man. She fancied he could be remorseless in a reckoning, and she had now and then of late had unpleasant suspicions respecting Deringham's intentions concerning him.|$|E
60|$|What {{would people}} do if this {{convenient}} shelter of duty did not afford them a retreat {{in cases when}} they are disposed to change their minds? Susan suppressed the arch smile that, in spite of herself, laughed out at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and told her sister that she was much obliged to her for her care. So off they went together.|$|E
60|$|When Miss Ophelia {{entered the}} kitchen Dinah did not rise, but smoked on in sublime tranquillity, {{regarding}} her movements obliquely out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> but apparently intent {{only on the}} operations around her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you've {{had your}} own way now," [...] she sighed, looking at him out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "I suppose you always get {{your own way}} in the end, don't you, Mr. Fischer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{pointed to}} the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about, {{examining}} me {{every now and then}} with the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> Turning to me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|While he was {{speaking}} Queen Cor had been studying the boy's face stealthily, from the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and she said to herself: [...] "He is so small and innocent that I believe I can capture him alone, and with ease. He does not seem very terrible and I suspect that King Gos and his warriors were frightened at nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus spoke Godfrey, {{drawing up}} his tall, slim young form {{to its full}} height, his dark eyes flashing, his fine face alight with righteous rage. Isobel, who was {{standing}} quite still and smiling a little, rather contemptuously, looked at {{him out of the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and thought that anger became him well. Never before had he seemed so handsome to her approving judgment.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ow dirty I am, bein' {{around the}} w'y I 'ave," [...] the woman said, {{as she sat}} down in a coffee-house, wiping the sleep and grime from the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "An' the sights I 'ave seen this d'y, an' I enjoyed it, though it was lonesome by myself. An' the duchesses an' the lydies 'ad sich gran' w'ite dresses. They was jest bu'ful, bu'ful." ...|$|E
60|$|Matthew had sheepishly {{unfolded}} {{the dress}} from its paper swathings {{and held it}} out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be contemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> with a rather interested air.|$|R
60|$|Miss Shott {{was passing}} {{on the other side}} of the street, and she was walking rapidly, but she could see more out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> than most people could see when they were looking {{straight}} before them at the same things.|$|R
6000|$|As he {{said this}} he looked across to Mary Lowther, who no doubt was {{watching}} every turn of his face from the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "I've just been and knocked under, {{and told him that}} the old place shall be put to rights." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's HER doin', then," [...] {{returned}} Arthur, with a laugh. [...] "She's always lookin' {{round the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{at me when}} she passes. Why, John Rogers was joking me about her only yesterday, and said McGee would blow a hole through me some of these days if I didn't look out! Of course," [...] he added, affectedly curling his moustache, [...] "that's nonsense! But {{you know how they}} talk, and she's too pretty for that fellow McGee." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} start or twitch, as if dazed. Then {{she looked up}} at her husband with a queer smile, {{puckering}} the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> He looked at the cigarettes, not at her. His face had the blunt voluptuous gravity of a young lion, a great cat. She kept him standing for some moments impassively. Then suddenly she hung her long, delicate fingers over the box, in doubt, and spasmodically jabbed at the cigarettes, clumsily raking one out at last.|$|E
60|$|Lord Martindale {{met them}} with his grave kind welcome, which awed even Helen into quiet and decorum, though perhaps, from the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> she was spying the Scagliola columns as places for hide-and-seek. She opened them to their roundest extent as her grandmamma came down-stairs, {{and she tried to}} take shelter behind her brother from the ceremonious kiss, while Johnnie tightly {{squeezed}} his aunt's hand, and Lady Martindale was quite as much afraid of them as they could be of her.|$|E
60|$|I runs my {{arm around}} her neck and raises her head, gentle, and breaks the bag of {{flaxseed}} with the other hand; and as easy as I could I bends over and slips three or four of the seeds in the outer <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Know? Yes, or {{she could}} hardly make such a brother of the Colonel. In fact, I {{think it is a}} bit of treachery to us all to keep such an affair concealed, don't you?" [...] with a vivid flash out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She {{gave me an}} odd glance out <b>of</b> the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "The queer thing is," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "what I wanted to say was {{something}} quite, quite different. To give you a friendly word of warning, entirely on your own account.... You have a rival, Midgetina." ...|$|R
