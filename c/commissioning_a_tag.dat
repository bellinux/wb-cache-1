5000|$|After the WWF/WWE {{name change}} in 2002, the {{championship}} was subsequently {{referred to as}} the [...] "World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Tag Team Championship". Then, during a period of open free agency after the brand extension, the WWE Tag Team Champions were signed to appear and defend the title on the Raw brand only, leaving the SmackDown! brand without <b>a</b> <b>tag</b> team title. <b>As</b> a result, SmackDown! General Manager, Stephanie McMahon, <b>commissioned</b> <b>a</b> new WWE <b>Tag</b> Team Championship to be the exclusive tag team titles for the SmackDown! brand. With the introduction of the World Heavyweight Championship on the Raw brand after the WWE Championship was moved to the SmackDown! brand, the WWE Tag Team Championship on Raw was now being {{referred to as the}} [...] "World Tag Team Championship". This was done so that the names of both tag team titles would mirror the names of the top championships on their respective brands. When the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship switched brands during the 2005 WWE draft lottery, however, neither of the tag team titles was renamed.|$|R

Localization with multiple reference points requires that distances between reference points in the sensory network be known in order to precisely locate <b>a</b> <b>tag,</b> and the determination of distances is called ranging.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the integration of}} an acoustic tracking system within an autonomous underwater AUV (AUV) to enable real-time tracking of sharks tagged with artificial acoustic sources. The tracking system consists of two hydrophones and a receiver unit that outputs a measurement of the relative angle to the tagged shark. Since only two hydrophones are used, {{the sign of the}} relative angle measurement is unknown. To overcome this ambiguity, a particle filter algorithm was developed to estimate the position of the acoustic source. When combined with an active control system that drives vehicle to obtain different orientations with respect to the acoustic source, real-time autonomous localization, tracking, and following of <b>a</b> <b>tagged</b> shark is shown to be possible. Four types of ocean experiments were used to validate the system including: 1) AUV tracking of <b>a</b> stationary <b>tag,</b> 2) AUV tracking of <b>a</b> <b>tagged</b> kayak, 3) AUV tracking of <b>a</b> <b>tagged</b> AUV, and 4) AUV tracking of <b>a</b> <b>tagged</b> shark. These experiments were analyzed with respect to the localization error, associated error variance, and distance between the AUV and the tag. The final shark tracking experiments took place in SeaPlane Lagoon, Los Angeles, CA, where the AUV was able to autonomously track and follow <b>a</b> <b>tagged</b> Leopard Shark for several hours...|$|R
