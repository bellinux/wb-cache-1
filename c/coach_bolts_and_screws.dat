50|$|A screw {{is a type}} of fastener, {{sometimes}} {{similar to}} a bolt (see Differentiation between <b>bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>screw</b> below), typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a male thread (external thread) or just thread.|$|R
5000|$|In 1864, William Sellers, the {{president}} of Franklin Institute, presented a standard for nuts, <b>bolts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws.</b> Out of this effort came the first United States Standard threads, including pipe threads. (See also Screw thread § History of standardization.) ...|$|R
30|$|Suppliers of <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> often give only {{parameter}} {{windows for}} the desired coefficients of friction.

Furthermore, no information about the distribution functions of the coefficients of friction is provided.|$|R
50|$|Woodie wagons {{required}} constant maintenance: {{bodies were}} finished in varnishes that required recoating; <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> required periodic tightening as wood expanded and contracted through the seasons.

50|$|The {{stress and}} shear in a rivet is {{analyzed}} like a bolted joint. However, {{it is not}} wise to combine rivets with <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> in the same joint. Rivets fill the hole where they are installed to establish a very tight fit (often called interference fit). It is difficult or impossible to obtain such a tight fit with other fasteners. The result is that rivets in the same joint with loose fasteners carry more of the load—they are effectively more stiff. The rivet can then fail before it can redistribute load to the other loose fit fasteners like <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws.</b> This often causes catastrophic failure of the joint when the fasteners unzip. In general, a joint composed of similar fasteners is the most efficient because all fasteners reach capacity simultaneously.|$|R

5000|$|The Nails <b>and</b> <b>Bolts</b> Plant (Uzina e Gozhdë-Bulonave) {{was inaugurated}} on November 28, 1963.

50|$|Because {{there is}} {{effectively}} a head on {{each end of}} an installed rivet, it can support tension loads (loads parallel to the axis of the shaft); however, {{it is much more}} capable of supporting shear loads (loads perpendicular to the axis of the shaft). <b>Bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> are better suited for tension applications.|$|R

50|$|The {{remains of}} a {{reservoir}} are located immediately to the northeast the overseer's quarters. Remains include a rectangular concrete pad with metal framing. Artefacts include piping, <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws.</b> A substantial section of hill face has been cut to create a level platform with a sloping concrete retaining wall measuring over two metres high in the highest corner.

50|$|The {{original}} factory at {{one time}} was {{the largest in the}} world, consisting of 24 separate buildings contributing to the manufacturing process, until 1928 when the Ford River Rouge Plant was completed and began operations. In the beginning, all components were manufactured in one location, to include wheel bearings, nuts, <b>bolts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws,</b> to transmissions, suspension components, wheels and interior components. Operations were carried out in this fashion well into the 1940s and beyond.|$|R
50|$|The {{family moved}} to a working-class {{neighborhood}} {{on the south side}} of Chicago, living there until 1956. Spanier’s father worked in a nuts, <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> warehouse loading <b>and</b> unloading trucks; his mother worked in a clerical position. The {{family moved to}} the suburb of Highland Park, where Spanier graduated from Highland Park High School in 1966. His father became postmaster of Highland Park in 1962 and retired from that position in 1975.|$|R
5000|$|Another common {{inspection}} {{point is the}} straightness of a bolt or screw. This topic comes up often when there are assembly issues with predrilled holes as the first troubleshooting point is {{to determine if the}} fastener or the hole is at fault. ASME B18.2.9 [...] "Straightness Gage <b>and</b> Gaging for <b>Bolts</b> <b>and</b> Screws" [...] was developed to address this issue. Per the scope of the standard, it describes the gage and procedure for checking <b>bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>screw</b> straightness at maximum material condition (MMC) and provides default limits when not stated in the applicable product standard.|$|R
30|$|Bolted joints {{are among}} the most used joints in {{mechanical}} engineering. But failures still occur during the tightening process and in operation. In order to improve the quality <b>and</b> reliability of <b>bolted</b> joints, a main goal is to achieve a proper clamping force. With a certain effort [1], it is possible to measure the clamping force directly. But most of the <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> still are assembled by an indirect measurement of the clamping force [2].|$|R
50|$|Like the kayak, the {{traditional}} umiak {{was made from}} a driftwood or whalebone frame pegged and lashed together, sometimes with antlers or ivory, over which walrus or Bearded seal skins are stretched. Oil, usually from seals, {{would be used to}} coat and waterproof the seams. A large umiak, 30 ft, would require about seven skins which would be sewn together, stretched over the frame and allowed to dry. Modern versions are essentially identical with the exception of using metal <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{secondary}} {{problem with}} either the 3.5L (though true {{for any of the}} OM60x family diesels) is lack of maintenance of the motor mounts, which results in hard engine vibration from the engine resting on the frame members. Especially in the OM603, the vibration helps loosen one of the myriad of small screws in the crankcase which primarily hold on the windage tray. If these small <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> find their way into the oil pump or passages, the resulting oil starvation can cause bearing failure, and subsequent broken or thrown rods—often cracking the block. Proper motor mount maintenance eliminates these issues.|$|R
50|$|Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval, a French {{artillery}} engineer, {{introduced the}} standardization of cannon {{design in the}} mid-18th century. He developed a 6 in field howitzer whose gun barrel, carriage assembly and ammunition specifications were made uniform for all French cannons. The standardized interchangeable parts of these cannons down to the nuts, <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> made their mass production and repair much easier. Another major change at this time was {{the development of a}} flintlock firing mechanism for the cannons to replace the old method of igniting powder in the cannon touchhole. The flintlock was a far more reliable (and safe) mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} a second {{reservoir}} and two water storage tanks are located on steep, rocky ground above the single men's quarters and supply centre and east of the overseer's quarters. The reservoir consists of a rectangular concrete pad with collapsed metal framing on site. Artefacts include <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws.</b> Pipes are visible along the exposed corner of the concrete pad. The hill face has been cut to create a level platform. Features in this area include the {{remains of a}} track and tramway leading up the hill, two large water storage tanks (south-west of reservoir 2) and a stone-lined path leading down the hill away from the two storage tanks.|$|R
5000|$|One major {{challenge}} was pulling {{all of the}} Wright R-3350-23 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines out of already completed B-29s and modifying them to R-3350-23A [...] "war engine" [...] standard. This entailed disassembling and rebuilding the engines with added baffles to accelerate the airflow over the cylinders, new exhaust valves with improved metallurgy, new rocker arms (drilled with small holes, to allow better oil flow, rather than solid) and modified nose casings and engine sumps, again to improve oil flow. In sub-zero temperatures the work was arduous, especially {{when it came to}} struggling with stiff and brittle fuel and oil lines <b>and</b> hard-to-reach clamps, <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R

50|$|Cost based pricing {{is still}} a useful method for {{specific}} categories of service parts. Low volume parts sold once in a product-lifetime have little effect on profitability but do need a price in the market. Such parts can be priced using the cost based approach with slight markups {{on the cost of}} the parts. Other examples are standard parts such as <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> that must be priced. These can also be priced simply using cost based approach. A useful case for cost based pricing is that of high-warranty parts. Since these parts do not generate revenue for the company, it makes sense to keep them as close to the actual cost as possible.|$|R
