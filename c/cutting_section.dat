30|$|The effect {{exerted by}} the {{processing}} rate {{may be explained}} as follows. When drilling polymer composite materials, elastic deformations do not localize in a narrow cutting zone but spread to the material around the drilled hole. Around the holes on {{the entire length of}} the <b>cutting</b> <b>section</b> of the tool, i.e. the entire height of the work piece, elastic compressive stresses emerge. After passing of the <b>cutting</b> <b>section</b> of the tool through the work piece, the forces causing these stresses release, and the material elastically deforms in the opposite direction by reducing the diameter of the drilled hole. The higher the cutting speed is, the more the holes will shrink. And vice versa, the lower the cutting speed is, the more time the cutting tool is in contact with the inner surface of the hole and, therefore, the smaller is the shrinkage. That is, if the polymer composite material “gets used”, the shrinkage does not occur, if the material lacks time to “get used” to the tool, the shrinkage emerges.|$|E
