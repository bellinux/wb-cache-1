50|$|Acquired by the U.S. Navy on 2 April 1953, she was {{designated}} YAG-39 the following month. She was then fitted out with numerous scientific instruments, including nuclear detection and measurement devices, which {{enabled her to}} conduct contamination and fallout measurement tests after nuclear explosions.

50|$|The main {{generator}} was a 1080 kW 650V 1660A continuous rated self ventilated machine {{directly connected to}} the engines crankshaft and supported by {{an extension of the}} diesel engines bedplate. The generator used two separately excited field windings whilst generating, using a series winding for battery powered (60 cell, 236 Ahr, D.P. Kathanode) motor starting. An auxiliary generator end connected to the {{main generator}} rated at 50 kW, 135V 375A supplied control equipment, compressors, motor cooling blowers, lighting, as well as providing the excitation for the main generator. Both generators projected from the engine room into a separate dust filtered <b>control</b> equipment <b>cubicle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Olympic Fencing Hall {{was built}} between November 13, 1967, and September, 1968, in the Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City. The 310-by-210-foot {{rectangular}} structure {{is covered by}} a convex roof of corrugated asbestos supported by steel cables. The ground floor had 15 fencing strips—each of which was provided with a two-sided scoreboard, a judges' podium and a <b>control</b> table—and 37 <b>cubicles</b> for competitors. On the south side were facilities for the press, dressing rooms, etc. The north side housed offices, a lounge, awarm-up area and additional dressing rooms and service areas. On the upper floor were grandstands with a seating capacity of 3,000.|$|R

50|$|When Halibut reached Midway on 11 May, it {{was decided}} to leave the injured man aboard and carry on to Pearl Harbor, which she reached on 15 May 1944. Again {{it was decided}} to leave the injured man aboard rather than risk moving him, and the {{submarine}} was refueled and restored before heading on to a major overhaul at the ship repair basin of Bethlehem Steel at Sixteenth Street in south San Francisco, California, with ninety days rest for the crew. She reached that port on 24 May and finally, after twenty-one days in his bunk, the injured man was transferred to a land hospital - Oak Knoll Naval Hospital. During her major overhaul, Halibut had some small changes. An automatic plotting table was added; the main electric power <b>control</b> <b>cubicle</b> was given shock-mountings; there was a new, more powerful, trim pump; another passive sonar set; and the 20 mm deck gun was replaced with a 40 mm rapid-fire gun. After testing, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 September 1944, where Galantin received a promotion to commander.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a two-channel digital control {{system for the}} hydraulic stand MZPK 100 designed for fatigue tests of cruciform specimens under biaxial tension-compression. In the past, the fatigue test stand MZPK 100 was provided with unreliable analog <b>control</b> power <b>cubicles.</b> Application of the computer with an analog and digital input-output signal path board, Matlab/Simulink software and a new control box equipped with the necessary electronic subassemblies (responsible for proper switching of the hydraulic supplier, command electrovalves, conditioning of signals from sensors and so on) enables replacement of the old analog system by a new two-channel digital control system. Nowadays, {{it is easy to}} modify the control system to different requirements of material tests because the hardware (electronic) solutions have been simplified, and the software has a friendly Simulink interface. Such an approach allows for the implementation of different control algorithms, e. g. PID, adaptive, and fuzzy logic etc. Moreover, this paper {{presents a}} description of how to keep the center of the specimen static under a controlled force that is being applied by four independent actuators...|$|R
30|$|At the Swanbank Power Station, a {{major fire}} in an ash plant <b>control</b> <b>cubicle</b> in 1995 caused {{extensive}} damage and downtime when the cabinet was completely burned out. As a result, VESDA smoke detection systems were installed in all equipment control cubicles. In 1996, another fire occurred, but was quickly detected and extinguished by control room operators. Only three cable terminals and one wire were burned, with minimal disruption (Anderson, 1996).|$|E
40|$|Very fast {{transient}} overvoltages (VFTOs) {{and the associated}} very {{fast transient}} currents (VFTCs) generated during switching operations in a gas-insulated substation (GIS) radiate electromagnetic (EM) fields, which in turn can leak into the external environment through apertures like $SF_ 6 $ gas-to-air bushing. Therefore, it becomes necessary to characterize and quantify the EM fields when sensitive control devices are used for the operation of such substations. Keeping this in view, a numerical model using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique was developed to compute the transient field emission from a 245 -kV-rated gasto- air bushing. Shielding effectiveness (SE) of the bushing for these transient fields was evaluated using a derivative Gaussian current excitation of the high-tension (HT) conductor. The variation in EM field levels along the axis of bushing at various radial distances for different frequencies of the transient current were analyzed. The enhancement of the field levels due {{to the presence of}} a metallic structure on the ground plane, which simulates the <b>control</b> <b>cubicle</b> or the grounded enclosures of the GIS, were studied. Finally, the emission levels from different bushing models were calculated for the VFTC generated during a switching event, and the dominant frequencies were identified...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{condition}} monitoring is to recognise {{the development of}} evolving motor faults at an early stage, so that the motor can be scheduled for repair or replacement before catastrophic failure occurs. Often in a modem industrial plant, {{the cost of an}} unscheduled shutdown of the process is very much greater than the cost of the motor itself. This thesis concentrates on the detection of stator and rotor defects in squirrel cage induction motors. Very little work has been done on the detection of these faults when the motor is supplied at variable frequency. Hardware and software approaches have previously been attempted but with limited success. An alternative method put forward here is to compute the instantaneous input power of the motor from the two line-to-line voltages and two line currents. In order to do this, specialised hardware has been developed, including a study of the suitability of different types of current transducers. The effects of open circuit and short circuit armature coils, and poor commutation of DC motors have been examined. Because the conventional current transformer cannot be used for DC, and the electrical noise inside the <b>control</b> <b>cubicle</b> of a thyristor-controlled DC motor prevents successful operation of a Hall Effect clip-on ammeter, an air core clip-on "Rogowski" coil was designed to monitor fault-related frequencies in armature and field current. In order to study the effect of open-circuit or short-circuit coil, steady-state models for the DC motor were developed using inductively coupled coils theory. Individual field and armature coils can be modelled, and the effect of faulty armature coils on the amplitude of frequency components that are introduced into armature and field current, can be predicted. To summarise, the main achievements described in this thesis are as follows: Voltage, current, and power monitoring of the induction motor • Design of fully shielded, linear phase shift, clip-on current transducer for power monitoring (It was initially designed by Mr Langman and modified by the author). • Design of a voltage and current monitoring hardware system for induction motors with assistance from the technical support group in the Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Tasmania. • Theory and implementation of using input motor power for the overall check of induction motors. • Use of spectrum analysis of current or power signal to attempt to detect bearing faults. • Use of the instantaneous input power signal to detect stator and rotor defect of the motor with variable frequency supply. Current monitoring of the DC motor • Frequency spectrum analysis of armature and field current waveforms of DC motors. • Investigation of the effect of incorrect interpole strength, open-circuit and shortcircuit armature coils on the armature and field currents. • Numerical modelling of DC motor with open-circuit armature coil for steadystate conditions. • Numerical modelling of DC motor with short-circuit armature coil for steadystate conditions...|$|E
