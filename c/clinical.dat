5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are <b>clinical</b> staging and surgical staging. <b>Clinical</b> staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It {{is based on}} the results of imaging studies (such as CT scans and PET scans) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during or after the operation and {{is based on the}} combined results of surgical and <b>clinical</b> findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.|$|E

25|$|<b>Clinical</b> {{psychology}} is an integration of science, theory and <b>clinical</b> knowledge {{for the purpose}} of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development.

In many countries, <b>clinical</b> {{psychology is}} a regulated mental health profession.|$|E

25|$|<b>Clinical</b> {{laboratory}} sciences are the <b>clinical</b> {{diagnostic services}} that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis {{and management of}} patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree, who actually perform the tests, assays, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include transfusion medicine, cellular pathology, <b>clinical</b> chemistry, hematology, <b>clinical</b> microbiology and <b>clinical</b> immunology.|$|E
25|$|In France, Pathology is {{separate}} in two distinct specialties, anatomical pathology and <b>clinical</b> pathology. Residencies for both lasts four years. Residency in anatomical pathology {{is open to}} physicians only, while <b>clinical</b> pathology is open to both physicians and pharmacists. At {{the end of the}} second year of <b>clinical</b> pathology residency, residents can choose between general <b>clinical</b> pathology and a specialization in one of the disciplines, but they can not practice anatomical pathology, nor can anatomical pathology residents practice <b>clinical</b> pathology.|$|E

25|$|Today, in the U.S., {{about half}} of {{licensed}} psychologists are trained in the Scientist-Practitioner Model of <b>Clinical</b> Psychology (PhD)—a model that emphasizes both research and <b>clinical</b> practice and is usually housed in universities. The other half are being trained within a Practitioner-Scholar Model of <b>Clinical</b> Psychology (PsyD), which focuses on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law). A third training model called the <b>Clinical</b> Scientist Model emphasizes training in <b>clinical</b> psychology research. Outside of coursework, graduates of both programs generally are required to have had 2 to 3 years of supervised <b>clinical</b> experience, {{a certain amount of}} personal psychotherapy, and the completion of a dissertation (PhD programs usually require original quantitative empirical research, whereas the PsyD equivalent of dissertation research often consists of literature review and qualitative research, theoretical scholarship, program evaluation or development, critical literature analysis, or <b>clinical</b> application and analysis).|$|E

In Sri Lanka, until recently there were few companion animals; veterinary education focused on herd health, with little attention to <b>clinical</b> skills. In Ethiopia few schools have <b>clinical</b> training facilities, {{and the government has}} prioritized opening more schools over improving existing colleges.

They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clinical</b> psychologists {{engage in}} a wide range of activities. Some focus solely on {{research}} into the assessment, treatment, or cause of mental illness and related conditions. Some teach, whether in a medical school or hospital setting, or in an academic department (e.g., psychology department) at an institution of higher education. The majority of <b>clinical</b> psychologists engage in some form of <b>clinical</b> practice, with professional services including psychological assessment, provision of psychotherapy, development and administration of <b>clinical</b> programs, and forensics (e.g., providing expert testimony in a legal proceeding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clinical</b> {{psychology}} is a diverse field {{and there have}} been recurring tensions over the degree to which <b>clinical</b> practice should be limited to treatments supported by empirical research.
