50|$|The ores {{are treated}} by a sulfatizing roast in a {{fluidized}} bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble oxides and iron into insoluble hematite. The calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte. Oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step {{to maintain the}} acid balance in the circuit. Iron and aluminum are removed from the leach solution {{by the addition of}} lime, and copper is electrowon on copper cathodes. A part of the spent electrolyte enters the cobalt recovery circuit and is purified by the removal of iron, copper, nickel, and zinc prior to the precipitation of cobalt as its hydroxide. This is accomplished by the addition of more lime to raise the pH until the remaining copper precipitates. This copper is sent back to the copper circuit. As more lime is then added, a copper-cobaltite precipitates and is fed back to the leaching process. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is added (along with some metallic cobalt as a catalyst) to precipitate nickel sulfide (NiS).

40|$|Graphene, as a {{recently}} discovered carbon allotrope, possesses with it many outstanding properties ranging from high electrical conductivity to great mechanical strength. Single layer graphene {{can be prepared}} by mechanical cleavage of graphite or by a more sophisticated method, CVD. However, the scale-up process for these preparation techniques is still unconvincing. Solution-processed graphene from exfoliation of graphite oxide {{on the other hand}} provides an alternative prospect resulting in the formation of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), which can be readily manipulated to tailor-suit various application demands. The main aim of the thesis is to explore the possibility and availability of this versatile method to produce graphene nanoplatelet and its composites with good all-round performance in energy and bioanalytical applications. A range of physical and chemical characterisation techniques were utilised including SEM, TEM, AFM, XPS, XRD, DLS, FTIR, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopy in order to investigate the structural and chemical information of the graphene-based materials prepared. Functionalisation of graphene oxide with polyelectrolyte polymer could facilitate deposition of platinum nanoparticles in the formation of Pt-GNPs composites. The resultant composite was employed for bioanalytical application in the detection of an important neurotransmitter, glutamate, based on glutamate oxidase enzyme. The performance of Pt-GNPs based glutamate sensor exhibited enhanced sensitivity and prolonged stability compared to the sensors based on Pt decorated diamond or glassy carbon electrodes. The significant interfering effect from concomitant electrochemically active biological compounds associated with Pt-GNPs electrode however could be alleviated via opting for Prussian blue deposited GNPs electrode instead. The oppositely charged Pt-GNPs due to different functionalising polymers were also subject to self-assembly, which was enabled by the electrostatic interaction of the opposite charges of Pt-GNPs. The self-assembled film showed enhanced mechanical stability than the conventional drop-casted film and provided reasonably good activity towards oxidation of hydrogen peroxide. Three-component composite of graphene, nanodiamond and polyaniline was prepared via in-situ polymerisation for usage as an electrode material in electrochemical capacitors ("supercapacitors"). The addition of graphene was shown to significantly enhance specific capacitance while nanodiamond could improve the stability of the electrode by strengthening the polymer core. Another approach to produce a supercapacitor was via electrodeposition of nickel and <b>cobalt</b> <b>hydroxides</b> on graphene oxide film corporated with bicarbonate salt. The film was then subject to thermal reduction of GO and expansion of graphene layers within the film was observed. This leavening process enhanced the surface area of graphene film and thus the higher specific capacitance was obtained. The decoration of nickel and <b>cobalt</b> <b>hydroxides</b> onto the film also boosted the specific capacitance further however the poor cycling stability of the heated film still remained an issue. Graphene nanoplatelets were also used as a support for electrodeposition of Pt nanoparticles for methanol oxidation in acidic media. The preferential phase of the Pt deposited and large surface area of graphene in comparison to other carbon supports studied led to good catalytic activity being observed.
