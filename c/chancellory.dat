5|$|From 1941, forward, the Leibstandarte became four {{distinct}} entities, the Waffen-SS division (unconnected to Hitler's {{personal protection}} but a {{formation of the}} Waffen-SS), the Berlin <b>Chancellory</b> Guard, the SS security regiment assigned to the Obersalzberg, and a Munich-based bodyguard unit which protected Hitler when he visited his personal apartment and the Brown House NSDAP headquarters in Munich. Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.|$|E

2500|$|On October 8 an {{international}} campaign was launched to flood the Reich <b>chancellory</b> with telegrams and letters of protest. Five hundred protest telegrams {{were sent to}} the Reich <b>chancellory</b> that day and during the next two days large numbers arrived from around the world, most of them from the United States, Britain, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Foreign post offices were told to stop transmitting the telegrams because the recipient refused to accept them and on October 10 the Berlin main telegraph office arranged with several overseas telegraph offices to destroy all telegrams that had not yet been transmitted. More than 1,000 letters—almost all of them with the same wording and signed [...] "Jehovah's Witnesses"—were also received at the presidential office and in November those letters were transferred to the Secret State Police [...] "for further investigation".|$|E
50|$|When Frederick IV died in 1730, the new King Christian VI {{immediately}} called Rosenkrantz back to Copenhagen, {{where he was}} appointed a Knight of the Elephant and appointed Chief of the two Danish <b>Chancellories.</b> During the hostility between England and France, he backed England. He was also known for his patronage of Copenhagen University. He was dismissed in 1735.|$|R

5|$|Maria Theresa was as {{conservative}} {{in matters of}} state as in those of religion, but implemented significant reforms to strengthen Austria's military and bureaucratic efficiency.

The central government {{was responsible for the}} army, although Haugwitz instituted taxation of the nobility, who never before had to pay taxes.

2500|$|During the trial, Evans was cross-examined by Irving. The {{cross-examination}} of Evans by Irving {{was noted}} {{for the high}} degree of personal antagonism between the two men. Such was the degree of antagonism that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting that a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote was fair. A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a 1942 memo by the Chief of the Reich <b>Chancellory</b> Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the [...] "Jewish Question" [...] on the [...] "back-burner" [...] until after the war. Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally, and taunted Evans, saying [...] "t is a terrible problem, is it not, that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item {{that we do not have}} to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which... quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?". In response, Evans stated [...] "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of... the way you manipulate and distort the documents".|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century Wilhelm began to {{concentrate}} upon his real agenda; the creation of a German navy that would rival that of Britain and enable Germany to declare itself a world power. He ordered his military leaders to read Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan's book, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, and spent hours drawing sketches of the ships that he wanted built. Bülow and Bethmann Hollweg, his loyal chancellors, looked after domestic affairs, while Wilhelm began to spread alarm in the <b>chancellories</b> of Europe with his increasingly eccentric views on foreign affairs.|$|R

60|$|These actions, {{together}} with the incessant commerce of banks, laboratories, <b>chancellories,</b> and houses of business, are the strokes which oar the world forward, they say. And they are dealt by men as smoothly sculptured as the impassive policeman at Ludgate Circus. But you will observe that far from being padded to rotundity his face is stiff from force of will, and lean from the efforts of keeping it so. When his right arm rises, all the force in his veins flows straight from shoulder to finger-tips; not an ounce is diverted into sudden impulses, sentimental regrets, wire-drawn distinctions. The buses punctually stop.|$|R
50|$|The Décoration du Lys {{was often}} called the Ordre du Lys. Even if from 1824 it was {{controlled}} by the grand <b>chancellory</b> of the Légion d’honneur, it never had a Grand Master or a <b>chancellory</b> of its own, and is never called an Order in the official documents.|$|E

60|$|After these amenities, {{the white}} master {{and the black}} talked of many things, the one bluffing with the white-man's superiority of intellect and knowledge, the other feeling and guessing, {{primitive}} statesman that he was, {{in an effort to}} ascertain the balance of human and political forces that bore upon his Su'u territory, ten miles square, bounded by the sea and by landward lines of an inter-tribal warfare that was older than the oldest Su'u myth. Eternally, heads had been taken and bodies eaten, now on one side, now on the other, by the temporarily victorious tribes. The boundaries had remained the same. Ishikola, in crude beche- de-mer, tried to learn the Solomon Islands general situation in relation to Su'u, and Van Horn was not above playing the unfair diplomatic game as it is unfairly played in all the <b>chancellories</b> of the world powers.|$|R
40|$|In case {{of digital}} goods such like music, {{intellectual}} property rights are typically not exerted by the creators (artists) but by intermediaries. Their profits, and therefore also the income of the artists, are endangered by copyright infringements (piracy). It is well known from static welfare analysis that to some extent piracy reduces the deadweight loss by limiting monopoly power and could therefore increase welfare. This paper contributes to the discussion by including the costs of law enforcement into the welfare analysis. Most models in the literature assume that law is enforced by governmental activities. In contrast, this paper considers that law enforcement is exerted by agents (e. g. lawyer <b>chancellories,</b> provider of screening technologies) which are also seen as intermediaries. The enforcement effort is there fore endogenously determined. It is shown that this will lead to suboptimal welfare outcomes. A social planner has to regulate punishment and enforcement effort to a moderate level. A more rigorous fight against piracy could only be justified by negative dynamic welfare effects due {{to a loss of}} creativity. However, there is no empirical evidence for that...|$|R

60|$|All day {{the needles}} had been ticking away without {{intermission}} {{in the little}} corrugated iron hut which served as a telegraph station at Sarras. With its bare walls and its packing-case seats, it was none the less for the moment one of the vital spots upon the earth's surface, and the crisp, importunate ticking might {{have come from the}} world-old clock of Destiny. Many august people had been {{at the other end of}} those wires, and had communed with the moist-faced military clerk. A French Premier had demanded a pledge, and an English marquis had passed on the request to the General in command, with a question as to how it would affect the situation. Cipher telegrams had nearly driven the clerk out of his wits, for of all crazy occupations the taking of a cipher message, when you are without the key to the cipher, is the worst. Much high diplomacy had been going on all day in the innermost chambers of European <b>chancellories,</b> and the results of it had been whispered into this little corrugated-iron hut. About two in the morning an enormous despatch had come at last to an end, and the weary operator had opened the door, and was lighting his pipe in the cool, fresh air, when he saw a camel plump down in the dust, and a man, who seemed to be in the last stage of drunkenness, come rolling towards him.|$|R
