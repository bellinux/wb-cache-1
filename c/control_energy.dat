5|$|Although {{the speaker}} uses bought-in drivers, {{they have been}} rebuilt using {{stronger}} materials. Drivers' metal baskets are treated to reduce the effects of vibration, and the enclosure designed and constructed to <b>control</b> <b>energy.</b> The drive units (T27, B110 and B139) were sourced from KEF in kit form, and two KEFKIT3 kits were judiciously used for each cabinet. However, Linn found the T27 tweeter too fragile {{and replaced it with}} the more robust and better-sounding D2008 from Scan-Speak after a very short run; the Scan-Speak tweeter was later changed to a Linn D20-LP-1, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark. The midrange KEF B110, known for its use in the LS3/5A BBC monitor, is a 100mm-diameter unit to which Linn applied a layer of doping. The woofer is a KEF B139.|$|E

500|$|The {{loudspeaker}} cabinet measures [...] The extremely rigid 55-litre cabinet {{is constructed}} using 19mm high-density particle board that is strategically damped in places, and extensively braced. According to the manufacturer, {{there is an}} array of stressed steel rods inside the enclosure to <b>control</b> <b>energy</b> flows. The techniques employed ensure that energy that would have caused the unwanted motion of the front panel and drivers is cancelled by a similar but opposite energy from the upward facing units, resulting in the minimum amount of resonances. The cabinets were initially made by Linn in their own factory, but the manufacturing was later outsourced to furniture-makers Leon Levin of Glasgow.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} system, {{particularly the}} stomach, releases a peptide hormone called ghrelin. In 1999 [...] experiments {{have revealed that}} hunger is communicated from the stomach to the brain via this hormone peptide. This peptide can stimulate thought about food, and is suppressed after food is ingested. Nutrient injection into the blood stream does not suppress ghrelin, so the release of hormone is directed by the digestive system and not by nutrient availability in the blood. [...] These blood levels of ghrelin increase with fasting and are reduced after a meal. [...] Ghrelin antibodies or ghrelin receptor antagonists inhibit eating. [...] Ghrelin also stimulates energy production and signals directly to the hypothalamus regulatory nucli that <b>control</b> <b>energy</b> homeostasis.|$|E

A novel approach is proposed which predicts energy production and consumption by fitting stochastic models to historic data, and solves the resulting optimization problem on a rolling horizon.
