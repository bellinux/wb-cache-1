40|$|Oviposition {{preference}} of the <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Chrysomela scripta F., was determined for 12 Populus clones. Oviposition {{was observed in}} multiple choice and no choice greenhouse experiments and in a field plot experiment. Oviposition preference was quantified by number of egg masses and mean number of eggs/mass for each clone. Significant differences were found for number of egg masses among the clones. No {{significant differences were found}} for mean number of eggs/mass among the clones. Means for the three experiments were 55 to 59 eggs/mass;Populus clones in the Aigeiros and Tacamahaca sections were more preferred for oviposition than Leuce clones. Hybrid clones between Aigeiros and Tacamahaca sections were generally less preferred for oviposition than either of the parent sections, especially hybrids of 25 % Aigeiros + 75 % Tacamahaca composition. Location of egg deposition within a tree showed a greater frequency on leaves from the top third of young trees;Oviposition preference was compared with results for other studies of <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> activities. A comparison of oviposition and adult feeding preferences showed differences in clonal rankings between these activities. However, a comparison of oviposition preference and larval development times revealed a very consistent relationship of clonal ranking. Results from two field studies on <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> injury levels can be explained, at least partially, by a combination of adult feeding preference, larval development time, and oviposition preference for the various clones...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Chrysomela scripta F. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most serious defoliators of Populus plantations in North America. This research was conducted to understand the relationship between poplar leaf secondary chemicals and adult beetle feeding preferences;Leaf surface chemicals from a cottonwood leaf beetle-preferred poplar clone, 2 ̆ 7 Eugenei 2 ̆ 7 (Populus deltoides x Populus nigra), was found to induce feeding in the adult <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle.</b> The feeding stimulants were isolated and identified as n-beheryl alcohol (C 22), n-lignoceryl alcohol (C 24), n-hexacosanol (C 26), n-octacosanol (C 28), n-triacontanol (C 30), and [alpha]-tocopherylquinone ([alpha]-TQ), (2 -(3 -hydroxy- 3, 7, 11, 15 -tetramethyl-hexadecyl) - 3, 5, 6 -trimethyl- 3 ̆c 1, 43 ̆ebenzoquinone). It is the first time that long chain fatty alcohols and [alpha]-TQ have been identified as <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> adult feeding stimulants. And it is the first time that [alpha]-TQ has been reported as a feeding stimulant for an insect. Fatty alcohols or [alpha]-TQ alone do not induce beetle feeding significantly, but a mixture of alcohols and [alpha]-TQ synergistically stimulates beetle feeding;Field-planted University of Washington poplar pedigree materials (parent clones ILL- 129, Populus deltoides, and 93 - 968, Populus trichocarpa, F, clones, 53 - 242 and 53 - 246, and 87 F 2 selections) were used for leaf disc feeding tests. Field cage feeding tests were performed with parent and F 1 clones. Leaf surface chemicals, long chain fatty alcohols and [alpha]-TQ, and the phenolic glycosides tremulacin and salicortin were analyzed to correlate chemical abundance with <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> adult feeding preference. The beetles showed varied feeding preferences among parent clones, F 1 clones, and F 2 clones. Contents of the alcohols or the phenolic glucosides did not explain adult beetle feeding preference. Content of [alpha]-TQ on the leaf surface, in the presence of the alcohols, could explain the adult beetle feeding preference. The beetle preferred to feed on clones with [alpha]-TQ rather than on clones without [alpha]-TQ. As the amount of [alpha]-TQ increased, the feeding preference increased, and then decreased as the amount of [alpha]-TQ increased further...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe used site-directed {{mutagenesis}} {{to modify the}} Bacillus thuringiensis cry 3 A gene in amino acid residues 350 – 354. Two mutant toxins, A 1 (R 345 A,Y 350 F,Y 351 F) and A 2 (R 345 A,ΔY 350,ΔY 351), showed significantly improved toxicity against Tenebrio molitor (yellow mealworm). The mutant toxin A 1 was also more potent against both Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Colorado potato beetle) and Chrysomela scripta (<b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle),</b> while A 2 displayed enhanced toxicity only in L. decemlineata.

40|$|The {{biotechnology}} {{of plant}} tissue culture has been developed as an applied science for micropropagation, tree improvement, and basic physiology studies. Biotechnological approaches in forest science are advanced as a desirable tool to obtain superior genotypes and to screen for insect resistance. As a basic technique, in vitro cloning is a powerful tool using different explant types such as immature ovules or stem nodes for tree improvement. Typically, plants can be regenerated in vitro by apical or vascular cambial meristems. Genetic transformation is another option to improve the variable lines by genetic modification in host genetic materials with desirable traits. In addition to cloning and gene transfer, in vitro screening methods are applicable for early selection with modified plantlets;In this advanced biotechnology program, several aspects were addressed with Populus species: (1) light and scanning electron microscope study of shoot formation in developing ovules of cottonwood (Populus deltoides), (2) evaluation of shoot proliferation from alternative in vitro nodal cultures of a cottonwood hybrid (Populus deltoides X P. nigra), (3) investigation of morphological in vitro shoot abnormalities in hybrid aspen (Populus alba L. X P. grandidentata Michx.), and (4) early screening {{of resistance to the}} <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in transgenic poplar (Populus deltoides X P. nigra);Immature ovule cultures can provide early cloning from zygotes that are composed of diverse genetic sources and the explant of immature ovules can be a desirable target for genetic transformation. Therefore, the culture system was developed and shoot formation from immature embryos was investigated via electron and light microscopes. The regeneration frequency was increased substantially by treatment with zeatin;Ordinarily, an intact node is used as explant material in {{plant tissue culture}}. However, shoot production was significantly enhanced by using internode and modified stem segment explants in this study. Besides the apical or vascular cambial meristems, shoots could be produced from the phellogen (lenticel) which is an organ for secondary growth in bark. Therefore, shoot formation from lenticel area was investigated through stereo and light microscopy;Even though the development of in vitro systems is important in biotechnological research, abnormal plantlets need to be studied to overcome in vitro problems. The cells and structure of normal and vitrified leaves of hybrid aspen were investigated with scanning electron and light microscopy. Vitrified leaves had more circular, larger stomata; an absence of palisade parenchyma; and large, vacuolated spongy mesophyll cells. Chloroplasts in vitrified leaves were less developed than in normal leaves;Finally, an in vitro system was integrated with entomological knowledge to screen for resistance to the <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle.</b> This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of the proteinase inhibitor gene II (pin 2). The in vitro system provided a quick, highly controlled method to screen the transgenic poplar in an in situ condition directly...|$|E
40|$|The insecticidal {{activity}} of Bacillus thuringiensis is due primarily to Cry and Cyt proteins. Cry proteins are typically toxic to lepidopterous, coleopterous, or dipterous insects, whereas the known toxicity of Cyt proteins {{is limited to}} dipterans. We report here that a Cyt protein, Cyt 1 Aa, is also highly toxic to the <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Chrysomela scripta, with a median lethal concentration of 2. 5 ng/mm 2 of leaf surface for second-instar larvae. Additionally, we show that Cyt 1 Aa suppresses resistance to Cry 3 Aa greater than 5, 000 -fold in C. scripta, a level only partially overcome by Cry 1 Ba due to cross-resistance. Studies of the histopathology of C. scripta larvae treated with Cyt 1 Aa revealed disruption and sloughing of midgut epithelial cells, indicating that its mechanism of action against C. scripta {{is similar to that}} observed in mosquito and blackfly larvae. These novel properties suggest that Cyt proteins may have an even broader spectrum of activity against insects and, owing to their different mechanism of action in comparison to Cry proteins, might be useful in managing resistance to Cry 3 and possibly other Cry toxins used in microbial insecticides and transgenic plants.

40|$|Abstract Populus {{species and}} hybrids have many {{practical}} applications, {{but there is}} a paucity of data regarding selections that perform well in the southeastern US. We compared pest susceptibility of 31 Populus clones over 3 years in South Carolina, USA. Cuttings were planted in spring 2001 on two study sites. Clones planted in the bottomland site received granular fertilizer yearly and irrigation the first two years only, while those on the sandy, upland site received irrigation and fertilization throughout each growing season. Foliar damage by the <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Chrysomela scripta), cottonwood leafcurl mite (Tetra lobulifera), and poplar leaf rust (Melampsora medusae) was visually monitored several times each growing season. Damage ratings differed significantly among clones, and clonal rankings changed from year to year. Irrigation increased C. scripta and M. medusae damage, but had no effect on T. lobulifera damage. Certain clones received greater pest damage at a particular study site. Temporal damage patterns were evident among individual clones and on each site. At the upland site, OP 367 and 7300502 were highly resistant to all three pests; I 45 / 51 was highly resistant to C. scripta and M. medusae; NM 6 and 15 – 29 were highly resistant to M. medusae; and 7302801 was highly resistant to T. lobulifera and M. medusae.

40|$|The insecticidal {{activity}} of Bacillus thuringiensis strains toxic to coleopterous insects {{is due to}} Cry 3 proteins assembled into small rectangular crystals. Toxin synthesis in these strains is dependent primarily upon a promoter that is active in the stationary phase and a STAB-SD sequence that stabilizes the cry 3 transcript-ribosome complex. Here we show that significantly higher yields of Cry 3 A {{can be obtained by}} using dual sporulation-dependent cyt 1 Aa promoters to drive the expression of cry 3 Aa when the STAB-SD sequence is included in the construct. The Cry 3 A yield per unit of culture medium obtained with this expression system was 12. 7 -fold greater than that produced by DSM 2803, the wild-type strain of B. thuringiensis from which Cry 3 Aa was originally described, and 1. 4 -fold greater than that produced by NB 176, a mutant of the same strain containing two or three copies of cry 3 Aa, which is the active ingredient of the commercial product Novodor, used for control of beetle pests. The toxicities of Cry 3 A produced with this construct or the wild-type strain were similar when assayed against larvae of the <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Chrysomela scripta. The volume of Cry 3 A crystals produced with cyt 1 Aa promoters and the STAB-SD sequence was 1. 3 -fold that of typical bipyramidal Cry 1 crystals toxic to lepidopterous insects.

40|$|The <b>cottonwood</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Chrysomela scripta F., (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} more serious defoliators of plantation Populus in North America. This research was undertaken to examine the effects of leaf age and plant chemicals on the feeding and oviposition behaviors of adult beetles. The most preferred leaf age class was established for both behaviors and the composition and concentration of selected phenolic glycosides were analyzed for the most and least preferred leaf age classes. Correlations were then made between the phenolic glycoside profiles of the leaves and the host preferences of the beetles for both behaviors;Greenhouse preference studies performed under controlled conditions established that adults exhibit preferences among selected Populus for feeding and oviposition and that the same clones were favored choices for both behaviors. Preferences for specific leaf age classes were observed and the relationship between leaf age class and feeding damage can be explained by a quadratic model. A positive correlation was also found between the amount of feeding damage and the distribution of egg masses;Laboratory high performance liquid chromatography analyses were conducted to determine the concentrations of salicin, salicortin, and tremulacin in the foliage of a non-host aspen hybrid and the same Populus clones used in the preference trials. Two leaf age classes (the most preferred age class and a nonpreferred age class) were examined and most samples contained all three of the targeted chemicals. Overall, the concentrations were higher in the younger, most preferred leaves than in the nonpreferred leaves. No direct correlations between host selection for feeding and oviposition and the concentration of these glycosides were found, but some general trends were evident. The levels of salicin and salicortin were moderate to high in the most preferred clones, while the concentrations of tremulacin were low. This suggests possible positive influences of salicin and salicortin on host selection and possible negative effects of tremulacin. The degree of resistance exhibited by some Populus may be caused in part to the composition or concentration of phenolic glycosides, especially salicin...|$|E
