In this paper, we find that functionally identical <b>coupled</b> <b>networks</b> are more robust than single networks under random attack. By studying the effect of the broadness and average degree of the degree distribution on the robustness of the network, we find that a broader degree distribution and a higher average degree increase the robustness of functionally identical <b>coupled</b> <b>networks</b> under random failure.

The actions that can exist within an overconstrained <b>coupling</b> <b>network</b> are shown to be geometrically identical to the motions that can occur within the dual of that <b>coupling</b> <b>network.</b> Most useful coupling networks, such as mechanisms within machinery, are both overconstrained and underconstrained.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{nonlinear}} coupling is an important factor impacting synchronization dynamics of nonlinear <b>coupled</b> complex <b>networks</b> [1 – 7]. In [1], synchronization for a class of nonlinear <b>coupled</b> complex <b>networks</b> with adaptive distributed controller based on fuzzy logic systems was studied.

40|$|Scalar {{coupling}} constants can {{be extracted}} from the cross peaks of correlation spectra by applying deconvolution to the frequency domain. This requires high resolution in the directly detected dimension. A three-step automated procedure {{is presented as a}} free package running in combination with a major commercial processing software. The initial step allows one to measure coupling constants in an interactive manner in high-resolution cross-peak multiplets of weakly coupled spin systems. The user can follow the recursive analysis to assess the reliability of the results. If needed, the course of the automatic procedure can be changed. A second module compiles the data of the cross-peak analysis and assembles the proton spin network. The algorithm assigns data to a given nucleus if it encounters full consistency of both chemical shifts and coupling constants in all relevant cross peaks. The pairing of signals symmetric with respect to the diagonal defines the connectivity of the spin network. The last module displays the <b>coupling</b> <b>network</b> in a pleasing presentation.

The design of a quadrature LC VCO with better phase noise and lower power consumption forms the core of this work. This thesis investigates a coupling mechanism to implement a quadrature voltage controlled oscillator using indirect injection method. The <b>coupling</b> <b>network</b> in this QVCO couples the two LC cores with their super-harmonic and it recycles its bias current back into the LC tank such that the power consumed by the <b>coupling</b> <b>network</b> is insignificant.
