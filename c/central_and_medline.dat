40|$|Background - Depression is {{a common}} health problem, ranking third after cardiac and {{respiratory}} diseases as {{a major cause of}} disability. There is evidence to suggest that university students are at higher risk of depression, despite being a socially advantaged population, but the reported rates have shown wide variability across settings. Purpose - To explore the prevalence of depression in university students. Method - PubMed, PsycINFO, BioMed <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medline</b> were searched to identify studies published between 1990 and 2010 reporting on depression prevalence among university students. Searches used a combination of the terms depression, depressive symptoms, depressive disorders, prevalence, university students, college students, undergraduate students, adolescents and/or young adults.

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastative {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{with complex}} etiology. Neuroinflammation {{has been found}} to be an underlying cause of the disease, although it demonstrates significant defensive role and renders the brain immunologically secured. This review focuses on the physiology and pathology of this crucial biological process and the diverse factors involved in and acting in a concerted manner to play a pivotal role either in the physiology or pathology of the disease. We used Pubmed, Pubmed <b>Central,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medline</b> databases for a period of 3 months. It also summarizes the recent advances in neuroinflammation in both in vitro and in vivo. This review eventually warrants further studies on animal models of AD to unravel the complete pathophysiology of the disease and also accentuates the burgeoning need to protect astrocytes which can become a substantial therapeutic avenue. ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{controversy}} {{about the effectiveness}} of mesh techniques for inguinal hernia repair (IHR) when compared with non-mesh procedures. The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically review the available evidence on the effectiveness of mesh compared to non-mesh IHR techniques. Cochrane <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> databases and the TRIP Database engine were reviewed looking for systematic reviews (SR) and clinical trials (CT) published from 1990 to 2012, comparing the effectiveness, in terms of operative time, postoperative pain, morbidity, hospital stay, return to work, costs and recurrence, of mesh and non-mesh IHR techniques. We retrieved 3, 069 articles, 17 of which met the selection criteria (3 SR and 14 RCT), representing a population of 15, 124 subjects (7361 mesh and 7763 non-mesh IHR). According to these studies, mesh IHR techniques are associated with less surgical time, pain, hospital stay, recurrence and sooner return to work than non-mesh techniques. It is concluded that mesh techniques are more effective than those not using a mesh...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} lymphadenectomy extent on the {{survival}} of patients with primary resectable gastric carcinoma is debated. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence {{on the impact of}} the three main types of progressively more extended lymph node dissection (that is, D 1, D 2 and D 3 lymphadenectomy) on the clinical outcome of patients with primary resectable carcinoma of the stomach. The primary objective was {{to assess the impact of}} lymphadenectomy extent on survival (overall survival [OS], disease specific survival [DSS] and disease free survival [DFS]). The secondary aim was to assess the impact of lymphadenectomy on post-operative mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched <b>CENTRAL,</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> <b>and</b> EMBASE until 2001, including references from relevant articles and conference proceedings. We also contacted known researchers in the field. For the updated review, <b>CENTRAL,</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> <b>and</b> EMBASE were searched from 2001 to February 2015.

40|$|Background People {{with central}} {{neurological}} disease or injury {{have a much}} higher risk of both faecal incontinence and constipation than the general population. There is often {{a fine line between}} the two symptoms, with any management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical, with a limited research base. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003 and 2006. The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Objectives To determine the effects of management strategies for faecal incontinence and constipation in people with a neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Trials Register (searched 8 June 2012), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<b>CENTRAL),</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> <b>and</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> In-Process as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings; and all reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating any type of conservative or surgical intervention for the management of faecal incontinence and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury were selected. Specific therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases that indirectly affect bowel dysfunction were also considered. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible trials and independently extracted data from the included trials using a range of pre-specified outcome measures. Main results Twenty trials involving 902 people were included.

Several randomized trials have shown metformin to be effective, but this still hasn’t been included in clinical guidelines on managing antipsychotic induced weight gain. Methods All double blind placebo controlled trials assessing the efficacy of metformin {{in the treatment of}} antipsychotic induced weight gain were included. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<b>CENTRAL)</b> <b>and</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> were searched for the period January 2000 -December 2015. Meta-analysis was carried out using the random effects model. Results Meta analysis of 12 published studies with a total of 743 patients found that in patients treated with antipsychotics, metformin treatment resulted in significantly better anthropometric and metabolic parameters than placebo. The mean change in weight was − 3. 27  kg (95  % CI − 4. 66 to − 1. 89) (Z[*]=[*] 4. 64, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Metformin compared to placebo resulted in significant reduction in BMI [− 1. 13  kg/m 2 (95  % CI − 1. 61 to − 0. 66) ] and insulin resistance index [− 1. 49 (95  % CI − 2. 40 to − 0. 59) ] but not fasting blood sugar [− 2. 48  mg/dl (95  % CI − 5. 54 to 0. 57].

In addition, the prevalence of inadequate zinc intakes {{was thought to be}} high among all population groups worldwide, and the public health concern is considerable. In accordance with the EURRECA consortium principles and protocols, a series of literature reviews were undertaken in order to develop best practice guidelines for assessing dietary zinc intake and zinc status. These were incorporated into subsequent literature search strategies and protocols for studies investigating the relationships between zinc intake, status and health, as well as studies relating to the factorial approach (including bioavailability) for setting dietary recommendations. EMBASE (Ovid), Cochrane Library <b>CENTRAL</b> <b>and</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> (Ovid) databases were searched for studies published up to February 2010 and collated into a series of Endnote databases that are available for the use of future DRV panels. Meta-analyses of data extracted from these publications were performed where possible in order to address specific questions relating to factors affecting dietary recommendations. This review has highlighted the need for more high quality studies to address gaps in current knowledge, in particular the continued search for a reliable biomarker of zinc status and the influence of genetic polymorphisms on individual dietary requirements. In addition, {{there is a need to}} further develop models of the effect of dietary inhibitors of zinc absorption and their impact on population dietary zinc requirements...|$|E
40|$|Background: Home visits {{for older}} adults aim to prevent {{cognitive}} and functional impairment, thus reducing institutionalization and mortality. Visitors may provide information, investigate untreated problems, encourage medication compliance, and provide referrals to services. Methods and Findings: Data Sources: Ten databases including <b>CENTRAL</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medline</b> searched through December 2012. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials enrolling community-dwelling persons without dementia aged over 65 years. Interventions included visits at home by a health or social care professional that were not related to hospital discharge. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two authors independently extracted data. Outcomes were pooled using random effects. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality, institutionalization, hospitalization, falls, injuries, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, quality of life, and psychiatric illness. Results: Sixty-four studies with 28642 participants were included. Home visits were not associated with absolute reductions in mortality at longest follow-up, but some programs may have small relative effects (relative risk = 0. 93 [0. 87 to 0. 99]; absolute risk = 0. 00 [20. 01 to 0. 00]).

DATA SOURCES: <b>CENTRAL,</b> EMBASE <b>and</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> were searched for abstracts and papers. All searching was completed in March 2004. No restriction was placed on language. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of adult patients with severe infections treated with meropenem or imipenem plus cilastatin at an equal dose, on a gram-for-gram basis, and with the same dosing regimen. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently assessed papers against the inclusion/exclusion criteria and for methodological quality with differences in opinion adjudicated by a third party. Data were extracted on clinical response, bacteriologic response, mortality and adverse events. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 27 trials met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were carried out using a Fixed Effects model. Results demonstrated that when compared to imipenem plus cilastatin, meropenem is associated with a significantly greater clinical response (Relative Risk 1. 04; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 01 - 1. 06), a significantly greater bacteriologic response (RR 1. 05; 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 08), a non-significant reduction in mortality (RR 0. 98; 95 % CI: 0. 71 - 1. 35), and a significantly lower adverse event rate (RR 0. 87; 95 % CI: 0. 77 - 0. 97). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review demonstrates that meropenem compared to imipenem plus cilastatin has a significantly greater clinical and bacteriologic response with a significant reduction in adverse events.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intracranial venous {{thrombosis}} (ICVT) commonly presents with seizures in the acute period, and some patients may develop recurrent seizures {{in the long}} term. The prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) {{for the management of}} post-ICVT seizures is controversial and there is currently no consensus on the optimal management of post-ICVT seizures. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of AEDs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures related to ICVT. (1) Do AEDs reduce the likelihood of seizures in patients who have had an ICVT but have not had a seizure?(2) Do AEDs reduce the likelihood of further seizures in patients who have had an ICVT and at least one seizure? SEARCH STRATEGY: We aimed to identify relevant studies in the Cochrane Epilepsy Group and Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Registers. We also undertook specialised searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<b>CENTRAL)</b> <b>and</b> <b>MEDLINE,</b> and checked the reference lists of articles retrieved from the searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in which patients were assigned to a treatment group (that is, receiving at least one AED) or control group (receiving placebo or no drug). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both review authors independently screened and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. If studies had been included, then one review author would have extracted the data and the other would have checked the extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: No relevant studies were found.

However, the prognostic value of NLR in patients with esophageal cancer (EC) is still controversial. Therefore, {{it was necessary for}} us to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of NLR in patients with EC. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed by using Web of Science, PubMed <b>Central,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medline</b> to evaluate the prognostic value of NLR in patients with EC. The deadline of our primary search was July 10, 2014. This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association of NLR and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Six studies involving 1, 633 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Our pooled results demonstrated that high NLR was associated with poor OS (HR: 1. 54, 95 % CI: 1. 32 – 1. 80, I 2 = 25. 3 %, P= 0. 254) and DFS (HR: 1. 74, 95 % CI: 1. 25 – 2. 43, I 2 = 63. 9 %, P= 0. 096). Subgroup analysis between NLR and OS was performed in a further investigation. When the patients were segregated according to country, sample size, and pathological type, high NLR was also significantly correlated with OS. Conclusion: High NLR is associated with poor prognosis in patients with EC. NLR may be a significant predictive biomarker in patients with EC.

40|$|Background: Cancer-related fatigue is {{reported}} {{as the most}} common and distressing symptom experienced by patients with cancer. It can exacerbate the experience of other symptoms, negatively affect mood, interfere with the ability to carry out everyday activities, and negatively impact on quality of life. Educational interventions may help people to manage this fatigue or to cope with this symptom, and reduce its overall burden. Despite the importance of education for managing cancer-related fatigue there are currently no systematic reviews examining this approach. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of educational interventions for managing cancer-related fatigue in adults. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<b>CENTRAL),</b> <b>and</b> <b>MEDLINE,</b> EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, OTseeker and PEDro up to 1 st November 2016. We also searched trials registries. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of educational interventions focused on cancer-related fatigue where fatigue was a primary outcome. Studies must have aimed to evaluate the effect of educational interventions designed specifically to manage cancer-related fatigue, or to evaluate educational interventions targeting a constellation of physical symptoms or quality of life where fatigue was the primary focus. The studies could have compared educational interventions with no intervention or wait list controls, usual care or attention controls, or an alternative intervention for cancer-related fatigue in adults with any type of cancer. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion. Trial authors were contacted for additional information. A third independent person checked the data extraction. The main outcome considered in this review was cancer-related fatigue. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 2 ̆ 7 Summary of Findings 2 ̆ 7 table. Main results: We included 14 RCTs with 2213 participants across different cancer diagnoses. Four studies used only 2 ̆ 7 information-giving 2 ̆ 7 educational strategies, whereas the remainder used mainly information-giving strategies coupled with some problem-solving, reinforcement, or support techniques. Interventions differed in delivery including: mode of delivery (face to face, web-based, audiotape, telephone); group or individual interventions; number of sessions provided (ranging from 2 to 12 sessions); and timing of intervention in relation to completion of cancer treatment (during or after completion). Most trials compared educational interventions to usual care and meta-analyses compared educational interventions to usual care or attention controls. Methodological issues that increased the risk of bias were evident including lack of blinding of outcome assessors, unclear allocation concealment in over half of the studies, and generally small sample sizes. Using the GRADE approach, we rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate, downgraded mainly due to high risk of bias, unexplained heterogeneity, and imprecision. There was moderate quality evidence of a small reduction in fatigue intensity from a meta-analyses of eight studies (1524 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) - 0. 28, 95...|$|E

There is little evidence on how procedural skills are best learnt and practiced in education. There is a need for educators to know what specific interventions could be used to increase learning of these skills. However, there is growing evidence from rehabilitation science, sport science and psychology that learning can be promoted with the application of motor learning principles. The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the evidence for selected motor learning principles in physiotherapy and medical education.

40|$|This is {{an update}} of a Cochrane review first {{published}} in The Cochrane Library (2010, Issue 7). To increase the success rate of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), adherence compounds such as hyaluronic acid (HA) and fibrin sealant have been introduced into subfertility management. Adherence compounds {{are added to the}} embryo transfer medium to increase the likelihood of embryo implantation, with the potential for higher clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. To determine whether embryo transfer media containing adherence compounds improved live birth and pregnancy rates in ART cycles. The Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<b>CENTRAL)</b> <b>and</b> <b>MEDLINE,</b> EMBASE and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched (up to 13 November 2013) to look for publications that described randomised controlled trials on the addition of adherence compounds to embryo transfer media. Furthermore, reference lists of all obtained studies were checked, and conference abstracts were handsearched. Only truly randomised controlled trials comparing embryo transfer media containing functional (e. g. 0. 5 mg/ml HA) concentrations of adherence compounds versus transfer media containing low or no concentrations of adherence compounds were included. The adherence compounds that were identified for evaluation were HA and fibrin sealant. Two review authors selected trials for inclusion according to the above criteria, after which two review authors independently extracted the data for subsequent analysis. Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. Seventeen studies with a total of 3898 participants were analysed. One studied fibrin sealant, and the other 16 studied HA. No evidence was found of a treatment effect of fibrin sealant as an adherence compound. For HA, evidence of a positive treatment effect was identified in the six trials that reported live birth rates (odds ratio (OR) 1. 41, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 17 to 1. 69; six RCTs, N = 1950, I(2) = 0 %, moderate-quality evidence). Furthermore, the 14 trials reporting clinical pregnancy rates showed evidence of treatment benefit when embryos were transferred in media containing functional concentrations of HA (OR 1. 39, 95 % CI 1. 21 to 1. 60; 14 RCTs, N = 3452, I(2) = 46 %, moderate-quality evidence) as compared with low or no use of HA. The multiple pregnancy rate (OR 1. 86, 95 % CI 1. 49 to 2. 31; five RCTs, N = 1951, I(2) = 0 %, moderate-quality evidence) was significantly increased in the high HA group, but no significant differences in adverse event rates were found (OR 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 49 to 1. 12; four RCTs, N = 1525, I(2) = 0 %, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence suggests improved clinical pregnancy and live birth rates with the use of functional concentrations of HA as an adherence compound in ART cycles. However, the evidence obtained is of moderate quality. The increase in multiple pregnancy rate {{may be the result of}} use of a combination of an adherence compound and a policy of transferring more than one embryo. Further studies of adherence compounds with single embryo transfer need to be undertake...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Learning of {{procedural}} skills {{is important in}} the education of physiotherapists. It is the aim of physiotherapy degree programmes that graduates are able to practice selected procedures safely and efficiently. Procedural competency is threatened by an increasing and diverse amount of procedures that are incorporated in university curricula. As a consequence, less time is available for the learning of each specific procedure. Incorrectly performed procedures in physiotherapy might be ineffective and may result in injuries to patients and physiotherapists. The aim of this review was to synthesise relevant literature systematically to appraise current knowledge relating to assessments for procedural skills in physiotherapy education. Method: A systematic search strategy was developed to screen five relevant databases (CINAHL, Cochrane <b>Central,</b> SportDISCUS, ERIC <b>and</b> <b>MEDLINE)</b> for eligible studies. The included assessments were evaluated for evidence of their reliability and validity. Results: The search of electronic databases identified 560 potential records. Seven studies were included into this systematic review. The studies reported eight assessments {{of procedural}} skills. Six of the assessments were designed for a specific procedure and two assessments were considered for the evaluation of more than one procedure. Evidence to support the measurement properties of the assessment was not available for all categories. Discussion: It was not possible to recommend a single assessment of procedural skills in physiotherapy education following this systematic review. There is a need for further development of new assessments to allow valid and reliable assessments of the broad spectrum of physiotherapeutic practice...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{in vitro}} {{fertilization}} (IVF) /intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment cycles, controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) is performed with recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) in combination with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue {{for the prevention of}} premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surges. The use of GnRH analogues however deprives the growing follicles of LH. The effectiveness of co-administrating rLH to rFSH for COH is at present unclear. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness and safety of a combination of recombinant LH and recombinant FSH with recombinant FSH alone in COH protocols in (IVF or ICSI followed by embryo transfer (ET). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the MDSG Group Specialised Register (searched up to Nov 2006) <b>and</b> <b>CENTRAL,</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> <b>and</b> EMBASE (1980 to November 2006) and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing COH with rFSH alone or in combination with rLH in IVF/ICSI were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We sought additional information if necessary. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen trials involving 2612 women were included. Eleven trials involving 2396 women used a GnRH agonist. There was no evidence of a statistical difference in live birth rate reported in two trials (OR 1. 51, 95 % CI 0. 79 to 2. 87). There was no evidence of a statistical difference in clinical pregnancy rates reported in seven trials OR 1. 15, 95 % CI 0. 91 to 1. 45. There was no evidence of a statistical difference or in ongoing pregnancy rates seven trials OR 1. 22, 95 % CI 0. 95 to 1. 56. Three trials used a GnRH antagonist. No data on live birth rates was available. There was no evidence of a statistical difference in clinical pregnancy rates (one trial: OR 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 26 to 2. 43) or in ongoing pregnancy rates (two trials: OR 0. 83, 95 % CI 0. 39 to 1. 80) comparing both groups. The pooled pregnancy estimates of trials including only poor responders showed significant increase in pregnancy rate, in favour of co-administrating rLH (three trials: OR 1. 85, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 3. 11) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a statistical difference in pregnancy outcomes when rLH was used. Nevertheless, further large RCTs should be undertaken in long GnRH agonist down regulation protocols, since all pooled pregnancy estimates, although not statistically different probably due to the small numbers, point towards a beneficial effect of co-treatment with rLH, in particular with respect to pregnancy-loss and poor-responder...|$|R

In Table 4, under the PCC of 0.5 similarity threshold, all of the test sets show this trend except for Cranfield <b>and</b> <b>Medline.</b> For both test sets, econo 50 is superior to all other schemes. The average value of econo 50 is also superior to the other schemes according to the Cranfield <b>and</b> <b>Medline</b> results. In Table 5, at the PCC of 0.6 similarity threshold, the results are similar to the Table 4 trends. Econo 50 is superior for the other schemes for Cranfield <b>and</b> <b>Medline</b> test sets. However, Table 5 shows different average results from Table 4. In Table 5, econo 70 is the best scheme.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundNon-specific cough {{is defined}} as {{non-productive}} cough {{in the absence of}} identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including inhaled anti-cholinergic medications. ObjectivesTo determine the efficacy of inhaled anti-cholinergic medications in the management of prolonged non-specific cough in children. Search methodsThe Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (<b>CENTRAL),</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> <b>and</b> EMBASE databases were searched. Relevant pharmaceutical companies were contacted. The latest searches were carried out in April 2010. Selection criteriaAll randomised controlled trials comparing inhaled anti-cholinergic medication with a placebo medication. Data collection and analysisResults of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified and thus no data were available for analysis. A single small trial in adults has been reported. Main resultsNo randomised-controlled trials that examined the efficacy of inhaled anti-cholinergic medications in the management of prolonged non-specific cough in children were found. An additional search in April 2010 did not identify any further studies. Authors 2 ̆ 7 conclusionsThere is currently no evidence to support the use of inhaled anti-cholinergics for symptomatic control of non-specific cough in children. Further research examining the effects of this intervention is needed...|$|R

40|$|Neuroblastoma {{is a rare}} {{malignant}} disease and patients with high-risk neuroblastoma have a poor prognosis. Retinoic acid {{has been shown to}} inhibit growth of human neuroblastoma cells and has been considered as a potential candidate for improving the outcome. The objective was to evaluate effects of retinoic acid after consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation as compared to placebo or no further treatment in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. We searched the databases <b>CENTRAL,</b> <b>MEDLINE,</b> <b>and</b> EMBASE from inception to 01 October 2014 and included randomized controlled trials. We identified one relevant randomized controlled trial with 50 participants receiving retinoic acid and 48 participants receiving no further therapy. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in overall survival (hazard ratio 0. 87, 95 % confidence interval 0. 46 - 1. 63, P= 0. 66) and event-free survival (hazard ratio 0. 86, 95 % confidence interval 0. 50 - 1. 49, P= 0. 59). We did not identify results for other outcomes, including toxicity. The difference in overall and event-free survival between treatment alternatives was not statistically significantly different. Based on the currently available evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of retinoic acid after bone marrow transplantation in patients with high-risk neuroblastom...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The term {{anchorage}} in {{orthodontic treatment}} {{refers to the}} control of unwanted tooth movement. This is conventionally provided either by anchor sites within the mouth, such as the teeth and the palate or from outside the mouth (headgear). Orthodontic implants which are surgically inserted to bone in the mouth are increasingly being used as an alternative form of anchorage reinforcement in orthodontics. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this review was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of surgical methods for preventing unwanted tooth movement compared with conventional anchorage reinforcement techniques. The secondary objectives were to examine patient acceptance, discomfort and failure rates associated with these techniques. SEARCH STRATEGY The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, <b>CENTRAL,</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> <b>and</b> EMBASE were searched. No language restrictions were applied. Authors were identified and contacted to identify unpublished trials. The most recent search was conducted in February 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving the use of surgically assisted means of anchorage reinforcement on orthodontic patients. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied when considering the studies to be included in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data extraction was performed by two review authors working independently using a previously piloted data collection form. Data were entered into RevMan with planned analysis of mean differences (MD) and 95...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of rehabilitation programmes following surgical repair of the rotator cuff with emphasis upon length of immobilisation and timing of introduction of load. Methods: An electronic search of <b>CENTRAL,</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> <b>and</b> PEDro was undertaken to August 2014 and supplemented by hand searching. Randomised controlled trials were included, quality appraised using the PEDro scale and synthesised via meta-analysis or narrative synthesis, based upon levels of evidence, where appropriate. Results: Twelve studies were included. There is strong evidence that early initiation of rehabilitation does not adversely affect clinical outcome but there is a marginally higher, statistically non-significant, incidence of tendon re-tear (OR 1. 3; 95 % CI 0. 72 to 2. 2). There is strong evidence that initiation of functional loading early in the rehabilitation programme does not adversely affect clinical outcome. Discussion: Concern about early initiation of rehabilitation and introduction of gradual functional load does not appear warranted but this should be considered in a context of potential for Type II error. There is further need to evaluate approaches that foster early initiation of rehabilitation and gradual introduction of functional load as well as considering key outcomes such as return to work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Controversy {{persists}} regarding medicinal injections for mechanical neck disorders (MNDs). Objectives: To {{determine the}} effectiveness of physician-delivered injections on pain, function/disability, quality of life, global perceived effect and patient satisfaction for adults with MNDs. Search Methods: We updated our previous searches of <b>CENTRAL,</b> <b>MEDLINE</b> <b>and</b> EMBASE from December 2006 through to March 2012. Selection Criteria: We included randomized controlled trials of adults with neck disorders treated by physician-delivered injection therapies. Data Collection and Analysis: Two authors independently selected articles, abstracted data and assessed methodological quality. When clinical heterogeneity was absent, we combined studies using random-effects models. Results: We included 12 trials (667 participants). No high or moderate quality studies were found with evidence of benefit over control. Moderate quality evidence suggests little or no difference in pain or function/disability between nerve block injection of steroid and bupivacaine vs bupivacaine alone at short, intermediate and long-term for chronic neck pain. We found limited very low quality evidence of an effect on pain with intramuscular lidocaine vs control for chronic myofascial neck pain. Two low quality studies showed an effect on pain with anaesthetic nerve block vs saline immediately post treatment and in the short-term. All other studies were of low or very low quality with no evidence o...|$|R
