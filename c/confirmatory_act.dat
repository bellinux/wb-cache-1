5000|$|Prior to the {{overthrow}} of the Hawaiian monarchy, the Hawaiian monarchs had access to 1.8 million acres (7,300 km²), the private lands of Kamehameha III which he set aside for the dignity of the royal office for the ruler of the Hawaiian Monarchy on 8 March 1848 during the Great Mahele. Kamehameha III and his successors made these lands their private property, selling, leasing or mortgaging at their enjoyment. At the death of Kamehameha IV, it was decided by the Kingdom's Supreme Court that under the above-mentioned instrument executed by Kamehameha III, reserving the Crown Lands, and under the <b>confirmatory</b> <b>Act</b> of 7 June 1848, [...] "the inheritance is limited to the successors to the throne", [...] "the wearers of the crown which the conqueror had won," [...] and {{that at the same time}} [...] "each successive possessor may regulate and dispose of the same according to his will and pleasure as private property, in like manner as was done by Kamehameha III." [...] Afterwards an Act was passed 3 January 1865, [...] "relieve the Royal Domain from encumbrances and to render the same inalienable." [...] This Act provided for the redemption of the mortgages on the estate, and enacted that the remaining lands are to be [...] "henceforth inalienable and shall descend to the heirs and successors of the Hawaiian Crown forever," [...] and that [...] "it shall not be lawful hereafter to lease said lands for any terms of years to exceed thirty." [...] The Board of Commissioners of Crown Lands shall consist of three persons to be appointed by His Majesty the King, two of whom shall be appointed from among the members of His Cabinet Council, and serve without remuneration, and the other shall act as Land Agent, and shall be paid out of the revenues of the said lands, such sum as may be agreed to by the King." ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the case study}} of four student teachers, examining {{the ways in which}} a particular kind of feedback—namely, <b>confirmatory</b> feedback—can <b>act</b> as a catalyst for some of the learning and potential change student teachers in a teaching practice group may experience on an initial teacher education programme. It illustrates how one piece of confirmatory feedback given to the student teacher, Jake, during post-observation feedback sessions has been influential not just for him but also for his peers. The article shows how this kind of feedback can be particularly effective when it is specific and detailed. It also exemplifies confirmatory feedback and considers the implications of such feedback for the field of teacher education...|$|R
40|$|Sermon {{discourse}} is a discourse of speech that contains of religious matters. This kind of discourse usually contain of advises {{spoken to the}} community by a religious scholar. This kind of discourse affects on the interlocutors. In order to influence the interlocutors, the speaker of this {{discourse is}} believed to apply several kinds of speech acts. What kind of speech acts used in the discourse of Friday sermon is discussed in this paper. The method used in the data collection was a gathering method, meanwhile, the technique used was recording method. Based on the result, it is shown that the discourse of Friday sermon at Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, used three kinds of speech acts, such as: representative, directive, expressive, comissive, and <b>confirmatory</b> speech <b>acts.</b> Keywords: speech act, sermon of Friday prayer...|$|R
40|$|We {{translated}} the Canadian residential long term care {{versions of the}} Alberta Context Tool (ACT) and the Conceptual Research Utilization (CRU) Scale into German, to study the association between organizational context factors and research utilization in German nursing homes. The rigorous translation process was based on best practice guidelines for tool translation, and we previously published methods and results of this process in two papers. Both instruments are self-report questionnaires used with care providers working in nursing homes. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the factor structure, reliability, and measurement invariance (MI) between care provider groups responding to these instruments. In a stratified random sample of 38 nursing homes in one German region (Metropolregion Rhein-Neckar), we collected questionnaires from 273 care aides, 196 regulated nurses, 152 allied health providers, 6 quality improvement specialists, 129 clinical leaders, and 65 nursing students. The factor structure was assessed using confirmatory factor models. The first model included all ten ACT concepts. We also decided a priori to run two separate models for the scale-based and the count-based ACT concepts as suggested by the instrument developers. The fourth model included the five CRU Scale items. Reliability scores were calculated based on the parameters of the best-fitting factor models. Multiple-group confirmatory factor models were used to assess MI between provider groups. Rather than the hypothesized ten-factor structure of the <b>ACT,</b> <b>confirmatory</b> factor models suggested thirteen factors. The one-factor solution of the CRU Scale was confirmed. The reliability was acceptable (>. 7 in the entire sample and in all provider groups) for 10 of 13 ACT concepts, and high (. 90 –. 96) for the CRU Scale. We could demonstrate partial strong MI for both ACT models and partial strict MI for the CRU Scale. Our results suggest that the scores of the German ACT and the CRU Scale for nursing homes are acceptably reliable and valid. However, as the ACT lacked strict MI, observed variables (or scale scores based on them) cannot be compared between provider groups. Rather, group comparisons should be based on latent variable models, which consider the different residual variances of each group...|$|R
