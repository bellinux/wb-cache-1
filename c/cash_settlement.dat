5|$|After Kaga left Nintendo, {{he founded}} a studio called Tirnanog and began {{development}} on a game titled Emblem Saga, a strategy role-playing {{game for the}} PlayStation. The game bore multiple similarities to the Fire Emblem series, and Nintendo {{filed a lawsuit against}} Tirnanog for copyright infringement. The first suit failed, and the court ruled in Tirnanog's favor. Nintendo filed a second lawsuit, and this time was awarded a <b>cash</b> <b>settlement</b> of ¥76 million. Nevertheless, Tirnanog and publisher Enterbrain were still allowed to publish the title, though they changed its name to Tear Ring Saga, and eventually developed a sequel. Nintendo attempted taking a third lawsuit to the Japanese Supreme Court in 2005, but the second ruling was upheld.|$|E
5|$|Bure left Moscow {{with his}} father and brother on September 6, 1991, staying {{temporarily}} in Los Angeles. His mother arrived shortly afterward. The Canucks began negotiating a contract with Bure, but before one could be finalized, the issue of his existing contract with the Central Red Army had to be settled. The Canucks management and officials from the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation met in late-October 1991 in a Detroit court, where they bartered for a <b>cash</b> <b>settlement.</b> After the Canucks offered US$200,000, Bure stood up in the courtroom to offer an additional $50,000, bringing the total to $250,000. The Soviet officials accepted, and Canucks management paid the full $250,000. Bure signed a four-year contract worth a reported $2.7 million with an $800,000 signing bonus. The deal made Bure the Canucks' second highest paid player behind team captain Trevor Linden.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} European double barrier basket call {{options on}} two underlyings with an upper {{and a lower}} knock-out barrier featuring {{a finite number of}} <b>cash</b> <b>settlements</b> at prespecified values of the underlyings between the strike and the upper barrier. The bilaterally constrained <b>cash</b> <b>settlements</b> are considered as controls that have to be chosen such that the Delta of the option is {{as close as possible to}} a predefined constant profit/loss. This leads to a control constrained optimal control problem for the two-dimensional Black-Scholes equation with Dirichlet boundary control and finite time control. Based on the variational formulation of the problem in an appropriate Sobolev space setting, we prove the existence of a unique solution and state the first order necessary optimality conditions. A semi-discretization in space by conforming P 1 finite elements with respect to a simplicial triangulation of the computational domain gives rise to a semi-discrete control constrained optimal control problem for a linear system of first order ordinary differential equations. A further discretization in time by the backward Euler scheme results in a fully discrete optimization problem that is solved numerically by the projected gradient method with Armijo line search. Numerical examples for some selected test cases illustrate the benefits of hedging with European double barrier basket options in case of optimally controlled <b>cash</b> <b>settlements...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>settlements</b> {{became a}} popular design feature in {{convertible}} securities once they obtained favorable accounting treatment for diluted {{earnings per share}} in 2002. The unexpected proliferation of <b>cash</b> <b>settlements</b> provoked the FASB to eliminate their favorable accounting treatment in 2008. We find that shareholders of firms that use cash-settled convertibles react negatively to the announcement of these recent changes. Firms that issued cash-settled convertible debt to avoid earnings dilution no longer {{have an incentive to}} keep them on their balance sheets. Consistent with this observation, we find that investors respond more favorably if the cash-settled convertibles of these firms include call features. We conclude that call features can be valuable in times of uncertainty related to possible accounting changes as they allow the firm to efficiently mitigate the effects of the accounting changes on their financial reporting...|$|R

25|$|William Penn {{was asked}} to {{adjudicate}} the matter and he awarded 90% of the claim to Billinge and the remaining 10% and a <b>cash</b> <b>settlement</b> to Fenwick for his share. Fenwick was dissatisfied with Penn's judgement and refused {{to abide by the}} decision; essentially Fenwick had no assurance that a previously bankrupt man would convey ten percent of the net proceeds of the future venture since he had not even paid the adjudicated <b>cash</b> <b>settlement.</b> So Fenwick organized a colony of settlers and sailed to the Delaware Bay where he settled as Patroon on the eastern shore near the abandoned Swedish settlement of Fort Nya Elfsborg and set himself up as the local governor of the fifth Tenth (approximately 20% of the original Billinge property), issuing land patents and enforcing his own laws in defiance of Billinge and Penn. Billinge countered by suing Fenwick, causing uncertainty in the chain of land title. The economic damages to those who controlled property within and near Salem caused many injured persons over the next decade to declare a long line of complaints and lawsuits in the colonial courts. To preserve Salem, its inhabitants and their property, Fenwick remained under arrest for months until copies of documents proving his claims were obtained from England. Fenwick ultimately proved the right of his claim in the court of Dominion Governor Andros, and returned to govern the Salem tenth by 1689. Salem remained as a settlement and continued growing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>settlement</b> − a {{cash payment}} is made {{based on the}} {{underlying}} reference rate, such as a short-term interest rate index such as 90 Day T-Bills, or the closing value of a stock market index. The parties settle by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash when the contract expires. Cash settled futures are those that, as a practical matter, could not be settled by delivery of the referenced item—for example, {{it would be impossible}} to deliver an index. A futures contract might also opt to settle against an index based on trade in a related spot market. ICE Brent futures use this method.|$|E

25|$|By 1924, Laurel {{had given}} up the stage for {{full-time}} film work, under contract with Joe Rock for 12 two-reel comedies.

In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a <b>cash</b> <b>settlement</b> and a one-way ticket back to her native Australia, which she accepted.

25|$|Some LGBT {{military}} personnel sought {{to overturn the}} military's ban on service by homosexuals. Among the earliest were Leonard Matlovich, who fought {{to remain in the}} Air Force after coming out in 1975, and Perry Watkins, who was drafted in 1967 despite disclosing his homosexuality on his induction papers. District Court judge Gerhard Gesell ordered Matlovich's reinstatement in 1980. Rather than return Matlovich to duty, the Air Force offered him a <b>cash</b> <b>settlement</b> of $160,000, which Matlovich accepted. The Army tried to discharge Watkins several times, until the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordered his reinstatement in 1989 and the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The appellate court, however, did not rule the military policy unconstitutional in Watkins's case. Rather, it decided that simple equity mandated that the Army could not discharge Watkins for homosexuality when it knew of his sexual orientation all along. Other high-profile discharges included those of Vernon Berg, III, Keith Meinhold, and Tracy Thorne from the Navy; Joseph Steffan from the Naval Academy; Margarethe Cammermeyer from the Washington National Guard; and Miriam Ben-Shalom from the Army Reserve.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit {{began to}} emerge as a {{political}} force in the late 1960s and early 1970s, shortly after the first graduates returned home. They formed new politically active associations in the early 1970s, starting with the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (Inuit Brotherhood and today known as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami), {{an outgrowth of the}} Indian and Eskimo Association of the '60s, in 1971, and more region specific organizations shortly afterwards, including the Committee for the Original People's Entitlement (representing the Inuvialuit), the Northern Quebec Inuit Association (Makivik Corporation) and the Labrador Inuit Association (LIA) representing Northern Labrador Inuit. Since the mid-1980s the Southern Labrador Inuit of NunatuKavut began organizing politically after being geographically cut out of the LIA, however, for political expediency the organization was erroneously called the Labrador Métis Nation. These various activist movements began to change the direction of Inuit society in 1975 with the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. This comprehensive land claims settlement for Quebec Inuit, along with a large <b>cash</b> <b>settlement</b> and substantial administrative autonomy in the new region of Nunavik, set the precedent for the settlements to follow. The northern Labrador Inuit submitted their land claim in 1977, although they had to wait until 2005 to have a signed land settlement establishing Nunatsiavut. Southern Labrador Inuit of NunatuKavut are currently in the process of establishing landclaims and title rights {{that would allow them to}} negotiate with the Newfoundland Government.|$|E
50|$|The dissent concluded:The {{majority}} today {{departs from}} the settled approach separating patent and antitrust law, weakens the protections afforded to innovators by patents, frustrates {{the public policy}} in favor of settling, and likely undermines the very policy it seeks to promote by forcing generics who step into the litigation ring {{to do so without}} the prospect of <b>cash</b> <b>settlements.</b> I would keep things as they were and not subject basic questions of patent law to an unbounded inquiry under antitrust law, with its treble damages and famously burdensome discovery.|$|R
