5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> accidentally or as {{an attempt}} to end one's life. CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating. It is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter. This <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> from motor vehicles, heaters, or cooking equipment that run on carbon-based fuels. It can also occur from exposure to methylene chloride. Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) preventing the blood from carrying oxygen. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected. Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.|$|E

40|$|In this paper  the modified  Schrödinger  equation  (MSE)   for  the particles with mass =  mass  of  the  human  neuron  is  obtained  and  solved. Considering  that neuron mass  is of the order of Planck mass  it was shown that for mass of the order of the human neuron mass the transition quantum  →  classical behavior <b>can</b> <b>occurs.</b> Moreover  it was argued that the human brain can be described as the fluid of the Planck particles. It  is  interesting to observe that the Planck gas was created at the beginning of the Universe...|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of aluminium to Fe-high Mn TWIP steels {{is because it}} increases SFE significantly and therefore stabilizes the austenite against phase transformations which <b>can</b> <b>occurs</b> in the Fe-Mn alloys during deformation.

5|$|Severe {{thunderstorms}} {{can sometimes}} produce hail, very strong straight line winds and tornadoes. Very heavy rainfall from thunderstorms {{can result in}} flash flooding. Thunderstorms occur most often during the summer but <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> {{at any time of}} the year.|$|E

5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. Though this is not always the case, genetic mutations <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis. In these cases, called germline mutations, the mutation will be present in the single-celled zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell, and the condition can be inherited by the next generation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} changes <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> to {{mitochondria}} during the aging process. Tissues from elderly patients show {{a decrease in}} enzymatic activity of the proteins of the respiratory chain. However, mutated mtDNA can only be found in about 0.2% of very old cells. Large deletions in the mitochondrial genome have been hypothesized to lead {{to high levels of}} oxidative stress and neuronal death in Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{squall line}} (also {{known as a}} quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> where the squall line is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E
