The French began to hack at the abatis and a Hessian sentry came out and asked who was there. When there was no response, the sentry opened fire as did other Hessians on the parapet. The French soldiers fired back, and then <b>charged</b> <b>the</b> redoubt. The Germans <b>charged</b> <b>the</b> Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley, driving them back. The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some barrels but threw down their arms and surrendered when the French prepared a bayonet charge.|$|E

5000|$|Conductive metal objects contain mobile {{electric}} charges (electrons) {{that can}} move about freely in the metal. [...] In an uncharged state, {{each part of}} the metal contains equal quantities of positive and negative charges, intimately mixed, so no part of it has a net charge. If an external charged object is brought near a piece of metal, the force of <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> causes these internal charges to separate. [...] <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> of opposite polarity to <b>the</b> external <b>charge</b> are attracted to it, and move {{to the surface of the}} object facing <b>the</b> <b>charge.</b> <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> of <b>the</b> same polarity are repelled and move to the surface of the metal away from <b>the</b> <b>charge.</b> This is called electrostatic induction. In Procedure 2 above, as <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> C is lowered into <b>the</b> container, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> in <b>the</b> metal of the container separate. If C has a positive <b>charge,</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>charges</b> in <b>the</b> metal are attracted to it and move to the inner surface of the container, while <b>the</b> positive <b>charges</b> are repelled and move to the outside surface. If C has a negative <b>charge,</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> have opposite polarity. Since the container was originally uncharged, the two regions have equal and opposite <b>charges.</b> <b>The</b> induction process is reversible: in Procedure 4, when C is removed, the attraction of <b>the</b> opposite <b>charges</b> cause them to intermingle again, and <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> on <b>the</b> surfaces reduces to zero.|$|R
