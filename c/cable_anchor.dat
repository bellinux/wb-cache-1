40|$|Cable {{guardrail}} {{systems have}} been increasing in popularity in recent years due to several perceived benefits over the commonly used W-beam guardrail. A non-proprietary design was desired {{as an alternative to}} the many proprietary designs available. A non-proprietary, high-tension cable end terminal was necessary to accompany the non-proprietary, high-tension cable guardrail system under development. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for a non-proprietary, high-tension cable end terminal. An analysis of several cable guardrail end terminals was undertaken to identify any common features that may prove to be beneficial or detrimental to end terminal designs. Next, a study of the non-proprietary low-tension system was conducted to determine the cause of vehicle instabilities in full-scale testing. Since the high-tension and low-tension cable end terminal designs are similar, it is likely that any issues with the low-tension design will also be evident in testing of the high-tension design. LS-DYNA modeling of current cable terminal anchor hardware was then accomplished and compared to bogie testing results. The anchor model proved to be sufficiently accurate to preliminarily analyze alternative <b>cable</b> <b>anchor</b> designs. A final, optimized, high-tension <b>cable</b> <b>anchor</b> design was produced along with alternative terminal post recommendations for continuing development of the non-proprietary, high-tension cable end terminal.

A second deflection unit (9), diametrically opposite the first, is for winding and unwinding the third and fourth cables. USE - The actuator is for moving an object in relation to a fixed anchor e. g. for grippers, levers, flaps, slides and the movement of mechanical prostheses. (All claimed).

40|$|AbstractHigh-stress {{fractured}} surrounding rock roadway {{occupies a}} large proportion in mining roadways. In the high-stress fractured surrounding rock roadway, the main reason of roadway's instability and damage is the structural instability of support. How to improve the structural stability of support and the carrying capacity {{is very important for}} resolving the problem of high-stress fractured surrounding rock roadway bolt support. The paper is based on invalid principle of bolt support of high-stress fractured surrounding rock roadway. Aiming at the features of roadway damage, the paper proposes that the combined support technology of active support and passive support be adopted {{to solve the problem of}} high-stress fractured surrounding rock roadway through theory analysis. The primary support is the active support of <b>cable</b> <b>anchor</b> and gunite. The secondary support is the combined technology which is aided by closed bracket of double-deck I-beam combination to fill wall and grout surrounding rock of shallow roadway. Test at the underground reveals that the combined support technology can greatly improve the carrying capability of the shallow and deep surrounding rock so that it can satisfy the long-term stability of high-stress fractured surrounding rock roadway and reduce maintenance costs of mining roadway. Therefore it has significant economic benefit and extensive application prospect...|$|E

40|$|A non-proprietary, cable {{guardrail}} {{system is}} currently under {{development for the}} Midwest States Pooled Fund Program. A cable guardrail end terminal was necessary to accompany the cable guardrail system. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for the cable end terminal. Bogie testing that was previously completed on a design concept indicated delayed cable release, which was an undesired performance that led to vehicle instabilities. Several design changes were recommended for better end terminal performance and to reflect the changes made to the cable median barrier. An LS-DYNA model of the modified cable end terminal was developed. Simulations of 0 - and 15 -degree impacts {{on the end of}} the <b>cable</b> <b>anchor</b> bracket with a bogie model indicated that the cables would release easily and not induce vehicle instabilities. This behavior still needs to be verified through bogie and full-scale crash testing. Simulations of a 25 -degree reverse impact between post nos. 2 and 3 with small car models indicated that cables did not release easily and may interlock around the car resulting in excessive vehicle decelerations or instabilities. Simulations of various line post designs found that the MWP and weakened MWP have lower forces and energies during impact than the S 3 x 5. 7 posts used in previous three-cable end terminals. This finding would suggest improved performance with respect to vehicle override and instability. However, vehicle simulations with multiple line posts impacted were inconclusive. Further design modifications, evaluation, and testing are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Cable-based robots {{generally}} {{perform better}} than other parallel robots with rigid links in terms of wider workspace and higher acceleration of end-effector because of light weight of robot links. Cable robots allow easy installation for outside applications {{at the expense of}} the requirement of a precise assembly of its components at the <b>cable</b> <b>anchor</b> points. In this study, system identification and adaptive control of cable planar robots are considered. Firstly, a parametric model is developed for estimation of position errors of anchor points for fully-constrained and redundant planar cable robots. A novel method based on inclusion of virtual cables facilitates the linear separation of the uncertain parameters from the input-output signals for redundant planar robots. A least-squares and gradient based parameter estimation algorithm provide the estimates of the system parameters. Further, this work deals with the design and comparison of three adaptive position control schemes combined with a classical PID controller for fully constrained and redundant planar robots. Then, three Lyapunov based adaptive controllers based on the (i) sliding mode, (ii) PD and (iii) backstepping schemes are designed to compensate for the matrix uncertainties appear in the system dynamics resulting from errors in the anchor point locations. Next, the adaptive controllers are evaluated and compared with a classical PID controller through simulations for a desired 2 D singularity-free pose of the mobile platform. Supremacy of the PD control scheme over the aforementioned control schemes is observed through simulations. The least-squares algorithm is compared with the gradient-based method in terms of the speed of convergence of the estimated parameters as well. Finally, we establish linear parametric forms for common friction models, recursive least-squares on-line friction estimator is presented and adaptive friction compensation scheme is designed. The efficiency of this design is discussed via simulation results...|$|E
50|$|Initially {{developed}} to destroy naval mines, the paravane would be strung out and streamed alongside the towing ship, normally from the bow.

If the <b>anchor</b> <b>cable</b> would not part, the mine and the paravane would be brought together and the mine would explode harmlessly against the paravane. The cable could then be retrieved and a replacement paravane fitted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Effects of stiffness, {{carrying}} {{efficiency and}} fatigue {{of the end}} <b>anchor</b> <b>cable</b> on the mechanical behavior of long span cable-stayed bridge, were discussed respectively. Firstly, {{the concept of the}} effective stiffness and the stress ratio were introduced to discuss the effects of the dead load stress level and the stress ratio on the effective stiffness of the end <b>anchor</b> <b>cable.</b> Secondly, the effect of the cable material on the vertical carrying efficiency of the structure was analyzed. Finally, the main influential factors on the fatigue performance of the end <b>anchor</b> <b>cable</b> were analyzed in detail. It is shown that improving the dead load stress level and keeping the low stress ratio would increase the effective stiffness of the end <b>anchor</b> <b>cable.</b> The section of the end <b>anchor</b> <b>cable</b> effects on stiffness of the structure under high stress level. It can be drawn that as a novel material, The CFRP end <b>anchor</b> <b>cable</b> will increase the load carrying level of the long span cable-stayed bridges. It can also be concluded that the length of side span and main span, the height of pylon, the area of the cable section and the live load collection degree are all the main effective factors to the stress amplitude of the end <b>anchor</b> <b>cable.</b> It is suggested that in the practical design of large span cable-stayed bridge, all the effective factors together with the global state of the structure should be taken into account comprehensively...|$|R
