5|$|His earlier {{books as}} Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his {{doctoral}} {{expertise in the}} field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, <b>cocaine</b> <b>addiction,</b> the common cold, and AIDS. He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, {{during the}} time of {{shooting}} for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching movies every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a <b>cocaine</b> <b>addiction.</b> Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E
25|$|Later in life, Garcia was {{sometimes}} ill {{because of his}} diabetes, and in 1986 went into a diabetic coma that nearly cost him his life. Although his overall health improved somewhat after that, he continued to struggle with longstanding heroin and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions,</b> and was staying in a California drug rehabilitation facility when {{he died of a}} heart attack in August 1995 at the age of 53.|$|R
5000|$|While Argov's {{career was}} dotted with {{creative}} and personal lapses caused by his heroin and crack <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions,</b> his musical achievements overshadowed his personal problems. He {{was able to}} sing in live performances even {{under the influence of}} drugs. Argov was among the first singers to achieve commercial and nationwide success in the sphere of Middle Eastern-Mediterranean/oriental (Mizrahi)-style music, despite the fact that his music was not mainstream at the time and radio stations gave predominance to pop music from overseas.|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, his <b>cocaine</b> <b>addiction</b> intensified. Jennings {{claimed to have}} spent $1,500 a day on his habit, {{draining}} his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt with debt up to $2.5million. Though he insisted on repaying the debt and did additional tours to earn the funds, his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated. Jennings decided to quit his addictions, leased {{a home in the}} Phoenix area, and spent a month detoxing himself, intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward. In 1984, he quit cocaine. Jennings claimed that his son Shooter was his main inspiration to quit permanently.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{inheritance}} {{was running}} out. Trying to earn money, {{he was hired}} by George Montagu Bennett, the Earl of Tankerville, to help protect him from witchcraft; recognising Bennett's paranoia as being based in his <b>cocaine</b> <b>addiction,</b> Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice. Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism. Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as Ambergris, Clouds Without Water, and Konx Om Pax, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, The World's Tragedy. Recognising the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in Vanity Fair, a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris. He also wrote Liber 777, a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.|$|E
25|$|Curtis {{developed}} a heavy <b>cocaine</b> <b>addiction</b> in 1974 while filming Lepke, {{at a time}} when his stardom had declined considerably and he was being offered few film roles. In 1984, Curtis {{was rushed to the hospital}} suffering from advanced cirrhosis as a result of his alcoholism and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addiction.</b> He then entered the Betty Ford Clinic and vowed to overcome his various illnesses. He underwent heart bypass surgery in 1994, after suffering a heart attack.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Preston {{was arrested}} and convicted for {{insurance}} fraud after setting fire to his own house in Los Angeles, and he was treated for alcohol and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions.</b> In the same year, he was also arrested for sexually assaulting a 16-year-old Mexican boy, after picking him up at a gathering point for day laborers. After submitting to a drug test, he tested positive for cocaine. That year, he entered no-contest pleas to the cocaine and sexual assault charges. He was sentenced to nine months at a drug rehabilitation center and three months of house arrest.|$|R
50|$|Merson {{started playing}} poker with {{neighborhood}} friends in 2003. He attended the University of Maryland {{for two and}} a half semesters before dropping out to play poker.

He resided in Laurel, Maryland until Black Friday, when he established residence in Toronto. He also briefly lived in Atlantic City, New Jersey. His mother's name is Donna and he has a brother. Merson overcame both marijuana and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions</b> before winning the World Series of Poker.|$|R
50|$|Perrett re-emerged in 1994 {{with a new}} {{band called}} The One. The band {{released}} their debut EP Cultured Palate via their manager's record label Dwarf Records, before signing to Demon Records and releasing their debut album Woke up Sticky in 1996. The band split up that same year, with Perrett disappearing again until April 2004 when he made an appearance on stage with the Libertines. He also appeared on stage with his sons Jamie and Peter Jr.'s band Love Minus Zero. Long hiatuses in his music career have been ascribed to his enduring struggles with heroin and crack <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions.</b>|$|R

5000|$|By 1978, Grillo was in {{deep trouble}} with the Gambino family. Suffering from {{gambling}} and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions,</b> he found himself heavily in debt to DeMeo. To avoid missing his payments to DeMeo, he was constantly borrowing from other loansharks. The drugs and financial stress was apparently making Grillo act erratically. This behavior convinced DeMeo and his superior, Anthony Gaggi, that Grillo was weak and would fold under police pressure if arrested. Montiglio attempted to help Grillo, risking his own life to do it. On one occasion, Montiglio ripped up $50,000 worth of debt markers that Danny had acquired during a night of gambling at Gambino party. DeMeo confronted Montiglio about Danny's behavior, and made statements that implied Grillo {{did not have much}} time left.|$|R
50|$|The rematch proved {{unable to}} live up to the original, as Arguello seemed spent and as if he did not have his heart in the fight. Pryor won by a 10th-round knockout, and both fighters retired {{following}} the bout. Both would later come out of retirement, both men being driven by financial problems and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions.</b> Both enjoyed a fair amount of success in doing so, perhaps most famously when Arguello knocked out former champion Billy Costello in four rounds. Pryor was also largely successful in his comebacks, although he would suffer the only loss of his career in one of them. Eventually, it was discovered during a medical test that Pryor had significantly lost vision in one of his eyes, and after that he was denied a boxing license.|$|R

25|$|The disappointing {{reception}} that New York, New York received drove Scorsese into depression.

It {{was held at the}} Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Paul Butterfield, Neil Diamond, Ronnie Wood, and Eric Clapton. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978.|$|E

For many women, becoming a mother is seen as one of life’s most rewarding experiences—one that they may look toward from their own very childhoods. Having children changes not only how women view their own personal lives, but also how they see themselves in a broader social context (Stenius, Veysey, Hamiliton & Anderson, 2005). For the addicted mother, this role becomes a source of ambiguity, strain and conflict when she finds herself trying to choose between being a mother and using substances (Brady, Black & Greenfield, 2009).

25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1981, Marvin Gaye had {{relocated}} to Ostend, Belgium, {{following the end of}} a European tour amid financial difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service and the end of his second marriage. Struggling with depression and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addiction,</b> Gaye had agreed to move to Ostend on the advice of longtime resident Freddy Cousaert. While in Ostend, Gaye began to curb his drug use and recover from his depression, partaking in Ostend's beaches. Gaye also began cutting ties with his longtime recording label, Motown, following the release of In Our Lifetime, an album the musician did not declare to be finished. He declared that he would never record with the label ever again after he accused the label of betraying his creativity.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} album, Come Taste the Band, {{was released}} in October 1975, one month before Bolin's Teaser album. Despite mixed reviews and so-so sales (#19 in the UK charts and #43 in the US Billboard charts), the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their hard rock sound. Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album's material. Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to manifest themselves. During the Come Taste the Band tour, many fans openly booed Tommy's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction. At this same time, as he would admit in interviews years later, Hughes was suffering from a <b>cocaine</b> <b>addiction.</b> After several below-par concert performances, the band was in danger.|$|E
25|$|Tony marries Elvira {{and becomes}} the dealer of Sosa's supplies. He builds a multimillion-dollar empire, {{living in a}} vast, heavily guarded estate. By 1983, however, Tony becomes {{unsatisfied}} with his lifestyle and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addiction.</b> His money launderer demands a greater percentage, while Manny resents Tony's growing paranoia and abusive treatment of Elvira. A sting by federal agents results in Tony being charged with tax evasion, with an inevitable prison sentence. Sosa offers to use his government connections to keep a desperate Tony out of prison, but only if Tony assassinates a journalist intending to expose Sosa. Later, Tony, during a public dinner, accuses Manny of causing his arrest and Elvira of being an infertile junkie, causing Elvira to leave him. He travels to New York City {{to carry out the}} assassination with Sosa's henchman, Alberto, who plants a bomb on the journalist's car. However, the journalist is unexpectedly accompanied by his wife and children. Disgusted, Tony kills Alberto and returns to Miami.|$|E
5000|$|Garcia and Adams {{separated}} in 1975 after {{he began a}} relationship with filmmaker Deborah Koons. Although Garcia and Adams reconciled after the dissolution {{of his relationship with}} Koons in 1977, they stopped cohabiting a year later (save for occasional holiday reunions) due to the guitarist's heroin and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions.</b> After marrying [...] "partly for tax purposes and partly out of a fond flickering of a once-bright romance" [...] in late 1981, this arrangement persisted until Garcia entered a diabetic coma in 1986. While this led to a lengthy period of cohabitation in which Carolyn Garcia played an integral role in her husband's recovery, they gradually drifted apart once more when Garcia began an extramarital relationship and fathered a child with Manasha Matheson. Jerry and Carolyn Garcia divorced in 1994, but remained friends until his death. During this period, he rekindled his relationship with Koons, who had been largely out of his life since the late 1970s; they would ultimately marry in February 1994. A month after the Grateful Dead's summer 1995 tour concluded, Garcia died at a rehabilitation facility in August 1995.|$|R

At Otatara Pa in 2004 Walsh said, [...] "This is a special place, and it is very special to me. It was here on a visit many years ago, up on the hills, that I had a moment of clarity. I don't understand it, but I reconnected with my soul, and I remembered who I used to be. I admitted I had problems and I had to do something about it. It was the beginning of my recovery from my addiction to alcohol and drugs, and when I got back to America it gave me the courage to seek help." ...|$|R

5|$|According to Crowley, Reuss {{had named}} him {{head of the}} O.T.O. upon his death, but this was {{challenged}} by {{a leader of the}} German O.T.O., Heinrich Tränker. Tränker called the Hohenleuben Conference in Thuringia, Germany, which Crowley attended. There, prominent members like Karl Germer and Martha Küntzel championed Crowley's leadership, but other key figures like Albin Grau, Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tränker by opposing it, resulting in a split in the O.T.O. Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic. Throughout, he was dogged by poor health, largely caused by his heroin and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions.</b> In 1928, Crowley was introduced to young Englishman Israel Regardie, who embraced Thelema and became Crowley's secretary for the next three years. That year, Crowley also met Gerald Yorke, who began organising Crowley's finances but never became a Thelemite. He also befriended Thomas Driberg; Driberg did not accept Thelema either. It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works, Magick in Theory and Practice, which received little attention at the time.|$|R
40|$|Most common SNPs are popularly {{assumed to}} be neutral. We here {{developed}} novel methods to examine in animal models and humans whether extreme amount of minor alleles (MAs) carried by an individual may represent extreme trait values and common diseases. We analyzed panels of genetic reference populations and identified the MAs in each panel and the MA content (MAC) that each strain carried. We also analyzed 21 published GWAS datasets of human diseases and identified the MAC of each case or control. MAC was nearly linearly linked to quantitative variations in numerous traits in model organisms, including life span, tumor susceptibility, learning and memory, sensitivity to alcohol and anti-psychotic drugs, and two correlated traits poor reproductive fitness and strong immunity. Similarly, in Europeans or European Americans, enrichment of MAs of fast but not slow evolutionary rate was linked to autoimmune and numerous other diseases, including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, psychiatric disorders, alcohol and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addictions,</b> cancer, and less life span. Therefore, both high and low MAC correlated with extreme values in many traits, indicating stabilizing selection on most MAs.
