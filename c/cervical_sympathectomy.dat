40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{develop a}} method for the {{detection}} of bilateral Horner's syndrome in patients with bilateral interruption of the cervical sympathetic pathway or widespread autonomic neuropathy.  METHODS—Darkness pupil diameters and redilatation times during light reflexes have been recorded with infrared TV pupillometry in 65 healthy subjects, 47 patients with unilateral Horner's syndrome, and 20 patients with bilateral Horner's syndrome. The aetiologies of the last group were diabetic autonomic neuropathy (three cases), amyloidosis (four), pure autonomic failure (PAF) (four), dopamine-β-hydroxylase deficiency (two), and one case each of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) type III, carcinomatous sympathetic neuropathy, familial dysautonomia, multiple system atrophy, Anderson-Fabry disease, and anterior spinal artery thrombosis at C 5, 6 and one had had bilateral <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomies.</b>  RESULTS—Darkness diameters on the affected side were below normal in 12 patients with unilateral Horner's syndrome, the measurement yielding only 26 % sensitivity for detection of the condition. By contrast, the time taken to reach three quarter recovery in the light reflex (T 3 / 4) was abnormally prolonged (redilatation lag) in 33 of the same eyes. The measurement yielded 70 % sensitivity and 95 % specificity for detection of the condition. In 20 cases, diagnosed on clinical grounds as having bilateral Horner's syndrome of various aetiologies, pupil diameters were abnormally small on both sides in five and on one side in three patients. Fourteen of these patients had significant redilatation lag in both eyes, five patients in one eye, and one patient had it in neither eye. Measurement of redilatation lag was therefore a more sensitive diagnostic test than pupil diameter in both unilateral and bilateral Horner's syndrome.  CONCLUSIONS—Provided that the pupils are not tonic, bilateral Horner's syndrome can be diagnosed on the basis of redilatation lag. It occurs clinically in some generalised autonomic neuropathies and with interruption of the local sympathetic nerve supplies to the two eyes. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{asked to}} what extent {{pulmonary}} innervation influences the postnatal development of the lung. To this end we performed <b>cervical</b> vagotomy and <b>sympathectomy</b> either on the right or {{on the left side}} in young rats and rabbits and rats after weaning. One to four weeks later we examined the lungs of the denervated side, the contralateral intact side of the same animal, and sham-operated controls. Dry lung weight, lung volume and the size of subpleural alveoli were not different among the three groups. Lung mechanical properties (static and dynamic lung compliances, lung resistance, frequency dependence of compliance), measured in rabbits, were also not different among groups of lungs, suggesting that neither central nor peripheral airways were markedly affected by the denervation. The breathing pattern, measured in the rats after weaning, was characterized by a larger tidal volume in the denervated animals than in controls, as expected after the partial pulmonary afferent denervation. The absence of major structural and functional changes in the lungs of these animals suggests that an increase in the mechanical stretch to the lung above that normally occurring during resting breathing does not influence the lung structure. We conclude that pulmonary innervation does not {{play an important role in}} the postnatal development of the lung...|$|R

40|$|There is a diurnal rhythm in the {{activity}} of serotonin N-acetyltransferase in the rat pineal gland. In the normal rat, the nocturnal enzyme activities are 15 -to 30 -fold greater than are daytime activities. This rhythm is abolished by decentralization or removal of the superior cervical ganglia, procedures that interrupt {{the only source of}} central neural input to the pineal gland. This effect of superior <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy</b> on the N-acetyltransferase rhythm cannot be attributed to changes occurring in the denervated pineal parenchymal cells. When chronically denervated glands are placed in organ culture with norepinephrine, the neurotransmitter normally located in sympathetic terminals in the gland, N-acetyltransferase activity increases 10 - to 20 -fold. These data indicate that superior <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy</b> abolishes the N-acetyltransferase rhythm by elimination of the input of central signals to the gland. These signals appear to regulate the N-acetyltransferase rhythm in the normal rat by regulation of the release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic terminals within the pineal gland...|$|E

40|$|Repeated {{invasive}} electrophysiological {{studies in}} a 7 -year-old {{boy with the}} classic Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome disclosed increased ventricular refractoriness, unusual late diastolic endocardial waveforms, and the inability to induce ventricular fibrillation. Despite apparently beneficial electrophysiological responses to left stellate block, surgical left <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy</b> was followed by spontaneous ventricular fibrillation, an unchanged QT interval and ventricular refractoriness, and persistence of late diastolic endocardial waveforms. These electrophysiological observations, which are unique, may reflect temporal and spatial inhomogeneity of repolarisation resulting from cardiac autonomic imbalance. The absence of electrophysiological change despite left stellate block is disconcerting and re-emphasises our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of syndromes involving long QT intervals.

40|$|Nasal airway {{resistance}} was assessed in halothane-anesthetized rats {{by measuring the}} transnasal pressure at constant airflow through both nasal cavities. Low inflation pressure (2. 5 - 5 cm H 2 O) decreased nasal {{airway resistance}}, whereas higher inflation pressures (10 - 20 cm H 2 O) caused a biphasic response: an initial increase in resistance followed by decrease in resistance. The nasal responses to all levels of inflation where completely abolished by hexamethonium, guanethidine, or bretylium pretreatment or <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy</b> and greatly lessened by cervical vagotomy or phenoxybenzamine pretreatment. Atropine and propranolol pretreatments {{had no effect on}} the responses.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the sympathetic nervous system on the cerebral circulatory response to graded reductions in mean arterial blood pressure was studied in anesthetized baboons. Cerebral blood flow {{was measured by the}} 133 Xe clearance method, and arterial blood pressure was decreased by controlled hemorrhage. In normal baboons, the constancy of cerebral blood flow was maintained until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 65 % of the base-line value; thereafter, cerebral blood flow decreased when arterial blood pressure was reduced. Superior <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy</b> of 2 - 3 weeks duration did not affect the normal response. In contrast, both acute surgical sympathectomy (cervical trunk division) and a-receptor blockade (1. 5 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine) enhanced the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of hemorrhagic hypotension in that cerebral blood flow did not decrease until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 35 % of the base-line value. The results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is not involved in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow {{in the face of a}} fall in arterial blood pressure. Indeed, the implication is that the sympathicoadrenal discharge accompanyin...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study the effect of sympathetic innervation on morphological and histochemical aspects of skeletal muscle tissue. Rabbit masseter muscle was studied using histochemical and immunohistochemical methods for periods of up to 18 months post-sympathectomy. The morphological and enzymatic characteristics of control masseter muscles were similar on both the left and right sides. The main features were muscle fibres with a mosaic pattern and a predominance of type IIa fibres, followed by type I. Type IIb fibres showed very low frequency. Sympathectomized animals showed varying degrees of metabolic and morphological alterations, especially 18 months after sympathectomy. The first five groups showed a higher frequency of type I fibres, whilst the oldest group showed a higher frequency of type IIb fibres. In the oldest group, a significant variation in fibre diameter was observed. Many fibres showed small diameter, atrophy, hypertrophy, splitting, and necrosis. Areas with fibrosis were observed. Thus <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy</b> induced morphological alterations in the masseter muscles. These alterations were, in part, similar to both denervation and myopathy. These findings indicate that sympathetic innervation contributes to the maintenance of the morphological and metabolic features of masseter muscle fibres...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Long-term {{records of}} the number of food {{approaches}} per 30 min were obtained from 16 rabbits in constant light and after blinding. Optic nerve sectioning usually resulted in a shortening of the free-running period (&tau;; mean reduction =- 0. 26 hr) of the oscillator governing the rabbit’s food intake pattern. Subsequent resection of both superior cervical ganglia always reduced this &tau; (mean =- 0. 41 hr), and it could be further shortened (mean =- 0. 24 hr) by chronic administration of melatonin. These observations led to experiments in which the food intake of 15 blinded rabbits was recorded before and after pinealectomy. This always resulted in a lengthening of &tau; (mean = + 0. 27 hr), which was never seen after subtotal or sham pinealectomy in 10 other blinded animals (mean =- 0. 05 hr). Sympathectomy also reduced &tau; (mean =- 0. 50 hr) in the pinealectomized rabbits, whereas it induced a smaller reduction (mean =- 0. 29 hr) after sham pinealectomy. These results, together with previous observations on the effect of sympathectomy on the retinal "dark " discharge and on the influence of the latter upon the food intake pattern, indicate that the cervical sympathetic nerves may form part of three feedback loops for the rabbit’s central circadian system. These have separate postganglionic pathways; there are also differences in the circadian phasing of their activities and in their effects on &tau;. In a previous investigation (Bobbert et al., 1988), it appeared that in (sighted) rabbits exposed to a light-dark cycle (LD 12 : 12), bilateral <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy</b> modified the entraine...|$|E
40|$|Neuropeptide Y co-exists with {{noradrenaline}} in {{the majority}} of the sympathetic nerves supplying cerebral blood vessels. However, after sympathectomy in the rat the number of cerebrovascular neuropeptide Y nerve fibers are only reduced in number despite a complete disappearance of the adrenergic markers. The origin of these non-sympathetic neuropeptide Y fibers was studied by nerve transections and retrograde axonal tracing utilizing True Blue. Three days after bilateral superior <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy,</b> the number of neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers decreased to about 40 % of that in non-treated animals. One week after True Blue application on the proximal portion of the middle cerebral artery, the tracer accumulated in neurons of the sphenopalatine, otic, and internal carotid ganglia. Of these cells 80 %, 95 % and 5 %, respectively, were neuropeptide Y-positive. Some of the True Blue/neuropeptide Y-positive cells displayed immunoreactivity for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and some were positive for choline acetyltransferase. Two weeks after bilateral removal of the sphenopalatine ganglion or transection of postganglionic fibers from the ganglion reaching the pial vessels through the ethmoidal foramen, together with subsequent sympathectomy, no neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers could be observed on the anterior cerebral and internal ethmoidal artery or the distal portion of the middle cerebral artery, whereas a few nerve fibers remained on the proximal portion of the middle cerebral artery, internal carotid artery, and the rostral portion of the basilar artery. In conclusion, neuropeptide Y in cerebrovascular nerves is co-stored not only with noradrenaline in sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion, but also with acetylcholine (reflected in the presence of choline acetyltransferase) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in parasympathetic nerves originating in the sphenopalatine, otic, and internal carotid ganglia...|$|E
40|$|Charles I {{that the}} heart was {{insensitive}} to pain. ' The {{subject of this}} observation {{was the son of}} Count Montgomery, a young man who had miraculously survived an injury to his ribs and costal cartilages that left the beating heart exposed in an open cavity. Harvey ob-served that neither pricking nor pinching the epicardium evoked any sensation of discomfort. Two and a half centuries later, after the advent of local anesthesia, Lennander 2 concluded that the intestines were likewise insensitive, be-cause his patients at operation did not complain of any discomfort on pricking, cutting, or burning of these structures. These miscon-ceptions arose because of the paucity of sensory endings in the heart and other internal organs. Spatial summation is necessary to activate a sufficient number of nerve fibers in order to breach the sensory threshold. Therefore a mas-sive stimulus to a large area of intestinal wall or myocardium is required. When pain is evoked, {{it is likely to be}} peculiarly disagreeable, but difficult to describe and to localize. The normal physiologic stimulus for intestinal pain is distention ' and for the heart ischemia of the myocardium. 4 Frangois-Franck, 5 professor of physiology in Paris, suggested in 1899 that sympathectomy be done for the relief of angina pectoris. For this purpose <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy</b> was first carried out by Jonnesco in Bucharest in 1916. 6 A decade later Fontaine 7 and Cutler, 8 after reviewing a large number of case reports, found that this operation had given satisfactory relief of anginal attacks in only 60 per cent of the published cases.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of direct stimulation of the sympathetic nerves on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in the anesthetized cat. Neither unilateral nor bilateral <b>cervical</b> <b>sympathectomy,</b> or splanchnicectomy significantly modified basal LES pressure in animals with intact vagi, or animals having undergone bilateral cervical vagotomy. Electrical stimulation of the cut, peripheral, cervical sympathetic trunk increased mean arterial blood pressure, but had no effect on LES pressure or LES relaxation as induced by vagal stimulation. Stimulation of the central end of the cervical sympathetic trunk had no effect on LES pressure. Stimulation of the central end of the cut splanchnic nerve produced a decrease in LES pressure with a maximal response of 69. 1 ± 16. 0 % (mean±SEM). This inhibitory response was not modified by either propranolol or bilateral cervical vagotomy. Stimulation of the peripheral end of the cut, greater splanchnic nerve gave an increase in LES pressure with a maximal response of 38. 2 ± 7. 19 mm Hg. Guanethidine, in the presence or absence of the adrenal glands, significantly augmented this excitatory response. This response was also slightly increased by phentolamine alone at 10 V, 1 Hz, but was not altered by propranolol. The excitatory response was completely antagonized by atropine or by trimethaphan camsylate. Stimulation of the peripheral end of the splanchnic nerve inhibited LES relaxation as induced by vagal stimulation. The results of this study suggest that: (a) the LES in the cat is not affected by either central or peripheral stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk; (b) the central portion of the splanchnic nerve carries an afferent inhibitory response to the LES through yet unknown pathways; (c) the peripheral splanchnic nerve carries an atropine-sensitive excitatory response to the LES; and (d) the splanchnic nerves may modulate LES relaxation as induced by vagal stimulation...|$|E
