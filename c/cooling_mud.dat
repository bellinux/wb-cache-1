60|$|He took to {{wandering}} {{about the}} settlement. The afterwards flourishing Sambir {{was born in}} a swamp and passed its youth in malodorous mud. The houses crowded the bank, and, as if {{to get away from the}} unhealthy shore, stepped boldly into the river, shooting over it in a close row of bamboo platforms elevated on high piles, amongst which the current below spoke in a soft and unceasing plaint of murmuring eddies. There was only one path in the whole town and it ran at the back of the houses along the succession of blackened circular patches that marked the place of the household fires. On the other side the virgin forest bordered the path, coming close to it, as if to provoke impudently any passer-by to the solution of the gloomy problem of its depths. Nobody would accept the deceptive challenge. There were only a few feeble attempts at a clearing here and there, but the ground was low and the river, retiring after its yearly floods, left on each a gradually diminishing mudhole, where the imported buffaloes of the Bugis settlers wallowed happily during the heat of the day. When Willems walked on the path, the indolent men stretched on the shady side of the houses looked at him with calm curiosity, the women busy round the cooking fires would send after him wondering and timid glances, while the children would only look once, and then run away yelling with fright at the horrible appearance of the man with a red and white face. These manifestations of childish disgust and fear stung Willems with a sense of absurd humiliation; he sought in his walks the comparative solitude of the rudimentary clearings, but the very buffaloes snorted with alarm at his sight, scrambled lumberingly out of the <b>cool</b> <b>mud</b> and stared wildly in a compact herd at him as he tried to slink unperceived along the edge of the forest. One day, at some unguarded and sudden movement of his, the whole herd stampeded down the path, scattered the fires, sent the women flying with shrill cries, and left behind a track of smashed pots, trampled rice, overturned children, and a crowd of angry men brandishing sticks in loud-voiced pursuit. The innocent cause of that disturbance ran shamefacedly the gauntlet of black looks and unfriendly remarks, and hastily sought refuge in Almayer's campong. After that he left the settlement alone.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{life cycle}} of Callianassa californiensis Dana, 1854, was studied in the tidal estuary, Yaquina Bay, Oregon. At this {{latitude}} it is largely restricted to intertidal sandy mudflats under predominately marine influence. Salinity and temperature appear to determine its distribution {{to a greater extent}} than does sediment type. Vertical movement within the sediment is related to the tides on a day to day basis and to temperature on a seasonal basis. Large-scale breeding generally begins in the spring, and ovigerous females may be plentiful in the <b>cooler</b> layers of <b>mud</b> until August. It is not clear what triggers larval release, but temperature and tidal conditions seem to be important. All five zoeal stages are found in the plankton from the mouth of the bay to three miles offshore during late spring and summer.

Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|R
40|$|International audienceInvestigation of soil amoebae in 11 {{cooling towers}} {{allowed us to}} isolate a major unknown small-sized amoeba {{population}} (SZA). However, SZA {{did not appear to}} be specific to cooling tower ecosystems since they are also a major amoeba population found in muds isolated from different points of a water treatment plant. The SSU-rDNA sequences from SZA strains did not match any known database sequences, suggesting that SZA constitutes a new amoeba taxon. We isolated and further described one of the SZA that we named Micriamoeba tesseris. The phylogenetic analyses showed that Micriamoeba tesseris belongs to the Amebozoa and branched together with genus Echinamoeba+Vermamoeba vermiformis. Phylogenetic analyses within the Micriamoeba group distinguished different subgroups of Micriamoeba strains according to their origin, i. e. <b>cooling</b> tower or <b>mud.</b> Although Micriamoeba are able to feed on viable E. coli cells, they do not uptake virulent Legionella pneumophila strains, thus enabling them to avoid infection by Legionella.

The system was constructed using 1. 5 -inch diameter polypropylene piping, a DIG Corporation drip irrigation system, a TotalPond 530 GPH pond pump, an Omega CSI 32 K miniature benchtop controller, Omega FWH 321 - 020 high temperature heater tape, and fifteen copper pipe samples. DuPont™ lab technicians coated ten copper pipe samples with two different fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) polymer coatings: 954 G- 300 Teflon® FEP and 532 - 1003 Teflon® FEP. Both coatings were applied to the exterior of five copper pipe samples each (standard 1. 25 -inch diameter by 1 -foot-long). Additionally, five separate foot-long lengths of 1. 25 -inch diameter copper pipe were used as is.

Lastly, if the blade is very old, it may have been shaved instead of filed. This is called sensuki. While ornamental, these file marks also serve the purpose of providing an uneven surface which bites well into the hilt which fits over it, and is made from wood. It is this pressure fit for the most part that holds the hilt in place, while the mekugi pin serves as a secondary method and a safety.|$|R
40|$|Interest in gas {{hydrates}} as {{an energy}} resource has grown continuously {{over the last}} decades, and it has significantly increased {{since the beginning of}} the last decade. Much of the interest has come from countries with limited access to conventional hydrocarbon resources, and/or with a strategic interest in developing alternative hydrocarbon resources. Although the gas-in-place volume estimates of gas locked in gas hydrates remains uncertain, they indicate a vast resource volume. These vast resource volumes, combined with the environmental desirability of gas compared to other hydrocarbon fuels and the growing worldwide energy demand, leads to the conclusion that the potential of gas hydrate as an energy resource is very large. However, gas production from gas hydrate reservoirs do not yet exist on a commercial scale as a consequence of the unique challenges associated with drilling and production from these reservoirs. The goal of this thesis has been to investigate and understand these unique drilling- and production related challenges, with an emphasis on the drilling related challenges, to suggest and evaluate possible methods and technologies that could solve these challenges, and to make recommendations of how these challenges can be overcome using existing methods and technologies. Background information concerning the properties and characteristics of gas hydrates and the classification of different types of gas hydrate reservoirs have been covered to provide a base from which the drilling and production related challenges could be discussed. A Matlab model has also been developed and simulated to investigate the annulus temperature profile during drilling at a specific depth, as keeping a low temperature in the annulus was found to be an important factor in reducing the drilling related challenges. The first of the two main findings in this thesis is that production wells can be drilled safely and effectively in formations containing gas hydrates by using a combination of different existing technologies. This involves drilling with managed pressure drilling in combination with other methods. These methods are: casing while drilling, where technically and economically possible; surface <b>mud</b> <b>cooling,</b> to reduce the temperature in the annulus and prevent dissociation of gas hydrates in the formation and cuttings; drilling with high circulation rate; and insulated equipment, if necessary. The second major finding is that the recommended production strategy for all three classes of gas hydrate reservoirs is depressurization combined with thermal stimulation in the near wellbore area. Thermal stimulation is important to prevent the formation of ice and secondary gas hydrates that has a disadvantageous effect on the near wellbore permeability and, consequentially, the gas production rate and cumulative gas production volume.

40|$|Submarine mud volcanos at the {{seafloor}} are surface expressions of fluid flow systems within {{the seafloor}}. Since the electrical resistivity of the seafloor is mainly {{determined by the}} amount and characteristics of fluids contained within the sediment's pore space, electromagnetic methods offer a promising approach to gain insight into a mud volcano's internal resistivity structure. To investigate this structure, we conducted a controlled source electromagnetic experiment, which was novel {{in the sense that}} the source was deployed and operated with a remotely operated vehicle, which allowed for a flexible placement of the transmitter dipole with two polarization directions at each transmitter location. For the interpretation of the experiment, we have adapted the concept of rotational invariants from land-based electromagnetics to the marine case by considering the source normalized tensor of horizontal electric field components. We analyse the sensitivity of these rotational invariants in terms of 1 -D models and measurement geometries and associated measurement errors, which resemble the experiment at the mud volcano. The analysis shows that any combination of rotational invariants has an improved parameter resolution as compared to the sensitivity of the pure radial or azimuthal component alone. For the data set, which was acquired at the ‘North Alex’ mud volcano, we interpret rotational invariants in terms of 1 -D inversions on a common midpoint grid. The resulting resistivity models show a general increase of resistivities with depth. The most prominent feature in the stitched 1 -D sections is a lens-shaped interface, which can similarly be found in a section from seismic reflection data. Beneath this interface bulk resistivities frequently fall in a range between 2. 0 and 2. 5 Ωm towards the maximum penetration depths. We interpret the lens-shaped interface as the surface of a collapse structure, which was formed at the end of a phase of activity of an older mud volcano generation and subsequently refilled with new mud volcano sediments during a later stage of activity. Increased resistivities at depth cannot be explained by compaction alone, but instead require a combination of compaction and increased cementation of the older sediments, possibly in connection to trapped, <b>cooled</b> down <b>mud</b> volcano fluids, which have a depleted chlorinity. At shallow depths (≤ 50 m) bulk resistivities generally decrease and for locations around the mud volcano's centre 1 -D models show bulk resistivities in a range between 0. 5 and 0. 7 Ωm, which we interpret in terms of gas saturation levels by means of Archie's Law. After a detailed analysis of the material parameters contained in Archie's Law we derive saturation levels between 0 and 25 per cent, which is in accordance with observations of active degassing and a reflector with negative polarity in the seismics section just beneath the seafloor, which is indicative of free gas...|$|R
40|$|Drilling with a bottomhole {{pressure}} {{less than the}} formation pore pressure (underbalanced) will usually {{increase the risk of}} borehole collapse due to yielding or failure of the rock adjacent to the borehole. Understanding borehole collapse mechanisms during underbalanced drilling (UBD) in shale is becoming increasingly important for the petroleum industry, especially due to the implementation of the UBD technique in operational practices. The UBD technique has become a bit of an art in the modern oil industry, often considered to avoid or mitigate formation damage, reduce the risk of lost circulation, enhance recovery and increase rate of penetration (ROP). So far, the potential of UBD has yet to be fully realized by the industry, particularly because borehole stability has not been well addressed. In this study, we will therefore focus on mechanical borehole stability and improving the prediction of the borehole collapse pressure while drilling in shale. From an operational point of view, rotating BOP, drill string vibration, downhole restrictions and the selection of an accurate borehole stability model are important concerns when trying to increase drilling efficiency and safety in UBD wells. Of these four major issues related to UBD, only the one related to wellbore stability were considered in this PhD project. The other three issues are complex and represent individual research topics. Other issues, such as the inclusion of a borehole stress model, a geo-mechanical model, in-situ stresses, true pore pressure in shale, thermal or cooling effects on rock stiffness and strength, dilatancy, lamination, anisotropy, heterogeneity and shale permeability, are important to include in conjunction with borehole stability models. To prevent wellbore instability problems (i. e., borehole collapse, sloughing shale, stuck pipes, hole cleaning or fracturing formation), accurate predictions of stresses, pore pressure, rock stiffness and strength, and deformations around the wellbore are essential. Recent research shows that several mechanisms contribute to shale instability including shearing, swelling, pressure diffusion, heterogeneity, anisotropy, capillary effects, osmosis and physico-chemical alteration. During UBD, it is believed and assumed that there is no chemical effect and the rock is inert. Thus, there is no sloughing due to chemical instability, only mechanical failure through shear or radial tensile failure. We show in this study that several factors need to be considered to properly understand borehole stability issues in UBD wells. Physical models can address the UBD hypothesis and help understand the borehole stress model. Rock strength, mud weight and pore pressure are the most important parameters used for both the UBD and borehole stability hypotheses. Existing geomechanical models have been implemented to verify the behavior of shale during underbalanced drilling. However, when applied to the problem areas, several weaknesses in these models become apparent. On the basis of these models, an assumption of shale permeability was made to derive further estimates for shale consolidation and its effect on time-delayed wellbore stability. The specific behavior of shale was further investigated to define material characterizations that affect yielding and dilation. These studies were supported by testing of samples that verify previous results and allowed us to develop a new procedure for shale testing. A combined experimental/numerical investigation was performed to determine how the directional properties of shale impact borehole stability in weak shale formations. In all, three triaxial undrained tests for each of four different sample-inclinations (0, 45, 60 and 900) relative to the bedding plane, as well as two drained triaxial tests and Brazilian tests, were performed to obtain an accurate description of the anisotropic properties of the shale. Thick-walled hollow cylinder tests at underbalanced conditions were carried out on samples drilled parallel and perpendicular to the bedding to calibrate the material model on a developed virtual borehole. Laboratory observations of material failure were compared with the numerical outcomes. An improved understanding of the behavior of shale during UBD will improve stability analysis models and facilitate more rational predictions of borehole collapse risk. Several material constitutive models have been considered for rock failure studies, including the Mohr-Coulomb, the Mogi-Coulomb, the Mohr-Coulomb elasto-plastic and the Modified Cam-Clay models. The effects of material plasticity and <b>mud</b> <b>cooling</b> on <b>mud</b> weight were quantified. Shale specimens were investigated experimentally for the development and organization of consistent input parameters intended for model calibration and the improvement of accuracy. This research also developed model-fitting parameters for the Mogi-Coulomb model and reorganized the Mohr-Coulomb closed-formed analytical solution to predict borehole collapse pressure. Additionally, the timedelayed borehole failure, when subjected to transient pore pressure effects, was discussed. This study provides in-depth information and techniques for a developed mud design tool for UBD wells in shale. This was achieved through the development of various concepts on UBD and borehole instability, the implementation of linear and non-linear material models to predict collapse pressure and the evaluation of mechanical properties of the rock, such as the stiffness and strength and parameters of failure. A combination of theoretical, analytical, numerical and experimental work was performed to achieve the overall goal of this project. The project workflow is presented briefly in an introduction of the findings and conclusions, followed by several conference proceedings and submitted journal articles. Numerical studies were carried out in MATLAB and ABAQUS. An inhouse mechanical analysis calculator for rock was developed and used during the simulations of analytical solutions of poroelastic model. The main contribution of this PhD project was to improve the confidence and reduce confusion when choosing an appropriate material model to predict borehole failure, with the ultimate goal of minimizing wellbore stability problems experienced by drilling communities. Extensive experimental data related to the characterization of shale anisotropy and heterogeneity is provided and will be useful to other researchers working with shale.

South American dwarf caimans inhabit cool, fast-flowing streams, often near waterfalls, and other caimans live in warmer, turbid lakes and slow-moving rivers. The crocodiles are mainly river dwellers, and the Chinese alligator is found in slow-moving, turbid rivers flowing across China's floodplains. The American alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps, rivers, or lakes with clear or turbid water. Climatic factors also affect crocodilians' distribution locally. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months; in the rainy season, much of the savannah in the Venezuelan llanos is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain. Desert crocodiles in Mauritania have adapted to their arid environment by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods.
