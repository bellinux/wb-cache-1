40|$|To {{maintain}} a competitive edge, companies today {{must be able}} to efficiently allocate resources to optimally commit and fulfill requested orders. As such, order processing and resource allocation models have become increasingly sophisticated to handle the complexity of these decisions. In our research, we introduce a model that integrates production scheduling, material allocation, delivery scheduling, as well as functions involving <b>commitment</b> of <b>forecast</b> demand for configure-to-order (CTO) and assemble-to-order (ATO) business environments. The model is formulated as a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) and seeks to maximize revenue by trading off commitment of higher profit forecast orders with the production and delivery schedule of lower profit accepted orders. Our model is particularly useful for testing different policies relating to order commitment, delivery mode selection and resource allocation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of dynamic and {{unstable}} business environment companies tend to more flexible performance management system. Being a central element in a performance management framework, forecasting practice becomes a major concern for business organizations. The practitioners claim {{that there is a}} significant gap existing between the development and the application of forecasting activities. In this respect strong bridges are required to connect theory and practice. Through an expert interview method author investigates how forecasting activities contribute to business performance. The main purpose of this research paper is to investigate the problem statement by answering the questions concerning how planning activities have changed {{in the last few years}} and what is the current attitude and <b>commitment</b> to <b>forecasting</b> tool. Furthermore, this study explores how forecasting is integrated in the decision-making process and how it affects business decisions. Finally research investigates whether companies apply a rolling forecast as well as the reasons for and against using a rolling approach are also considered. The main findings of the research show that companies have altered their planning activities to improve forecast effectiveness, to reduce uncertainty and risks, to enable a more flexible resource allocation. Interviewed companies expressed growing interest and <b>commitment</b> to <b>forecasting</b> as an instrument of control. Moreover, results demonstrate that forecasting plays a crucial role for the business organization by facilitating business decisions and providing assumptions for business plans. Also different practices show, the more complex and larger organization is the more scrutinized and granular the forecast process should be. Regarding a rolling forecast, only two interviewed companies use this approach. All respondents found a rolling forecast beneficial for the business, however, in order to be successful companies are required to put more efforts and gain more experience with this method...|$|R

While Sales and Marketing managers are surrounded by promotion information, questions on retail <b>commitment</b> and product <b>forecast</b> accuracy can hinder the process. Multiple data sources and conflicting needs from various departments further complicate the issue. Kurt Jetta, a consumer researcher, has challenged the existing industry baseline sales forecasting methodologies and has developed the Dynamic Linear Model, which he states is [...] "able to capture structural changes that could be present in certain products after controlling for seasonality and other predictable patterns".|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that as demand becomes {{irregular}} and complex (i. e., lumpy), a possible approach for managing such uncertainty is to collect information directly from customers. This implies that the sales units have to move closer to customers, analyse their likely requirements, and collect quantitative and structured data as well as qualitative and subjective insights. However, as integration with individual customers increases and data collection capabilities improve the organisational configuration of most companies becomes ever more complex and the aggregation of forecasts more difficult. This paper discusses two approaches to managing demand uncertainty in complex environments. In the first (termed decentralised order overplanning), sales units are responsible for forecasting the demand of each customer and defining requirements. In the second (termed centralised order overplanning), forecasts provided by sales units are aggregated and further elaborated by manufacturing to define item requirements. By means of an analytical model (which describes the forecasting and planning process as a Bayesian-Markovian process), we show that the centralised method out-performs the decentralised approach by virtue of the ability to exploit the additional information provided by commonalities between customers requests. However, this advantage has to be balanced against organisational costs. Since the centralised method splits responsibilities for forecasting and slack control between sales and manufacturing units, major conflicts are likely to arise, the focus and <b>commitment</b> on <b>forecasting</b> accuracy may be compromised, and information may be lost when individual forecasts are sent to the manufacturing unit...|$|R

The paper presents some {{of the results of the}} Romanian organizations participating in the research programmes financed from national and European funds. The higher education institutions are in the most favorable situation relating to the development of the equipment and apparatus as a result of their participation in the research projects. The dependence of the national institutes on the Nucleus Programmes has increased lately. Many traditional companies that have RDI activities are in a dramatic situation...|$|R
40|$|Education, {{suggested}} that persons reading his book {{should do so}} with an attitude of gentle skepticism; that he would feel less inhibited about expressing his ideas, assumptions and convictions clearly and forcefully if he could rely on readers to test his ideas against their own exper-iences, adopting those that made sense and building on them creatively (Knowles, 1980). I hope you will subscribe to his philosophy as I visit with you. A managing broker for Neuberger and Berman, Limited Maturity Bonds in New York, suggested in her newsletter that "the trouble with crystal ball gazing is that occasionally one finds themselves eating crushed glass" (Havell, 1986). It is, of course, never comfortable to forecast. In education, like economics, forecasters tend to be wrong at exactly {{the time they are}} most needed [...] at infection points. Unfortunately, it is generally human nature to believe that a trend in motion will continue in motion. But forecasting a change in direction leaves the forecaster the most exposed, and subject to ridicule if wrong; another reason to stay with the pack so that all will be right, or wrong, together. So, why even do this forecasting? Alan Greenspan, now heading the Federal Reserve Board replied to this question: "Implicit in any investment action or <b>commitment</b> is a <b>forecast,</b> whether consciously or otherwise. We {{may not be able to}} forecast well, yet we have no choice but to forecast. "...|$|R
40|$|Product {{companies}} face {{new challenges}} {{as they continue}} to expand their international footprints. Whereas globalization initially sought savings by outsourcing production to low-cost regions, emerging markets now present new sales opportunities with unique customer demands. Companies increasingly must be sensitive to local expectations {{at the same time that}} products are becoming more technology rich and with shorter life cycles. Improved coordination that enables greater speed, flexibility, and multi-market effectiveness is particularly important as companies shift engineering and commercial responsibilities to formerly production-only centers. This study develops and demonstrates an approach to one domain of coordination-the flow of material and related information between globally distributed sites-based on lessons from engineer-to- order (ETO) operating models. By examining contemporary trends in ETO and identifying several generalizable tensions, this study outlines key parameters that distinguish dynamic coordination needs from those embedded in conventional process improvement frameworks. The five-step approach developed in this paper takes a dynamic systems perspective on organizational interfaces and seeks to build feedback mechanisms at multiple levels. It targets the knowledge-transfer, business planning, and execution levels of material management while also addressing the behavioral and practical components of implementation. In doing so, the approach recognizes that uneven process maturity and uncertain external demands must be accommodated. It argues that traditional approaches to coordination have had limited success, because they are slow to adapt and encourage circumvention. Whereas these past methods have exchanged reduced process "waste" for greatly increased rigidity and process housekeeping, the proposed method seeks reinforcing loops that align stakeholders without exhaustive process definition or significant maintenance. A detailed case study at a global ETO business group illustrates the method and its initial results in an environment of limited patience for formal process development. The resulting portfolio of change initiatives, which includes inter-site service level <b>commitments,</b> local <b>forecast</b> sharing, service parts forecasting, and reverse logistics, demonstrates an integrative approach to business site interfaces that attempts to tie local short-term performance with global long-term success. by Brian S.
