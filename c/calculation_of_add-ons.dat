40|$|Background: Add-on test requests, where a {{clinician}} requests further test assays on {{an existing}} specimen, contribute disproportionately to pathology service workload. However, {{little research has}} quantified the volume, rates, source or types <b>of</b> <b>add-on</b> tests. This study provides a descriptive analysis <b>of</b> <b>add-on</b> testing within a pathology service serving five hospitals. Methods: We analyzed 6 months of test data extracted from a pathology service in metropolitan Sydney, Australia. Add-on requests were analyzed in terms of total volume and {{as a proportion of}} all test requests and test assays; ten most frequently requested add-on test types for clinical chemistry and hematology; by patient registration category; and proportions <b>of</b> <b>add-on</b> requests received within 1 -, 4 -, 8 -, and 24 -h of specimen collection. Results: Add-on test requests constituted 3. 7 % (n = 19, 541) of the total 529, 361 test requests. Clinical chemistry and hematology add-on requests accounted for 76. 9 % <b>of</b> all <b>add-on</b> requests. The add-on request rate was higher in the clinical chemistry (5. 4 %) than in hematology (1. 3 %). Patients who entered hospital via the emergency department had the highest rates <b>of</b> <b>add-on</b> requests. A total of 79. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>add-on</b> requests across the pathology service were made within 24 -h of specimen collection. Conclusions: The volume <b>of</b> <b>add-on</b> requests is substantial and varies considerably by test type and patient registration category thus impacting differentially upon pathology service departments. While some add-on requests are unavoidable in clinical practice, others are precipitated by inadequate information at the point of care. Improving appropriate utilization <b>of</b> <b>add-on</b> testing will reduce their burden on pathology services. 8 page(s...|$|R
