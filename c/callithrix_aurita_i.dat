50|$|The common {{marmoset}} (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey. It originally {{lived on}} the northeastern coast of Brazil, in the states of Piaui, Paraiba, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Bahia. Through release (both intentional and unintentional) of captive individuals, it has expanded its range since the 1920s to Southeast Brazil (its first sighting in the wild for Rio de Janeiro was in 1929) and became there an invasive species, raising concerns about genetic pollution of similar species, such as the buffy-tufted marmoset (<b>Callithrix</b> <b>aurita),</b> and predation upon bird nestlings and eggs.|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Gestão e Conservação de Recursos Naturais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe Atlantic Forest {{is one of}} the biomes {{with the}} highest {{biodiversity}} in the world. Included among the 25 global hotspots due to its endemism, has today, 35 % of plant species in Brazil, and many of these species are threatened with extinction. Compared to other countries and even other continents will, the biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest region is of global importance, being essential to their conservation. Brazil has the greatest diversity of World monkeys (48 %), and, most endemic country, 2 / 3 of this amount occurring in the Atlantic Forest. Due to its wild habitat, have suffered great pressure by fragmentation in Atlantic Forest region, restricting habitats of populations to small fragments. The present study consists of a survey of presence and absence of <b>Callithrix</b> <b>aurita,</b> it is a species of primate rare, vulnerable and endemic Atlantic Forest. The importance of this survey is due to the current situation of the Atlantic Forest biome, particularly in the type of vegetation in the region studied, semideciduous forest, where there are the greatest deforestation for agricultural purposes and pasture due to climate, soil type, and other anthropogenic such as property market and building industries. Another factor that was considered is the presence of invasive species as Callithrix jacchus and Callithrix penicillata. The study was conducted in the state of Rio de Janeiro, the city of Sapucaia in the district of Vila Nossa Senhora Aparecida. We evaluated 11 fragments which registered the presence of <b>Callithrix</b> <b>aurita</b> in 8 of these fragments. To assist, we used the method play-back and questionnaires with residents and local workers. The council has a large agricultural exploration, and a total lack of environmental planning by local government. With the results of this survey, along with historical data collected, {{it was found that the}} municipality has a high environmental value. Even with the vulnerable status of the species, and its rarity, it is present in 70 % of the fragments studied, and no record of invasive species, becoming fundamental to implementing a conservation plan, with the support of the public and society. The objective of this survey is to assist in defining priority areas for future creation of conservation units, using <b>Callithrix</b> <b>aurita</b> as flagship species, assisting in the work of environmental education and public awareness, exploring the potential tourist, historical, religious, among others the municipality for a better environment and a better quality of life for the region's population...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of Brazilian vertebrates is regarded {{among the highest}} in the world. However, the biological diversity is still mostly unknown and a good part of it is seriously threatened by human activities. This study aimed to inventory the medium and large size mammals present in the Reserva Biológica de Santa Rita do Sapucaí, an Atlantic forest reserve located in Santa Rita do Sapucaí, southeastern Brazil. Sand-plots, photographic traps and searches for animal tracks on pre-existent trails in the area, were carried out once every two months between May 2006 and February 2007. The sand-plots and tracks were inspected during five consecutive days per sampling. We obtained 108 records of 15 species, mostly of carnivorans. Two confirmed species are threatened with extinction in Brazil (<b>Callithrix</b> <b>aurita</b> and Leopardus pardalis). The results suggest that the sampled reserve has high species richness and plays an important role in conservation of mammals in this landscape, including species threatened with extinction...|$|R
40|$|In the Atlantic {{forest of}} Rio de Janeiro, <b>Callithrix</b> <b>aurita</b> (É. Geoffroy in Humboldt, 1812) {{is a native}} species {{vulnerable}} to extinction and C. jacchus (Linnaeus, 1758) and C. penicillata (É. Geoffroy, 1812) are invasive species. The major threats to the native species are habitat degradation and hybridization, although there are currently no genetic data about natural hybrids available. Previous studies have revealed that species of the Callithrix genus are extremely homogeneous in their karyotypes with the exceptions of the morphology {{and size of the}} Y chromosome and its nucleolar organizer region (NOR) banding pattern. Three male marmosets captured in the wild in Guapimirim municipality, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, considered as possible hybrids between C. aurita and C. jacchus or C. penicillata on the basis of pelage pattern, were cytogenetically studied. Metaphase chromosomes were obtained by using short-term lymphocyte cultures and Ag-NOR staining was performed. The hybrids karyotypes were 2 n= 46, 14 uni- and 30 bi-armed autosomes, a median size submetacentric X and NOR bearing autosomes, being compatible with that observed for the genus. In the three individuals studied, Y chromosomes were similar to those found for C. aurita, without NORs. The data obtained suggest the involvement of C. aurita in natural hybridization with one of the invasive species. We discuss the possible consequences of this hybridization...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{fragmentation}} and habitat loss {{are among the}} major current extinction causes. Remaining fragments are mostly small, isolated and showing poor quality. Being primarily arboreal, Neotropical primates are generally sensitive to fragmentation effects. Furthermore, primates are involved in complex ecological process. Thus, landscape changes that negatively interfere with primate population dynamic affect the structure, composition, and ultimately {{the viability of the}} whole community. We evaluated if fragment size, isolation and visibility and matrix permeability are important for explaining the occurrence of three Neotropical primate species. Employing playback, we verified the presence of Callicebus nigrifrons, <b>Callithrix</b> <b>aurita</b> and Sapajus nigritus at 45 forest fragments around the municipality of Alfenas, Brazil. We classified the landscape and evaluated the metrics through predictive models of occurrence. We selected the best models through Akaike Selection Criterion. Aiming at validating our results, we applied the plausible models to another region (20 fragments at the neighboring municipality of Poco Fundo, Brazil). Twelve models were plausible, and three were validated, two for Sapajus nigritus (Area and Area+Visibility) and one for Callicebus nigrifrons (Area+Matrix). Our results reinforce the contribution of fragment size to maintain biodiversity within highly degraded habitats. At the same time, they stress the importance of including novel, biologically relevant metrics in landscape studies, such as visibility and matrix permeability, which can provide invaluable help for similar studies in the future and on conservation practices in the long run...|$|R
60|$|General Remarks.--It {{will have}} been seen how much subject to {{variation}} the valves of this species are. When I first examined the Cineras chelonophilus of Leach, from 36° N. lat., Atlantic Ocean, and found in many specimens, both old and young, that the terga were very small, flat, acuminated at both ends, with a projecting shoulder on the carinal margin, and situated at about their own length from {{the apex of the}} carina, and at twice their own length from the scuta; and when I found the carina acuminated at both ends, and the scuta very imperfectly calcified, with the lateral lobe broad, flat, and standing out at right angles; and lastly, when I found the whole capitulum bluntly pointed, instead of being square on the summit, I had not the least doubt, that it was a quite distinct species. Afterwards, I found in the Cineras Olfersii of Leach, from the South Atlantic, the same form of terga; but within slightly more concave or furrowed, and not nearly so small, and therefore not placed at above half so great a distance from the other valves; and here, the carina had its usual outline, as had nearly the scutum on one side, whereas, on the other side, it presented a new and peculiar form, having five ridges or points, and was imperfectly calcified; seeing this, it was impossible to place much weight in the precise form or size (and therefore, relative separation,) of the calcified valves; and on close examination, I found every part of the mouth and cirri identical in Leach's Cineras chelonophilus and C. Olfersii, and in the common form. Therefore, I conclude, that C. chelonophilus, and still more C. Olfersii, are only varieties; the terga presenting the greatest, yet variable, amount of difference, namely, in their acumination and flatness. We know, also, that in the species of the closely allied genus of Lepas, the terga are very variable in shape, and this is the case, even in a still more marked degree, in Conchoderma <b>aurita.</b> Professor Macgillivray, <b>I</b> may add, has come to a similar conclusion regarding the extreme variability of the valves of this species.|$|R
