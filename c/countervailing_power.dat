25|$|In {{fighting}} the anti-trust suits, A also emphasized the considerable impact of its {{activities on the}} public welfare, which had been recognized as the legacy of George Hartford Sr. and his sons. The concepts pioneered and perfected by the Hartfords and their competitors enabled the public to enjoy significantly healthier eating at lower cost. In 1950, the average American consumed 10 percent more food than in 1930, with poorer households enjoying an especially important improvement {{in the quality of}} the food they consumed. John Kenneth Galbraith supported this contention in his 1952 book, American Capitalism, by citing A as an example of <b>countervailing</b> <b>power.</b> To support his thesis, he discussed a 1937 A study of the feasibility of opening a plant to manufacture corn flakes. The mere possibility of A producing corn flakes forced existing corn flake manufacturers to lower their prices by 10%.|$|E

Galbraith's primary purpose in Capitalism: The Concept of <b>Countervailing</b> <b>Power</b> (1952) was, ironically, to show that big {{business}} was now necessary to the American economy to maintain the technological progress that drives economic growth. Galbraith knew that the [...] "countervailing power", which included government regulation and collective bargaining, was necessary to balanced and efficient markets. In The New Industrial State (1967), Galbraith argued that the dominant American corporations had created a technostructure that closely controlled both consumer demand and market growth through advertising and marketing. While Galbraith defended government intervention, Parker notes that he also believed that government and big business worked together to maintain stability.|$|E

2500|$|The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, {{better known}} as A, was an American chain of grocery stores that ceased {{supermarket}} operations in November 2015, after 156 years in business. From 1915 through 1975, A was the largest food/grocery retailer in the United States (and until 1965, the largest U.S. retailer of any kind). A was considered an American icon that according to The Wall Street Journal [...] "was as well known as McDonald's or Google is today" [...] and that A was [...] "Walmart before Walmart." [...] Known for innovation, A and the supermarkets that followed its lead significantly improved nutritional habits by making available a vast assortment of food products at much lower costs. Until 1982, A also was a large food manufacturer. In his 1952 book, American Capitalism, John Kenneth Galbraith cited A's manufacturing strategy as {{a classic example of}} <b>countervailing</b> <b>power</b> that was a welcome alternative to state price controls.|$|E
60|$|And it {{was quite}} true that, when {{business}} permitted, Mr. Freely thought {{a great deal of}} Penny. He thought her prettiness comparable to the loveliest things in confectionery; he judged her to be of submissive temper--likely to wait upon him as well {{as if she had been}} a negress, and to be silently terrified when his liver made him irritable; and he considered the Palfrey family quite the best in the parish, possessing marriageable daughters. On the whole, he thought her worthy to become Mrs. Edward Freely, and all the more so, because it would probably require some ingenuity to win her. Mr. Palfrey was capable of horse-whipping a too rash pretender to his daughter's hand; and, moreover, he had three tall sons: it was clear that a suitor would be at a disadvantage with such a family, unless travel and natural acumen had given him a <b>countervailing</b> <b>power</b> of contrivance. And the first idea that occurred to him in the matter was, that Mr. Palfrey would object less if he knew that the Freelys were a much higher family than his own. It had been foolish modesty in him hitherto to conceal the fact that a branch of the Freelys held a manor in Yorkshire, and to shut up the portrait of his great uncle the admiral, instead of hanging it up where a family portrait should be hung--over the mantelpiece in the parlour. Admiral Freely, K.C.B., once placed in this conspicuous position, was seen to have had one arm only, and one eye--in these points resembling the heroic Nelson--while a certain pallid insignificance of feature confirmed the relationship between himself and his grand-nephew.|$|E

5000|$|In the 20th century, [...] "Countervailing Power" [...] is {{a theory}} of {{political}} modification of markets, formulated by American economist John Kenneth Galbraith in his 1952 book American Capitalism. In the classic liberal economy, goods and services are provided and prices set by free bargaining. According to Galbraith, modern economies give massive powers to large business corporations to bias this process, and there arise 'countervailing' powers {{in the form of}} trade unions, citizens' organizations and so on, to offset business's excessive advantage. On page 126 of this book, Galbraith elaborates on <b>countervailing</b> <b>power</b> in the sphere of economics when he states:"The development of <b>countervailing</b> <b>power</b> requires a certain minimum opportunity and capacity for organization, corporate or otherwise. If the large retail buying organizations had not developed the <b>countervailing</b> <b>power</b> which they have used, by proxy, on behalf of the individual consumer, consumers would have been faced with the need to organize the equivalent of the retailer's power.

40|$|Doctors {{are among}} the healthiest {{segments}} of the population in western countries. Nevertheless, they complain strongly of stress and burnout. Their own explanation is deprofessionalisation: The honourable art of doctoring has been replaced by standardised interventions and production lines; professional autonomy has withered. This view is shared by many medical sociologists who have identified a “golden age of medicine,” or “golden age of doctoring,” starting after World War II and declining around 1970. This article looks at some of the central sociological literature on deprofessionalisation, particularly in a perspective of <b>countervailing</b> <b>powers.</b> It also looks into another rise-and-fall model, proposed by the medical profession itself, where the fall in professional power was generated by the notion that there are no more white spots to explore on the map of medicine.

Stakeholder theory provides the framework for analysis of competing interests among the various groups in the healthcare system. The data are derived from personal interviews with 10 formal leaders from medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, clinical nutrition and public health. We conceived of these leaders as one group of stakeholders, with both common and conflicting interests. The findings demonstrate that these stakeholders are reluctant to endorse the professionalization of CAM. They propose a series of strategies to contain the acceptance of CAM groups, such as insisting on scientific evidence of safety and efficacy, resisting integration of CAM with conventional medicine and opposing government support for research and education. These strategies serve to protect the dominant position of medicine and its allied professions, and to maintain existing jurisdictional boundaries within the healthcare system. The popular support for CAM will require that health professional stakeholders continue to address the challenges this poses, {{and at the same time}} protect their position at the apex of the healthcare pyramid.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} unravel the {{political}} economy of large-scale land acquisitions in post-Soviet Russia. Russia falls neither in the normal category of ‘investor’ countries, nor in the category of ‘target’ countries. Russia has large ‘land reserves’, since in the 1990 s much fertile land was abandoned. We analyse how particular Russia is with regards to the common argument in favour of land acquisitions, namely that land is available, unused or even unpopulated. With rapid economic growth, capital of Russian oligarchs in search of new frontiers, and the 2002 land code allowing land sales, land began to attract investment. Land grabbing expands at a rapid pace and in some cases, it results in dispossession and little or no compensation. This paper describes different land acquisitions strategies and argues that the share-based land rights distribution during the 1990 s did not provide security of land tenure to rural dwellers. Emerging rural social movements try to form <b>countervailing</b> <b>powers</b> but with limited success. Rich land owners easily escape the implementation of new laws on controlling underutilized land, while there is a danger that they enable eviction with legal measures of rural dwellers. In this sense Russia appears to be a ‘normal’ case in the land grab debate...|$|R

Integration and decentralization are not opposite policy strategies but both meaningful if the single public goods and services supplies are analyzed in more detail. Both strategies doubtlessly have advantages, which can be realized if the manifold possibilities are combined in an efficient approach of good governance. Best practice approaches in inter- or supra-national integration, fiscal federalism and taxation do exist and have to be successfully implemented. Obviously such a modern fiscal policy has to be accompanied by an appropriate monetary policy, which in an economic union has to be carried out by an independent central bank as one of the necessary <b>countervailing</b> <b>powers</b> in a democratic setting. A modern fiscal policy strategy efficiently controls budget deficits, which naturally have to be limited to finance reliable public investments. Such strategy has to be safeguarded through modern methods of budgeting and fiscal planning.
