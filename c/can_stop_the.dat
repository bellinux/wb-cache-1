5|$|While certain beliefs {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} tobacco smoke to protect against disease persisted {{until well into the}} 20th century, the use of smoke enemas in Western medicine declined after 1811, when through animal experimentation Benjamin Brodie demonstrated that nicotine—the principal active agent in tobacco smoke—is a cardiac poison that <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> circulation of blood.|$|E

Olivia also hooks herself up, allowing her to communicate what she sees in Lane's mind. When the prime version of Lane attempts to get into the right position, Olivia is able to identify his location, and he is captured in time. However, despite disrupting the process for Lane, earthquakes continue across the world. Walter estimates that the next set of quakes will cause both universes to collapse.|$|E

5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} dream sequence, Buffy is woken by Anya in her dorm room. She then finds {{herself in her}} room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, Buffy talks to her mother, {{who lives in the}} walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been {{promoted}} to Surgeon General and is drawing up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam start to make a pillow fort. When Buffy finds her weapons bag, the only thing in it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells Buffy that she cannot have friends and must work alone, which Buffy rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy's living room next to her dying friends until Buffy realizes that she <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up.|$|E
5|$|Locating the armillary {{building}} in Egypt {{with the three}} stone keys, George and Nico sneak into the building, only to see Susarro forcing Bruno to activate the armillary. As it powers up, George and Nico subdue Susarro, just before Petra arrives with a hooded man seen twice before during their adventure, who proceeds to kill Susarro with supernatural powers. The figure {{turns out to be}} the Grand Master of the Neo-Templars, thought to have been killed back in Bannockburn, but had survived, having Petra work with Susarro until he learnt what the Grand Master needed. With the armillary active and the location of a large power site displayed, the Grand Master sets off dynamite in the building as he escapes with Petra, trapping George, Nico, and Bruno inside and killing Flap. The group find the only way for them to escape is for one of them to sacrifice themselves in one of the puzzle rooms, forcing Bruno to take the responsibility, hoping to atone for past sins so that George and Nico <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Grand Master.|$|E

Designations may change between jams: a pivot in one jam might be the jammer in a later jam.|$|E

25|$|On December 1, 1957, Jean Hoerni first {{proposed}} a planar technology of bipolar transistors. In this process, all the p-n junctions {{were covered by}} a protective layer, which should significantly improve reliability. However, in 1957, this proposal was considered technically impossible. The formation of the emitter of an n-p-n transistor required diffusion of phosphorus, {{and the work of}} Frosch suggested that SiO2 does not block such diffusion. In March 1959, Chi-Tang Sah, a former colleague of Hoerni, pointed Hoerni and Noyce to an error in the conclusions of Frosch. Frosch used too thin oxide layers, whereas the experiments of 1957–1958 showed that a thick layer of oxide <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> phosphorus diffusion. Armed with this knowledge, by March 12, 1959 Hoerni made the first prototype of a planar transistor, and on May 1, 1959 filed a patent application for the invention of the planar process. In April 1960, Fairchild launched the planar transistor 2N1613, and by October 1960 completely abandoned the mesa transistor technology. By the mid-1960s, the planar process has become the main technology of producing transistors and monolithic integrated circuits.|$|E

500|$|Although {{none of the}} {{available}} drugs can clear the infection, they <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. As of 2008, there are seven medications licensed {{for the treatment of}} [...] infection in the United States. These include antiviral drugs lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), tenofovir (Viread), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and entecavir (Baraclude), and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha-2a and PEGylated interferon alpha-2a (Pegasys). In 2015 the World Health Organization recommended tenofovir or entecavir as first-line agents. Those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment.|$|E

Logan has Colossus throw him at Lehnsherr and {{distract}} him long enough for Hank McCoy to inject Lehnsherr with the [...] "cure" [...] and thus nullify his powers. Army reinforcements arrive and shoot at Jean just as Logan had calmed her down. The Phoenix is awakened by the attack and disintegrates the troops in retaliation.

2500|$|The {{first thing}} {{to realize is that}} the pawn may be able to queen unassisted by his king, simply by {{advancing}} to the queening square before the opposing king can capture or block the pawn. The rule of the square is useful in determining whether the pawn can queen unassisted, or whether the king <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> pawn. In this position, the pawn is on the fifth square from the queening square (counting the queening square itself). [...] A square of five by five squares with the queening square in one corner and the pawn in an adjacent corner can be imagined. (Often, the easiest method of constructing the square is to draw a diagonal mentally from the pawn to the last rank; this is the diagonal of the square). [...] If the black king can move into this square, he <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> pawn, otherwise the pawn wins the race. In this position, if it is Black's move, he can move to b4 and enter the square, therefore he <b>can</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> pawn.
