50|$|Antecedent-contained {{deletion}} (ACD), {{also called}} antecedent-contained ellipsis, {{is a phenomenon}} found in contexts containing verb phrase ellipsis and a quantifier. The ellipsis appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> contained inside its antecedent, which should result in an infinite regress and thus ungrammaticality. The problem arises in phrase structure grammars that take the <b>constituent</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis. It does not arise if the catena <b>is</b> taken <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the fundamental unit. The catena is associated with dependency grammars (DGs).|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt {{has often}} been argued that Non-Constituent Coordinations involve ellipsis. Focussing in this paper on {{so-called}} 'Argument Cluster Coordination', we provide empirical evidence drawn from French against such elliptical analyses and sketch an alternative approach within HPSG, allowing non-standard <b>constituents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conjoined in the scope of some shared predicate. While such non-standard constituents are generally obtained by relaxing phrase structure, we propose analyzing them as non-headed constructions, deriving their unusual properties from the interplay of two different sets of constraints: those imposed by coordination and those imposed by predicates that select such clusters as arguments...|$|R

It incorporates a more consistent treatment {{of a wide range}} of grammatical phenomena, provides a set of coin-dexed null elements in what can be thought of as &quot;underly-ing &quot; position for phenomena such as wh-movement, passive, and the subjects of infinitival constructions, provides some non-context free annotational mechanism to allow the struc-ture of discontinuous <b>constituents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easily recovered, and allows for a clear, concise tagging system for some semantic roles...|$|R
