60|$|The {{floating}} light's bell rung {{this morning}} at half-past four o'clock, as a signal for the boats to be got ready, and the landing took place at half-past five. In passing the Smeaton at her moorings near the rock, her boat followed with eight additional artificers who had come from Arbroath with her at last trip, but there being no room {{for them in the}} floating light's boats, they had continued on board. The weather did not look very promising in the morning, the wind blowing pretty fresh from W.S.W.: and had it not been that the writer calculated upon having a vessel so much at command, in all probability he would not have ventured to land. The Smeaton rode at what sailors call a salvagee, with a cross-head made fast to the floating buoy. This kind of attachment was found to be more convenient than the mode of passing the hawser through the ring of the buoy when the vessel was to be made fast. She had then only to be steered very close to the buoy, when the salvagee was laid hold of with a boat-hook, and the bite of the hawser thrown over the cross-head. But the salvagee, by this method, was always left at the buoy, and was, of course, more liable to chafe and wear than a hawser passed through the ring, which could be wattled with canvas, and shifted at pleasure. The salvagee and <b>cross</b> <b>method</b> is, however, much practised; but the experience of this morning showed it to be very unsuitable for vessels riding in an exposed situation for any length of time.|$|E

40|$|Finite-size scaling {{analysis}} {{turns out}} to be a powerful tool to calculate the phase diagram as well as the critical properties of two dimensional classical statistical mechanics models and quantum Hamiltonians in one dimension. The most used method to locate quantum critical points is the so called <b>crossing</b> <b>method,</b> where the estimates are obtained by comparing the mass gaps of two distinct lattice sizes. The success of this method is due to its simplicity and the ability to provide accurate results even considering relatively small lattice sizes. In this paper, we introduce an estimator that locates quantum critical points by exploring the known distinct behavior of the entanglement entropy in critical and non critical systems. As a benchmark test, we use this new estimator to locate the critical point of the quantum Ising chain and the critical line of the spin- 1 Blume-Capel quantum chain. The tricritical point of this last model is also obtained. Comparison with the standard <b>crossing</b> <b>method</b> is also presented. The method we propose is simple to implement in practice, particularly in density matrix renormalization group calculations, and provides us, like the <b>crossing</b> <b>method,</b> amazingly accurate results for quite small lattice sizes. Our applications show that the proposed method has several advantages, as compared with the standard <b>crossing</b> <b>method,</b> and we believe it will become popular in future numerical studies.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{reliability}} of three algorithms {{to estimate the}} maximal and minimal frequency contours of Doppler spectrograms was evaluated {{in a group of}} 48 patients. Two algorithms had previously been used in the literature. These are the Modified Threshold <b>Crossing</b> <b>Method</b> and the Hybrid method. The third algorithm is new and is the Maximal Background Noise Threshold <b>Crossing</b> <b>Method.</b> A new approach was also proposed in the present study to estimate the background noise level of Doppler spectrograms. This level was used as a threshold in the computation of the spectral envelopes. Two diagnostic spectral parameters (the spectral envelope area and the systolic velocity integral) extracted from Doppler spectrograms recorded in the left ventricular outflow tract were also evaluated and tested to discriminate between 23 patients having no aortic pressure gradient and 25 patients with a stenotic aortic valve. Results describe the influence of the threshold level used in the Modified Threshold <b>Crossing</b> <b>Method</b> and the Hybrid method on the variability of the spectral contours. It is clearly demonstrated that the variability of minimal frequency contours is higher than that of maximal frequency contours. All three algorithms provided similar diagnostic performances with the spectral envelope area (71 % to 73 % of correct classifications) while the Maximal Background Noise Threshold <b>Crossing</b> <b>Method</b> and the Hybrid method provided the best results for the systolic velocity integral (69 % of correct classifications).

50|$|The Hardy <b>Cross</b> <b>method</b> is an {{iterative}} method {{for determining the}} flow in pipe network systems where the inputs and outputs are known, but the flow inside the network is unknown. The method {{was first published in}} November 1936 by its namesake, Hardy Cross, a structural engineering professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The Hardy <b>Cross</b> <b>method</b> is an adaptation of the Moment distribution method, which was also developed by Hardy Cross as a way to determine the moments in indeterminate structures. The introduction of the Hardy <b>Cross</b> <b>method</b> for analyzing pipe flow networks revolutionized municipal water supply design. Before the method was introduced, solving complex pipe systems for distribution was extremely difficult due to the nonlinear relationship between head loss and flow. The method was later made obsolete by computer solving algorithms employing the Newton-Raphson method or other solving methods that prevent the need to solve nonlinear systems of equations by hand.|$|E
