5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms in that they are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By <b>contrast,</b> <b>the</b> fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By <b>contrast,</b> <b>the</b> reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E

5|$|By <b>contrast,</b> <b>the</b> British press were jubilant; many {{newspapers}} {{sought to}} portray the battle as a victory for Britain over anarchy, and the success was used to attack the supposedly pro-republican Whig politicians Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|By <b>contrast,</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine {{position}} in Southern Italy was gradually consolidated {{so that by}} 873 Bari was once again under Byzantine rule, and most of Southern Italy would remain in the Empire for the next 200 years.

The Paulicians were defeated and their capital of Tephrike (Divrigi) taken, while the offensive against the Abbasid Caliphate began with the recapture of Samosata.|$|E

5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult.

Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E

5|$|Gallium {{is found}} {{primarily}} in the +3 oxidation state. The +1 oxidation {{is also found in}} some compounds.

Compounds containing gallium-gallium bonds are true gallium(II) compounds; for example, GaS can be formulated Ga24+(S2−)2, and the dioxan complex Ga2Cl4(C4H8O2)2 contains a Ga–Ga bond.|$|E
