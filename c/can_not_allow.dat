Mustafa was {{introducing}} to the Muslim fraction on the recommendation of Alikhan Bukeikhanov. Until 1917, before the October revolution Mustafa was a member of State Duma and he joined the political life of Turko-Tatar peoples. The formal political activities began in 1917 when Mustafa Shokay was delegated to congress of Muslims in Moscow. This big congress of Turkestan’s was held by his initiatives. Mustafa was a member of Turkestan committee of Interim Government and after he was elected as a Chairman of Turkestan’s national committee. On 10 December 1917 the project of creating autonomy was submitted. On the 4th Congress in Turkestan, Turkestan autonomy, known as the Kokand Autonomy. After overthrowing the Russian Provisional Government was declared in Petrograd during the armed uprising on October 25, the Bolsheviks carried out popular measures for the people in the election-Russian Constituent Assembly of Russia. But in election November 12, 1917 the Bolsheviks received only 23.9% of the vote against 40.4% for the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. In such circumstances, the Kokand government announced its intention to create on March 20, 1918 its parliament by universal direct, equal and secret ballot. Two thirds of the seats in parliament were for Muslim MPs and one third - representatives of non-Muslims. The existence of such a parliament was to be the first step towards the democratization of Turkestan. Chairman of People's Commissars of the Turkestan Republic Fedor Kolesov, said: [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> Muslims to the supreme authorities, since the position of the local population against us is not defined and, in addition, they have no proletarian organization"But on 11 February 1918 Bolsheviks sent troops to Kokand. The power was on equal and Kokand was completely destroyed, the troops were armed with machine guns and cannons, which were not in Kokand, Turkestan. Mr. Shokay moved through Fergana to Tashkent. On his head a bounty of 1000 rubbles was placed. At that time Mustafa Shokay was the youngest politician, who advocated for Turkestan Autonomy, but he was against separatism. When he was in hiding Mustafa met his old friend Maria Gorina, whom he married in April 1918, After this event Mr. Shokay said:” We called the soviet power then established in Tashkent the «enemy of our people». I have not changed my view on the matter in the last ten years.” [...] During the following years Shokay wrote and published a book:” Turkestan under the Soviet Union (On the characteristics of the dictatorship of the proletariat)”.|$|E

We implement a standalone typechecker for ETT in Haskell, allowing us to reload existing libraries into the system safely without re-elaboration. Rather than adopting a rewriting approach to computation, we use a glued representation of values, pairing first-order syntax with {{a functional}} representation of its semantics, computed lazily. This approach separates β-reduction from βηconversion. We consequently <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>allow</b> the η-laws for λ-abstractions and pairs, but also collapse each of the unit and empty types. 1. ...|$|R

A fundamental difference of DA with non-dynamic types of assessment is the active role taken by the teacher/assessor during the testing situation. DA overcomes the assessment–instruction dualism by unifying them according to the principle that interaction between the teacher and learners happened during the administration of assessment is necessary to understand the range of an individual’s functioning, and to guide learners to further develop future potential. That is, it is a means of accessing {{and at the same time}} promoting the process of development rather than focusing on its product, as happens in more conventional assessments.|$|R
