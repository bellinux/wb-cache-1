40|$|The issues {{involving}} environmental problems {{have become a}} major global concern in recent years. Even thoughInformation Technology (IT) has contributed significantly to build this scenario, IT directors and managers haveexpressed concerns about the environmental impact provided by IT. This situation has driven different practices toreduce waste and increase the efficiency of processes related to <b>computer</b> <b>operations,</b> being commonly <b>reported</b> bypractitioners as Green IT initiatives. Thus, this study aimed to identify the main Green IT practices adopted byorganizations. The study, based on the analysis of 196 announcements published on internet sites, identified 37 different Green IT practices, grouped into seven categories: practices of awareness, green data center, disposal andrecycling, alternative energy sources, hardware, printing and software...|$|R

40|$|NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} traversing a tree {{of potential}} complex computer operations; and pruning the tree for optimality under constraints. The optimality comprises maximization of {{a function of}} merit. The constraints comprise a convexity constraint, a maximum-input-multiplicity constraint, or a maximum-output-multiplicity constraint. USE - For determining complex <b>computer</b> <b>operation</b> for <b>computer</b> application. ADVANTAGE - Enhances processing performance by automatically forming extensions from high-level application code. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a system for determining a complex <b>computer</b> <b>operation</b> for a <b>computer</b> application...|$|R

40|$|Data {{shifting}} {{is required}} in many key <b>computer</b> <b>operations</b> from address decoding to computer arithmetic. Full barrel shifters are often on the critical path, which has led most research to be directed toward speed optimizations. With the advent of mobile computing, power has become as important as speed for circuit designs. In this paper we present apower-delay analysis {{for a range of}} 32 -bit barrel shifters that vary at the gate, architecture, and environment levels. Shifts and rotations are integral in many <b>computer</b> <b>operations</b> from address generation to arithmetic functions. Shifters are also central in oating point operations [1] that are essential to elds such as signal processing...|$|R
