40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the conditions under which}} a system of extended collective licensing (ECL) for the use of works contained in the collections of cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) participating in Europeana could function within a cross-border basis. ECL is understood as a form of <b>collective</b> rights <b>management</b> whereby the application of freely negotiated copyright licensing agreements between a user and a <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organisation</b> ("CMO"), is extended by law to non-members of the organisation. ECL regimes have already been put in place in a few Member States and so far, all have the ability to apply only on a national basis. This article proposes a mechanism that would allow works licensed under an ECL system in one territory of the European Union to be made available in all the territories of the Union. The proposal rests on the statutory recognition of the "country of origin" principle, as necessary and sufficient territory for the negotiation and application of an ECL solution for the rights clearance of works contained in the collection of a cultural heritage institution, including orphan works...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a regulatory framework {{in the area of}} <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> of rights in Nigeria must have been intended to strengthen the creative industry. Unfortunately, it has thrown this industry and in particular the music and film industries into a battle of a regulated against a non-regulated collective administration sector for upward of twenty (20) years. My choice of research on this topic could be attributed to the interest I developed while administering the collective administration desk at the Nigerian Copyright Commission. Serving on that desk afforded the opportunity to see the frustration of right owners who were being deprived the fruit of their labor, as the societies meant to collect and distribute royalties on their behalf were enmeshed in litigations and in the process, rarely paid any royalties to authors. Within this context, this research seeks to explore whether there is any merit in the continued existence of the current regulatory framework for <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> in Nigeria, and what the best operational framework for collective administration in Nigeria would be. A methodological approach entailing literature review of books, articles, journals, legislation, cases, reports of committees and interviews with experts was adopted, with critical analysis carried out on particularly the Nigerian Copyright Act, the Nigerian Copyright (<b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organisation)</b> regulation, the South African Copyright Act, the South African Performers’ Protection Act, the South African Collecting Societies Regulation, as well as judicial decisions challenging certain provisions in the Nigerian legislation. It is hoped that this research will spur a desire for the need for supervisory and regulatory agencies of government to seek the national interest above all others in taking and making decisions that affect the collective administration of copyright and related rights.

Collecting societies negotiate the royalty rates and other licence terms on behalf of their members and collect royalty payment on behalf of their members. Royalties are distributed by the collecting society to relevant members, who as individual right owners are not directly involved in the negotiation of the licence.|$|E
40|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> play an {{essential}} role in enabling the mass dissemination of content that is protected by copyright and related rights within Europe and beyond, especially when such dissemination takes place over the internet. Whether it is through commercial content delivery services, through cultural heritage institutions in pursuit of their public mission, or through any other type of legitimate service, works are nowadays typically made accessible beyond the boundaries of a single territory. The need for multiterritorial licensing that spans the entire European territory is more acute than ever. The absence of EU-wide copyright licenses has been one factor that has made it difficult for new internet-based music services to develop their full potential. Rights clearance for the exploitation of non-domestic repertoire must therefore be facilitated asmuch as possible. Since a significant portion of royalty collections in <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> derives from the nondomestic repertoire, the facilitation of multi-territorial licensing of online music rights {{goes hand in hand with}} the establishment of a coherent system of collective rights management as a whole. The role and functioning of <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> in the exploitation of copyright protected works in Europe therefore stands under the close scrutiny of European lawmakers and stakeholders with a view to developing solutions for the licensing of the aggregate repertoire of works administered by all European societies...|$|E

This paper asks whether the reforms have had the desired effect and shows, through qualitative research, that at least regarding the streaming of music, competition has not delivered.

40|$|Directive 2014 / 26 /EU on {{collective}} management of copyright and related rights aims at creating {{a level playing}} field of competition between <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organisations.</b> The article compares the European system with the US system, and shows that the US system is based on a different approach. Not only the US system in based on the application of general antitrust rules, where the EU system provides for special rules, which are relevant independently from any consideration of market power, price fixing or excessive prices practices. In addition, the US level playing field created through consent decrees only apparently resembles the system of special rules introduced through the European directive. The US system strikes essentially on the objective to find a proper balance between the interest in lowering transaction costs and the opposite interest in preventing excessive prices. Although the same objective finds many references in European scholarship, the article suggests that the problem of transaction costs is not central in the system of the EU directive. This conclusion argues through the solution adopted by US courts in Pandora case. Pandora was essentially judged considering the interest in lowering transaction costs; but this judgement would be completely inconsistent with the European di-rective. Therefore, the article proposes a different approach to the European directive. Under this alternative approach, transaction costs do not play a central role. Instead, it should be considered the interest in realizing a fair market system to determine a proper compensation of copyright and related rights owners. Only after this mechanism (implemented through the directive) is furtherly investigated, it should be evaluated if it would be consistent with the general antitrust rules when (and only when) a {{collective management}} organisation exerts market power. This investigation should also consider another aspect of US implementation of antitrust rule to <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organisations,</b> namely the notion of “right compensation” of intellectual property owner under US general antitrust rules. This notion is not clearly expressed in US antitrust cases, and sometimes seems to be contradictory exposed. Therefore, the notion of “right compensation” according to the US system will be investigated in future articles, which will consider US cases concerning the application of the special rules contained in the consent decrees...|$|E

40|$|In {{the digital}} {{networked}} environment, user’s expectations of getting {{easy access to}} digital content {{all the time and}} through a multitude of devices clash with the territorial structure of copyright and the complications of the licencing process. Under these circumstances, systems of collective rights management (CRM) offering a one-stop shop for rights clearance would seem to be an attractive solution to simplify cross-border licencing and save on transaction costs. In the European Union (EU), the Commission has made many attempts over the last decade not only to make <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> (CMOs) work more efficiently but also to bring them from a system of national licences granted by national monopolies to a system of EU-wide authorisations. The European Commission’s Proposal of 12 July 2012 for a directive on CRM is a confirmation of this policy. However, it is questionable whether these regulatory attempts are compatible with cultural diversity interests. This paper discusses the role of CRM in ensuring cultural diversity and how a purely competition-orientated approach can impinge on this. It does so through analysing EU case law and the Commission’s Proposal...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{intermediary}} institutions in promoting creativity and cultural diversity in the music industry, {{and the impact of}} cultural policy on the performance of those intermediaries. It reviews some of the existing literature on the relationship between economic conditions and innovation in music, and argues that too little {{attention has been paid to}} intermediaries. Focusing on <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> (CMOs) as one example of overlooked intermediaries, we illustrate, by way of comparison, the different priorities and incentives that drive CMO practice. These variations, we suggest, are important to appreciating how CMOs operate as intermediaries in different territories. We then turn our attention to recent attempts by the EU to reform CMO practice as part of its Digital Single Market project. The fact that the CMO has been an object of reform is indicative of its importance. However, there is more at stake here: the reforms themselves, in seeking to change the role and behaviour of CMOs will, we suggest, have profound consequences for the market in music in Europe, and for creativity and cultural diversity within that marke...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications for}} European music culture of the European Union’s Digital Single Market strategy. It focuses on the regulatory framework being created {{for the management of}} copyright policy, and in particular the role played by <b>Collective</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Organisations</b> (or Collecting Societies). One of the many new opportunities created by digitalization has been the music streaming services. These depend on consumers being able to access music wherever they are, but such a system runs counter to the management of rights on a national basis and through collecting organisations who act as monopolies within their own territories. The result has been ‘geo-blocking’. The EU has attempted to resolve this problem in a variety of ways, most recently in a Directive designed to reform the CMOs. In this paper, we document these various efforts, showing them to be motivated by a deep-seated and persisting belief in the capacity of ‘competition’ to resolve problems that, we argue, actually lie elsewhere - in copyright policy itself. The result is that the EU’s intervention fails to address its core concern and threatens the diversity of European music culture by rewarding those who are already commercially successful...|$|E

40|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Organisations</b> (CMOs) {{manage the}} various rights granted in {{copyright}} law to creators and performers {{in a range}} of creative industries – broadcasting, live performance, journalism, publishing, the music industry, visual arts et al. They offer pooled services of rights administration in self-governing membership organisations that are non-profit monopolised collectives that have curiously been left out of the list of similar institutions studied. They have the added interest that they deal in copyright, itself an institutional response to an ‘intangible property’ problem that has become increasingly complex due to developments in technologies of producing and consuming creative works, such as literature, art and music. Without CMOs, access to ‘legal’ use would be prohibitively costly for users of protected works, an external benefit of the creators’ need to protect their rights. Digitisation has provided both a threat to smaller CMOs and an opportunity for the larger ones. Increasing returns in rights management makes CMOs natural monopolies that are bolstered by the territorial nature of copyright. Digitisation enables transactional licensing to be feasible, threatening the solidarity of collective rights management (crm) by CMOs. It requires significant investment in IT, which may be too great for smaller CMOs in smaller markets. Regulation to promote multi-territorial licensing within the EU is likely to exacerbate the gap between the big and the smaller CMOs. The paper outlines the workings of and the operation of CMOs, drawing on the economics of collecting societies, a topic that the author has studied in some depth, extending previous work to include these effects...|$|E
