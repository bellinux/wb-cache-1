50|$|Above the big <b>wheel,</b> the <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is mounted}} {{on the front of}} the clock outside the clock frame. The <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> has 78 teeth on the outside, and the 12 notches are on the inside of the <b>count</b> <b>wheel.</b> The main arbor has an 8-tooth pinion which drives the <b>count</b> <b>wheel.</b> This {{directly}} reflects the ratio of strikes to lifting pins on the main wheel, as each turn of the <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> has to produce 78 strikes (the total of numbers 1 through 12). One turn of the <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> is equal to 9¾ turns of the big wheel.|$|R

50|$|A Leibniz wheel or stepped drum is a {{cylinder}} {{with a set}} of teeth of incremental lengths which, when coupled to a <b>counting</b> <b>wheel,</b> can be used in the calculating engine of a class of mechanical calculators. Invented by Leibniz in 1673, it was used for three centuries until the advent of the electronic calculator in the mid-1970s.|$|E
50|$|It {{appears that}} most of the wheels of the {{striking}} train are original. The <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> might have been replaced at a later stage, as its construction and execution is different from the other wheels. It is possible that an earlier <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> only rang the bell once every hour, as this was not unusual for clocks with similar design.|$|R

50|$|Data {{regarding}} permanent speed {{restrictions and}} other information about the permanent way and track configuration are loaded into an on-board database while temporary speed restrictions are provided to the train while en route via a wireless data system. The on-board equipment tracks the trains position by <b>counting</b> <b>wheel</b> rotations between a series of fixed Balises set between the rails. In the event a train's crew exceeds a speed restriction a penalty brake application is applied bringing the train to a complete stop {{in the same fashion}} as existing automatic train control (ATC) systems.|$|E
5000|$|Most odometers work by <b>counting</b> <b>wheel</b> {{rotations}} {{and assume}} that the distance traveled {{is the number of}} wheel rotations times the tire circumference, which is a standard tire diameter times pi (3.1416). If nonstandard or severely worn or underinflated tires are used then this will cause some error in the odometer. The formula is (actual distance traveled) = ( [...] (final odometer reading) - (initial odometer reading) [...] ) * (actual tire diameter) / (standard tire diameter). It is common for odometers to be off by several percent. [...] Odometer errors are typically proportional to speedometer errors.|$|E
5000|$|... In [...] "Machina arithmetica in qua non additio tantum et subtractio sed et multiplicatio nullo, diviso vero paene nullo animi labore peragantur", {{written in}} 1685, Leibniz {{described}} an arithmetic machine he had invented {{that was made}} by linking two separate machines, one to perform additions/subtractions and one for multiplications/divisions. Pascal's calculator was {{to be used for}} additions and subtractions (he called it the calculating box of Pascal) and a machine using wheels with movable teeth was to be used for multiplications and divisions. There is no evidence that Leibniz constructed this pinwheel machine, but his Leibniz wheel, which, when coupled to a sliding <b>counting</b> <b>wheel,</b> can mesh with a variable number of teeth, seems to have been his way of implementing a variable number of teeth design.|$|E
50|$|Seen {{from the}} {{striking}} train side, the great wheel with the winding barrel turns clockwise, the hoop <b>wheel</b> anti-clockwise, the <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> clockwise, and the fly clockwise.|$|R
50|$|Great <b>wheel</b> to <b>count</b> wheel: 8 tooth pinion to {{internal}} 78 teeth on <b>count</b> <b>wheel,</b> with 8 striking pins {{on the great}} wheel. This directly corresponds with the 78 strikes the clock will make in 12 hours (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78). The <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> turns once every 12 hours, so the great wheel turns 9.75 times, operating the strike lever thus 9.75 × 8 = 78 times.|$|R

40|$|Perimeters {{of large}} objects of {{approximately}} circular cross section determined indirectly through radius measurements {{by any of}} several proposed methods. Methods reduce errors introduced by wheel moved around perimeter and <b>counting</b> <b>wheel</b> turns: Surface irregularities and variations in friction and contact pressure seriously affect accuracy and repeatability of wheel measurements.

50|$|A {{pivot bracket}} {{to the top}} right of the <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> holds a three-pronged fork-like construction. The left tine of the fork keeps the flail in place. The middle tine of the fork is used to {{transmit}} the release from the main arbor of the going train.|$|R
50|$|The <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> turns once in 12 hours, the big wheel turns 9.75 {{times in}} 12 hours, thus {{striking}} the bell 78 times in 12 hours, and the flail arbor turns once every strike of the bell, and the fly turns 3.333 times per strike of the bell.|$|R
50|$|The {{computing}} {{engine of}} an Arithmometer has {{a set of}} linked Leibniz wheels coupled to a crank handle. Each turn of the crank handle rotates all the Leibniz wheels by one full turn. The input sliders move <b>counting</b> <b>wheels</b> {{up and down the}} Leibniz wheels which are themselves linked by a carry mechanism.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the main}} arbor of the going train, there are two pegs of metal mounted that turn with the main arbor once per hour. The first one is short (approximately 2 cm), and the second is longer (approximately 10 cm). They are at roughly a 90 degree angle. As the main arbor of the going train turns anti-clockwise, the first, short peg will push the fork up a little, which {{releases}} the flail and also moves the lock pin out of the <b>count</b> <b>wheel.</b> The flail turns clockwise until it hits the second, longer peg. This is the warning. A couple of minutes later, as the longer peg moves anti-clockwise, it completely releases the flail, which now turns clockwise whilst the clock strikes. As soon as a notch comes up on the <b>count</b> <b>wheel,</b> the fork dips again, and the left tine of the fork blocks the flail on its next turn.|$|R
50|$|The gearing (260/11 <b>counts</b> per <b>wheel</b> revolution) is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} Jones-Oerth model.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the mechanism, {{towards the}} end of the 18th century, round clock {{movements}} became a reliable mass-produced product. Known as [...] "Pendule de Paris" [...] (Paris, or French, clock movements), they were an 8-day movement with anchor escapement, silk thread suspended pendulum with a <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> striking on a bell every hour and half-hour. By the 1840s the simple and very effective silk suspension was being replaced by various adjustable spring suspension systems.|$|R
50|$|One {{peculiarity}} of this {{clock is}} that the <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> only appears to have 11 notches, but the clock strikes 12 times each complete turn. This is because the first strike (when the clock strikes one) is executed whilst the lever is still within the first, wider, notch. The locking piece is lifted out of the hoop of the hoop wheel, which then turns once, {{which leads to the}} great wheel turning 1/8 and striking once. Then the locking piece falls back into the hoop wheel. The fly will continue to turn until it stops gently on his own as it has a ratchet mechanism, which protects the bird cage on the fly arbor.|$|R
50|$|The main {{notation}}s are the Whyte notation (based on <b>counting</b> the <b>wheels),</b> the AAR wheel arrangement notation (based on counting {{either the}} axles or the bogies), and the UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements (based on counting either the axles or the bogies).|$|R
50|$|Paul Oerth took up {{production}} in approximately 1990 {{and continued to}} about 2006. These models have a different gear ratio (260/11 <b>counts</b> per <b>wheel</b> revolution). In 2006, production of the necessary gears ceased, and an alternative plastic-encapsulated set of gears was introduced. This was short-lived, and the Oerth model went out of production.|$|R
50|$|The {{goal line}} is {{the section of the}} end line within the key. Each end of the goal line is marked with a {{cone-shaped}} pylon. Players score by carrying the ball across the goal line. For a goal to <b>count,</b> two <b>wheels</b> of the player's wheelchair must cross the line while the player has possession of the ball.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, in {{a widely}} known {{handbook}} on music, Musurgia Universalis (1650), the scholar Athanasius Kircher describes a mechanical organ with several automated figures, including a mechanical cuckoo. This book contains the first documented description—in words and pictures—of how a mechanical cuckoo works. It {{should be noted}} that Kircher did not invent the cuckoo mechanism, because this book, like his other works, is a compilation of known facts into a handbook for reference purposes. The engraving clearly shows all the elements of a mechanical cuckoo. The bird automatically opens its beak and moves both its wings and tail. Simultaneously, there is heard the whistle—call of the cuckoo, created by two organ pipes, tuned to a minor or major third. There is only one fundamental difference from the Black Forest-type cuckoo mechanism: The functions of Kircher's bird are not governed by a <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> in a strike train, but a pinned program barrel synchronizes the movements and sounds of the bird.|$|R
50|$|The {{master and}} slave pendulums were linked {{together}} in a feedback loop which kept the slave synchronized with the master. The slave clock had a mechanical escapement using a 15-tooth <b>count</b> <b>wheel</b> which was moved forward each right-hand pendulum swing by a pawl attached to the pendulum. Every 15 oscillations (30 seconds), this released a gravity lever which gave the slave pendulum a push. This simultaneously closed a switch which reset the gravity lever and sent a pulse of current to an electromagnet which released a second gravity lever in the master unit to give the master pendulum a push. The impulse {{was provided by the}} weight of the gravity lever (acting as a remontoire) rolling off a wheel attached to the pendulum, this mechanism ensuring that the pendulum received an identical impulse, at precisely the same part of its stroke, every 30 seconds. The falling gravity lever closed another pair of contacts which reset the lever and provided an electrical pulse back to the slave unit.|$|R
2500|$|Pinball machines, {{like many}} other {{mechanical}} games, were sometimes used as gambling devices. Some pinball machines, such as Bally's [...] "bingos", featured a grid on the backglass scoring area with spaces corresponding to targets or holes on the playfield. Free games could be won if the player {{was able to get}} the balls to land in a winning pattern; however, doing this was nearly random, and a common use for such machines was for gambling. Other machines allowed a player to win and accumulate large numbers of [...] "free games" [...] which could then be cashed out for money with the location owner. Later, this type of feature was discontinued in an effort to legitimize the machines, and to avoid legal problems in areas where awarding free games was considered illegal, some games, called Add-A-Ball, did away with the free game feature, instead giving players extra balls to play (between 5 and 25 in most cases). These extra balls were indicated via lighted graphics in the backglass or by a ball <b>count</b> <b>wheel,</b> but in some areas that was disallowed, and some games were shipped with a sticker to cover the counters.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the approach of}} using of a neural network to estimate the odometry error in the mobile robot localization based on the odometers.

50|$|Axle {{counters}} {{have problems}} maintaining correct <b>counts</b> when train <b>wheels</b> stop {{directly on the}} counter mechanism; {{this is known as}} 'wheel rock'. This can prove problematic at stations or other areas where cars are shunted, joined and divided. Also, where main lines have switches to siding, spur or loop tracks extra counters will need to be deployed to detect trains entering or exiting the line, where with track circuits such infrastructure needs no special attention.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "ton" [...] (907 kg) weight {{ratings are}} the payload of a basic cargo {{version of the}} truck, not of the {{individual}} version. Ratings can be [...] "on-road" [...] for improved roads or [...] "off-road" [...] for all-ground in all-weather. The [...] "wheel arrangement" [...] designation {{is the number of}} wheels x the number of driven wheels.

5000|$|In 1995, {{the wheel}} was changed again, as [...] "DECISION" [...] spaces were added, which offered a player $50,000 to stop or another spin of the wheel, {{at the risk}} of landing on a smaller amount. In 1999, the [...] "DOUBLE" [...] and [...] "DECISION" [...] spaces were removed in favor of [...] "TRIPLE" [...] spaces, which earned a second spin at triple value. Any {{subsequent}} spins that land on [...] "DOUBLE" [...] or [...] "TRIPLE" [...] did not <b>count</b> and the <b>wheel</b> was respun. These spins were cut from the show as they did not influence the outcome.|$|R
