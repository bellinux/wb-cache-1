25|$|The {{capacity}} of an alkaline battery is strongly {{dependent on the}} load. An AA-sized alkaline battery might have an effective {{capacity of}} 3000mAh at low drain, but at a load of 1 ampere, which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could be as little as 700mAh. The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total usable capacity depends on the cut-off voltage of the application. Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers about as much capacity on intermittent or <b>continuous</b> <b>light</b> loads. On a heavy load, capacity is reduced on continuous discharge compared with intermittent discharge, but the reduction is less than for Leclanche cells.|$|E
25|$|Although optical devices {{also used}} for <b>continuous</b> <b>light,</b> like beam {{expanders}} and spatial filters, {{may be used for}} ultrashort pulses, several optical devices have been specifically designed for ultrashort pulses. One of them is the pulse compressor, a device {{that can be used to}} control the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses. It is composed of a sequence of prisms, or gratings. When properly adjusted it can alter the spectral phase φ(ω) of the input pulse so that the output pulse is a bandwidth-limited pulse with the shortest possible duration. A pulse shaper can be used to make more complicated alterations on both the phase and the amplitude of ultrashort pulses.|$|E
25|$|Arabidopsis FLU mutant with damaged {{regulation}} {{can survive}} only {{either in a}} continuous darkness (protochlorophyllide is not dangerous in the darkness) or under <b>continuous</b> <b>light,</b> when the plant is capable to convert all produced protochlorophyllide into chlorophyll and do not overaccumulate it despite {{of the lack of}} regulation. In barley Tigrina mutant (mutated on the same gene,) light kills the majority of the leaf tissue that has developed in the darkness, but part of the leaf that originated during the day survives. As a result, the leaves are covered by white stripes of necrotic regions, and the number of the white stripes is close to the age of the leaf in days. Green regions survive the subsequent nights, likely because the synthesis of chlorophyll in the mature leaf tissue is greatly reduced anyway.|$|E

Because of {{the combination of the}} very high speeds at which a gated tube may operate and their light amplification capability, gated tubes can record specific portions of a beam of light. It is possible to capture only the portion of light reflected from a target, when a pulsed beam of light is fired at the target, by controlling the gating parameters. Gated-Pulsed-Active Night Vision (GPANV) devices are another example of an application that uses this technique. GPANV devices can allow a user to see objects of interest that are obscured behind vegetation, foliage, and/or mist.

500|$|The mycelia of this species, {{grown in}} {{laboratory}} culture, {{have also been}} shown to be bioluminescent. Early studies demonstrated that short-wave ultraviolet light (at a wavelength of 280nm) reversibly inhibited the luminescence of P.stypticus mycelia, while longer wavelength (366nm) ultraviolet was stimulatory. Further, the fungus exhibited a pronounced diurnal periodicity, and maximum luminescence was noted between 6 and 9 pm, regardless as to whether the mycelial cultures were incubated in <b>continuous</b> <b>light,</b> continuous darkness, or a normal day-night cycle. The mycelia of P.stipticus grown submerged in liquid were non-luminescent, but became luminescent while growing on solid substrata. Dark-grown colonies were luminescent in the center, and light-grown colonies were brightest at the periphery. Other experiments have shown that growth temperature and pH {{have a significant effect on}} the level of bioluminescence, optimized at [...] and pH 3–3.5. However, light had a significant effect on mycelial growth but not on bioluminescence, and the optimal light conditions for maximum bioluminescence were total darkness.|$|E

The experiment was conducted between June, 2004 and May, 2005. Six flocks were sequentially housed in four 12 &# 215; 10 m broiler houses divided into 4 pens with 200 birds each. Litter was reused six times or until flock 6. Body weight and feed conversion were determined on days 21, 35, and 42 of each flock. Mortality was recorded daily. Electrical energy consumption was recorded at the end of the grow-out of each flock (every 42 days). A completely randomized design in a 6 &# 215; 2 &# 215; 2 factorial arrangement (flocks, lighting programs, curtains) with four replicates per treatment was applied. Broilers reared in houses with yellow curtains and under nearly <b>continuous</b> <b>lighting</b> programs presented the best feed conversion ratio and the highest body weight. Nearly <b>continuous</b> <b>lighting</b> programs resulted in 1. 48 times more sudden deaths and 1. 34 times higher general mortality when compared with intermittent lighting programs. Electrical energy consumption was 2. 12 times higher in nearly <b>continuous</b> <b>lighting</b> programs in relation to intermittent lighting programs. The presence of darkling beetles was higher in broiler houses with blue curtains and intermittent lighting program.

500|$|The {{development}} of Cyathus fruit bodies {{has been studied}} in laboratory culture; Cyathus stercoreus has been used most often for these studies due to {{the ease with which}} it may be grown experimentally. In 1958, E. Garnett first demonstrated that the development and form of the fruit bodies is at least partially dependent on the intensity of light it receives during development. For example, exposure of the heterokaryotic mycelium to light is required for fruit to occur, and furthermore, this light needs to be at a wavelength of less than 530 nm. <b>Continuous</b> <b>light</b> is not required for fruit body development; after the mycelium has reached a certain stage of maturity, only a brief exposure to light is necessary, and fruit bodies will form if even subsequently kept in the dark. Lu suggested in 1965 that certain growing conditions—such as a shortage in available nutrients—shifts the fungus' metabolism to produce a hypothetical [...] "photoreceptive precursor" [...] that enables the growth of the fruit bodies to be stimulated and affected by light. The fungi is also positively phototrophic, that is, it will orient its fruit bodies {{in the direction of the}} light source. The time required to develop fruit bodies depends on a number of factors, such as the temperature, or the availability and type of nutrients, but in general [...] "most species that do fruit in laboratory culture do so best at about 25 °C, in from 18 to 40 days." ...|$|E

As irradiance increased, the days to flower budding increased except under blue light. Yellow green and yellow LED had flower inhibiting effect equivalent to red LED. There was no difference in the crown bud number and the occurrence of abnormal flower irrespective of the light quality and irradiance. Next the, effects of night break and <b>continuous</b> <b>lighting</b> treatment by yellow LED on the flowering and cut flower characteristics of the chrysanthemum were investigated. There were significant differences in the cut flower characteristics except for the blade number on the neck in these treatments; there was no practical problem with night break or <b>continuous</b> <b>lighting.</b> The minimum irradiance strength enough for flower inhibition in the <b>continuous</b> <b>lighting</b> treatment was about 80 mW m− 2 that was half in night break treatment.
