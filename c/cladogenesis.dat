5|$|Horner did {{not perform}} an exact {{cladistic}} analysis determining {{the relationship between the}} three populations. Such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree implies the lowest number of evolutionary changes and therefore is the most likely. He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. Such a tree would, {{as a consequence of the}} method used, never show a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway. Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that, in this case, the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. Evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognize this. Such a transition is called anagenesis; he posited that, if the opposite, <b>cladogenesis,</b> could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process.|$|E

The punctuated equilibria hypothesis {{suggests that}} anagenesis is rare and that the rate of evolution is most rapid immediately after a split which will lead to <b>cladogenesis,</b> but does not completely rule out anagenesis.

50|$|Pseudoextinction is {{an event}} that occurs much more {{frequently}} under the assumption of a Phyletic gradualism model of evolution, under which speciation is slow, uniform and gradual.

However, the model of punctuated equilibrium is more widely accepted, with the proposal that most species remain in stasis, a state of very little evolutionary change, for {{a large proportion of}} the species' lifespan. This would result in increased cases of speciation through <b>cladogenesis</b> and true extinction, with fewer cases of Pseudoextinction. Nearly all species undergo true extinction under the model of punctuated equilibrium. Charles Darwin proposed the idea of stasis in his book, On the Origin of Species.

50|$|On May 11, 1940 {{she arrived}} in New York, where almost {{immediately}} after, she moved to Massachusetts {{to take a position}} at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, where she published her second seminal work, The Evolution of the Horse Brain in 1948, three years after becoming a citizen of the U.S. She took leave from Harvard for the 1944-1945 academic year to be a professor of comparative anatomy at Wellesley College, a position she resigned after her hearing deteriorated severely. Edinger's work on fossil horse brains showed that evolution was a branching process, as structures could evolve independently, such as the large forebrain found in advanced mammals.

5000|$|From a taxonomic perspective, pseudoextinction is [...] "within an {{evolutionary}} lineage, {{the disappearance of}} one taxon caused {{by the appearance of}} the next." [...] The pseudoextinction of a species can be arbitrary, simply resulting from a change in the naming of a species as it evolves from its ancestral form to its descendant form. [...] Taxonomic pseudoextinction {{has to do with the}} disappearance of taxa that are categorized together by taxonomists. As they are just grouped together, their extinction is not reflected through lineage; therefore, unlike evolutionary pseudoextinction, taxonomic pseudoextinction does not alter the evolution of daughter species. From {{an evolutionary}} perspective, pseudoextinction entails the loss of a species as a result of the creation of a new one. As the primordial species evolves into its daughter species, either by anagenesis or <b>cladogenesis,</b> the ancestral species can be subject to extinction.

50|$|Horner {{thought he}} had found the {{mechanism}} driving this evolution, elaborating on ideas he had developed even before he had investigated the Landslide Butte. The animals were living on a narrow strip on the east-coast of Laramidia, bordering the Western Interior Seaway and constrained in the west by the three to four kilometres high proto-Rocky Mountains. During the Bearpaw Transgression sealevels were rising, steadily reducing the coastal habitat width, from about three hundred to as little as thirty miles. This led to stronger selection pressures, the severest for Achelousaurus that lived during the phase that the coastal strip was at its narrowest. The lower number of individuals that the smaller habitat could have sustained, constituted a population bottleneck, making possible a rapid evolution. Increased sexual selection would have induced changes in the sexual ornamentation such as spikes, horns and bosses. A reduced environmental stress by lower sealevels on the other hand, would be typified by adaptive radiation. That indeed sexual selection had been the main mechanism would be proven by the fact that young individuals of all three populations were very similar: they all had two frill spikes, a small nasal horn pointing to the front and orbital horns in the form of slightly elevated knobs. Only in the adult phase did they begin to differ. This also showed that the populations were very closely related. Horner did not perform a cladistic analysis determining the relationship between the three populations. He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. Such a tree would {{as a consequence of the}} method used never show a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway. Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that in this case the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. Evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognise this. Such a transition is called anagenesis. He defended that, if the opposite, <b>cladogenesis,</b> could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process.In 1996 Dodson made two objections to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, the possession of just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertenis. This suggested to him that the Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus, given the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, estimated by him at about 250,000 years, were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. If the hypothesis were true however, it was according to Dodson perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E
