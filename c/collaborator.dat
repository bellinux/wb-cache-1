50|$|At {{the same}} time, this social {{exclusion}} of the <b>collaborators</b> meant that old ties from the war lived on and remained strong. In one case, a grocer who had been convicted after the war mostly had former <b>collaborators</b> among his customers.

40|$|AbstractGoogle Docs is a {{powerful}} collaborating tool. Traditionally, collaboration {{can be done by}} attaching documents to e-mail and sending them to <b>collaborators.</b> By using Google Docs, one needs to have only one copy of document which is kept in the web. To collaborate, one needs to create a Google document and invite others as <b>collaborators.</b> The document owner needs to allocate tasks to <b>collaborators</b> so that each of the <b>collaborators</b> knows which part they are supposed to contribute. This paper aims to introduce Google Docs as a useful collaborating tool and how it facilitates academicians in collaborating with others...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative coevolutionary {{algorithms}} are {{a popular}} {{approach to learning}} via problem decomposition. One important aspect of cooperative coevolutionary algo-rithms concerns how to select <b>collaborators</b> for com-puting the fitness of individuals in different populations. We argue that using a fixed number of <b>collaborators</b> dur-ing the entire search may be suboptimal. We experi-ment with a simple ad-hoc scheme that varies the num-bers of <b>collaborators</b> over time. Empirical comparisons {{in a series of}} problem domains indicate that decreasing the numbers of <b>collaborators</b> over time fares better than keeping the number fixed. We conclude with a brief dis-cussion of our findings and suggest directions for future research...|$|R

40|$|By {{analyzing}} {{a unique}} dataset {{of more than}} 270, 000 scientists, we discovered substantial gender differences in scientific collaborations. While {{men are more likely}} to collaborate with other men, women are more egalitarian. This is consistently observed over all fields and regardless of the number of <b>collaborators</b> a scientist has. The only exception is observed in the field of engineering, where this gender bias disappears with increasing number of <b>collaborators.</b> We also found that the distribution of the number of <b>collaborators</b> follows a truncated power law with a cut-off that is gender dependent and related to the gender differences in the number of published papers. Considering interdisciplinary research, our analysis shows that men and women behave similarly across fields, except in the case of natural sciences, where women with many <b>collaborators</b> {{are more likely to have}} <b>collaborators</b> from other fields...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} quantum {{illumination}} {{was first introduced}} by Seth Lloyd and <b>collaborators</b> at MIT in 2008. An experimentally feasible scheme for quantum illumination can be realized using Gaussian states as demonstrated by Jeffrey Shapiro and <b>collaborators</b> from the same institute. In 2009, a secure communication scheme based on quantum illumination was proposed. This scheme is {{a variant of the}} quantum cryptographic protocols based on continuous variables and two-way quantum communication introduced by Stefano Pirandola, Seth Lloyd and <b>collaborators</b> in 2008. In 2015 an extension of quantum illumination to microwave frequencies has been proposed by Shabir Barzanjeh, Stefano Pirandola and <b>collaborators</b> providing the first theoretical prototype of quantum radar.|$|R

5000|$|Asynchronous and lagged communication: <b>Collaborators</b> {{that are}} interdependent on each other’s {{information}} can experience problems {{due to the}} lack of synchronization due to technology. Asynchronous communication does not give team members constant updates in real time, which can lead to coordination and sequencing problems for a task. [...] In video and teleconferencing, time lags due to technology-mediated communication can cause confusion between <b>collaborators.</b> [...] Such coordination problems can frustrate <b>collaborators</b> and result in unnecessary work.|$|R
5|$|Aurobindo's close spiritual <b>collaborator,</b> Mirra Richard (b. Alfassa), came to {{be known}} as The Mother. She was a French national, born in Paris on 21 February 1878.

Aurobindo {{considered}} her his spiritual equal and <b>collaborator.</b> After 24 November 1926, when Aurobindo retired into seclusion, he left it to her to plan, build and run the ashram, the community of disciples which had gathered around them. Some time later, when families with children joined the ashram, she established and supervised the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with its experiments in the field of education. When he died in 1950, She continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram, and guided their disciples.|$|E
5|$|Beatty's {{reputation}} for directorial profligacy—notably with the critically acclaimed Reds (1981), {{did not sit}} well with Disney. As a result, Beatty and Disney reached a contracted agreement whereby any budget overruns on Dick Tracy would be deducted from Beatty's fee as producer, director, and star. Beatty and regular <b>collaborator</b> Bo Goldman significantly rewrote the dialogue but lost a Writers Guild arbitration and did not receive screen credit.|$|E
