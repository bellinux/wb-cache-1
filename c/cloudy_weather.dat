5|$|Five major {{precision}} bombing {{attacks were}} conducted {{as part of}} the Empire Plan. On 9June, two groups of B-29s bombed an aircraft factory at Narao and another two groups raided a factory in Atsuta; both facilities were badly damaged. A single group of Superfortresses also attempted to bomb a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory at Akashi but accidentally struck a nearby village instead. The next day, XXIBomber Command bombers escorted by 107 P-51s successfully attacked six different factories in the Tokyo Bay region. Precision bombing raids were also conducted on 22June, when 382 B-29s attacked six targets at Kure, Kakamigahara, Himeji, Mizushima and Akashi in southern Honshu. Most of the factories targeted were badly damaged. Four days later, 510 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were sent against nine factories in southern Honshu and Shikoku. Heavy clouds over the region meant that many bombers attacked targets of opportunity individually or in small groups, and little damage was done to the raid's intended targets. <b>Cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> prevented any further large-scale precision attacks until 24July, when 625 B-29s were dispatched against seven targets near Nagoya and Osaka. Four of the factories attacked suffered heavy damage. Renewed <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> prevented any further Empire Plan precision attacks in the last weeks of the war.|$|E

2500|$|On June 27, Maitland and Hegenberger {{made the}} short hop from Crissy Field {{to the newly}} opened Oakland Municipal Airport, whose [...] runway was much {{preferable}} for the takeoff roll with full fuel load, and departed the next morning just after 7 a.m. for Wheeler Field, Oahu, with Maitland as pilot and Hegenberger as navigator. Although assisted as planned by the Signal Corps beacon on Maui, the directional radio receiver in the C-2 operated only intermittently before cutting out altogether. The earth inductor compass on the C-2 failed just after takeoff, and despite increasingly <b>cloudier</b> <b>weather,</b> Hegenberger navigated most of the charted Great Circle route by dead reckoning, using a magnetic compass and driftmeter supplemented by celestial navigation observations. Contact with several ships at sea was used to verify their position and adjust the original flight plan.|$|R
5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> will slow nymphal development.|$|E
5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather.</b> The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E

25|$|Solar cookers {{are less}} useful in <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> {{and near the}} poles (where the sun is {{low in the sky}} or below the horizon), so an {{alternative}} cooking source is still required in these conditions. Solar cooking advocates suggest three devices for an integrated cooking solution: a) a solar cooker; b) a fuel-efficient cookstove; c) an insulated storage container such as a basket filled with straw to store heated food. Very hot food may continue to cook for hours in a well-insulated container. With this three-part solution, fuel use is minimized while still providing hot meals at any hour, reliably.|$|E

25|$|October is the {{transition}} month between the summer rainy {{season and the}} cold, dry winter. The predominantly tropical <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> of the summer is replaced by cooler, drier, and less cloudy conditions. The primary weather producers during October are cold frontal systems from the Asian mainland. On the average, one frontal passage per week can be expected during the month. A typical frontal passage is proceeded by increasing middle and high cloudiness with light rain. Following the frontal passage, mostly clear skies can be expected for 3 or 4 days. During this clear period {{it is very likely}} for fog to form. Fog is especially prevalent in river valleys and in low-lying areas.|$|E
25|$|The first {{bombing of}} Kjeller by the Allies was planned for 16 November 1943, but {{canceled}} {{because of the}} <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather.</b> Two days later the Eighth Air Force of the United States Air Force carried out an attack on Kjeller, using 102 B-24 Liberators to deliver 838 high-explosive bombs. The civilian workforce was away from work as there was a German military exercise being carried out, under supervision of General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst. This caused the anti-aircraft guns to be loaded with blanks and that no-one suspected {{that it was a}} real attack until the bombs started raining. Russian prisoners of war were used to clear the undetonated shells. Both Daimler-Benz's workshop and one of the halls were destroyed, as were an estimated twelve aircraft {{and the rest of the}} buildings suffered significant damages.

25|$|The {{increase}} of sugars in the grapes {{comes from the}} storage of carbohydrates in the roots and trunk of the grapevines {{as well as through}} the process of photosynthesis. Sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transferred from the leaves to the berries as it is broken down into glucose and fructose molecules. The rate of this build up will depend on several factors including the climate (such as a string of <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> which prohibits sunlight from reaching the vine) as well as the potential yield size of grape clusters and young vine shoot tips which compete for the resources of the mother grapevine. As the concentration of sugars build up, the concentration of acids decrease due, in part, to simple dilution but also to the consumption of acids in the process of plant respiration. The decrease in free acids, as well as the buildup of potassium, triggers a rise in the pH level of the grape juice.|$|E

25|$|Celestial {{navigation}}: Butterflies {{are known}} to be capable of navigation {{with the help of the}} sun. They can also navigate by using polarized light. The polarization of the sun's light changes with the angle of the rays, hence they can also navigate with <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather.</b> There are indications that they can even make corrections depending on the time on a day. Diamondback moths {{are known to}} fly in a straight trajectory which is not dependent on the angle of the sun's rays. Tests have been performed to interfere with the biological clock of certain species by keeping them in the dark and then observing if they would choose for other flight paths. The conclusion was that some species did, and others did not. Research on monarchs demonstrates that with removal of antennae, the location of the circadian clock, individuals do not localize in any one direction during flight as they do with antennae intact. Night flyers cannot use sun light for navigation. Most of these species rely on the moon and stars instead.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton, despite {{complaining}} of brake vibrations, set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at one minute and 47.490 seconds on the super soft compound tyres in the second practice session; Alonso was second and Ricciardo third. Räikkönen was fourth-fastest with Vettel in fifth. The two McLaren drivers were sixth and seventh (with Magnussen ahead of Button) and Pérez, Nico Hülkenberg and Kvyat followed in the top ten. The session was disrupted halfway through when Pastor Maldonado drove too quickly through the tenth turn, lost control of his car's rear-end, and slid into the outside exit barriers, heavily damaging his vehicle's front-right hand corner. After the session ended, Lotus constructed a new E22 chassis overnight for Maldonado, which he used {{for the remainder of}} the race meeting. In the final practice session, which was held in <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> conditions, Alonso set the fastest lap of the weekend so far at one minute and 47.299 seconds, 0.051 seconds faster than Ricciardo in second and Rosberg was third after going slowly in the first sector and went over the turn eleven kerbing. Vergne was fourth-fastest; Vettel was fifth and Hamilton sixth. Massa was seventh-fastest, Bottas eighth, Räikkönen ninth and Esteban Gutiérrez completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
25|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran {{for half}} an hour. The drivers' fastest lap times determined the starting order for the first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. Qualifying began under <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> conditions and thus most of the field drove onto the track when the session started. Rain fell five minutes into qualifying but was not heavy enough to affect the track. Simon Trummer was the early pace setter but was soon eclipsed by his teammate Coletti, who in turn, was suppressed by Ericsson. Leimer then moved {{to the top of}} the time sheets with a new GP2 Series lap record of the Bahrain International Circuit and later lowered it to a of one minute and 39.427 seconds lap time and this secured him the pole position. Ericsson appeared to challenge Leimer for pole but eased off after losing time in the final sector to join the latter on the grid's front row with a time nearly a second off Leimer's pace. Nasr equalled his qualifying result from the previous year's race to start from third. Coletti improved on his own fastest lap which was good enough for fourth. Dillmann was best of the late improvers and qualified fifth. Richelmi was close in arrears in sixth position. Rossi was in the top three early in the session but fell to seventh by its conclusion.|$|E
5000|$|P. ovata is a 119- to 130-day crop that {{responds}} well to cool, dry weather. In India, P. ovata is cultivated {{mainly in}} North Gujarat as a [...] "Rabi" [...] or post-rainy season crop (October to March). During this season, which follows the monsoons, average temperatures {{are in the}} range of 15 - 30 C, and moisture is deficient. Isabgol (P. ovata), which has a moderate water requirement, is given 5 to 6 light irrigations. A very important environmental requirement of this crop is clear, sunny and dry weather preceding harvest. High night temperature and <b>cloudy</b> wet <b>weather</b> close to harvest have a large negative impact on yield. Rainfall on the mature crop may result in shattering and therefore major field losses.|$|R

30|$|Across the Caucasus, the glaciered {{area has}} been {{shrinking}} at a slower rate of 0.4 – 0.5 % year− 1 (Shahgedanova et al. 2014). Changes in the extent of glaciers of northeastern Siberia and the Urals are often more difficult to quantify {{because of the small}} size and <b>cloudy</b> summer <b>weather</b> which make it difficult to obtain suitable satellite imagery. However, analysis of glacier change in the Kodar Mountains shows both a strong loss of glacier area, as high as 0.9 % year− 1 between the 1960 s and 2010 (Stokes et al. 2013), and a strong loss of glacier volume and negative mass balance (Shahgedanova et al. 2011). Glaciers of the Polar Urals have lost nearly half of their area since the 1950 s and exhibited negative mass balance (Shahgedanova et al. 2012).|$|R
25|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> with occasional rain showers. Michael Schumacher clinched his seventh pole position of his career, his first at the circuit, with a time of 1:14.266. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard, who was one-tenth of a second slower and was helped by running in the slipstream of teammate Häkkinen on the main straight. Häkkinen qualified third and stated that he was not unhappy with his starting position. Barrichello qualified fourth, three-tenths of a second behind Michael Schumacher, and said he had more grip in his car to improve his time. Trulli qualified fifth. Button took sixth and was happy with his effort despite encountering a yellow flag on his third run and admitted to pushing too hard on his fourth attempt. Frentzen slid onto the grass during the session and managed to record the seventh quickest time. Villeneuve who secured eighth believed he could have set a faster time as he spun while on a quick lap. Diniz took ninth having removed some downforce which improved the feel of his car. Ralf Schumacher rounded out the top ten having suffered his spin on his fourth run. Wurz qualified eleventh and said that he was happy with his car. Ricardo Zonta qualified twelfth, blaming his car for his qualifying performance. He was ahead of Verstappen and Salo. Fisichella, who started 15th, stated that understeer and poor grip prevented him from setting a faster lap time. He managed to qualify ahead of Heidfeld and Irvine, who spun during the session. Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa, Herbert and Alesi filled the next three positions; the latter had a lack of running due to a pneumatic valve system failure in his engine. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid; Gastón Mazzacane in front of Gené.|$|E
500|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 British Summer Time (...) for a 30-minute warm-up session which was held in <b>cloudy</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. Andretti {{continued}} his strong form at the track by recording the session's fastest lap {{with a time of}} 25.205 seconds. Takagi continued to drive quickly and was second-fastest ahead of Carpentier. After the session ended, Franchitti felt the first laps of the event would be treacherous after the ASCAR support race laid rubber on the track's surface, and he believed most of the overtaking would occur in the pit lane.|$|E
