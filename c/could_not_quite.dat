5|$|In the 1926 {{season as}} a whole, Larwood took 137 wickets at 18.31; with the bat he scored 451 runs at 12.88. No Tests were played in 1927; Larwood's {{performances}} for Nottinghamshire, however, lifted him {{to the top of}} the national bowling averages—100 wickets at 16.95—and he was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His efforts <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> secure the County Championship title for Nottinghamshire; they finished second after losing their final match to Glamorgan. The 1927 season saw the first appearance in the Nottinghamshire side of Bill Voce, a 17-year-old ex-miner who, after beginning as a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, later became Larwood's principal fast bowling partner for county and country. At the season's end, Larwood was married, in a quiet and private ceremony, to Lois Bird, a miner's daughter whom he had first met in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{was awarded}} the first bar to his DSO on 24 September 1943. Four nights later, on the 28/29 September whilst {{carrying}} out an intruder operation between Celle and Hanover Braham encountered what he identified to be a Do 217 which engaged him in a dogfight. He downed the enemy aircraft which hit the ground and exploded. He then gained another contact on an enemy aircraft but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> catch it then witnessed a crash or explosion nearby. One source suggests {{the victim of the}} crash was German ace Hans-Dieter Frank (55 victories), flying a Heinkel He 219, who collided with another German fighter while trying to evade Braham. The very next night he claimed a Bf 110. His victim was identified as German ace August Geiger of IV/NJG 1 (53 victories). Geiger parachuted out of his fighter but drowned. Within minutes Braham fired on a Ju 88 which he claimed as damaged. Frank, Vinke and Geiger were the 17th, 18th and 19th most successful night fighter aces of the Second World War (and aerial warfare).|$|E
25|$|On {{the weaker}} east front of Army Group Kempf, the Soviet 57th Army cleared the right {{bank of the}} Donets between Chuguyev & Zmiyev, but the army command somehow <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> bring itself to try for a full scale breakthrough.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{wish we had}} an {{ice-making machine}} on board," [...] said Roger, as he fanned himself. They had taken ice along, but the supply was running low, and he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get <b>quite</b> {{as much as he}} desired.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And wha is't tou's gotten, Wullie, lad?' said half a {{score of}} voices, while all eyes were turned on your humble servant, who kept the best countenance he <b>could,</b> though <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> easy at {{becoming}} the centre to which all eyes were pointed.|$|R
25|$|Approximately 49.10million SNES {{units were}} sold worldwide, with 23.35million of those units {{sold in the}} Americas and 17.17million in Japan. Although it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> repeat {{the success of the}} NES, which sold 61.91million units worldwide, the SNES was the best-selling console of its era.|$|E
25|$|Particularly vexing was the Selectric's {{lack of a}} full ASCII {{character}} set. The late Bob Bemer {{wrote that}} while working for IBM he lobbied unsuccessfully to expand the typing element to 64 characters from 44. The Selectric actually provided 44 characters per case, but the point remains that with 88 printable characters it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> produce the full printable ASCII character set.|$|E
25|$|When {{he first}} pitched {{the idea of}} Pokémon to Nintendo, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> grasp the concept, but were {{impressed}} enough with Tajiri's game design reputation that they decided to explore the concept. Shigeru Miyamoto began to mentor Tajiri, guiding him during the creation process. Pokémon Red and Blue took six years to produce, and nearly bankrupted Game Freak in the process; often, there was barely {{enough money to pay}} the employees. Five employees quit, and Tajiri did not take a salary, instead living off of his father's income. Investment from Creatures Inc. allowed Game Freak to complete the games, and in return, Creatures received one-third of the franchise rights.|$|E
60|$|Leland fancied he {{felt her}} hand tremble, and thought he saw a sudden {{softness}} in her eyes, but he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>quite</b> sure. Before he could decide how to profit by it, she had turned her face aside and gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help being {{a little}} different," [...] Jeanne said shyly.

60|$|During one {{of these}} flashes Jeff thought he saw a vessel labouring heavily. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>quite</b> sure, for by that time spray, borne on the {{whistling}} wind, was blinding him. Suddenly a red flash was seen, followed by a report. It was a signal of distress.|$|R
25|$|Australian opener Jimmy Maher {{recorded}} his second successive single-figure score {{in his first}} match for Durham, as the hosts made it 59 for 3, but centuries from Paul Collingwood and Dale Benkenstein sent {{them back in the}} lead. The pair added 206 runs together before Collingwood was out for 112 - his sixth first-class century in twelve matches - while Benkenstein continued to 162 not out, adding 80 runs with Gareth Breese and 21 for the ninth wicket with Brad Williams before declaring. The declaration set Derbyshire 280 to win in 66 overs, and Michael di Venuto and Steve Stubbings put on 91 for the first wicket to cut that down to 189. They had used two hours to hit those 91, though, leaving two hours for the remaining 189 - and though Stubbings completed his century, the rest of the batting order <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> hit quite quickly enough, and they finished on 277 for 6 - three runs short of victory.|$|E
25|$|On day three, however, Kent hit back. In 33 fiery overs before lunch, Amjad Khan and Min Patel both {{took two}} wickets, and despite more runs from Ervine - who {{finished}} with 74 - Hampshire crumbled to 182 for 7 at lunch. However, Andy Bichel and Nic Pothas added 138 {{for the eighth}} wicket, as Hampshire eked out 325, with Bichel top-scoring from number nine with 87 off 90 balls. Kent got a good start to their attempt to get quick runs and put a big target up for Hampshire, as they moved to 140 for 4 just before the close of play, but Shane Watson took two quick wickets and Shaun Udal one, {{and all of a}} sudden it was up to Justin Kemp and Andrew Hall to save Kent, as they were 153 for 7 overnight. Kemp fell on the fourth morning, as Kent rolled over for 185, setting up a potentially exciting finish with 307 runs to get in 83 overs. A 95-run partnership between Sean Ervine and John Crawley put Hampshire into a good position at 139 for 1, but Hampshire failed to score quickly enough, and three wickets from Simon Cook <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> force a victory as Hampshire hung on to finish on 241 for 8 and draw the match.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, England {{were back}} playing Sri Lanka, {{this time for}} a Twenty20 International. After bowling Sri Lanka out for 163, England {{required}} 12 off the last eight balls, with opener Marcus Trescothick just run out for 72, and England <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> score quickly enough, ending on 161 for five. In the C Trophy, Sussex qualified for the final with a week to go when they chased 255 against Hampshire, in a match where Sussex captain Chris Adams claimed the hosts [...] "were dead and buried" [...] after 15 overs.|$|E
60|$|Master Courage Toogood {{had long}} ago given up all thought {{of waiting for the}} mistress. He had knocked {{repeatedly}} {{at the door of the}} cottage, from behind the thick panels of which he had heard loud and--he thought--angry voices, speaking words which he <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> however, <b>quite</b> understand.|$|R
60|$|She did <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> {{know whether}} to be glad or not that the men were all in sacks and cutaways at dinner; it saved her, from shame for her husband and Mr. Burnamy; but it {{put her in the}} wrong. Every one talked; even the father and {{daughter}} talked with each other, and at one moment Mrs. March <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>quite</b> sure that the daughter had not looked at her when she spoke. She <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be mistaken in the remark which the father addressed to Burnamy, though it led to nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do!" [...] said Twinkle and Chubbins, in one eager breath. They flew {{for a long}} time, high in the air, {{but neither}} of the bird-children seemed to tire in the least.

2500|$|... "At 6:30 {{we arrived}} {{close to the}} beach. We <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> get into the beach because of the {{obstacles}} that the Germans had placed under water and also had proximity bombs that would blow up ships. They were having trouble getting the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, and I looked up and said, {{we are not going}} out that door; everybody over the side." [...] Unfortunately, the landing craft had stopped in water {{over the heads of the}} soldiers, most of whom were burdened down by packs and equipment. [...] Only by cutting loose their equipment and then swimming to shore could most of them avoid drowning.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} Baltacha {{returned}} to action in March 2007 after surgery, her singles ranking {{had fallen to}} 660 {{in the world and}} as such, she had to qualify for her first $25,000 ITF tournament of the year in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. She qualified before losing to Sorana Cîrstea in the first round. She competed in two more $25,000 events in March (reaching the quarterfinals of one) before heading to Bulgaria to compete in the Fed Cup for Britain. She played two singles matches (winning one) and four doubles matches (winning two). Following this she reached two consecutive $25,000 ITF semifinals in Incheon and Gimcheon, one as a qualifier and the other as a lucky loser. She consolidated these results with a run to the quarterfinals of another $25,000 in Changwon. In June she received a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic where she showed [...] "fighting spirit" [...] in her first round loss to Milagros Sequera. She then received a wild card into the qualifying draw for the Hastings Direct International and proved she deserved it by dropping only nine games in the three matches she won to qualify. She then went on to beat the British number 1, Anne Keothavong, in round one of the main draw in a tense three set match and join fellow Britons, Melanie South and Katie O'Brien in the second round, making this the first year since 1991 that three British women reached the second round. She <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> match up to world number 14, Nicole Vaidišová, in the second round though and was beaten in straight sets. She then received another wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon but wasn't able to overcome the 19th seed, Katarina Srebotnik.|$|E

60|$|Still, James was {{somewhat}} afraid. He knew of course, now, {{that there could}} be no hornets in it; but, still, the association of the idea of danger was so strong with the sight of a hornets' nest, that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> feel <b>quite</b> easy. At length, however, he came up near to it, and examined it attentively.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl looked}} at him in a curious fashion, and though she was {{probably}} not aware of it, there was doubt in her eyes.

60|$|When the {{recollection}} of Marizano's cruelty {{at the time}} of their first meeting flashed upon him, Disco felt an almost irresistible desire to rush upon and strangle the Portuguese, but the calm deportment of that wily man, and the peaceful manner in which he had approached, partly disarmed his wrath.
