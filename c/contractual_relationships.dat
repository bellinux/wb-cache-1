5|$|Claudia Cardinale met Italian film {{producer}} Franco Cristaldi in 1958. She married him in Atlanta in 1966, but they divorced in 1975. The couple had become increasingly detached {{and he wanted}} to remarry without any ties. Although Cardinale did not believe the Atlanta marriage had any status in Italy, she consented to his request. As a result, Cristaldi married Zeudi Araya and had no further <b>contractual</b> <b>relationships</b> with Cardinale.|$|E

2500|$|At-will {{employment}} {{is a term}} used in U.S. labor law for <b>contractual</b> <b>relationships</b> in which an employee can be dismissed by an employer for any reason (that is, without having to establish [...] "just cause" [...] for termination), and without warning. When an employee is acknowledged as being hired [...] "at will," [...] courts deny the employee any claim for loss resulting from the dismissal. The rule is justified by its proponents {{on the basis that}} an employee may be similarly entitled to leave his or her job without reason or warning. In contrast, the practice is seen as unjust by those who view the employment relationship as characterized by inequality of bargaining power.|$|E

2500|$|One {{example of}} the gradual change that typifies {{evolution}} of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule {{through most of the}} 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in privity of contract. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, Winterbottom v. Wright, the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The Winterbottom court recognized that there would be [...] "absurd and outrageous consequences" [...] if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the <b>contractual</b> <b>relationships,</b> and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the thesis is the {{multilayered}} view of regional hospitals on their <b>contractual</b> <b>relationship</b> with health insurance companies. The thesis draws information from two case studies of regional hospitals in Central Bohemia. These case studies have allowed me to map {{the whole process of}} establishing a <b>contractual</b> <b>relationship</b> with health insurance companies from the first contact to the final conclusion of the contract for a particular year. Through mapping the process I have identified a number of problematic areas that are encountered when concluding contracts. Thesis has also concentrated on the establishment and content of the payment regulation which, to a large extent, determines the final form of the <b>contractual</b> <b>relationship.</b> One of the goals of the thesis is the identification of key problems stemming from the parameters of the <b>contractual</b> <b>relationship</b> and payment mechanism. These problems are analyzed on the level of hospitals, individual specialized units, and in relation to the provision of health care to patients...|$|R

50|$|The {{regulation}} of <b>contractual</b> <b>relationships</b> {{is one of}} the most important elements in any legal system, and especially so in societies where there is a lack of a strong central state, enforcing codified law. Where Celtic societies in late prehistory are concerned, all evidence points to such an absence of a strong central state control, and a largely kin-based enforcement of legal claims. The {{regulation of}} <b>contractual</b> <b>relationships</b> therefore most likely formed the single most essential element of all early Celtic laws.|$|E
