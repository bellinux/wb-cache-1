25|$|Early in 1949 Derby School's JTC was amalgamated {{into the}} Combined Cadet Force (CCF). This became a British Army section, a Royal Air Force section, and around 1951 they {{reformed}} the band section Military band {{made up of}} members of both sections. A parade was held on Friday afternoons: members of the JTC and then the CCF would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> in their uniforms, berets and including boots. In addition, JTC and CCF pupils stayed on after school on Monday afternoons to undertake other instruction in civilian clothes. The CCF transferred to the new School at Moorway Lane in Littleover in 1966 and survived until it was disbanded in 1973, under the last Commanding Officer (CO) Flight Lieutenant Mick Foulkes, who was a Chemistry Master at the school. He was senior officer in the RAF section but also responsible for the whole Cadet Corps, including the Army section, band section and RAF section.|$|E
25|$|Bella annoys Edward with {{questions}} about how he saved her life. She hears that Edward {{and his family are}} vampires who drink animal blood. She is told legends of the local Quilyeute people by a friend Jacob Black who she met during a camp out. Disturbed by recurring nightmares, Bella researches about vampires. To her dismay, she then realizes that Edward hadn't <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> on the blood typing day because he is a vampire; she compares the characteristics of the vampires in mythology to the Cullens, and finds many similarities. Convinced he's a vampire, she finds herself in the state of bewilderment. Bella is saved by Edward again in Port Angeles when she is almost attacked. Driving a silver Volvo, Edward takes Bella to dinner and home. As they drive, she tells him of the stories that he is a vampire. Edward says he tried to stay away, finding her scent too desirable.

Kyle spends the rest of the episode attempting to rescue him.|$|E
500|$|When Stewie is {{fantasizing about}} murdering and harming Lois, he {{performs}} several karate and kung-fu moves. This is {{a reference to}} an individual whom Mark Hentemann, a writer for Family Guy, used to know. He was the boy who would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> car washes or other events and tell stories {{about the people who}} he had been in physical fights with. During the scene when Stewie describes Lois as being the female version of Bonnie Hunt, MacFarlane comments that he feels bad about that joke, as just before it was broadcast— Hunt telephoned him on his mobile phone and told him about how much she enjoyed the show, however the gag was not removed due to its expected airing date being so close to when the telephone call was made. On the uncut version of this episode, there is a scene where Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's mouth for Lois's genitals, muttering, [...] "Oh, you are so ready!" [...] The edited TV version does not have this part, but leaves in the first half, in which Peter sleepily mistakes Stewie's nose for Lois's nipple.|$|E
2500|$|Overwhelming needs {{cannot be}} met by the usual {{processes}} of schooling and include extreme instances such as abuse, neglect and illness. As well, a student’s socioeconomic status (SES) or dysfunctional family environment can cause them to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> with needs that cannot be expressed nor met by educators. [...] To help meet those overwhelming needs of students, particularly those in poor neighborhood, the ethic of care philosophy dictates that schools should be full-service institutions. Medical and dental care, social services, childcare and parenting advice should be available on campus. In turn, students in these situations are often forced into academic courses and fight an uphill battle, {{where they have to}} engage in activities that are difficult to focus on, based on their circumstances.|$|E

Also, I was never ostracized as weird just because I was a film geek, because my parents would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> and show 16mm films, or teach leatherworking and jewelry classes, which all the kids thought was cool[...] [...] [...] It {{never occurred to me}} that I was fat until the fifth grade, when a new kid at school started causing problems. [...] That's when Dad showed me José Ferrer as Cyrano de Bergerac; when someone hurls an insult at him, he says, 'Is that all? Ah, no, young sir, you're too simple. [...] You might have said a great many things. [...] Why waste your opportunity?' And then he names a score better than himself. Or Cocteau's La Belle et la Bête (Beauty and the Beast). [...] Or Charles Laughton in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. [...] You don't have to feel bad about yourself just because you're different (boiling oil notwithstanding)." ...|$|E
