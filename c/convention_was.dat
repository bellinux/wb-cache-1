5|$|As {{his term}} neared expiration, Laffoon removed Ben Johnson {{from his post}} as highway commissioner, {{replacing}} him with Tom Rhea.

Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea, the Democratic Party again chose a nominating convention in lieu of a primary to choose their gubernatorial candidate. Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county political organizations, a convention would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee. The <b>convention</b> <b>was</b> scheduled for May 14, 1935 in Lexington.|$|E

Long (R-KS) and Governor Willis J. Bailey (R-KS). When the next vacancy opened on the Eighth Circuit, Burton and his allies favored the appointment of Charles Blood Smith. D.W. Mulvane was unsuccessful in pressing Smith's candidacy in a June 1903 meeting with Roosevelt.|$|E

The <b>convention</b> <b>was</b> in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them.
