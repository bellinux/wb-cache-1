40|$|Switching {{languages}} {{has often}} been associated with a processing cost. In this study, the authors used event-related potentials to compare switches between two languages with withinlanguage lexical switches as bilinguals read for comprehension. Stimuli included English sentences and idioms ending either with the expected English words, their Spanish translations (<b>code</b> <b>switches),</b> or English synonyms (lexical switches). As expected, lexical switches specifically enhanced the N 400 response in both context types. <b>Code</b> <b>switches,</b> by contrast, elicited an increased negativity over left fronto-central sites in the regular nonidiomatic sentences (250 – 450 ms) and a large posterior positivity (450 – 850 ms) in both context types. In addition, both lexical and <b>code</b> <b>switches</b> elicited a late frontal positivity (650 – 850 ms) relative to expected completions, especially in idioms. Analysis of the individual response patterns showed correlations with vocabulary skills in English and in Spanish. Overall, the electrophysiological data suggest that for some speakers in some contexts, the processing of a <b>code</b> <b>switch</b> may actually be less costly than the processing of an unexpected within-language item. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA...|$|R

50|$|Instead of Díaz {{directly}} {{telling the}} story to the reader, he creates an aesthetic distance by speaking through the novel's narrator Yunior. Yunior provides analysis and commentary for the events he is relaying in the novel. His speech often exemplifies <b>code</b> <b>switching,</b> switching rapidly from a lively, Caribbean-inflected vernacular, replete with frequent usage of profanity to wordy, eloquent, and academic prose. This runs in parallel to several central themes of the novel regarding identity, as Yunior's <b>code</b> <b>switching</b> alludes to a struggle between his Dominican identity and his identity as a writer. <b>Code</b> <b>switching</b> between Spanish and English is also central to the narrative itself of the book, as characters switch {{back and forth as}} they see fit.|$|E

50|$|Another aspect worth {{considering}} is that bilingual children are often doing <b>code</b> <b>switching,</b> {{which does not}} mean that the child is not able to separate the languages. The reason for <b>code</b> <b>switching</b> is the child's lack of vocabulary in a certain situation. The acquisition of a second language in early childhood broadens children's minds and enriches them more than it harms them. Thus they are not only able to speak two languages in spite of being very young but they also acquire knowledge about the different cultures and environments. It is possible for one language to dominate. This depends on how much time is spent on learning each language.|$|E
