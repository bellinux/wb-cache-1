Made up of representatives from Canada, Poland and India, it supervised the cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign troops, the release of prisoners of war, and overall compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement. The French and most of the Viet Minh forces were withdrawn on schedule in October 1954.|$|E
25|$|After {{the return}} of the British, who {{established}} a military administration, the Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO), formed in August 1944, was transformed into a united front, comprising the BNA, the Communists and the Socialists, and renamed the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL). The Burma National Army was renamed the Patriotic Burmese Forces (PBF) and then gradually disarmed by the British as the Japanese were driven out of various parts of the country. The Patriotic Burmese Forces, while disbanded, were offered positions in the Burma Army under British command according to the Kandy <b>conference</b> <b>agreement</b> with Lord Louis Mountbatten in Ceylon in September 1945. Aung San was offered the rank of Deputy Inspector General of the Burma Army, but he declined it in favor of becoming a civilian political leader and the military leader of the Pyithu yèbaw tat (People's Volunteer Organisation or PVO).|$|E
500|$|The Nyon Conference was a {{diplomatic}} conference held in Nyon, Switzerland in September 1937 to address attacks on international shipping in the Mediterranean Sea during the Spanish Civil War. The conference was convened {{in part because}} Italy had been carrying out unrestricted submarine warfare, although the final <b>conference</b> <b>agreement</b> did not accuse Italy directly; instead, the attacks were referred to as [...] "piracy" [...] by an unidentified body. Italy was not officially at war, nor did any submarine identify itself. The conference was designed to strengthen non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The United Kingdom and France led the conference, which was also attended by Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.|$|E

500|$|The {{agreement}} {{provided that}} any submarine that attacked neutral shipping {{was to be}} sunk if possible, including submarines {{in the vicinity of}} a recent attack that were determined to be responsible for the attack. French and British fleets would patrol the seas west of Malta and attack any suspicious submarines, with the division of patrols between the United Kingdom and France to be decided by their governments. Both countries would patrol the high seas and territorial waters of signatory countries in the Mediterranean. The British would provide slightly more than half the 60 destroyers needed, with the French providing the remainder and most of the accompanying aircraft. It was agreed that Italy could participate in patrols of the Tyrrhenian Sea if it wished to do so. In the Eastern Mediterranean, British and French ships would patrol up to the Dardanelles, but not in the Adriatic Sea. In this area, signatory countries would patrol their own territorial waters, and would provide any reasonable assistance to the French and British patrols. The future revision of these provisions, including the way the area had been divided into zones, was specifically allowed. Submarine activity would be banned, subject to two exemptions: travel on the surface accompanied by a surface ship, and activity in certain areas for training purposes. Governments would only allow foreign submarines into each of their territorial waters in extreme situations, such as immediate distress. Merchant shipping would also be advised to stick to particular shipping routes. The agreement repeated the suggestion that Italy join in the proposal. Delbos announced that similar proposals about surface craft would be prepared. The provisions of the agreement would come into force on 20 September. The British and French knew that the secret Italian submarine operations had already been paused, but actions to enforce the <b>conference</b> <b>agreement</b> started at midnight on 19/20 September. The delegates to the agreement were happy; The Times likened them to cricketers, [...] "reviewing their innings, over by over".|$|E
50|$|Title IV - Nutrition. Title IV of the <b>conference</b> <b>agreement</b> {{would reduce}} {{nutrition}} spending by $8 {{billion over the}} 2014-2023 period, CBO estimates. The House-passed bill would reduce such spending by $39 billion over the 10-year period. It includes two provisions not contained in the <b>conference</b> <b>agreement</b> that would reduce spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by restricting the definition of categorical eligibility for the program and {{reducing the number of}} waivers from work requirements available for certain adult SNAP recipients. The Senate-passed bill would reduce nutrition spending by $4 billion over the next 10 years, about half the reduction in the <b>conference</b> <b>agreement.</b> It contains a proposal to limit heating and cooling allowances for SNAP participants that is less restrictive than the provision include in the <b>conference</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

Relative to spending and revenues projected under the CBO’s May 2013 baseline, the CBO {{estimates that}} enacting the <b>conference</b> <b>agreement</b> would lower budget deficits by $16.6 billion over that 10-year period. The CBO reported that original House version, Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 (H.R. 1947; 113th Congress), would have reduced direct spending by $51.8 billion and increased revenues by $60 million. The original Senate version, Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 (S. 954; 113th Congress), would have decreased direct spending by $17.7 billion and increased revenues by $50 million.|$|E

The notable exceptions to this rule were Washington playing in the 1960 and 1961 games and Minnesota playing in the 1961 and 1962 games during the period when the <b>conference</b> <b>agreements</b> were in a state of flux. The Big Ten abolished this rule in 1972. The AAWU/Pac-8 had abandoned its no-repeat rule by the time Southern California played in four consecutive Rose Bowl games from 1967 to 1970.|$|R

The <b>conference</b> <b>agreement,</b> as well as both the House and Senate bills, would end fixed payments and certain other existing forms of price and income support to producers.

A {{conference key}} {{protocol}} allows {{a group of}} participants to establish a secret communication (conference) key so that all their communications thereafter are protected by the key. In this paper we consider the distributed conference key (<b>conference</b> key <b>agreement)</b> protocol. We present two round-efficient <b>conference</b> key <b>agreement</b> protocols, which achieve the optimum {{in terms of the}} number of rounds. Our protocols are secure against both passive and active adversaries under the random oracle model. They release no useful information to passive adversaries and achieve fault tolerance against any coalition of malicious participants. We achieve the optimal round by transferring an interactive proof system to a non-interactive version, while preserving its security capability. ...|$|R
