5|$|The 2011 French Open Men's singles {{semifinal}} between world No. 2 Novak Djokovic {{and world}} No. 3 Roger Federer was a historic encounter that {{brought about the}} end of the longest winning streak in almost 30 years. Djokovic entered the match undefeated for the first five months of the year having gone 41–0 with a total winning streak of 43 matches (his last loss had come against Federer at the World Tour Finals). It was the first Grand Slam tournament in which Djokovic had ever been seeded higher than Federer. Djokovic had defeated Federer in their three previous meetings in 2011, however, Federer shocked many by taking the first two sets. Djokovic won the third set and as the fourth set went on the light began to fade and it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the match went to a fifth set it would have to be continued the next day. Djokovic served for the fourth set at 5–4 but was broken and Federer closed out the match in a tiebreaker.|$|E

Additionally, the Court clarified that section 101 can also be reconciled with the PPA and the PVPA. In fact, the three statutes may provide overlapping protection and are not mutually exclusive. Thus, inventors of new plant varieties are free to apply for protection under each regime and may benefit from the protection provided by each regime.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the works}} which bear the names of Bakhtin's close friends V. N. Vološinov and P. N. Medvedev have been {{attributed}} to Bakhtin – particularly Marxism and Philosophy of Language and The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship. These claims originated in the early 1970s and received their earliest full articulation in English in Clark and Holquist's 1984 biography of Bakhtin. In the years since then, however, most scholars have come to agree that Vološinov and Medvedev ought to be considered the true authors of these works. Although Bakhtin undoubtedly influenced these scholars and may even have had a hand in composing the works attributed to them, it now seems <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it was necessary to attribute authorship of these works to one person, Vološinov and Medvedev respectively should receive credit.|$|E

25|$|Duncan, {{with the}} main body of the fleet, was at the time lying at Great Yarmouth revictualling, the Texel being watched by a small {{squadron}} under Captain Henry Trollope in HMS Russell, from whom he received early information of the Dutch being at sea. He at once weighed anchor, and with a fair wind approached the Dutch coast, saw that the fleet was not returned to the Texel, and steering towards the south sighted it on the morning of 11 October about seven miles from the shore and nearly halfway between the villages of Egmont and Camperdown. The wind was blowing straight on shore, and though the Dutch forming their line to the north preserved a bold front, it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the attack was not made promptly they would speedily get into shoal water, where no attack would be possible. Duncan at once realised the necessity of cutting off their retreat by getting between them and the land. At first he was anxious to bring up his fleet in a compact body, for his numbers were at best equal to those of the Dutch; but seeing the absolute necessity of immediate action, without waiting for the ships astern to come up, without waiting to form line of battle, and with the fleet in very irregular order of sailing, in two groups, led respectively by himself in Venerable and Vice-admiral Richard Onslow in Monarch, he made the signal to pass through the enemy's line and engage to leeward.|$|E

500|$|In December 1901, the MCC {{approved}} the scheme previously suggested—that the county captains should meet {{to discuss the}} fairness of suspected bowlers. It was proposed that any bowler who was judged to be unfair by a two-to-one majority of captains would be banned {{for at least a}} season. The MCC also recommended that the counties not play suspected bowlers and that any bowler called for throwing should be removed from the attack {{in the interests of the}} spirit of cricket. In the 1902 Wisden, Sydney Pardon wrote: [...] "Never in the last twenty years or more has there been so little unfair or doubtful bowling as in the season of 1901. Indeed the improvement was so marked as to make it <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> the captains stick to their guns, we shall soon be entirely free from the evil of which not very long ago it seemed impossible to get rid." [...] After 1901, there were only isolated incidents regarding illegal bowling actions until the Second World War, and throwing ceased to be an issue in English cricket, in which no cricketer was no-balled for throwing between 1908 and 1952.|$|E

In response, a Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that Singapore first stated its claim to a territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone on 15 September 1980, and reiterated this claim on 23 May 2008 following the ICJ's judgment. Both statements had made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the limits of Singapore's territorial sea or Exclusive Economic Zone overlapped with the claims of neighbouring countries, Singapore would negotiate with those countries to arrive at agreed delimitations in accordance with international law.

500|$|The 1899 Australian tour saw Trumble score 1,183runs {{and take}} 142wickets; {{he was only}} the second Australian, after George Giffen, to score 1,000runs and take 100wickets in an English season {{as part of a}} touring team. In the Test series, Trumble took 15wickets at an average of 25.00 and made 232runs at an average of 38.66. [...] Wisden said of Trumble's batting that season, [...] " [...] played so {{consistently}} well as to make it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he had not been a bowler {{he would have been a}} great batsman". Dry pitches saw his bowling average fall off a little from the 1896 tour but Wisden stated that he [...] "bowled quite as well as in 1896" [...] and [...] " [...] never seemed easy to hit, and whenever the ground gave him least advantage...he was deadly". Australia won the Second Test by 10wickets and with the other Tests finishing in draws, they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory. Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at Headingley, where he took 5wickets for 60runs and was the highest run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he retained it for the next 5 years).|$|E
500|$|When Oppenheimer was {{ejected from}} his {{position}} of political influence in 1954, he symbolized for many the folly of scientists thinking they could control how others would use their research. He has also been seen as symbolizing the dilemmas involving the moral responsibility of the scientist in the nuclear world. The hearings were motivated both by politics, as Oppenheimer {{was seen as a}} representative of the previous administration, and by personal considerations stemming from his enmity with Lewis Strauss. The ostensible reason for the hearing and the issue that aligned Oppenheimer with the liberal intellectuals, Oppenheimer's opposition to hydrogen bomb development, was based as much on technical grounds as on moral ones. Once the technical considerations were resolved, he supported Teller's hydrogen bomb because he believed that the Soviet Union would inevitably construct one too. Rather than consistently oppose the [...] "Red-baiting" [...] of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Oppenheimer testified against some of his former colleagues and students, both before and during his hearing. In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother. In the end it became a liability when it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Oppenheimer had really doubted Peters' loyalty, his recommending him for the Manhattan Project was reckless, or at least contradictory.|$|E

500|$|The defense {{also raised}} a federal {{constitutional}} issue on whether Frank's {{absence from the}} court when the verdict was announced [...] "constituted deprivation of the due process of law". Different attorneys were brought in to argue this point since Rosser and Arnold had acquiesced in Frank's absence. There was a debate between Rosser and Arnold on {{whether it should be}} raised at this time since its significance might be lost with all of the other evidence being presented. Louis Marshall, President of the American Jewish Committee and constitutional lawyer, urged them to raise the point, and the decision was made that it should be made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the extraordinary motion was rejected they intended to appeal through the federal court system and there would be an impression of injustice in the trial. For almost every issue presented by the defense, the state had a response: most of the repudiations were either retracted or disavowed by the witnesses; the question of whether outdated order pads used to write the murder notes had been in the basement before the murder was disputed; the integrity of the defense's investigators were questioned and intimidation and bribery were charged; and the significance of Conley's letters to Annie Carter was disputed. The defense, in its rebuttal, tried to bolster the testimony relating to the murder notes and the Carter letters. (These issues were reexamined later when the governor considered commuting Frank's sentence.) During the defense's closing argument, the issue of the repudiations was put to rest by Judge Hill's ruling that the court could only consider the revocation of testimony if the subject were tried and found guilty of perjury. [...] The judge denied Frank a new trial and the full court upheld the decision on November 14, 1914. The full court also said that the due process issue should have been raised earlier, characterizing what it considered a belated effort as [...] "trifling with the court".|$|E
