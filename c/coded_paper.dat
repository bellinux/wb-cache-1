40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} {{capacity and}} achievable rates for transmitter cooperation schemes in ad-hoc wireless networks. In addition to cooperative dirty <b>paper</b> <b>coding,</b> we propose two new cooperative transmission techniques: time-division successive broadcasting and time-division relaying. We show that transmitter cooperation can significantly increase capacity, {{even if one}} of the cooperating nodes is halfway between the transmit and receive node clusters. However, the best form of cooperation depends on the relative geometry of the transmit and receive clusters. When the transmitters are close together, cooperative dirty <b>paper</b> <b>coding</b> achieves the highest rates. However, {{if one of the}} transmitters is relatively close to the receive cluster, cooperative broadcasting or relaying achieves higher rates than dirty <b>paper</b> <b>coding.</b> That is because, at large separations, the exchange of messages between the transmitters required for dirty <b>paper</b> <b>coding</b> consumes a substantial amount of power. We show that in most cases transmitter cooperation provides a substantial capacity improvement over noncooperative techniques, especially under an equal rate constraint. I...|$|R

This kind of “ 1 steganography ” can hide a longer message than simple LSB embedding. We propose a double-layered embedding method for implementing “ 1 steganography, ” in which binary covering <b>codes</b> and wet <b>paper</b> <b>codes</b> {{are used to}} hide messages in the LSB plane and the second LSB plane, respectively. We show that this method can achieve the upper bound on the embedding efficiency of “ 1 steganography ” when the employed binary covering codes reach the upper bound on that of LSB steganography. Applications using random and structured covering codes show that the new method outperforms previous ones and can approach the upper bound.
