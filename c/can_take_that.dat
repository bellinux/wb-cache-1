500|$|Boulding's 2007–08 season {{started in}} better form, when he scored in a 1–1 draw with Brentford {{on the opening}} day of the campaign, which was {{followed}} up with goals in each of Mansfield's next three league fixtures. Despite his goals, Mansfield were soon {{at the bottom of the}} table. The club found some respite from their league form in the FA Cup; their run started with a 3–0 victory against Conference South side Lewes when both Boulding brothers scored, and was followed with a 3–2 defeat of another non-league team, Harrogate Railway Athletic, when Boulding scored twice in a televised game. However, Boulding missed a penalty in Mansfield's next league game as they remained bottom of the table following a goalless draw with Bradford City, before they were knocked out of the FA Cup by Premier League club Middlesbrough in the fourth round once again live on television. Boulding, who hit the crossbar during the game, was pleased with the side's performance, saying: [...] "If we <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> sort of performance into the league, we'll definitely get out of this relegation battle." [...] While Boulding's own goalscoring form continued, Mansfield failed to pick up enough points to stay up. He finished the season with 25goals, including a hat-trick in his penultimate game against Shrewsbury Town.|$|E

But you <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head. Or, you can have a separate machine and do that. if you do it on one machine, you have to echo everything." [...] In more technical terms a tape delay and a 7-ips, instead of the more advanced 15-ips. The recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound.|$|E
