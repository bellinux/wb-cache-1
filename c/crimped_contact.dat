40|$|International audienceThis work {{focuses on}} the {{modeling}} of the aeronautical electrical contact crimping process for aircraft applications. Several thousands of <b>crimped</b> <b>contact</b> {{can be found in}} an airplane or a helicopter. The crimping process has thus to be mastered precisely in order to avoid expensive repairing and dangerous configurations. Electrical crimping is a plastic deformation process of a contact (component) on a multi-strand wire. All components are highly deformed in order to impose mechanical contact and electrical continuity. The components are very small for the cases studied in this work (0. 12 mm diameter wire or 1 mm diameter cylinders). The work has been divided in 3 main steps. First, material characterization is performed in order to identify behavior laws to feed numerical simulations. The challenge {{is to be able to}} deal with very small components. The second point is to build an accurate a numerical model of the crimping process. The numerical model is compared with experimental results. Validation is done comparing with both laboratory devices and real crimped assemblies. Finally mechanical strength is studied. The numerical model is used to verify the impact of components’ dimensions or crimping condition on the mechanical resistance. Numerical models are also compared to experimental data...|$|E

40|$|The crimpings of the Pole Face Windings (PFW), used {{to connect}} the {{rectangular}} copper conductor of the main windings with its supply cable, could have defects due to the manufacture process. They could lead to an extensive high electrical resistance.

40|$|Crimping is a {{mechanical}} joining technique to manufacture electrical connectors by squeezing the clip's crimp barrel onto the conductor.

40|$|International audienceElectrical <b>contact</b> <b>crimping</b> is a {{mechanical}} fastening process {{commonly used in}} aeronautical and aero spatial applications. In order to ensure the perfect electrical conduction and acceptable mechanical properties, the assembly has to fulfill some drastic holding force criteria. This outfit is directly dependent on the indentation depth {{at the end of}} crimping, on the materials properties and on the geometrical dimensions. The feedback generally reveals that an over crimping will lead to the cable breakage whereas an under crimping will be characterized by the cable sliding into the contact during pulling. The optimal behavior is a combination of both phenomena: the cable must become thinner before slipping into the contact. Numerical simulation is an efficient tool to limit the tedious experimental tests. It is the main topic of our work. This paper deals with prediction of the failure type and the force level required to tear out a <b>contact</b> <b>crimped</b> on multi strand cable. Different parameters impact has been numerically studied. In order to simulate the <b>contact</b> tensile test, <b>crimping</b> simulation has to be performed. The first step is then to be able to simulate accurately the crimping stage by using appropriate behavior laws and realistic conditions. One difficulty is linked to the small size of our objects. The first one is a 19 strands cable recorded DR 22. Each cable strand is about 0. 15 mm diameter. The second sample is a 1 mm diameter cylindrical copper contact. It measure 7 mm long. The way to determine the behavior law parameters is succinctly described. Geometries and mechanical fields are obtained and then exported in the mechanical holding model to ensure realistic prediction. Impact of various parameters on the pulling results is discussed. Pulling simulation results are compared to experimental values. The prediction of breakage mechanisms is also studied...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{hand-operated}} and hydraulic compressors use crimping {{of connection}} terminals. However, this equipment often causes compressed defects because non-uniform pressure is {{applied in the}} circumferential direction of the terminal during crimping. A defective terminal often leads to fire in electric equipment due to overheating. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop a new crimping process for manufacturing highly durable terminals. MPC (magnetic pulse crimping) uses uniform electromagnetic pressure by a high magnetic field interaction between coil and terminal. This process uses only electromagnetic pressure for crimping, so the terminal can be <b>crimped</b> without physical <b>contact,</b> thereby producing a highly durable connection terminal. In this study, a MPC process was developed to fabricate a prototypical terminal. The result was compared with other crimping processes in terms of durability. The crimped part using MPC has a lower rising temperature and higher tensile strength than those using other crimping process. It is inferred from the experimental results that an optimal charging voltage exists in the MPC proces...|$|R
40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic feed-thru connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or recessed contact pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact pin retention forces, <b>contact</b> <b>crimp</b> failures, unmated connectors and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged connector elastomeric seals and cryogenic connector failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact retention, plating issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, bent pins, <b>contact</b> <b>crimp</b> barrel cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related. A number of recommendations were identified for improving NASA connector selection processes and overall space connector reliability and performance...|$|R
40|$|During system {{level testing}} {{intermittent}} and permanent open circuit failures of mated, <b>crimp</b> removable, electrical <b>contact</b> pairs were experienced. The {{root cause of}} the failures {{was determined to be}} low (but not zero) contact forces applied by the socket contact tines against the engaging pin. The low contact force reduces the effectiveness of the wiping action of the socket tines against the pin. The observed failure mode may be produced when insufficient wiping during mate, demate and small relative movement in use allows for the accumulation of debris or insulating films that electrically separate the contact pair. The investigation identified at least three manufacturing process control problems associated with the socket contacts that enabled shipment of contacts susceptible to developing low contact forces: (1) Improper heat treatment of the socket tines resulting in plastic rather than elastic behavior; (2) Overly thinned socket tines at their base resulting in reduced pin retention forces; (3) insufficient screening tests to identify parts susceptible to the aforementioned failure mechanisms. The results from an extensive screening program of socket contacts utilizing the industry standard contact separation force test procedures are described herein. The investigation shows this method to be capable of identifying initially weak sockets. However, sockets whose contact retention forces may degrade during use may not be screened out by pin retention testing alone. Further investigations are required to correlate low contact retention forces with increased electrical contact resistance in the presence of insulating films that may accumulate in the use environment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectrical <b>contact</b> <b>crimping</b> is {{a process}} {{commonly}} used in aeronautical and aero spatial applications. One require-ment to perform a resistant assembly is to master crimping parameters. Numerical simulation is then an efficient tool to limit tedious experimental test campaigns. Nevertheless, the numerical model accuracy depends on input data determina-tion, such as material behaviour law parameters. This paper deals with study done to determine material behaviour law parameters of component involved on electri-cal crimping process. The two samples, a strand and an electrical contact, have both small dimensions and specific shapes. For that reason, normalised tensile or compression tests could not be perform. Indeed, inverse analysis is a powerful tool to determine the behaviour laws parameters. The goal is to precisely model the sample mechanical solicitation. A series of computations is launched with various rheological parameters. By comparing experimental and simulated results, {{the goal is to}} minimize a cost function. Thus, the first step of the study has been to determine experimental tests to perform in order to gather the force/displacement experimental data. The copper strands have been studied in compression, with a micro indentation de-vice. A 60 N force sensor has been used to acquire force data, whereas an inductive displacement sensor has been used for displacement acquisition data. The 60 N force sensor is too weak to crush completely a copper contact. For that sample, we decided to use an instrumented crimping plier. A series of crimping tests has been performed on empty barrel, and the equivalent simulation has been done. With the best copper strand material parameters set, relative errors between experimental and simulated copper strand data finally amount to 6. 9 % (lower than the 8 % experimental data scattering). On the other side, with the best cop-per contact material parameters set, the cost function amounts to 4 % (lower than the 7 % experimental data scattering). This study allows to determine material parameters sets which are use to simulate efficiently the crimping process...|$|R
