In his work with patients and in his own personal explorations, Jung wrote that art expression and images found in dreams <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in recovering from trauma and emotional distress. He often drew, painted, or made objects and constructions at times of emotional distress, which he recognized as more than recreational.|$|E
25|$|In 1190 Emperor Henry VI, had revoked Hartwig's princely regalia {{empowering}} {{his rule}} in the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen for his partisanship with the House of Welf. The Pope, however, did not depose Hartwig as archbishop, who fled first with the Guelphs to England and then to Lüneburg. In 1192 Duke Valdemar, meanwhile 22 years old, seriously disagreed about Bishop Valdemar's way of leading the diocese. In the same year the Bremian Chapter didn't wait any longer for a papal dismissal of Hartwig and unauthorisedly elected Valdemar as its new Prince-Archbishop - encouraged by HenryVI. Valdemar welcomed his election, hoping his new position <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in his dispute with Duke Valdemar and his elder brother Canute VI. Before entering the Prince-Archbishopric he won the support of Ditmarsh. Moreover, the bishop conspired with AdolphusIII of Holstein, perhaps also with his brothers-in-law JaromarI of Rugia and CasimirII of Pomerania, and with Canute I of Sweden and Sverre of Norway. The Bremian mint {{in the city of}} Bremen issued coins showing Valdemar's portrait.|$|E

Tiner added that he could recall no other [...] "person of standing" [...] making such a declaration in Shreveport, which he noted in 1865 had briefly been the last capital of the Confederate States of America and hence a symbol of southern conservatism.
