5|$|Experience {{from the}} few <b>cities</b> <b>where</b> {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} of Starling's public disgrace, Lecter sends her a taunting letter. Starling detects a strange fragrance from the letter. A perfume expert later identifies a skin cream whose ingredients are only {{available to a}} few shops in the world. She contacts the police departments of the <b>cities</b> <b>where</b> the shops are located, requesting surveillance tapes. In Florence, one of said cities, Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as Dr. Fell, the assistant curator and caretaker.|$|E

5|$|ArtRave: The Artpop Ball (stylized as artRAVE: the ARTPOP ball) was {{the fourth}} {{headlining}} concert tour by American singer Lady Gaga. Supporting her third studio album Artpop (2013), the tour ran from May 4, 2014 to November 24, 2014. The tour dates included <b>cities</b> <b>where</b> Gaga had canceled shows of her previous Born This Way Ball tour after suffering a hip injury. The ArtRave tour was preceded by a performance at the South by Southwest music festival, which drew controversy due to a segment where an artist vomited on Gaga, and a seven-day residency at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} stories with {{predominantly}} indigenous casts, Drama dari Krakatau {{is set in}} a rural area, far from the <b>cities</b> <b>where</b> the ethnic Chinese populace were concentrated. Geography plays a major role. The novel starts on a macro scale, depicting the origins of the archipelago from rising sea levels caused by the sinking of Poseidonis, then progresses increasingly towards the micro scale, passing through views of Java, Sumatra, and Krakatoa, before focusing on the home of Tjakra Amidjaja {{and the beginning of the}} plot. A later passage details the view from Mount Ciwalirang, showing Java, Krakatoa and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Sunday {{began to}} conduct {{meetings}} (usually {{longer than a}} month) in small cities like Youngstown, Wilkes-Barre, South Bend, and Denver, and then finally, between 1915 and 1917, the major cities of Philadelphia, Syracuse, Kansas City, Detroit, Boston, Buffalo, and New York City. During the 1910s, Sunday was front page news in the <b>cities</b> <b>where</b> he held campaigns. Newspapers often printed his sermons in full, and during World War I, local coverage of his campaigns often surpassed that of the war. Sunday {{was the subject of}} over sixty articles in major periodicals, and he was a staple of the religious press regardless of denomination.|$|E

5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and <b>cities,</b> <b>where</b> size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E
5|$|Compliance {{with the}} law is checked when {{vehicles}} pass through a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major <b>cities,</b> <b>where</b> the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E
5|$|In Manhattan, uptown means north (more {{precisely}} north-northeast, {{which is}} the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage {{differs from that of}} most American <b>cities,</b> <b>where</b> downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.|$|E

5|$|Refused legal {{representation}} or bail, Lenin denied all {{charges against him}} but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work {{he noted that the}} rise of industrial capitalism in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the <b>cities,</b> <b>where</b> they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow Tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.|$|E
5|$|Sunday was a {{conservative}} evangelical who accepted fundamentalist doctrines. He affirmed and preached the inerrancy of the Bible, the virgin birth of Christ, {{the doctrine of}} substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Christ, a literal devil and hell, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, most Protestant church members, regardless of denomination, gave assent to these doctrines. Sunday refused to hold meetings in <b>cities</b> <b>where</b> he was not welcomed by {{the vast majority of the}} Protestant churches and their clergy.|$|E
5|$|The new law was {{met with}} {{considerable}} resistance, especially in the towns and <b>cities,</b> <b>where</b> Tillman had less support. Dozens of clandestine saloons opened, fueled by barrels of illicit liquor, often transported by railroad. Tillman appointed dispensary constables, who tried to seize such shipments, to be frustrated {{by the fact that}} the South Carolina Railroad was in federal receivership, and state authorities could not confiscate goods entrusted to it. All of Tillman's constables were white, placing him at a disadvantage in dealing with the alcohol trade among African Americans. Some of the constables tried going undercover by blacking their faces like minstrels; later, Tillman hired an African-American detective from Georgia.|$|E

5|$|The old Sixth District was {{centered}} in southwestern and south-central Ohio around McEwen's hometown, Hillsboro. After redistricting, McEwen found himself {{running in a}} huge area stretching from Lebanon to Marietta. This new district {{was very difficult to}} campaign in. It spilled across six media markets, meaning that McEwen had to buy ads in <b>cities</b> <b>where</b> most of the viewers couldn't vote in the district. It also lacked any large cities and possessed few unifying elements. His Democratic opponent was psychologist Ted Strickland, whom he had defeated in his initial run in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Zagreb {{was one of}} {{the first}} European <b>cities</b> <b>where</b> {{television}} pictures were broadcast. Beginning on 26 August 1939 the Zagreb Fair featured a Philips television system, operated for short periods each day of the exhibition (until 4 September). The Philips television, consisting of a transmitter and several receivers, was operated by Eric Klaas de Vries in the Dutch pavilion at the fair. The fair newspaper announced the event as the first, after television broadcasts in London and Berlin. The programming consisted of comedy, opera, music performances and the first TV news broadcast in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable {{example of this}} phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big <b>cities</b> <b>where</b> tickets cost more.|$|E
