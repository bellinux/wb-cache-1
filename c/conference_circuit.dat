2500|$|In 1910, {{the year}} when he toured the Old Kingdom's <b>conference</b> <b>circuit,</b> Nicolae Iorga again rallied with Cuza to {{establish}} the explicitly antisemitic Democratic Nationalist Party. Partly building on the antisemitic component of the 1907 revolts, its doctrines depicted the Jewish-Romanian community and Jews in general as a danger for Romania's development. During its early decades, it used as its symbol the right-facing swastika (卐), promoted by Cuza as the symbol of worldwide antisemitism and, later, of the [...] "Aryans".

2500|$|In {{his other}} {{political}} articles, Isac notably expressed his alarm at seeing the Regency regime take shape in post-Trianon Hungary, writing that the exiled Oszkár Jászi was preferable as national leader to the authoritarian Miklós Horthy. He gave a positive review to Jászi's renewed campaigning {{in favor of}} a Danubian Confederation to replace competing nation states, but argued that there was little prospect of [...] "today's generation", in both Romania and Hungary, to endorse the project. Answering to this objection, Jászi himself suggested that Isac take into consideration the creation of a Danubian cultural Alliance, with [...] "civilized" [...] representatives from Hungary, Romania, the Czechoslovak Republic and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Isac, György Litván notes, remained evasive, and, even as Jászi was facing much criticism from partisans of Hungarian ethnic nationalism, as well as from Romanian advocates of centralism, refused to help Jászi and his associate Pál Szende tour the Transylvanian <b>conference</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{founding}} {{president of}} the Association of Romanian Public Libraries, Iorga was also tightening his links with young Transylvanian intellectuals: he took part in reorganizing the Cluj Franz Joseph University into a Romanian-speaking institution, meeting scholars Vasile Pârvan and Vasile Bogrea (who welcomed him as [...] "our protective genius"), and published a praise of the young traditionalist poet Lucian Blaga. He was in correspondence with intellectuals of all backgrounds, and, reportedly, the Romanian who was addressed the most letters in postal history. Touring the larger <b>conference</b> <b>circuit,</b> he also wrote some 30 new books, among them: Histoire des roumains de la Peninsule des Balcans ("The History of Romanians from the Balkan Peninsula": Aromanians, Istro-Romanians and Megleno-Romanians), Istoria poporului francez ("The History of the French People"), Pentru sufletele celor ce muncesc ("For The Souls of Working Men"), and Istoria lui Mihai Viteazul ("The History of Michael the Brave"). Iorga was awarded the title of doctor honoris causa by the University of Strasbourg, while his lectures on Albania, collected by poet Lasgush Poradeci, became Brève histoire de l'Albanie ("Concise History of Albania"). In Bucharest, Iorga received as a gift from his admirers a new Bucharest home on Bonaparte Highway (Iancu de Hunedoara Boulevard).|$|E

In addition, ORF had the broadcasting rights to each “Top Match of the Round” - mostly on Sundays, but also on Wednesdays for weekday rounds. This arrangement did not apply in the last two rounds, in which all games had to be held at the same time. Consequently, ORF was permitted to show a 45-minute summary of the remaining four matches in each round.|$|E

5000|$|Manuel María {{was the son}} of two well-to-do farmers, Antonio Fernández Núñez, who was {{the mayor}} of Outeiro de Rei, and Pastora Teixeiro Casanova. He went to primary school in his small village of Rábade. In 1942 he moved to Lugo to carry out his {{secondary}} studies at the Marist Brothers school. In Lugo, at the age of 20, he began his precocious literary career participating in a <b>conference</b> <b>circuit</b> called [...] "Jóvenes valores lucenses." [...] This helped him get in touch with members of a group that met at the Méndez Núñez cafeteria: Luís Pimentel, Ánxel Fole, Juan Rof Codina, Aquilino Iglesia Alvariño, and others. This was his introduction to Galicianism and the Galician literary world. His friendship with Uxío Novoneyra also dates from this period.|$|E

He has since recorded an ANZAC themed version of [...] "I am Australian", titled [...] "The Anzac Song", and appeared on Melbourne radio advertising the release of a CD-Single several weeks before Anzac Day in 2005. Apparently due to production difficulties, it never eventuated. In 2005 Bruce was interviewed by music journalist Debbie Kruger for a new book entitled Songwriters Speak, focusing on influential and successful Australian singer-songwriters.|$|E
