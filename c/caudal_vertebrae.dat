5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{with the}} poached elements, both new {{specimens}} represent {{almost the entire}} skeleton of Deinocheirus, as MPC-D 100/127 includes all material apart from the middle dorsal vertebrae, most <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> and the right forelimb; MPC-D 100/128 fills in most gaps of the other skeleton, with nearly all dorsal and <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> the ilium, a partial ischium, {{and most of the}} left hindlimb. In 2014, the specimens were described in the Nature journal by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang-Jae Lee Lee, Godefroit, Escuillié, and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. A similar series of events was reported earlier in 2014 with Spinosaurus, another sail-backed theropod which had only been known from few remains since 1912. Poached remains were reunited with specimens obtained by scientists, and Spinosaurus was shown to have been quite different from other spinosaurids. The two cases showed that the lifestyle and appearance of incompletely known extinct animals cannot always be safely inferred from close relatives.|$|E

5|$|The 19 dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar}} to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly concave and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral vertebrae are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
5|$|The tail, {{according}} to Schwartz, {{is longer than}} in the potto. He does not provide measurements of the tail of AMZ 6698 and notes {{that at least one}} vertebra is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> in an illustration of AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the potto, though {{according to}} Stump the tail of Pseudopotto is longer than any seen in pottos. The false potto allegedly has shorter spines on its cervical (neck) and first and second thoracic (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false potto differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a bifid (two-tipped) spine on the second cervical vertebra, but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 potto specimens he examined.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids are {{diagnosed}} {{by the following}} features; short T-shaped frontals that form the rostral boundary of the supratemporal fenestra; a caudolateral overhanging shelf of the squamosal; a lateral process of the quadrate that contacts the quadratojugal; raised, stalked, parapophyses on the dorsal vertebrae, a modified pedal digit II; chevrons and prezygapophysis of the <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> elongate and spanning several vertebrae; {{the presence of a}} subglenoid fossa on the coracoid.|$|E

5|$|During the Pliocene, {{larger and}} more {{advanced}} cetaceans appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies to cope with these large whales. Numerous fossilized flipper bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, which suggests that megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its fins before killing and feeding on it.|$|E
5|$|The bat's upperparts are reddish-brown or grey, {{while the}} {{underside}} is generally paler. The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips {{that allow the}} bat to hover. Despite having two <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs (the uropatagium) which may assist in flying and catching insects, {{although there are no}} tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of {{the neck}} had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments which helped support the massive head. The dorsal vertebrae of the back had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural spines were short and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae. The ribs {{of the last four}} back vertebrae were fused to them, and the ribcage was very broad {{in this part of the}} body. The ribs had scars that show where muscles attached to them. The <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> of the tail had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides. The interlocked zygapophyses (articular processes) of the <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> formed a U-shape when seen from above, instead of the more usual V-shape.|$|E

50|$|Its fossil {{specimens}} {{were found}} by Matley in the Lameta Formation, {{dating from the}} Maastrichtian. They consist of two syntypes, GSI K27/614 and GSI K20/612, each being a partial distal <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra.</b> A third distal tail vertebra, GSI K27/599, {{has been referred to}} the species.|$|R
50|$|The holotype, once {{having the}} {{inventory}} number MGB 500 but later lost, was a distal <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> 152 millimetres long. The species was by von Huene considered {{a member of}} the Coeluridae but is now generally seen as a nomen dubium, Neotheropoda incertae sedis.|$|R
5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|About 8500 {{different}} marcoremains {{have been}} found in Lo Hueco. Sauropods make up the largest amount of the remains with many articulated individuals, <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> and teeth. The <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> have been identified as being from a titanosaur closely related to Lirainsaurus, but with some differences. The teeth, were assigned to Ampelosaurus atacis. Apart from sauropods, the Villalba de la Sierra Formation has a good representation of carbonized plants, mostly known from branches and leaves, and invertebrates, mostly bivalves and gastropods. Fishes from the formation include lepisosteid, which have plenty of material, and unidentified actinopterygians and teleosteans. Turtle fossils are very common, even more common than fishes. Of all this material, only two different groups have been identified, the bothremydids Polysternon and Rosasia, along with an uncommon undetermined Pancryptodiran. Squamate lizards are known only from a few undetermined specimens, and eusuchian crocodiles are known from a specimen with similarities to Allodaposuchus and Musturzabalsuchus. Ornithischias and theropod dinosaurs are not as common as sauropods but still consist of much material. Basal euornithopods and probable ankylosaurians are known from Lo Hueco. The ankylosaurian remains consist of a few vertebrae. Rhabdodon sp. is known from the formation, and is known from a fair amount of elements. Only two theropods have been identified, both Dromaeosauridae indet., one dromaeosaurine and one velociraptorine.|$|E
5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E
50|$|A middle <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra</b> {{from the}} Marília Formation, CPP 248, cannot be {{evaluated}} for any diagnostic {{features of the}} genus Aeolosaurus.

5|$|Carnotaurus {{is one of}} the best-understood genera of the Abelisauridae, {{a family}} of large theropods {{restricted}} to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents. Several notable traits that evolved within this family, including shortening of the skull and arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> were more pronounced in Carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} 198284 Suresh Srivastava, a GSI {{geologist}} at the Palaeontology Division of the GSI's Western Region, collected {{large numbers of}} bone fossil fragments from Rahioli, and also precisely mapped the area. These fossils {{were taken to the}} Palaeontology Division at Jaipur for identification. U. B. Mathur and Suresh Srivastava, under the supervision of S. C. Pant, meticulously cleaned many of the skeletal parts (braincase, dorsal and <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> sacrum, thigh bone, upper arm, shin bones, and others), leading to the publication of multiple research papers. There was a lull in further activity until a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with Punjab University in 199495.|$|E
5000|$|Teinurosaurus (meaning [...] "extended tail lizard") is a genus of {{carnivorous}} theropod dinosaur. Teinurosaurus lived {{during the}} Late Jurassic {{in what is}} now Portugal.

30|$|Caudal vertebra: {{the only}} <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra</b> (Figure  2) is poorly {{preserved}} but still presents the centrum, the prezygapophyses, the transverse processes, and the neural and haemal arches.

5|$|The tail of Sauropelta was {{characteristically}} {{long and}} made up {{nearly half of the}} body length. One skeleton preserved forty caudal (tail) vertebrae, although some were missing, suggesting that the true number of <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> may have exceeded fifty. Ossified tendons stiffened the tail along its length. Like other ankylosaurs, Sauropelta had a wide body, with a very broad pelvis and ribcage. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, which resulted in an arched back, with the highest point over the hips. Its feet, limbs, shoulders, and pelvis were all very stoutly constructed and reinforced to support a great deal of weight. American paleontologist Ken Carpenter estimated the mass of S. edwardsorum at 1,500kilograms (3,300lb).|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{vertebrae}} of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six lumbar vertebrae. A find of associated <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> {{from the base of}} the tail, which diminish in size only slowly from front to back, suggests that the tail was long. There is no evidence for the additional joints between the vertebrae that are characteristic of xenarthrans. In the seven known thoracic (chest) vertebrae, the articulations with the intervertebral disks are bean-shaped and much wider from side to side than from top to bottom. In the back thoracics and all lumbars, a longitudinal transarcual canal is present in the neural arch.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the tail}} {{had at least}} forty <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> it was highly mobile. It could {{possibly}} swing at an arc of 180 degrees, covering the entire half circle behind it. Swing speeds {{at the tail end}} may have been as high as 50km/h. Continuous rapid swings would have allowed the spikes to slash open the skin of its attacker or to stab the soft tissues and break the ribs or facial bones. More directed blows would have resulted in the sides of the spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of the legs by blunt trauma. These attacks would have crippled small and medium-sized theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones. Earlier interpretations of the defensive behaviour of Kentrosaurus included the suggestion that the animal might have charged to the rear, to run through attackers with its spines, in the way of modern porcupines.|$|E
