25|$|A late intimation of Nash's {{development}} of the Italianate style was his 1805 design of Sandridge Park at Stoke Gabriel in Devon. Commissioned by the dowager Lady Ashburton as a country retreat, this small country house clearly shows the transition between the picturesque of William Gilpin and Nash's yet to be fully evolved Italianism. While this house can still be described as Regency, its informal asymmetrical plan together with its loggias and balconies of both stone and wrought iron; tower and low pitched roof <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> {{very similar to the}} fully Italianate design of Cronkhill, the house generally considered to be the first example of the Italianate style in Britain.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of {{contributors to the}} Mishnah state that the table was of the same dimensions as the loaves - 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, but Rabbi Akiva contributed a dissenting view, according to which there was {{a gap between the}} piles of shewbread, with the table being 12 Etzba long, and 6 Etzba wide; Abba Saul argued that the cups of incense were placed within the gap. These dimensions <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> too small for the loaves to rest on the table lengthways, and clearly some support would have been needed for them to be piled high upon the table in two distinct piles, which is difficult to reconcile with the apparent biblical implication that the loaves were free standing on the table.|$|E
25|$|The {{number and}} nature of the post-oral {{segments}} in the insect head have rarely been questioned. A much more difficult area, however, has been the nature of the preoral region. The obvious contradiction between a theory that no-preoral structures are segmental, and evidence, such as for the first antennae of crustaceans, that some such structures <b>clearly</b> <b>are,</b> led workers as long ago as Lankester to posit that there has been forward migration of segments in front of the mouth. Indeed, such a process can be seen in ontogeny of the tritocerebrum, which can be seen to migrate forward as the brain develops; furthermore, although in most insects and crustaceans its ganglia are part of the brain, its commissures still loop behind it, suggesting derivation from a more posterior position.|$|E

25|$|The {{pipe organ}} {{is another example}} of a {{potentially}} dipole sound source being driven as a monopole source. An air jet is directed at a sharp edge setting up flow oscillations as in the edge tone. The edge is part of a generally cylindrical tube of length L. An example is shown in the figure on the right. The unstable jet drives fluid alternately into the tube and out. The streamlines <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> distorted from those of the free edge tone. There is a stagnation point opposite the source. The dashed lines, colored in red, are those most strongly modified. The red streamlines in the tube are now augmented by the oscillatory flow in the tube, a superposition of resistive and reactive dipole flow and resistive acoustic flow.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to tell {{how much of the}} content of these traditional biographies is fiction and how much is fact. Large parts <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> mere deduction from Juvenal's writings, but some elements appear more substantial. Juvenal never mentions a period of exile in his life, yet it appears in every extant traditional biography. Many scholars think the idea to be a later invention; the Satires do display some knowledge of Egypt and Britain, and it is thought that this gave rise to the tradition that Juvenal was exiled. Others, however - particularly Gilbert Highet - regard the exile as factual, and these scholars also supply a concrete date for the exile: 93 AD until 96, when Nerva became emperor. They argue that a reference to Juvenal in one of Martial's poems, which is dated to 92, {{is impossible}} if, at this stage Juvenal was already in exile, or, had served his time in exile, since in that case, Martial would not have wished to antagonise Domitian by mentioning such a persona non grata as Juvenal. If Juvenal was exiled, he would have lost his patrimony, and this may explain the consistent descriptions {{of the life of the}} client he bemoans in the Satires.|$|E

[...] We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] Christian Hamaker of Crosswalk.com noted that, [...] "in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and puts it in the mouths of the film's villains... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal." [...] Other reviews saw Avatar as [...] "the bubbling up of our military subconscious... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast." ...|$|E

In 1966 he was a principal witness for an extensive Congressional review of China policy conducted by Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At that time China was regarded primarily as an enemy, particularly for its support of North Vietnamese expansion. China was feared as a revolutionary force seeking to topple democratic governments, which would fall like a row of dominoes. Barnett told the committee that China's initial reaction to American overtures was [...] "almost certain to be negative and hostile and that any changes in our posture will create some new problems, but ... initiatives on our part <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> required {{if we are to}} work, however slowly, toward the long term goal of a more stable, less explosive situation in Asia and to explore the possibilities of trying to moderate Peking's policies." [...] In 1969, Barnett moved to the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at the Johns Hopkins University, where he remained until he retired in 1989.|$|E

2500|$|Reform of {{the office}} is usually only {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a New Zealand republic. Helen Clark, when defending Dame Silvia Cartwright following a political controversy over prison sentences, stated [...] "ne of the challenges for us is we <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> no longer a dominion of Britain where the Governor-General is exactly like the Queen. I think we need to consider how the role of governor-general might evolve further. As you know, my view is that one day there will be a president fulfilling the kind of role the governor-general does." [...] Others, such as Professor Noel Cox have argued that the Governor-General's role needs to be updated, rather than reforming the office. Some constitutional academics expressed concern that the process of electoral reform could result in the Governor-General having greater political influence. In 1993, the then Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard caused controversy by suggesting that under the proposed Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system, the Governor-General may have to use their reserve powers more often. Following the adoption of MMP at a referendum later in 1993, Prime Minister Jim Bolger suggested at the opening of parliament in 1994 that one reason New Zealand might move to a republic was that the Governor-General would have more influence under the new electoral system.|$|E

60|$|But {{the lighter}} the sufferings are, the more {{difficult}} it is to judge of the comforts of the Spirit of God, for it is common for a man to be comfortable under sufferings when he suffereth but little, and knows also that his enemy can touch his flesh, his estate, or the like, but little: I say, it is common for such a man to be comfortable in his sufferings, from the consideration that his enemies can touch him no further. And this may be the joy of the flesh--the result of reason, and may be very much, if not altogether, without a mixture of the joy of the Holy Ghost therewith. The more deep, therefore, and the more dreadful the sufferings are, the more <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> seen the comforts of the Spirit, when a man has comfort where the flesh is dead, stirreth not, and can do nothing. When a man can be comfortable at the loss of all--when he is under the sentence of death, or at the place of execution--when a man's cause, a man's conscience, the promise, and the Holy Ghost, have all one comfortable voice, and do all, together with their trumpets, make one sound in the soul; then the comforts are good, of the right kinds, of God and his Spirit.|$|E

60|$|When the American {{war began}} troops were {{sent out to}} Canada, and when I was in the provinces more troops were then expected. The matter was much talked of, {{as a matter of}} course, in Canada, and it had been {{discussed}} in England before I left. I had seen much said about it in the English papers since, and it also had become the subject of very hot question among the politicians of the Northern States. The measure had at that time given more umbrage to the North than anything else done or said by England {{from the beginning of the}} war up to that time, except the declaration made by Lord John Russell in the House of Commons as to the neutrality to be preserved by England between the two belligerents. The argument used by the Northern States was this: if France collects men and material of war in the neighborhood of England, England considers herself injured, calls for an explanation, and talks of invasion. Therefore, as England is now collecting men and material of war in our neighborhood, we will consider ourselves injured. It does not suit us to ask for an explanation, because it is not our habit to interfere with other nations. We will not pretend to say that we think we are to be invaded. But as we <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> injured, we will express our anger at that injury, and when the opportunity shall come will take advantage of having that new grievance.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is further}} {{apparent}} that Browning's characters are never merely types, but {{must always be}} reckoned with as individuals. It was his belief that no two beings were ever made similar in head and heart; hence, even where there are external similarities the essential elements are strongly differentiated. Take, for instance, three poems in which the situations are not unlike. In [...] "My Last Duchess," [...] "The Flight of the Duchess," [...] and The Ring and the Book, we have a portrayal of three men of high lineage, but cold, egotistic, cruel, who have married very young and lovely women over whom the custom of the times gives them absolute power. But there the likeness ends. We cannot for a moment class together the polished, aesthetic, well-bred aristocrat of the first poem, the absurd little popinjay of the second, and the [...] "tiger-cat" [...] of the third. Less strongly, but as <b>clearly</b> <b>are</b> the wives differentiated. To the innocent gaiety of heart, the bright, sweet friendliness of the hapless lady in [...] "My Last Duchess" [...] must be added for the lady in [...] "The Flight of the Duchess" [...] a native force of character which, when roused by {{the call of the}} gypsy-queen, enables her to break the yoke imposed on her by the Duke and his mother and go forth into a life of adventure, freedom, and love. The delicate, flower-like Pompilia in The Ring and the Book has also power to initiate and carry through a plan of escape, but her incentive is no call to romantic freedom. Her passive endurance changes to active revolt only when motive and energy are supplied by her love for her child. Or take Pippa and Phene in Pippa Passes, two beautiful young girls brought up in dangerous and evil surroundings, but both innately pure. In character and experience they are, however, as unlike as two girls could be. Phene, undeveloped in mind and heart, the easily duped agent of a cruel trick, appeals to us by her slow, incredulous, but eager response to goodness and aspiration, the tremulous opening of her soul to love. But Pippa, with her observant love of nature, her gay, sportive, winsome fancies, her imaginative sympathy with the lives of others, her knowledge of good and evil, her poise, her bright steadiness of soul, carries us into a different and much more highly evolved world of thought and feeling. So we might go through the great assemblage of Browning's characters to find that each one stands out by himself as a person with his own qualities, possibilities, and problems.|$|E
