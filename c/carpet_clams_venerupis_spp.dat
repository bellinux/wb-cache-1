40|$|Protocol for {{hatchery}} {{culture of}} the pullet <b>carpet</b> shell <b>clam</b> <b>Venerupis</b> corrugata spat is currently under development, as the only reliable means of providing spat to replenish natural beds or to support aquaculture activities. Among other variables, the microbiota has been demonstrated to be critical for successful bivalve culture. Shellfish hatcheries are hindered by fatal outbreaks of disease, regardless the bivalve species. These mass mortalities are mainly caused by opportunistic bacteria belonging to genus Vibrio and constitute one bottleneck for this economic activity. Different species, as V. tubiashii, V. pectenicida, V. splendidus, V. neptunius, V. ostreicida and V. bivalvicida, {{have been identified as}} responsible of mortalities in hatchery-reared larvae, affecting a wide range of bivalves. This is the first report of the microbiota associated with larval cultures of the pullet <b>carpet</b> shell <b>clam.</b> We present the results of the microbiological analyses of two larval cultures of pullet carpet shell reared in the Centro de Investigacións Mariñas (CIMA, Xunta de Galicia) de Ribadeo (Galicia, NW Spain) following the procedures developed in the institution. Each batch, A and B, was obtained from broodstocks collected in natural environment but in different geographical locations, the stock A (SW Galicia) and the stock B (NW Galicia). Previous records of mortalities led us to divide each batch in two. One sub-batch (A 1 and B 1) was cultured following the routine procedures. Antibiotic was experimentally added to the other sub-batch (A 2 and B 2) with the aim of evaluating the effects on the culturable bacterial population (total marine bacteria and presumptive vibrios) and on larval survival. Chloramphenicol, formerly the most commonly used antibiotic in bivalve hatcheries, was supplied with each change of seawater during larval development. Microbiological samples of broodstock, larvae and seawater in culture tanks were taken and processed immediately following Prado et al. (2005, 2014). The bacteriological media used were Marine Agar, for heterotrophic marine bacteria, and Thiosulphate-Citrate-Bile-Sucrose, selective for vibrios. Bacterial counts were determined in all samples and expressed in colony forming unit (cfu) per millilitre or gram. The different types of colony in the samples of larval cultures were isolated, purified and subjected to a basic phenotypic characterization. Further studies were carried out with the isolates that shared the main features of the genus Vibrio, including phenotypic tests and the genetic characterization by sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene, as described by Prado et al. (2014). The counts of marine heterotrophic bacteria associated to broodstock gonad were similar in both groups (≈ 105 cfu/g). However, substantial differences were observed in the counts of presumptive vibrios, with higher values in the stock B (≈ 104 cfu/g) than in the stock A (≈ 102 cfu/g). Interestingly, the larval batch A showed high bacterial counts in the initial samples, including presumptive vibrios, while the batch B began with lower numbers of total marine bacteria and vibrios. The survival rates {{at the end of the}} larval development were higher in batch B (40 % B 1, 32 % B 2) than in batch A (24 % A 1, 27 % A 2). The use of antibiotic did not imply a significant enhancement of the survival. The total counts in the seawater from the culture tanks were similar. The presumptive vibrios were found mainly associated to larvae, regardless the batch or the use of antibiotic. The differences on the composition of bacterial populations will be analysed, focused on the identification of the presumptive vibrios. Preliminary results showed the dominance of species within the Splendidus clade of the genus Vibrio, as expected taking into account that its members have been isolated from marine environments and many of them from bivalves. Due to the high phenotypic diversity within this clade and the difficult to differentiate species, the correlation between phenotypic and genotypic identification will be evaluated...|$|R

Here we describe the first isolation of V. tapetis from wild-caught and subsequently captive-held Dover sole Solea solea.

On the non-pigmented side, multiple circular lesions-white at the center and red at the edges-were evident. Histological examination of the vesicular lesions revealed dermal fluid-filled spaces, collagen tissue necrosis and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, with large numbers of small rod-shaped bacteria. In the deep skin lesions, loss of scales and dermal connective tissue, with degeneration and fragmentation of the myofibres bordering the ulceration, were noted.

Cellular processes such as inhibition of serine proteases and proliferation were also involved in this early response. This phase was followed by an intermediate stage, when the pathogen was most likely multiplying and infecting new areas of the body, and animals began to die. In this stage, many genes related to cell movement were over-expressed. Thirty days after infection metabolic pathway genes were the most affected.

In the present study, we cloned and characterized {{a member of the}} invertebrate defensin from the <b>clam</b> <b>Venerupis</b> philippinarum, designated VpDef. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that VpDef was similar to defensins from marine mollusks and ticks. In non-stimulated clams, RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that both VpDef mRNA and the encoding peptide were constitutively expressed in hemocytes and mantles, as well as in other major tissues. VpDef transcripts were significantly induced in hemocytes at different time intervals post Vibrio anguillarum infection. The recombinant VpDef (rVpDef) showed the highest activity against Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and less effective to Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, incubation of rVpDef with M. luteus at 1 x and 3 x MIC could induce an obvious decrease of the membrane potential and notable changes of membrane permeability in a dose-dependent manner. Membrane integrity and bacterial viability analysis also revealed that rVpDef increased the membrane permeability of M. luteus and then resulted in cell death at 2 x and 10 x MIC. Overall, these results suggest that VpDef has an important function in host defense against invasive pathogens, probably killing microbes by inducing membrane lesions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Total haemocyte count, haemocyte diameter and volume, lysozyme activity in both haemocyte lysate and cell-free haemolymph, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in gills and digestive glands were measured at time 0 (clam sampling time), after 7 days of acclimation in the laboratory and after 1, 3 and 7 days of copper exposure. Interestingly, statistical analyses (three-way ANOVA and Canonical Correlation Analysis) revealed persistent differences in the biological responses of clams from the two sampling sites before and after copper exposure. Conversely, the influence of copper on cellular and biochemical parameters was negligible. Overall, the results obtained indicated that animals with a different ecological history respond differently to experimental contaminant exposure.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 The {{success of}} {{commercial}} shellfish aquaculture {{is rooted in}} a healthy and productive nearshore marine ecosystem, making it essential {{to strike a balance}} between ecological and economic interests for farmers and regulators alike. Consequently, the removal of marcoalgae from anti-predator nets and the development of new harvest techniques used in Manila <b>clam</b> (<b>Venerupis</b> philippinarum) aquaculture have raised important questions regarding their ecological impacts. In this study, I examine these impacts on the infaunal invertebrate communities of a Manila clam farm in Samish Bay, Washington. Using species data gathered from benthic and epibenthic sampling, I found that farmed sites support different invertebrate communities compared to reference sites, regardless of whether or not macroalgae is removed from anti-predator nets. Similarly, farmed sites support different invertebrate communities and lower taxon densities and richness values when compared to eelgrass habitats, regardless of whether or not sites are harvested by hand or by machine. Within farmed sites, however, a significant decline in both density and richness was observed after hand harvesting events, but not after mechanical harvests. These results provide ecological evidence that supports the removal of macroalgae from anti-predator nets, and the continued use and development of mechanical forms of Manila clam harvest. Both technologies are responsible for increases in the economic returns from shellfish operations, but until now, their ecological effects have been less clear...|$|R
40|$|The main {{toxic effect}} of {{fluoride}} in cells {{depends on its}} interaction with enzymes, acting as an enzyme inhibitor and interrupting metabolic processes, such as glycolysis and protein synthesis. We carried out experiments on the marine <b>clam</b> <b>Venerupis</b> philippinarum, in order to study its fluoride accumulation capability- exposing the animals to the nominal concentrations of 80, 160, 320 and 640 mg/l in filtered seawater. In addition we studied {{the effects of the}} exposure of their haemocytes to NaF (10, 50 and 250 mg/L) in filtered seawater (FSW), for 60 min. A significant (p < 0. 01) increase in cell mortality, as detected with the Trypan Blue assay, was reported for all the concentrations used in our experiments. A decrease in the stability of the internal membranes was observed with the Neutral Red assay, after exposure to 250 mg/L as the dye, usually accumulating inside acid compartments, such as lysosomes, leaks from these compartments into the cytoplasm so that the cells assume a pinkish colour. A significant (p < 0. 01) reduction in the fraction of phagocytosing cells was observed at all the used concentrations suggesting an effect of fluoride ions on actin cytoskeleton. The observed increase in the cell shape factor in haemocytes exposed to 250 mg/L, indicating a decrease in the capability of haemocytes to assume a spreading morphology, fits the above hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|The Gram-negative {{bacterium}} Vibrio tapetis {{is known}} as the causative agent of Brown Ring Disease (BRD) in the Manila <b>clam</b> <b>Venerupis</b> (=Ruditapes) philippinarum. This bivalve is the second most important species produced in aquaculture and has a high commercial value. In spite of the development of several molecular methods, no survey has been yet achieved to rapidly quantify the bacterium in the clam. In this study, we developed a Taqman real-time PCR assay targeting virB 4 gene for accurate and quantitative identification of V. tapetis strains pathogenic to clams. Sensitivity and reproducibility of the method were assessed using either filtered sea water or extrapallial fluids of clam injected with the CECT 4600 T V. tapetis strain. Quantification curves of V. tapetis strain seeded in filtered seawater (FSW) or extrapallial fluids (EF) samples were equivalent showing reliable qPCR efficacies. With this protocol, we were able to specifically detect V. tapetis strains down to 1. 125 101 bacteria per mL of EF or FSW, taking into account the dilution factor used for appropriate template DNA preparation. This qPCR assay allowed us to monitor V. tapetis load both experimentally or naturally infected Manila clams. This technique will be particularly useful for monitoring the kinetics of massive infections by V. tapetis and for designing appropriate control measures for aquaculture purposes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{occurrence}} {{and spread}} of brown ring disease (BRD) to several northern Mediterranean coasts is described. We report {{the results of}} a 6 -y surveillance of BRD in natural populations of <b>carpet</b> shell <b>clams</b> (Ruditapes decussatus) in 14 zones along the Gulf of Gabes in Tunisia (southern Mediterranean Sea). BRD symptoms in adult animals resulting from conchiolin deposits in inner parts of carpet shell were observed in all zones surveyed. Infestation rates within each site ranged from 65 - 100 %, and BRD prevalence varied from 1 - 58 % of clams in winter and from 1 - 33 % in summer. Positive correlations were demonstrated between BRD prevalence and Vibrio spp. concentrations in clams. Vibrio tapetis was not identified among the bacterial organisms, suggesting that other marine Vibrio species are capable of causing BRD-like illness in <b>carpet</b> shell <b>clams...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceHemocytes are {{the immune}} effectors in clams, {{directing}} cellular but also humoral defences. In the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) and the <b>carpet</b> shell <b>clam</b> (Ruditapes decussatus), two phenotypically similar venerid species, fishery and aquaculture importance motivated scientific studies to improve {{knowledge about the}} participation of hemocytes in immune response. Currently, gaps still persist concerning the classification of hemocyte sub-populations {{as well as their}} non-immune activities. This review summarizes current knowledge about hemocytes of the Manila <b>clam</b> and the <b>carpet</b> shell <b>clam,</b> suggests some probable misinterpretations arising from extrapolations from other bivalves and vertebrates, and suggests future research prospects. The susceptibility of hemocytes to environmental modifications as well as biological and chemical toxicants is also re-evaluated. Hemocytes of bivalves are not limited in function to immunity and should be considered in a wider scheme including the environment and whole-animal physiology...|$|R
40|$|<b>Clam</b> spat <b>Venerupis</b> pullastra {{were fed}} for 4 weeks on diets of 2 species of microalgae {{supplied}} singly or mixed. Microalgae were Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis suecica, species used normally in bivalve hatcheries. Observed growth responses were high for mixed and I. galbana diets and intgermediate for the T. suecica diet. Differences in growth rate were explained by differences in rates of ingestión and digestibility {{and in the}} biochemical composition of diets. Lower growth indices were related to lower protein and higher lipid content of spat. The high growth response to the mixed diet was not explained by the factors considere...|$|R

The chromosomal changes accompanying bivalve evolution are an area about which few reports have been published. To improve our understanding on chromosome evolution in Veneridae, ribosomal RNA gene clusters were mapped by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to chromosomes of five species of venerid <b>clams</b> (<b>Venerupis</b> corrugata, Ruditapes philippinarum, Ruditapes decussatus, Dosinia exoleta, and Venus verrucosa). The results were anchored to the most comprehensive molecular phylogenetic tree currently available for Veneridae. While a single major rDNA cluster was found {{in each of the}} five species, the number of 5 S rDNA clusters showed high interspecies variation. Major rDNA was either subterminal to the short arms or intercalary to the long arms of metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes, whereas minor rDNA signals showed higher variability. Major and minor rDNAs map to different chromosome pairs in all species, but in R. decussatus one of the minor rDNA gene clusters and the major rDNA cluster were located in the same position on a single chromosome pair. This interspersion of both sequences was confirmed by fiber FISH. Telomeric signals appeared at both ends of every chromosome in all species. FISH mapping data are discussed in relation to the molecular phylogenetic trees currently available for Veneridae. 1...|$|R
