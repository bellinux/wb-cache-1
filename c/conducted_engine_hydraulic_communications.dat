40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> mounts {{are applied}} to the {{automotive}} applications to isolate the chassis from the high frequency noise and vibration generated by the engine {{as well as to}} limit the engine shake motions resulting at low frequencies. In this paper, a new <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> mount with a controllable inertia track profile is proposed and its dynamic behavior is investigated. The profile of the inertia track is varied by applying a controlled force to a cylindrical rubber disk, placed in the inertia track. This design provides a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> mount design with an adjustable notch frequency location and also damping characteristics in shake motions. By using a simple control strategy, the efficiency of the proposed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> mount in two-mode operation meaning isolating mode in the highway driving condition and damping mode in the shock motions, is investigated...|$|R

To build an active engine mount, a commercial On-Off solenoid is modified {{to be used as}} an actuator and it is embedded inside a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> mount. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engine</b> mount is modelled and tested, solenoid actuator is modelled and identified, and finally the models were integrated to obtain the analytical model of the active hydraulic mount. Then the active mount is tested and showed that the analytical model can closely predict its behaviour. In future, the developed model can be used for designing the vibration control system of this active mount. This active mount can potentially work as part of an active noise and vibration control (ANVC) system in automotive or other closely related applications as an alternative to more expensive active mount systems...|$|R
