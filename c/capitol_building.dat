5|$|With Indiana's rapid {{increase}} of population {{during the middle}} of the 19th century, the state's government increased in size, causing the previous <b>capitol</b> <b>building</b> to become crowded. In 1865, a state office building had to be constructed to house some of the burgeoning government, and the Supreme Court and several bureaus were relocated into the new building. When the statehouse was condemned in 1877, the state was without a real <b>capitol</b> <b>building,</b> and the administration of Governor James D. Williams proposed the construction of the current state <b>capitol</b> <b>building.</b> The plan was approved by the Indiana General Assembly during the legislative session of 1878. After the third state <b>capitol</b> <b>building</b> had been razed, the new building was constructed on the same site. Two million dollars (USD) were appropriated for construction of the new building, and it was completed in 1888. Governor Williams, who was famed for his frugality, was able to complete the project for $1.8 million and returned the extra $200,000 to the general fund.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Supreme Court, {{business}} was conducted at a variety of locations in downtown Salem. The first public building to house the court was the Territorial <b>Capitol</b> <b>Building</b> in Salem that was built between 1854 and 1855. In that building the courtroom was in a chamber measuring 20 feet by 27 feet on the first floor. On December 29, 1855, after the building was partially occupied, it burned to the ground. In 1876, the state finished construction on a second <b>capitol</b> <b>building</b> where the court was located on the third floor. This courtroom measured 54 feet by 46 feet, while the state law library was 75 feet by 70 feet. A separate building was built by the state in 1914 to house the Supreme Court, and this is now the oldest building on the Capitol Mall after the second <b>capitol</b> <b>building</b> burned down on April 25, 1935.|$|E

5|$|In 1872, {{architect}} Elijah E.

The cornerstone was laid on October 2, 1873, with about 7,000 Lansing residents and some 30,000 to 50,000 visitors attending. Construction and finishing work were completed by late 1878.
