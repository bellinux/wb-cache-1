5|$|In 1907, Australian swimmer and {{performer}} Annette Kellerman {{was arrested}} on a Boston beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. In 1913, designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired {{by the introduction of}} females into Olympic swimming he designed a <b>close-fitting</b> costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.|$|E
25|$|<b>Close-fitting</b> caps called coifs or biggins {{were worn}} only by young {{children}} and old men under their hats or alone indoors.|$|E
25|$|The members wore a {{black dress}} bound by a leathern girdle, a black {{sleeveless}} cloak, and a <b>close-fitting</b> headdress with a white veil and a longer black veil.|$|E
25|$|<b>Close-fitting</b> caps {{covering}} the ears and tied under the chin called coifs {{continued to be}} worn by children and older men under their hats or alone indoors; men's coifs were usually black.|$|E
25|$|At {{this early}} date, {{it seems that}} the style {{associated}} with a flapper already included the boyish physique and <b>close-fitting</b> hat, but a hobble skirt rather than one with a high hemline.|$|E
25|$|Margaret of Anjou, Queen consort of Henry VI of England. She {{is wearing}} the <b>close-fitting</b> cotehardie with gold buttons and tight gold sleeves. Her red mantel is richly {{embroidered}} {{at the neck}} and clasped with a brooch.|$|E
25|$|Both men's and women's {{national}} dress {{are extremely}} costly {{and can take}} many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the <b>close-fitting</b> jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.|$|E
25|$|Jeans {{or other}} sturdy, <b>close-fitting</b> {{trousers}} made of canvas or denim, {{designed to protect}} the legs and prevent the trouser legs from snagging on brush, equipment or other hazards. Properly made cowboy jeans also have a smooth inside seam to prevent blistering the inner thigh and knee while on horseback.|$|E
25|$|Between c. 1390 and 1410 the bascinet had an exaggeratedly tall skull with an acutely pointed profile– {{sometimes}} {{so severe}} {{as to have}} a near-vertical back. Ten years later both the skull of the helmet and the hinged visor started to become less angular and more rounded. Almost globular forms became common by c. 1450. As {{part of the same}} process the helmet became more <b>close-fitting,</b> and narrowed to follow the contours of the neck.|$|E
25|$|Today's working cowgirls {{generally}} use clothing, {{tools and}} equipment indistinguishable from that of men, other than in color and design, usually preferring a flashier look in competition. Sidesaddles are only seen in exhibitions and {{a limited number of}} specialty horse show classes. A modern working cowgirl wears jeans, <b>close-fitting</b> shirts, boots, hat, and when needed, chaps and gloves. If working on the ranch, they perform the same chores as cowboys and dress to suit the situation.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 41 D.IIIs were {{delivered}} to frontline units between April and May 1918. Most aircraft were supplied to Jagdgeschwader II, whose pilots were {{enthusiastic about the}} new aircraft's handling and rate of climb. After only seven to 10 hours of service, however, the Sh.III engines started showing serious problems with overheating and piston seizure. The problem was later traced to the Voltol mineral oil {{that was used to}} replace the now-scarce castor oil. Furthermore, the <b>close-fitting</b> engine cowling provided inadequate cooling to the engine.|$|E
25|$|The Small Box Respirator {{featured}} a single-piece, <b>close-fitting</b> rubberized mask with eye-pieces. The box filter was compact {{and could be}} worn around the neck. The SBR could be readily upgraded as more effective filter technology was developed. The British-designed SBR was also adopted {{for use by the}} American Expeditionary Force. The SBR was the prized possession of the ordinary infantryman; when the British were forced to retreat during the German Spring Offensive of 1918, it was found that while some troops had discarded their rifles, hardly any had left behind their respirators.|$|E
25|$|By {{approximately}} 5,000 years ago, jewellery-making {{had become}} a significant craft in the cities of Mesopotamia. The most significant archaeological evidence comes from the Royal Cemetery of Ur, where hundreds of burials dating 2900–2300 BC were unearthed; tombs {{such as that of}} Puabi contained a multitude of artefacts in gold, silver, and semi-precious stones, such as lapis lazuli crowns embellished with gold figurines, <b>close-fitting</b> collar necklaces, and jewel-headed pins. In Assyria, men and women both wore extensive amounts of jewellery, including amulets, ankle bracelets, heavy multi-strand necklaces, and cylinder seals.|$|E
25|$|The miners took {{to these}} devices without {{hesitation}} as their pay was not calculated {{until they had}} reached their underground workplace. Contemporary safety studies concluded that, although intrinsically dangerous, {{the use of a}} man engine was in practice safer than climbing long ladders: it was less risky to be carried {{up at the end of}} a hard shift than to climb a ladder and risk falling because of exhaustion. In some mines, particularly in Germany, wedges or collars placed just above <b>close-fitting</b> rollers, or chains, were installed to limit any drop should a breakage occur.|$|E
25|$|Most classic huipils are {{wider than}} they are long {{although}} there has been a reduction in width in recent years. Huipils can be as short as waist length or can reach to the ankles or anywhere in between, but most fall just above or just below the knee. Long or short, it is not designed to be a <b>close-fitting</b> garment. The neckline can be round, oval, square or a simple slit. Most are sewn on the sides, leaving an opening in the upper part for the arms to pass through. Some huipils are not sewn on the sides, especially the very short ones.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the upper}} part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a <b>close-fitting</b> shirt-like garment called a chemise in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was tucked into a man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise {{underneath}} their gowns or robes, sometimes with petticoats over the chemise. Elaborately quilted petticoats might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the farthingale was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with reed or willow rods so that it stood out from a woman's body like a cone extending from the waist.|$|E
25|$|In {{works of}} art, battles between Amazons and Greeks {{are placed on}} the same level as – and often {{associated}} with – battles of Greeks and centaurs. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly {{in the shape of a}} crescent, called pelta, and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess Athena. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly Persian – that is, <b>close-fitting</b> trousers and a high cap called the kidaris. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly over-sized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or <b>close-fitting</b> neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E
25|$|Officers were {{responsible}} for providing (and paying for) their own uniforms. Consequently, variable styles and decorations were present, according to the officer's private means. Officers in the Infantry wore scarlet coattees with long tails fastened with turnbacks. <b>Close-fitting</b> white pantaloons, tucked into tall Hessian or riding boots were worn, often covered with grey wool and leather overalls on campaign, {{in addition to a}} dark blue, later grey, double-breasted greatcoat. After 1811, officers were permitted to wear a short tailed coatee, grey pantaloons or trousers and low field boots on campaign. Officers generally wore silver or gold epaulettes (depending on regimental colours), with regimental badge to designate rank. An 1810 order stipulated that subalterns wore one epaulette, on the right shoulder, while captains wore one of a more ornate pattern on the right shoulder. Field officers wore one on each shoulder, badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels). Grenadier, fusilier and light infantry officers wore more ornate versions of the shoulder wings their men wore on both shoulders; trimmed with lace, chain or bullion. Generals, from 1812, wore an aiguillette over the right shoulder, and rank was denoted by the spacing of buttons on the coatee: Major generals wore their buttons in pairs, lieutenant generals in threes and full generals wore their buttons singly spaced.|$|E
25|$|The steppe wildcat's coat {{is lighter}} than the forest wildcat's, and never attains the level of density, length, or {{luxuriance}} {{as that of the}} forest wildcat, even in winter. The tail appears much thinner than that of the forest wildcat, as the hairs there are much shorter, and more <b>close-fitting.</b> The colours and patterns of the steppe wildcat vary greatly, though the general background colour of the skin on the body's upper surface is very lightly coloured. The hairs along the spine are usually darker, forming a dark gray, brownish, or ochreous band. Small and rounded spots cover the entirety of the species' upper body. These spots are solid and sharply defined, and do not occur in clusters or appear in rosette patterns. They usually do not form transverse rows or transverse stripes on the trunk, {{as is the case in}} the forest wildcat. Only on the thighs are distinct striping patterns visible. The underside is mainly white, with a light gray, creamy or pale yellow tinge. The spots on the chest and abdomen are much larger and more blurred than on the back. The lower neck, throat, neck, and the region between the forelegs are devoid of spots, or have bear them only distinctly. The tail is mostly the same colour as the back, with the addition of a dark and narrow stripe along the upper two-thirds of the tail. The tip of the tail is black, with 2–5 black transverse rings above it. The upper lips and eyelids are light, pale yellow-white. The facial region is of an intense gray colour, while the top of the head is covered with a dark gray coat. In some specimens, the forehead is covered in dense clusters of brown spots. A narrow, dark brown stripe extends from the corner of the eye to the base of the ear.|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} dog must be rounded {{in shape}} with no stop. Their eyes are {{almond-shaped}} and small, and the lips are <b>close-fitting</b> and lack flews. The back must be arched, and the body should be slightly longer in length than in height. Although [...] is the preferred height for male dogs, a range from [...] is allowed; for females, the preferred height is [...] and the acceptable range is from [...] Both genders must weigh between [...] They possess a light, springy gait.|$|E
500|$|Chapter IV details natural {{selection}} under the [...] "infinitely complex and <b>close-fitting...</b> mutual relations of all organic beings {{to each other}} and to their physical conditions of life". Darwin takes as an example a country where a change in conditions led to extinction of some species, immigration of others and, where suitable variations occurred, descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions. He remarks that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence in character between breeds, and suggests that {{natural selection}} might do the same, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Cocoon" [...] was {{directed}} by Eiko Ishioka and was shot in April 2001 in New York City. One of Björk's most avant-garde music videos, it: [...] "plays with minimalist white for both costume and bleached eyebrows, treating Björk as a geisha whose makeup extends over her entire nude body". Red threads emerge from her nipples and circulate between her breasts and nose, finally enveloping her in a cocoon. Björk actually wore a very <b>close-fitting</b> body suit. Although not as controversial as the [...] "Pagan Poetry" [...] music video, it was still banned from MTV. The three music videos {{were included in the}} DVDs Volumen Plus (2002) and Greatest Hits - Volumen 1993–2003 (2002).|$|E
500|$|Female {{swimming}} {{was introduced}} at the 1912 Summer Olympics. In 1913, inspired by that breakthrough, the designer Carl Jantzen {{made the first}} functional two-piece swimwear, a <b>close-fitting</b> one-piece with shorts {{on the bottom and}} short sleeves on top. Silent films such as The Water Nymph (1912) saw Mabel Normand in revealing attire, and this was followed by the daringly dressed Sennett Bathing Beauties (1915–1929). The name [...] "swim suit" [...] was coined in 1915 by Jantzen Knitting Mills, a sweater manufacturer who launched a swimwear brand named the Red Diving Girl,. The first annual bathing-suit day at New York's Madison Square Garden in 1916 was a landmark. The swimsuit apron, a design for early swimwear, disappeared by 1918, leaving a tunic covering the shorts.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Cocoon" [...] {{was directed by}} Eiko Ishioka and shot in April 2001 in New York City. It was premiered at Raindance Film Festival on 24 October 2001, and was made available online through the singer's official website on 12 February 2002. Its treatment was described as playing with [...] "minimalist white for both costume and bleached eyebrows, treating Björk as a geisha whose makeup extends over her entire nude body". The video begins with many apparently nude Björks singing. Throughout the video, red threads emerge from her nipples and circulate between her breasts and nose, finally enveloping her in a cocoon. Björk actually wore a very <b>close-fitting</b> body suit. Following the music video for previous single [...] "Pagan Poetry", it was also banned from prime-time MTV.

2500|$|Christina of Denmark, Duchess of Milan in {{mourning}} wears a black robe with a fur lining over a black gown. [...] She wears a <b>close-fitting</b> black cap, 1538.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>close-fitting</b> linen cap {{called a}} coif or biggins was worn, alone or under other hats or hoods, {{especially}} in the Netherlands and England. Many embroidered and bobbin-lace-trimmed English coifs survive from this period.|$|E
2500|$|... wears {{a finely}} pleated partlet or high-necked chemise {{with a high}} collar and small ruff beneath her gown. [...] Her <b>close-fitting</b> cap may be similar to that worn by Anne of Cleves under her veil, c. 1545.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Close-fitting</b> sleeves {{just past}} the elbow were trimmed with frills or ruffles, and {{separate}} under-ruffles called engageantes of lace or fine linen were tacked to the smock or chemise sleeves. The neckline was trimmed with a fabric or lace ruffle, or a neckerchief called a fichu could be tucked into the low neckline. Women would also sometimes [...] wear a neckerchief or a more formal [...] lace modesty piece, particularly on low-cut dresses.|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{a problem}} for <b>close-fitting</b> {{neoprene}} suits, or hybrid suits with neoprene bottoms, which prevent air from easily moving into the legs of the suit. Wearers of baggy surface dry suits can mitigate the problem by venting out as much excess air as possible before entering the water. This is typically done by crouching down and leaning forward, wrapping the arms around the knees, and then having an assistant zip the suit shut while it is stretched out tightly. Excess air can also be [...] "burped" [...] out of the neck or cuff seal.|$|E
2500|$|Vertebrate {{dentition}} {{originated from}} a folding {{in of the}} placoderm's armor, evolving into the familiar condition of living reptiles, amphibians, and fish: a long row of pointed or sharp-sided, undifferentiated teeth (homodont) that are completely replaceable. The mammalian pattern is significantly different. The teeth in {{the upper and lower}} jaws in mammals have evolved a <b>close-fitting</b> relationship such that they operate together as a unit. [...] "They occlude, that is, the chewing surfaces of the teeth are so constructed that the upper and lower teeth are able to fit precisely together, cutting, crushing, grinding or shearing the food caught between." ...|$|E
2500|$|Home-sewn {{garments}} {{competed with}} factory-made, ready-to-wear garments. The bra {{was at first}} {{an alternative to the}} corset, as a negligée or at-home wear, or worn by women with medical issues stemming from corsets. After the straight-fronted corset became fashionable in the early 20th century, a bra or [...] "bust supporter" [...] became a necessity for full-busted women because the straight-fronted corset did not offer as much support and containment as the Victorian styles. Early bras were either wrap-around bodices or boned, <b>close-fitting</b> camisoles (both worn over the corset). They were designed to hold the bust in and down against the corset, which provided upward support.|$|E
2500|$|The Villiers 31 had a flat sided {{fuselage}} of {{rectangular cross-section}} behind the wing, {{built around a}} frame of chrome steel tubes and fabric covered. It was the first aircraft to have an autogenically welded structure, that is welded {{without the use of}} a filler metal. There was a [...] Gnome et Rhône 9Ab nine-cylinder radial engine in the nose, which some photographs show under a long-chord, <b>close-fitting,</b> circular cowling. Others show it uncowled. The two crew sat in a cockpit at the wing leading edge, the wing itself raised a little above the general fuselage line on a low fairing over the cabin, which seated eight and was lit by long strips of transparencies on each side. [...] Access was via a rear starboard side door.|$|E
2500|$|Erections {{during sleep}} or when waking up are {{medically}} known as nocturnal penile tumescence and colloquially {{referred to as}} morning wood. The penis can regularly get erect during sleep and men or boys often wake up with an erection. Once a boy reaches his teenage years, erections occur much more frequently due to puberty. Erections can occur spontaneously {{at any time of}} day, and if clothed may cause a bulge or [...] "hump". This can be disguised or hidden by wearing <b>close-fitting</b> underwear, a long shirt and baggier clothes. Erections are common for male children and infants, and can even occur before birth. Spontaneous erections are also known as involuntary or unwanted erections and are normal. Such erections can be embarrassing if they happen in public, such as a classroom or living room.|$|E
2500|$|The Flamen priesthood was {{dedicated}} to various deities of the Roman state. They wore a <b>close-fitting,</b> rounded cap (Apex) topped with a spike of olive-wood; and the laena, a long, semi-circular [...] "flame-coloured" [...] cloak fastened at the shoulder with a brooch or fibula. Their senior was the Flamen dialis, who was the high priest of Jupiter and was married to the Flamenica dialis. He {{was not allowed to}} divorce, leave the city, ride a horse, touch iron, or see a corpse. The laena was thought to predate the toga. The twelve Sali ("leaping priests" [...] of Mars) were young patrician men, who processed through the city in a form of war-dance during the festival of Mars, singing the Carmen Saliare. They too wore the apex, but otherwise dressed as archaic warriors, in embroidered tunics and breastplates. Each carried a sword, wore a short, red military cloak (paludamentum) and ritually struck a bronze shield, whose ancient original was said to have fallen from heaven.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fashion of}} the Gibson Girl allowed them {{a much more}} active {{lifestyle}} then previously, in both work and recreation. [...] "Skirts were long and flared, and dresses were tailored with high necks and <b>close-fitting</b> sleeves. The style was considered masculine, and this was sometimes emphasized by wearing a necktie. Though women still wore the restrictive undergarments known as corsets, a new health corset came into style that {{was said to be}} better for the spine than earlier corsets. An S-shaped figure became trendy, with a large bust and large hips, separated by a tiny, corseted waist. These styles, worn with confidence and poise by modern women. ... She might be pictured at a desk in a tailored shirtwaist or at a tennis party in an informal sports dress. She wore her long hair upswept in an elaborate mass of curls, perhaps topped by a simple straw hat. Though she was capable and independent, the Gibson girl was always beautiful and elegant." [...] According to the Library of Congress, [...] "Gibson’s meticulous depiction of their hats accentuates the Gibson Girls' stylish attire and visually reinforces the impression of height, leading the eye to the mountains. ... Gibson shows off the classic Gibson Girl as a figure who embraced outdoor physical activities." ...|$|E
