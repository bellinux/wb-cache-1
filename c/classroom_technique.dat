Members with the same role from each group gather in [...] "expert groups" [...] to discuss their sections. They then return to their own groups and take turns to present what they have learned. They are then assessed individually on all sections of the material. This division of responsibilities means that students are motivated to listen to each other and each of them experiences a role in which they are valuable to others.|$|E

The existence of English teaching learning process is a current issue in senior high school. It is needed to face Asian Economic Community. The {{purposes of this study}} are expose briefly the English teaching learning process of MAN 1 Boyolali namely : learning objective, syllabus, classroom procedure, <b>classroom</b> <b>technique,</b> learning material, teacher and student’s role, media, assessment and strength and weaknesses. The study was an micro ethnographic study. The result of research portrays learning objective categorized into general and specific outcome. The syllabus of research is mixed syllabus. It consist of functional, structural, lexical, genre based text and skill based syllabus. The classroom procedure is two pattern namely : BKOF-MOT-JCOT-ICOT and BKOF-MOT-ICOT. The <b>classroom</b> <b>technique</b> are mind mapping, brainstorming, think-pair-share, think-aloud pair problem solving, drilling, questioning, presenting, practicing, discussing, and concluding. The learning material is divided into printed for instance, handbook, worksheet, handout and and unprinted such as MP 3 file, slide, cassette and CD room. The Student’s role are as listener, an active participant, a processor, coordinator and problem solver. The teacher’s role are a manager, guide and instructor, a guide and instructor and explainer. The media are language laboratory, laptop and LCD projector, internet and, speaker active. The assessment applied to written test such as dialogue completion task, multiple choice and listening close task. It also uses observation, portfolio and project in assessment. There are strength and weakness among English teaching learning process at MAN 1 Boyolali. Due to to finding, discussion, conclusion and implication, the writer suggests for English teacher to enlarge their knowledge and involves their student in classroom actively. The application of variety methods, model and technique are obviously needed in English teaching. The writer also recommends for future to inflate the study in other research field.

To address these needs, we introduce a new modeling framework, the Hierarchical Network Models (HNM) framework. The HNM framework {{can be used to}} extend single-network statistical network models to multiple networks, using a hierarchical modeling approach.

The catalytic event is {{the transfer of}} marbles (substrate molecules) by hand from one plastic container to another.

With this demonstration, students visualize an important concept: the turnover number is constant and independent of marble concentration. A student assessment of this exercise showed that it helped students visualize the turnover number and Vmax but not Km, the marble concentration at which V 0 is one-half Vmax. To address the concept of Km, we use supplemental laboratory and lecture exercises. This exercise with plastic containers and marbles is equally suited to demonstrate the kinetics of carrier-mediated membrane transport. We conclude that this exercise helps students visualize the turnover number and Vmax and gives students important insights into the kinetic parameters used to characterize the catalytic activity of enzymes and membrane transporters...|$|E

40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) This paper explores vendor {{selection}} decisions where competing vendors offer similar {{products with}} multiple non-price attributes. Traditional ''multi-attribute auctions'' {{such as the}} USAF Air Tanker competition include prices alongside other attributes in vendor proposals. Buyers generally select winning bidders using a weighted average of price and non-price attributes. A different approach is recommended here: to embed vendor prices directly in the buyer''s budget constraint. A {{first step is to}} conduct a simple multi-attribute auction with a fixed budget. The government buyer only evaluates vendor proposals that satisfy the budget constraint, choosing the proposal (non-price attribute bundle) which offers the greatest ''value for money'' (i. e., budget). The next step is to address budget uncertainty, expanding the model to incorporate a range of budgets. This leads to several interesting results, including that the traditional practice, and <b>classroom</b> <b>technique,</b> of eliminating dominated alternatives can lead to sub-optimal decisions. Improving public procurement decisions requires forecasting a range of future budgets, and soliciting information from vendors that allows procurement alternatives to be defined as functions of the value offered by each vendor over a range of budgets, rather than as a single point in budget-value (cost-effectiveness) space. Under more realistic budget scenarios, different vendor selection decisions will occur that benefit both troops and taxpayers. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|E
