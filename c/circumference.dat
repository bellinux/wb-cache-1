40|$|The Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence Study aims to {{describe}} total {{body fat percentage}} and anthropometric indices of body fat distribution in European adolescents. Objective: To describe the standardization process and reliability of anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements. We examined both intra- and interobserver errors for skinfolds, <b>circumferences</b> and BIA. Methods: For the intraobserver error assessment, first of all, 202 adolescents in the pilot study (110 boys, 92 girls, aged 13. 64 ± 0. 78 years) were assessed. For the second intraobserver and interobserver assessments, 10 adolescents were studied (5 boys and 5 girls). Results: The pilot study’s intraobserver technical errors of measurement (TEMs) were between 0. 12 and 2. 9 mm for skinfold thicknesses, and between 0. 13 and 1. 75 cm for <b>circumferences.</b> Intraobserver reliability for skinfold thicknesses was greater than 69. 44 % and beyond 78. 43 % for <b>circumferences.</b> The final workshop’s intraobserver TEMs for skinfold thicknesses and <b>circumferences</b> were smaller than 1; for BIA resistance TEMs were smaller than 0. 1 O and for reactance they were smaller than 0. 2 O. Intraobserver reliability values were greater than 95, 97, 99 and 97 % for skinfold thicknesses, <b>circumferences,</b> BIA resistance and reactance, respectively. Interobserver TEMs for skinfold thicknesses and <b>circumferences</b> ranged from 1 to 2 mm; for BIA they were 1. 16 and 1. 26 O for resistance and reactance, respectively. Interobserver reliability for skinfold thicknesses and <b>circumferences</b> were greater than 90 %, and for BIA resistance and reactance they were greater than 90 %. Conclusions: After {{the results of the}} pilot study, it was necessary to optimize the quality of the anthropometric measurements before the final survey.

Single-step annealing results in the self-assembly of long tubes displaying monodisperse <b>circumferences</b> of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, or 20 DNA helices. DNA, life's information carrier, has recently emerged as a versatile material for constructing self-assembled synthetic molecular structures and devices (1 – 4). The construction of extended DNA arrays has motivated the search for rigid molecular building blocks, as component rigidity is commonly considered necessary {{for the formation of}} well-ordered DNA crystals rather than ill-defined aggregates (5). A typical building block, or tile, has a rigid structural core and displays several “sticky ends ” that allow for specific binding with other tiles to guide lattice formation (6, 7). Diverse tiling lattices have been constructed (8), and some of these lattices are reported to form tubes (9 – 15). Such DNA nanotubes typically have varied <b>circumferences.</b> As the precise control of the structure of matter is a central goal for nanotechnology, materials science, and supermolecular chemistry, controlling DNA tube <b>circumferences</b> has attracted intense research interest. One strategy is to encode the circumferential tube geometry directly in each individual building block (16 – 21) : barrel-like and/or half-barrel–like rigid tiles with designed...|$|R

This information is necessary to ascertain human-machine compatibility {{in the design of}} manual systems for the bare and gloved hand, such as design and sizing of hand tools, controls, knobs and other applications in different kinds of precision and power grips. The present study was undertaken to generate hand anthropometric data of 95 women, working in informal industries (beedi, agarbatti and garment making). Methods: Fifty one hand measurements of the right hand (lengths, breadths, <b>circumferences,</b> depths, spreads and clearances of hand and fingers) were taken, using anthropometric sliding and spreading calipers, measuring tape and handgrip strength dynamometer. The data were statistically analyzed to determine the normality of data and the percentile values of different hand dimensions, and simple and multiple regression analysis were done to determine better predictors of hand length and grip strength. Results: The hand breadths, <b>circumferences</b> and depths were approximately normally distributed, with some deviation in case of the finger lengths.

For both sexes. comparisons of percentiles for different age cohorts revealed marked variations apparently related to aging in all three parameters: 1) for men, both arm <b>circumferences</b> and arm muscle <b>circumferences</b> generally increased with aging until middle-age (35 to 44 yr), and then, steadily decreased: 2) for women. all three parameters increased progressively until age was well advanced (45 to 64 yr). and then stabilized, on declined, {{with the onset of}} senescence: and. 3) triceps skinfold thicknesses in men showed large fluctuations but no consistent trends with advancing age.
