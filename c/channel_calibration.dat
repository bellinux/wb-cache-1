40|$|The {{process to}} ensure a fixed and desired {{response}} from a color display generally consists of a per-channel calibration transform combined with a multi-dimensional characterization transformation. In this paper We focus on the former, i. e., the <b>channel</b> <b>calibration.</b> Conventional one-dimensional <b>channel</b> <b>calibration</b> strategies are inadequate for high resolution LCD displays because of inter-channel crosstalk. We address this problem by developing a color calibration strategy for a four primary LCD display, based on a two dimensional structure for <b>channel</b> <b>calibration,</b> which allows for simultaneously meeting the dual objectives of perceptual linearization of individual channels and gray balance along the device gray axes, despite inter-channel crosstalk. The two-dimensional nature of the transform represents a good balance between the dual objectives of low complexity and accurate control of key attributes of the displayed colors via <b>channel</b> <b>calibration</b> and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme accomplishes its objectives offering a significant improvement over the per <b>channel</b> <b>calibration</b> for our four primary display system.

We found no significant trends associated with frequency, frequency <b>channels,</b> <b>calibration</b> source, pointing uncertainty, instrument type, platform and altitude. We did find some evidence at the ~ 1 to ~ 2 sigma level for trends associated with angular scale (l range) and absolute galactic latitude.

It is found that accurate wind diagnoses depend upon (1) accounting for hydrometeor effects in the AMSU channels, and (2) maximizing signal-to-noise, since the 50 km resolution data cannot fully resolve the temperature gradients in the Vmax region, typically 10 - 20 km in scale.

Each thermistor bolometer package consisted of three narrow field of view (FOV) broadband radiometric channels measuring shortwave (0. 2 to 5. 0 jim), longwave (5. 0 to 50 jim), and total (0. 2 to 50 pin) radiation.

40|$|A simple <b>channel</b> <b>calibration</b> for {{microphone}} arrays is proposed. A gain {{is applied}} to the signal in each channel. The signal power in each channel is normalized by its time-averaged power and scaled by the channel-averaged power. This allows equalization of the gains without any change in the output power of the fixed beamformer. Suppressing the gain difference reduces directivity distortion and avoids target speech cancellation by the microphone array. Evaluation results in a simulated environment demonstrate that the gain difference as much as 3. 1 dB is suppressed. This calibration is robust to an interference direction of arrival (DOA) of up to 90 ◦. The improvement in the target speech leakage through a fixed blocking matrix is also shown. Experimental results in the real environment with DOAs of 30 ◦ to 90 ◦ and signal-to-interference ratios of 0 dB and 10 dB show that the proposed method reduces the gain difference by 80 % of the initial 1. 26 dB difference. 1...|$|E

A novel {{radio channel}} {{compensation}} method aiming to give optimal calibration for microstrip antenna array systems {{is presented in}} this paper, realized for an actual DOA measurement antenna system using microstrip antennas to sample the electromagnetic field, operating at 4. 5 GHz. This new approach considers mismatch between antennas and channel RF ports, channel transmission ine-qualities, and also decreases the effects of multipath propagation components of calibration reference signals by placing the calibration reference signal feeding network on the microstrip antenna array bearer, directly beside the antenna patches. It is combined with orthogonal spread spectrum calibration signal utility for continuous uninter-rupted measurements. The spread spectrum calibration signal is orthogonal to the continuous wave (CW) signal to be measured, therefore, the 2 signals can be separated in the receiver, enabling them to be present simultaneously.
