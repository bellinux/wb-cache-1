5|$|In 1923 J Harlen Bretz {{published}} a paper {{arguing that the}} channeled scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. This view, which was seen as arguing for a Catastrophic explanation for the geologic development, which ran counter the then prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz's views were initially decried. Bretz defended his theories, setting off a forty-year debate over the Missoula Floods before Bretz’s view of a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> finally prevailed. Waitt extended Bretz's argument, arguing for a sequence of multiple Missoula Floods — 40 or more. Waitt's proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake bottom deposits in Ninemile Creek and the Touchet Formation deposits in Burlingame Canyon. This represented a move away from a single <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> toward a series of catastrophic floods, but with the flood source still ascribed to Glacial Lake Missoula.|$|E
5|$|The {{next big}} {{headland}} is Foreland Point, {{after which the}} path comes to Lynmouth with the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway linking it with Lynton on the hill above. At Lynmouth the path intersects with the Two Moors Way. The river here suffered a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> in the 1950s. Beyond Lynton the path passes through the Valley of the Rocks, known for its herd of goats, then Duty Point and Lee Bay, then Crock Point and Woody Bay. After Highveer Rocks the path crosses the small River Heddon then skirts Trentishoe Down and Holdstone Down and climbs Great Hangman.|$|E
5|$|A <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> in March 1913, {{known as}} the Great Dayton Flood, led to the {{creation}} of the Miami Conservancy District, a series of dams and hydraulic jumps installed around Dayton, in 1914. Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II. Several locations around the city hosted the Dayton Project, a branch of the larger Manhattan Project, to develop polonium triggers used in early atomic bombs. The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high demand for housing and other services. At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.|$|E

50|$|The ages of <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flooding</b> is not tightly constrained, and {{may involve}} several events. The {{mechanisms}} of lake filling and ice dam failure would suggest an early or late glacial time, whereas conditions at glacial maxima {{would seem to}} preclude such events.

5|$|After a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> in 1889, the Johnstown Inclined Plane was {{completed}} in 1891 {{to serve as an}} escape route for future floods, as well as a convenient mode of transportation for the residents of the new communities situated above the valley. It was operated by Cambria Iron Company and its successor Bethlehem Steel until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown Inclined Plane fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floodsonce in 1936 and again in 1977. The incline was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1994. It had major renovations in 1962 and from 1983 to 1984.|$|E

40|$|<b>Catastrophic</b> <b>floods</b> {{may be the}} {{mechanism}} which created Martian outflow channels and the distinctive assemblage of channel landforms, including regional and local anastomosing patterns, expanding and contracting reaches correlated with flow constrictions, streamlined uplands, inner channels with recessional headcuts, pendant forms on the downcurrent sides of flow obstacles, and scour marks around the obstacles. A terrestrial landscape which contains analogs to all the Martian outflow features is the Channeled Scabland of eastern Washington, formed by <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flooding</b> across differentially resistant basalt, loess and sedimentary rock.

25|$|A <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> {{refilled}} the Mediterranean Sea 5.3 {{million years}} ago, {{at the beginning}} of the Zanclean age that ended the Messinian salinity crisis. The flood occurred when Atlantic waters found their way through the Strait of Gibraltar into the desiccated Mediterranean basin, following the Messinian salinity crisis during which it repeatedly became dry and re-flooded, dated by consensus to before the emergence of modern humans.|$|E

25|$|The mine {{returned}} to profitability during the 1920s but was beset {{by a series}} of difficulties, and then a falling lead price in the 1930s. A reservoir dam collapsed in 1927, sending a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> through Glenridding village. Fortunately no one was killed, but compensation claims cost the company over £4,500, several years' worth of profits. A replacement reservoir dam, built at a cost of nearly £11,000, also failed in August 1931 and the reservoir was then abandoned. In the same month one of the shafts in the mine collapsed, and collapsed again in December 1933. The falling lead price led to a {{reduction in the number of}} employees, from 68 to 53 in February 1931, and down to 40 in July 1932.|$|E
25|$|The Kankakee Torrent was a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> that {{occurred}} between 14,000 and 18,000 years ago, {{resulting from the}} breach of a large glacial lake formed by the melting of the Wisconsin Glacier. The origin of the flood may have been prehistoric Lake Chicago, it {{may have come from}} further east, near what is today the center of the Lower Peninsula of the state of Michigan. The torrent carved out a channel that is currently followed by the Kankakee River and Illinois River. It also appears to have pushed the course of the Ohio River further south and the Mississippi River further west. The bluffs carved by the torrent can be seen at Starved Rock State Park and Kankakee River State Park. In both parks, smaller streams flow over waterfalls before they join the main river, phenomenon known as hanging tributaries.|$|E

Pre-Cambrian and Pleistocene geological formations compose the bulk of Kerala's terrain. A <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> in Kerala in 1341 CE drastically modified its terrain and consequently affected its history; it also created a natural harbour for spice transport.|$|E
500|$|Sedimentation of the Colorado River Delta {{directed}} {{water into}} the Lake Cahuilla area. Distributaries in a river delta are inherently unstable and tend to change course often. Major floods may have triggered the change in river course, {{although most of the}} flood events in the prehistoric record {{do not appear to be}} associated with diversions to Lake Cahuilla. Given that the slope toward Lake Cahuilla is steeper than the one toward the Gulf of California, once the river entered the basin it likely stabilized on that course. In fact, it is remarkable that this slope difference doesn't regularly cause the river to enter the Salton Trough. The diversion occurred close to the apex of the Colorado River Delta and would have discharged water directly through the Alamo River and indirectly through Volcano Lake and the New River. The infilling of the lake may have been a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood,</b> considering that native people fled the Imperial Valley to the mountains. Infilling to an altitude of [...] above sea level would have taken 20–12 years. When the lake was full, the Colorado River would have entered it at the southeastern side.|$|E

500|$|Four Chinese constellations are {{contained}} {{in the area of}} the sky identified with Perseus in the West. Tiānchuán (天船), the Celestial Boat, was the third paranatellon (A star or constellation which rises at the same time as another star or object.) of the third house of the White Tiger of the West, representing the boats that Chinese people were reminded to build in case of a <b>catastrophic</b> <b>flood</b> season. Incorporating stars from the northern part of the constellation, it contained Mu, Delta, Psi, Alpha, Gamma and Eta Persei. Jīshuǐ (積水), the Swollen Waters, was the fourth paranatellon of the aforementioned house, representing the potential of unusually high floods during the end of August and beginning of September at the beginning of the flood season. Lambda and possibly Mu Persei lay within it. [...] Dàlíng (大陵), the Great Trench, was the fifth paranatellon of that house, representing the trenches where criminals executed en masse in August were interred. It was formed by Kappa, Omega, Rho, 24, 17 and 15 Persei. The pile of corpses prior to their interment was represented by Jīshī (積屍, Algol), the sixth paranatellon of the house. The Double Cluster, h and Chi Persei, had special significance in Chinese astronomy. Known as Hsi and Ho, the two clusters represented two astronomers who failed to predict a total solar eclipse and were subsequently beheaded.|$|E
