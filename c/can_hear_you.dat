In 1695 an't was used as a {{contraction}} of [...] "am not", in William Congreve's play Love for Love: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> farther off, I an't deaf". But as early as 1696 Sir John Vanbrugh uses an't to mean [...] "are not" [...] in The Relapse: [...] "Hark thee shoemaker! These shoes an't ugly, but they don't fit me".|$|E

500|$|An initial {{screening}} of Alien for 20th Century Fox representatives in St. Louis {{was marred by}} poor sound. A subsequent screening in a newer theater in Dallas went significantly better, eliciting genuine fright from the audience. Two theatrical trailers were shown to the public. The first consisted of rapidly changing still images set to some of Jerry Goldsmith's electronic music from Logan's Run. The second used test footage of a hen's egg set to part of Goldsmith's Alien score. The film was previewed in various American cities {{in the spring of}} 1979 and was promoted with the tagline [...] "In space, no one <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> scream." ...|$|E
500|$|The September 11 {{terrorist}} attacks were a major {{turning point in}} Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized {{the need for the}} nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. On September 14, he visited Ground Zero, meeting with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on a heap of rubble, to much applause: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you.</b> The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{music videos}} were also made to help promote the album. The first was [...] "Die Dead Enough", which was {{directed}} by Thomas Mignone. [...] "Of Mice and Men" [...] {{was selected as the}} second video from the album. In this video, the then-new Megadeth lineup is shown performing. The majority of the video was filmed on January 20, 2005 in Los Angeles. Many fans turned up to be in the video through a contest held by Sanctuary Records. A third video was made for [...] "Back in the Day" [...] in 2005, but was unreleased until September 2014, to celebrate ten years since the album's release.

500|$|Ira Whipple (Gary Patent) says, [...] "In cyberspace, {{everyone}} hears you scream", {{a reference}} to the tagline of the 1979 film Alien: [...] "In space, no one <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> scream." [...] A New York Film Academy professor refers to Holden as a [...] "James Cameron-wannabe", referring to the American director of such films as The Terminator and Aliens. The vlog in which Holden's ear is cut off is described by one characters as a rip-off of director Quentin Tarantino, {{a reference to}} his 1992 feature film debut, Reservoir Dogs. During an interrogation, Mike Logan sarcastically refers to Reggie as James Dean, the famous actor and American cultural icon. Captain Danny Ross refers to the episode's shooting as [...] "cyber-Rashomon. Reggie says Holden shot Todd, Holden says Reggie did it and Willow doesn't even believe anyone's dead." [...] This references the 1950 Japanese film Rashomon, in which multiple characters describe vastly different interpretations of the same murder. A poster for Grand Illusion, the 1932 Jean Renoir war film, hangs in Holden's apartment. In the episode's final scene, Willow is interviewed by CNN journalist Larry King, host of Larry King Live, which is shown on a giant scene in Times Square.|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

The skyline will be made whole again." [...] During a visit to the site on September 14, 2001, Bush spoke to a crowd of cleanup workers through a megaphone.
