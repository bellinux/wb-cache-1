In weak erosion, {{the cells in}} the samples were slightly deformed without any change in their internal structure. There was slight discoloration and breakup between the <b>cell</b> <b>cavity</b> and secondary cell wall (Fig.  4 a). In some samples, oval-shaped cells were found, with no obvious boundary between the <b>cell</b> <b>cavity</b> and the secondary cell wall; hollow corners of the cells; and only the part S 2 layer, close to the <b>cell</b> <b>cavity</b> slightly discoloured (Fig.  4 b).

30|$|The solute {{diffusion}} into cell walls {{was suggested}} {{to be driven}} by the higher solute concentration in <b>cell</b> <b>cavities</b> than that in cell walls, which is caused by the higher evaporation rate of solvent from <b>cell</b> <b>cavities</b> than that from cell walls [5]. The amount of solute diffusing into cell walls is considered to be increased by increasing the following two factors. The first factor is the difference in solute concentration between <b>cell</b> <b>cavities</b> and <b>cell</b> walls. The second factor is the solute diffusivity into cell walls [6]. It should be noticed that both these factors may be affected by the atmospheric state such as relative humidity (RH) and temperature during the conditioning. The goal of our work was to determine the atmospheric states that maximize the amount of the solute diffused into cell walls by controlling the solute diffusion during conditioning process.|$|R

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of oil impregnation is as follows: as wood is preheated prior to secondary treatment, whatever air that is {{contained within the}} <b>cell</b> <b>cavities</b> and voids becomes hot and expands. Immersing the hot wood in a room temperature preservative solution causes the rapid contraction of the air within the <b>cell</b> <b>cavities</b> and voids, resulting in the solution being drawn into the wood void structures. It is believed that the performance of treated wood is closely connected with the oil properties, the amount of absorption {{and the extent of}} oil leaching during use.

40|$|So-called {{goblet cells}} {{are present in}} the midgut of {{lepidopteran}} larvae. They are thought {{to be involved in the}} active transport of potassium out of the haemolymph and into the gut lumen. A number of plasma membrane differentiations within the goblet <b>cell</b> <b>cavity</b> has been investi-gated using conventional staining, lanthanum tracer and freeze-etch techniques. Of particular interest are junction-like inter- and intra-membrane differentiations found on the villus-like cytoplasmic projections present at the apical tip of the goblet cell cavities. These cytoplasmic projections appear to act as a valve; in some cases they seem to close off the top of the goblet <b>cell</b> <b>cavity,</b> so isolating it from the gut lumen, while in other cases they are spread apart leaving a wide channel from the cavity into the lumen. The junction-like structures on these cytoplasmic projections are different in structure from the septate-type junctions which seal the midgut cells together at their apical borders, and the 2 types are present on the same plasma membrane, often within one micron of each other. The need for a different type of junction may possibly be related to the fact that it occurs between 2 areas of the same plasma membrane. The morph-ology of this unusual junction-like structure is discussed and 2 diagrams are presented to illustrate our interpretation of its structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this technical note is to document {{the details of the}} infrastructure development process that was realized at the A 0 photo injector facility to establish RF cold testing capability for 1. 3 GHz superconducting niobium single <b>cell</b> <b>cavities.</b> The activity began the last quarter of CY 2006 and ended the first quarter of CY 2009. The whole process involved addressing various aspects such as design of vertical insert and lifting fixture, modification of existing RF test station and design of new couplers, development of a Temperature Mapping (T-Map) system, radiation considerations for the test location (north cave), update of existing High Pressure Rinse (HPR) system, preparation of necessary safety documents and eventually obtaining an Operational Readiness Clearance (ORC). Figure 1 illustrates the various components of the development process. In the past, the north cave test station at A 0 has supported the cold testing 3. 9 GHz nine cell and single <b>cell</b> <b>cavities,</b> thus some of the components were available for use and some needed modification. The test dewar had the capacity to accommodate 1. 3 GHz single cells although a new vertical insert that could handle both cavity types (1. 3 and 3. 9 GHz) had to be designed. The existing cryogenic system with an average capacity of {approx} 0. 5 g/sec was deemed sufficient. The RF system was updated with broadband components and an additional amplifier with higher power capacity to handle higher gradients usually achieved in 1. 3 GHz cavities. The initial testing phase was arbitrated to proceed with fixed power coupling. A new temperature mapping system was developed to provide the diagnostic tool for hot spot studies, quench characterization and field emission studies. The defining feature of this system was the use of diode sensors instead of the traditional carbon resistors as sensing elements. The unidirectional current carrying capacity (forward bias) of the diodes provided for the ease of multiplexing of the system, thus substantially reducing the number of cables required to power the sensors. The high gradient capacity of the 1. 3 GHz cavities required a revision of the radiation shielding and interlocks. The cave was updated as per the recommendations of the radiation safety committee. The high pressure rinse system was updated with new adapters to assist the rinsing 1. 3 GHz single <b>cell</b> <b>cavities.</b> Finally, a proposal for cold testing 1. 3 GHz single <b>cell</b> <b>cavities</b> at A 0 north cave was made to the small experiments approval committee, radiation safety committee and the Tevatron cryogenic safety sub-committee for an operational readiness clearance and the same was approved. The project was classified under research and development of single <b>cell</b> <b>cavities</b> (project 18) and was allocated a budget of $ 200, 000 in FY 2007...|$|R
