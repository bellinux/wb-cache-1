5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E

25|$|Wells's stories, on {{the other}} hand, use science fiction devices to make didactic points about his society. In The Time Machine (1895), for example, the {{technical}} details of the machine are glossed over quickly so that the Time Traveller <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story that criticizes the stratification of English society. The story also uses Darwinian evolution (as would be expected in {{a former student of}} Darwin's champion, Huxley), and shows an awareness of Marxism. In The War of the Worlds (1898), the Martians' technology is not explained as it would have been in a Verne story, and the story is resolved by a deus ex machina, albeit a scientifically explained one.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most basic method of holding the work is a planing stop or dog ear, which is simply a peg or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} bench top. The work is placed on the bench with the end pushed against the stop. The force of the planing keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. Planing against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - he <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> lot about what is going on just by the pressure, force and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a planing stop.|$|E

[...] Jeff Benjamin of Billboard called Roberts' effort the most [...] "intriguing" [...] {{out of all the}} Girls Aloud solo efforts. He said that Roberts had potential for success in the United States, comparing the song to the work of such artists as M.I.A., Robyn and Kelis. He asked readers to imagine that [...] "a young M.I.A. – mixed with Robyn and band Yelle – went on a shopping spree to Urban Outfitters, started chanting [...] "L! O! V! E!"

500|$|Mehra {{approached}} Angad Paul {{after having}} been impressed with his production work on British films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Paul, who was keen to work in India, liked Mehra's story and agreed to produce the film, bringing with him David Reid and Adam Bohling as executive producers. Despite having no prior knowledge of Hindi cinema, Reid and Bohling's belief in the script was strong enough that they each were willing to work at half their normal rate. While it was originally suggested that language versions of the film would be made concurrently, in English (as Paint it Yellow) and Hindi, the plans for an English version were dropped during development. Mehra believed that English-language version felt alien and that [...] "one <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> film in just one language". After the English version was dropped, the writer Kamlesh Pandey was brought on board to pen {{the first draft of}} Rang De Basanti in Hindi, marking the start of his screenwriting career. Thereafter Mehra and co-writer Rensil D'Silva took over the script, working on it for about two years. Prasoon Joshi, the film's lyricist, worked on the dialogue, marking his foray into screenwriting.|$|E

The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> person that you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter.

He then creates a costume out of rotten fish like Aquaman, but it does not go so well due to the awful smell from the costume.

2500|$|Carla Day {{writing for}} Collider.com gave The Flash episode 5 stars out of 5, calling the episode [...] "brilliant" [...] saying, [...] "With so many {{characters}} on the scene, {{it would have}} been easy for the show to get overwhelmed by them all and lose The Flash's unique look and tone. But the writers effectively incorporated the other DC series' characters into the episode while keeping the show's light-hearted and funny demeanor... the standard has been set high for the Arrow and Legends of Tomorrows [...] "Invasion!" [...] hours." [...] Day's one complaint was the fact the Dominators motivations were not very clear. Entertainment Weeklys Chancellor Agard awarded The Flash episode an [...] "A-", stating, [...] "Based on tonight's episode alone, this year's crossover is looking like it'll be the best one yet. The first crossovers were two relatively standalone episodes, and last year's was burdened with setting up Legends of Tomorrow. This is really the first time Berlanti and Co. <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> cohesive story, and it seems like it's paying off... That being said, the episode did drag a bit whenever it focused too much on the ongoing Team Flash drama... my biggest problems were with the Wally stuff. However, I understand that was here for viewers who might only watch The Flash, and the episode does a good job of appeasing both kinds of fans. Luckily, though, the nonsense doesn't drag the episode too much: For every anxious scene, there was a funny aside to lighten the mood." ...|$|E

[...] Di Renjie was known for being studious in his youth, and after passing the imperial examination served as a secretary at the prefectural government of Bian Prefecture (汴州, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan). [...] While serving there, he was falsely accused of improprieties by colleagues, and when the minister of public works, Yan Liben, was touring the Henan Circuit (河南道, the region immediately south of the Yellow River), which Bian Prefecture belonged to, he was asked to judge the case.

[...] Malone said that the character (Marty) having amnesia [...] "literally erases the real moral consequences and the real spiritual journey Marty has embarked on. It’s like telling Othello he’s White and Desdemona doesn’t really die. Presumably, Marty will gain her memory, and what will happen? She will be horrified". Malone agreed that Todd had now [...] "raped Marty in the worst possible way" [...] but that this type of story [...] coming out of nowhere". [...] "In this genre, General Hospitals Luke and Laura have a long history. This kind of story is profoundly founded on hope, forgiveness and redemption," [...] he said. [...] "That’s why it goes to its most radical narrative position. That someone can forgive this ultimate crime is redemptive both for the person forgiven, and the forgiver." [...] Malone said he had faith in Carlivati's storytelling but that the story would have been different and possibly not romantic if he himself had been writing it. [...] "Anyone <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story, {{and one of the reasons}} people mock soaps is because you can only read plot," [...] he said.
