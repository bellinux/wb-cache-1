This paper proposes six Key Solutions to overcome this challenge. We urge financing institutions, governments and service providers worldwide to put these Key Solutions into practice: 1) Use life-cycle costing approaches to ensure that all life-cycle costs of infrastructure and services are fully taken into account. 2) Maximise local small-scale private-sector involvement in water and sanitation service provision. 3) Introduce innovative water tariff systems that are ensure both financial sustainability and affordability for the poorest of the poor. 4) Use water revenues to cross-subsidise sanitation: including sanitation charges in water bills is a key approach for financing sanitation services. 5) Use output-based financing approaches: by making disbursement dependent on demonstrated delivery of infrastructure or services, international funders can ensure that funds are spent more efficiently. 6) Use progress-linked finance (PLF) approaches: under PLF, a financing institution commits to providing <b>concessional</b> <b>finance</b> at a specified time in the future, on condition that the service provider has by that time demonstrated capacity for commercially viable service delivery to low-income areas. Thus PLF uses the incentive of future disbursement to encourage local service providers to adopt policies and business models that are genuinely sustainable and pro-poor.

In {{the case of the}} NWSC, concessional debt contracted from international financial institutions had been passed on by the government to the utility in the form of debt. In February 2008, however, the government agreed to convert the NWSC's USH:153.5 billion debt into equity. This was done to increase the NWSC's ability to borrow from the local capital market. A week later, the NWSC announced that it intended to borrow USH:30 billion more on the bond market to finance mitigation of the impact of Lake Victoria's receding levels on water supply. The NWSC expected to be able to borrow in local currency at lower interest rates and for longer maturities compared to borrowing from commercial banks.

50|$|Developing {{countries}} {{grew increasingly}} frustrated with {{not being able}} to afford IBRD lending and perceived the Marshall Plan as a comparatively generous gift to European nations. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing countries began calling for the United Nations (UN) to create a development agency that would offer technical support and <b>concessional</b> <b>financing,</b> with a particular desire that the agency adhere to other UN bodies' convention of each country having one vote as opposed to a weighted vote. However, the United States ultimately opposed proposals of that nature. As the United States grew more concerned over the growth of the Cold War, it made a concession in 1954 at the behest of its Department of State by backing the conception of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Despite the launch of the IFC in 1956, developing countries persisted in demanding {{the creation of a new}} <b>concessional</b> <b>financing</b> mechanism and the idea gained traction within the IBRD. Then-President of the IBRD Eugene R. Black, Sr. began circulating the notion of an International Development Association, as opposed to an idea of a concessional named the Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED) governed by the United Nations. Paul Hoffman, the Marshall Plan's former Administrator, proposed the idea of a soft-loan facility within the World Bank, where the US would have a preponderant voice in the allocation of such loans.Democratic Senator Mike Monroney of Oklahoma supported this idea. As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on International Finance, Monroney proposed a resolution recommending a study of the potential establishment of an International Development Association to be affiliated with the IBRD. Monroney's proposal was more preferred received within the United States than the SUNFED. The resolution passed the senate in 1958, and then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert B. Anderson encouraged other countries to conduct similar studies. In 1959, the World Bank's Board of Governors approved a U.S.-born resolution calling for the drafting of the articles of agreement. SUNFED later became the Special Fund and merged with the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance to form the United Nations Development Programme.|$|R

Both the accounting approach and the present value constraint (PVC) approach are considered. Typically, sustainability analyses for developing countries involve issues that are not particularly important in the industrial country context. Reliance on seigniorage to finance deficits is often quantitatively much more important, although its use varies widely across LDCs. The distinction between domestic and foreign-currency borrowing is central; concessional lending and grants may also make an important contribution to fiscal finance. We consider generalizations of the PVC approach to situations where money-financing of deficits is used and <b>concessional</b> <b>financing</b> is available. The simultaneous presence of domestic and foreign debt, which characterizes a growing number of LDCs, are also discussed.

40|$|Large-scale {{acquisition}} of land by foreign investors” is the correct term for a process where the verdict of guilt is often quicker than the examination. But is there something really new about land grab except in its extent? In comparison with colonial and post-colonial plantation operations, should foreign investors today behave differently? We generally accept coffee and banana exports as pro-growth and pro-development, just as for cars, beef and insurance. What then is wrong with an investment contract allowing the holder to buy a farm and to export wheat to Saudi Arabia, or soybeans and maize as cattle feed to Korea, or to plant and process sugar cane and palm oil into ethanol for Europe and China? Assuming their land acquisition was legal, should foreigners respect more than investment contracts and national legislation? And why would they {{not take advantage of}} the legal protection offered by international investment law and treaties, not to speak of <b>concessional</b> <b>finance,</b> infrastructure and technical cooperation by a development bank, or the tax holidays offered by the host state? Remember Milton Friedman’s often-quoted quip: “The business of business is business!” And why would the governments signing those contracts not know whether and which foreign investment projects are best for their country, and how to attract them? This chapter tries to show that land grab, where it occurs, is not only yet another symptom of regulatory failures at the national level and a lack of corporate social responsibility by certain private actors. National governance is clearly the most important factor. Nonetheless, I submit that there is an international dimension involving investor home states in various capacities. The implication is that land grab is not solely a question whether a particular investment contract is legal or not. This chapter deals with legal issues which seem to have largely escaped the attention of both human rights lawyers and, especially, of investment lawyers. I address this fragmentation between different legal disciplines, rules, and policies, by asking two basic questions: (i) Do governments and parliaments in investor home countries have any responsibility in respect of the behaviour of their investors abroad? (ii) What should they and international regulators do, if anything...|$|E

The Fund’s debt limits policy has been in place since the 1960 s. From the policy’s inception, concessional flows have been excluded from debt limits under the presumption that such financing was critical for LICs and posed only limited risks to debt sustainability. Over time, the exclusion of concessional flows has led to a bifurcation in the policy, with one branch focusing on members to whom <b>concessional</b> <b>financing</b> is normally available, and the other on those to whom it is not—a distinction which in practical terms has involved differentiating between LICs and non-LICs.

In addition to withdrawing this aid, Saudi Arabia expelled almost 1 million Yemeni workers. The resultant fall in expatriate remittances had a disastrous impact on Yemen's governmental budget. The civil war of 1994 further drained the economy, and in 1995 Yemen sought the aid of multilateral agencies. In 1996 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) granted Yemen a US$190 million stand-by credit facility, and the following year it approved two funding facilities that increased the country's credit by approximately US$500 million. The funding was contingent on Yemen's adoption of stringent economic reforms, a requirement that the country had limited success in fulfilling. As a result, the IMF suspended lending to Yemen from late 1999 until February 2001. The extension of the two funding facilities, particularly the poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF), through October 2001 was again contingent on Yemen's commitment to economic reform.

A set of theoretical models predict that countries with unchanged long-run savings preferences will respond to debt relief {{with a mixture of}} asset decumulation and new borrowing.
