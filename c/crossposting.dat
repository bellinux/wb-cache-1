5|$|The {{battalion}} {{was part}} of 1st Parachute Brigade, which by mid-1942 had been expanded into 1st Airborne Division {{under the command of}} Major-General F.A.M. Browning. In July 1942 the 1st Parachute Battalion was selected to participate in the Dieppe Raid, and got as far as being loaded onto transport aircraft before poor weather cancelled the operation; when the raid was planned for a second time the parachute battalion was removed because their deployment was too dependent on there being good weather {{on the day of the}} raid. In midSeptember, as 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that an American airborne unit, the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, was to be used during the invasion, Browning successfully advocated for the 1st Parachute Brigade to also be included. He argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations. The War Office and CommanderinChief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach the brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion. After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by <b>crossposting</b> personnel from the newlyformed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November 1942.|$|E
5|$|Browning was {{shortly after}} {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} Major General, and he then supervised the newlyformed division as it underwent a prolonged of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades being raised and then assigned to the division and even more new equipment being tested. By midApril 1942 the division was able to conduct a smallscale airborne exercise {{for the benefit of the}} Prime Minister, in which twentyone transport aircraft and nine gliders participated, and by late December the division had been brought up to full strength. In midSeptember, as the division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that the 2nd Battalion of the American 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment was to take part in the campaign, he argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations. The War Office and CommanderinChief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach 1st Parachute Brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion. The Air Ministry was unable to provide transport aircraft or aircrews to operate with the brigade, so the United States Army Air Forces took over this responsibility, providing 60 Group of 51 Wing which flew Douglas C-47 Dakotas. A practice drop was conducted with a unit from the brigade on 9 October, although a lack of American familiarity with British airborne equipment and parachuting technique, as well a lack of British familiarity with the Dakota, led to three men being killed; this meant a delay in training whilst new techniques were developed, which in turn resulted in the majority of the brigade's personnel travelling to North Africa without having conducted a training drop from a Dakota. After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by <b>crossposting</b> personnel from the newlyformed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November.|$|E
25|$|One common {{faux pas}} on Internet forums is to post {{the same message}} twice. Users {{sometimes}} post versions of a message that are only slightly different, especially in forums where {{they are not allowed}} to edit their earlier posts. Multiple posting instead of editing prior posts can artificially inflate a user's post count. Multiple posting can be unintentional; a user's browser might display an error message even though the post has been transmitted or a user of a slow forum might become impatient and repeatedly hit the submit button. An offline editor may post the same message twice. Multiple posting can also be used as a method of trolling or spreading forum spam. A user may also send the same post to several forums, which is termed <b>crossposting.</b> The term derives from Usenet, where <b>crossposting</b> was an accepted practice but causes problems in web forums, which lack the ability to link such posts so replies in one forum are not visible to people reading the post in other forums.|$|E

5000|$|Replies to <b>crossposted</b> {{messages}} will be, by default, also <b>crossposted,</b> and so conversations {{can occur}} between {{readers of the}} multiple newsgroups without any confusion, so long as nobody [...] "breaks the thread" [...] by changing the groups they post their reply to. This enables readers {{of one of the}} newsgroups in the <b>crosspost</b> to provide corrections, etc. to information posted by somebody in a different newsgroup. By adding a [...] "" [...] line a poster can indicate that answers to his post should be posted to another set of newsgroups than those listed by the [...] "" [...] line.|$|R
50|$|In practice, most servers supply {{only one}} {{optional}} field, {{the contents of}} the Xref: header, to allow <b>crosspost</b> management.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crossposting</b> is {{the act of}} posting {{the same}} message to {{multiple}} newsgroups ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Crossposting</b> {{to groups}} that are {{irrelevant}} to the message posted could be considered spamming. Moreover, excessive <b>crossposting</b> is generally considered bad form because it multiplies traffic without adding any new content. In the extreme case, if all messages were crossposted to every email list or forum, then every email list or group would look exactly the same. A crossposter can minimize this problem by specifying that all responses be directed to a single group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crossposting</b> to {{more than}} a small number of newsgroups is likely to be counterproductive. A {{commonly}} suggested limit is three newsgroups.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>crossposted</b> message {{takes up}} less server storage space, and creates less network traffic, than if {{individual}} messages had been posted to multiple newsgroups.|$|R

5000|$|Over time, the {{accumulated}} FAQs across all USENET news groups sparked {{the creation of}} the [...] "*.answers" [...] moderated newsgroups such as comp.answers, misc.answers and sci.answers for <b>crossposting</b> and collecting FAQ across respective comp.*, misc.*, sci.* newsgroups.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crossposting</b> {{is usually}} practiced when {{material}} is relevant and {{of interest to}} the readers of more than one newsgroup. However sometimes it is used maliciously to begin a thread between newsgroups whose readers are likely to have violently differing opinions, in the hope of provoking a conflict. This is a form of trolling.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} an effort to {{differentiate}} between types of newsgroup spam. Messages that were <b>crossposted</b> to too many newsgroups at once – {{as opposed to those}} that were posted too frequently – were called velveeta (after a cheese product). But this term didn't persist.|$|R
50|$|A more {{aggressive}} criterion, Breidbart Index Version 2, has been proposed. The BI2 {{is defined as}} the sum of the square root of n, plus the sum of n, divided by two. A single message would only need to be <b>crossposted</b> to 35 newsgroups to breach the threshold of 20.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Crossposting</b> is {{the act of}} posting {{the same}} message to {{multiple}} information channels; forums, mailing lists, or newsgroups. This is distinct from multiposting, which is the posting of separate identical messages, individually, to each channel, (a forum, a newsgroup, an email list, or topic area). Enforcement actions against <b>crossposting</b> individuals vary from simple admonishments up to total lifetime bans. In some cases, on email lists and forums, an individual is put under a Stealth Ban where their posts are distributed back to {{them as if they}} were being distributed normally, but the rest of the subscribers are not sent the messages. This is easily detected if the Stealthed individual has two different, and totally non-associated identities in the channel, such that the non-stealthed identity will see a different set of messages, lacking the posts of the stealthed individual, in their view of the channel.|$|E

Subsequently, after discussion on the newsgroup, the group was voted to be moderated in 1997 by the normal USENET RFD/CFV process, in which only spam and excessive <b>crossposting</b> are censored. The moderator for the newsgroup is David Iain Greig (and technically Jim Lippard as alternate/backup).|$|E

5000|$|Usenet II had {{strictly}} enforced rules. Readers {{of messages}} in Usenet II must be fully compliant with the RFC 1036 (Usenet) standard plus some additional format compliance rules specific to Usenet II. A message header must contain a valid email {{address in the}} From field. It must have an NNTP-Posting-Host header field containing a sound site. The distribution field must be set to [...] "4gh" [...] (a reference to Shockwave Rider by John Brunner). If the Subject field starts [...] "Re:", indicating a follow-up, {{there must be a}} valid [...] "References" [...] field containing the Message-ID of a previous message. <b>Crossposts</b> to groups outside the net.* hierarchy are cancelled automatically.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} use the {{community}} structure of Usenet for organizing and retrieving the information stored in newsgroups. In particular, we study the network formed by <b>crossposts,</b> messages that are posted to two or more newsgroups simultaneously. We present what is, to our knowledge, {{by far the most}} detailed data that has been collected on Usenet cross-postings. We analyze this network to show that it is a small-world network with significant clustering. We also present a spectral algorithm which clusters newsgroups based on the cross-post matrix. The result of our clustering provides a topical classification of newsgroups. Our clustering gives many examples of significant relationships that would be missed by semantic clustering methods...|$|R
50|$|Every {{host of a}} {{news server}} {{maintains}} agreements with other nearby news servers to synchronize regularly. In this way news servers form a redundant network. When a user posts to one news server, the post is stored locally. That server then shares posts with the servers that are connected to it for those newsgroups they both carry. Those servers do likewise, propagating the posts through the network. For newsgroups that are not widely carried, sometimes a carrier group is used for <b>crossposting</b> to aid distribution. This is typically only useful for groups that have been removed or newer alt.* groups. Crossposts between hierarchies, outside of the Big 8 and alt.* hierarchies, are prone to failure.|$|E

5000|$|MI5Victim (Mike Corley, a.k.a. Boleslaw Tadeusz Szocik) - {{paranoid}} user {{who goes}} through periods of binge posting, claiming that British intelligence has bugged {{his home and}} is sending people to follow him around and harass him. These allegations are often <b>crossposted</b> to newsgroups where his messages would be considered off-topic. This has led to claims that he suffers from paranoia. Since 1995 he has posted transcripts and snippets of conversations that he has recorded, citing it as evidence, sometimes years after the actual event. He has also claimed in his posts that television personalities are often talking about him in code and {{are part of the}} MI5 conspiracy. After applying the cui bono test, many people have found it difficult to understand why Corley should have been targeted by MI5 (given that he has no connections/affiliations which would make him of interest), and cannot see what possible benefit the security services could derive from such harassment, given that they have always had more pressing concerns, e.g. monitoring PIRA in the 1990s and later the threat posed by al-Qaeda. Corley will often cross-post [...] "examples" [...] of MI-5 victimizing him 20 or 30 posts at a time. He has been banned from posting through Google for his abuse of Usenet, and has been similarly bounced from most ISPs in England, an assertion which Corley rebutted in August 2012. In the past, his posts were relatively easy to filter out, due to his similar subject lines and email address. However, at the start of 2008, he began a series of posts that avoided filters through sporgery and by slightly varying his subject line of [...] "MI-5 Persecution", showing an ability to adapt. In 2007, the opera The Corley Conspiracy by Tim Benjamin and Sean Starke premiered at the Southbank Centre in London. Corley has his own web site on which he provides so-called evidence of the conspiracies against him. Corley has written a book about his [...] "experiences" [...] with MI5.|$|R
