25|$|The {{anthocyanins}}, anthocyanidins {{with sugar}} group(s), are mostly 3-glucosides of the anthocyanidins. The anthocyanins are subdivided into the sugar-free anthocyanidin aglycones and the anthocyanin glycosides. As of 2003, more than 400 anthocyanins had been reported, while later literature in early 2006, puts the number {{at more than}} 550 different anthocyanins. The difference in chemical structure that occurs in response to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH,</b> {{is the reason why}} anthocyanins often are used as pH indicators, as they change from red in acids to blue in bases.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{key factors}} {{associated}} with the toxicity of CYN is its stability. Although the toxin {{has been found to}} degrade rapidly in an algal extract when exposed to sunlight, it is resistant to degradation by <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> and temperature, and shows no degradation in either the pure solid form or in pure water. As a result, in turbid and unmoving water the toxin can persist for long periods, and although boiling water will kill the cyanobacteria, it may not remove the toxin.|$|E

25|$|This almost-correct {{molecule}} {{possesses a}} tricyclic guanidine group (rings A, B & C), {{along with a}} uracil ring (D). The zwitterionic nature of the molecule makes this highly water-soluble, {{as the presence of}} charged areas within the molecule creates a dipole effect, suiting the polar solvent. Sensitivity of key signals in the NMR spectrum to small <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> suggested that the uracil ring exists in a keto/enol tautomeric relationship, where a hydrogen transfer results in two distinct structures (Figure 2). It was originally proposed that a hydrogen bond between the uracil and guanidine groups in the enol tautomer would make this the dominant form.|$|E
25|$|Acidosis is a {{condition}} in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient’s blood expresses a low pH value. Alkalosis is {{a condition}} in which there are too few hydrogen ions, and the patient’s blood has an elevated pH. Normal blood pH falls in the range of 7.35–7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number represents alkalosis. Enzymes, being the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions - are sensitive to pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, subsequently decreasing the rate of many enzymatic reactions, which can have complex effects on HR. Severe <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.|$|E

50|$|Polymers {{can also}} form {{micelles}} (spheres) {{in response to}} a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH.</b> This behavior can occur with linear block copolymers. If the different blocks of the copolymer have different properties, they can form micelles with one type of block on the inside and one type on the outside. For example, in water the hydrophobic blocks of a copolymer could end up on the inside of a micelle, with hydrophilic blocks on the outside. Additionally, a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> could cause micelles to swap their inner and outer molecules depending on the properties of the polymers involved.Responses other than simply swelling and deswelling with a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> are possible as well.
