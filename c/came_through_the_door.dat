2500|$|Two {{versions}} {{describe how}} Leduc got its name. According to popular local legend, {{it was decided}} in 1890 when a settler (McKinlay) setting up a telegraph office needed {{a name for the}} new settlement and decided that it would be named after the first person who <b>came</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the telegraph office. That person was Father Hippolyte Leduc, a priest who had served the area since 1867. In another, more official, version, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, Edgar Dewdney (1835–1916), [...] decided that Telford Place should be renamed at the time the railroad terminal was established in 1891, and picked the name of the missionary priest.|$|E
2500|$|Andy Pryor, {{the casting}} director, {{suggested}} Gillan to Moffat after her {{performance in the}} fourth series episode [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", in which she played a soothsayer, but Moffat originally thought Gillan was [...] "short and dumpy". Later, however, he stated that she was [...] "exactly right for the role", though she portrayed the character differently from how Moffat originally wrote. Gillan was reportedly the last to audition for the role, and stood out as she was [...] "a bit kookier" [...] than the others. Moffat said of the casting, [...] "We saw some amazing actresses for this part. But when Karen <b>came</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> the game was up— she was funny, clever, gorgeous and sexy. Or Scottish, which is the quick way of saying it. A generation of little girls will want to be her. And a generation of little boys will {{want them to be}} her too." [...] Doctor Who executive producer and drama chief at BBC Wales Piers Wenger concurred, [...] "We knew Karen was perfect for the role the moment we saw her. She brought an energy and excitement to the part that was just fantastic." [...] Gillan was aware of the show but was not as big a fan of it as her mother was, due to it not being on when she was growing up. However, she watched some with her mother after it returned in 2005, and was also a fan of other science fiction such as The X-Files, The Outer Limits, [...] and [...]|$|E

He was smoking a cigar and he was holding an {{umbrella}} to protect his white flannel suit. He was as usual wonderfully groomed and turned out, but he walked as though he were tired, and his smile, as he greeted Francis, lacked a little of its usual light-hearted mockery.|$|E

They sat down on a bench outside and a beam of light and the dull voices of the others <b>came</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Marston did not hear the woman; she had not spoken at all, but sat {{motionless}} and huddled. He had not seen her face and never knew what she was like. All was quiet in the village, and outside the feeble beam the gloom was strangely deep. Marston sympathized with Don Felix's liking for plenty of light.|$|E

This session is about an experiment at OIT, hosted from off site to teach instructors off and onsite about using the library and modern information manipulation. In the Summer of 2009 the OIT librarians created a digital brown bag series for faculty about topics that would help them in the classroom and the library. Each librarian will take a turn teaching a synchronous session in person and online with an online version archived for people unable to make the session. Topics include creative commons in the classroom, getting books the library does not own, research through open source resources and more...|$|R

I looked over my shoulder as I passed the doorway, and saw to my surprise that he was exhibiting the docility of the birds in his most engagingly polite manner to the housekeeper. He must have specially invited her to see them--for she would never have thought of going into the library of her own accord. The man's slightest actions had a purpose of some kind at the bottom of every one of them. What could be his purpose here? ...|$|E

Poetess as she was, or as she thought herself, she had not been too sublime that day to dress with infinite trouble in a fashionable robe of rich material, having a faint resemblance to the chiton of the Greeks, a style just then in vogue among ladies of an artistic and romantic turn, which had been obtained by Ella of her Bond Street dressmaker when she was last in London.

From inside he could hear a turmoil of voices. White with rage and passion, he pushed and kicked madly. There was the sound of a shot from inside, a bullet <b>came</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> within an inch of his head, then the crash of broken crockery and a man's groan. With a final effort Quest dashed the door in and {{staggered}} into the room. Lenora was standing in the far corner, the front of her dress torn and blood upon her lip. She held a revolver in her hand and was covering a man whose head and hands were bleeding. Around him were the debris of a broken jug.|$|E

60|$|He had not {{calculated}} on {{a further}} descent, but {{the floor of}} the cave was five feet below him, and he fell heavily upon it, the gun going off as it struck the floor. Instantaneous as the fall had been, his eyes had taken in the scene. Several lanterns faintly lit up the cave; while in the centre a table, at which several figures were sitting, was illuminated by three or four candles. He was partly stunned by the heaviness of his fall, but vaguely heard shouts of surprise and alarm, and was, a minute later, roughly seized and dragged along. Then he felt that he was being tightly bound. For some minutes he was left to himself, but he could see three men with guns in their hands standing near the door by which he had entered, listening attentively. Presently he heard steps coming down the passage and two other men <b>came</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> shut and bolted it carefully, and then came down the steps into the cabin.|$|E
6000|$|The room in {{the hotel}} where the general {{meetings}} of [...] "The Island Navigation Company" [...] were held was nearly full when the secretary <b>came</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which as yet divided the shareholders from their directors. Having surveyed their empty chairs, their ink and papers, and nodded to a shareholder or two, he stood, watch in hand, contemplating the congregation. A thicker attendance {{than he had ever}} seen! Due, no doubt, to the lower dividend, and this Pillin business. And his tongue curled. For if he had a natural contempt for his Board, {{with the exception of the}} chairman, he had a still more natural contempt for his shareholders. Amusing spectacle when you came to think of it, a general meeting! Unique! Eighty or a hundred men, and five women, assembled through sheer devotion to their money. Was any other function in the world so single-hearted. Church was nothing to it--so many motives were mingled there with devotion to one's soul. A well-educated young man--reader of Anatole France, and other writers--he enjoyed ironic speculation. What earthly good did they think they got by coming here? Half-past two! He put his watch back into his pocket, and passed into the Board-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{they were}} talking {{together}} {{as if they had}} accidentally met in the street. I remained at the window looking at them from behind the curtain. If I had turned round, and if Laura had seen my face at that moment----Thank God, she was absorbed over her drawing! They soon parted. The man from the Asylum went one way, and the Count the other. I began to hope they were in the street by chance, till I saw the Count come back, stop opposite to us again, take out his card-case and pencil, write something, and then cross the road to the shop below us. I ran past Laura before she could see me, and said I had forgotten something upstairs. As soon as I was out of the room I went down to the first landing and waited--I was determined to stop him if he tried to come upstairs. He made no such attempt. The girl from the shop <b>came</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> into the passage, with his card in her hand--a large gilt card with his name, and a coronet above it, and these lines underneath in pencil: 'Dear lady' (yes! the villain could address me in that way still)--'dear lady, one word, I implore you, on a matter serious to us both.' If one can think at all, in serious difficulties, one thinks quick. I felt directly that it might be a fatal mistake to leave myself and to leave you in the dark, where such a man as the Count was concerned. I felt that the doubt of what he might do, in your absence, would be ten times more trying to me if I declined to see him than if I consented. 'Ask the gentleman to wait in the shop,' I said. 'I will be with him in a moment.' I ran upstairs for my bonnet, being determined not to let him speak to me indoors. I knew his deep ringing voice, and I was afraid Laura might hear it, even in the shop. In less than a minute I was down again in the passage, and had opened the door into the street. He came round to meet me from the shop. There he was in deep mourning, with his smooth bow and his deadly smile, and some idle boys and women near him, staring at his great size, his fine black clothes, and his large cane with the gold knob to it. All the horrible time at Blackwater came back to me the moment I set eyes on him. All the old loathing crept and crawled through me, when he took off his hat with a flourish and spoke to me, as if we had parted on the friendliest terms hardly a day since." ...|$|E
