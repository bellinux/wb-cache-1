5|$|Adrienne {{visits the}} nearly 110-year-old Malcolm Wyrmshadow (Douglas Seale), {{who had been}} Carno's {{apprentice}} as a young boy. Malcolm reveals that <b>Carno</b> met his demise after his last wife, Marie (Traci Clauson), discovered he was a murderer. Marie conspired with her lover, Gaston (Jeff Rector), to kill <b>Carno</b> by sabotaging the equipment for his most infamous and dangerous escapology trick, in which <b>Carno</b> dons a burning hood and escapes from bonds on a throne underneath a swinging axe. The sabotage leaves <b>Carno</b> horribly burned and disfigured, but he survives and viciously attacks Marie and Gaston. After killing Marie by beheading her, <b>Carno</b> is killed by Gaston, who then succumbs to his own wounds.|$|E
5|$|Four battles {{large enough}} to be {{recorded}} in Ireland were fought in 728 and 729. Alpín was defeated twice by Óengus, after which Nechtan was restored to power. In 729 a battle between supporters of Óengus and Nechtan's enemies was fought at Monith <b>Carno</b> (traditionally Cairn o' Mount, near Fettercairn) where the supporters of Óengus were victorious. Nechtan was restored to the kingship, probably until his death in 732. On 12 August 729 Óengus defeated and killed Drest in battle at Druimm Derg Blathuug, a place which has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm tells Adrienne about {{a ritual}} that can {{eradicate}} the demon. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides {{to leave with}} Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day, Adrienne is attacked by Don, who is now completely insane and dressed like <b>Carno.</b> Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom and then flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts him long enough to free herself and trigger the swinging axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, a huge and murderous monster that pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps the demon once again. The game ends with Adrienne {{walking out of the}} mansion with a vacant stare, almost catatonic.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to retrieve the orb of <b>Carnos,</b> located on the 40th level and guarded by a powerful boss monster called [...] "The Dark Wizard", who can be beaten relatively easily by standing in the staircase, reflecting all spell attacks. The 40th level also contains a second orb, made of plastic, which can only be identified using an [...] "identify scroll".|$|R
5|$|The {{comic relief}} roles of Harriet and Cyrus were played by V. Joy Lee and Steven W. Bailey, respectively. Lee had mostly done theater {{work in the}} Atlanta and Seattle areas, along with {{appearing}} in some industrial films and an episode of Northern Exposure. Bailey had been an actor in Seattle for about three years, doing mostly stage work, {{as well as some}} commercials, television episodes, independent films, and industrial films for the United States Navy. Malcolm was portrayed by veteran actor Douglas Seale. Stella Stevens played the antiques store owner Lou Ann, Geoff Pryser played Bob the realtor, and Carl Neimic played phone technician Mike. Traci Clauson portrayed Marie, <b>Carno's</b> fifth and final wife.|$|R
5|$|During her {{exploration}} of the grounds, Adrienne finds a secret chapel hidden behind a bricked off fireplace. After opening a locked box atop an altar, Adrienne unknowingly releases <b>Carno's</b> demon, which promptly possesses Don. Don starts acting menacingly and aggressively toward Adrienne and becomes progressively worse as time passes, culminating in a controversial scene in which he rapes Adrienne. Eventually, Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday (V. Joy Lee), a superstitious vagrant, and her strong but dim-witted son, Cyrus (Steven W. Bailey), who are secretly living in a barn on the estate. After Adrienne agrees to let them stay, they volunteer to help around the mansion. When a technician named Mike (Carl Neimic) visits the mansion to install the phone, Don screams at him in a jealous rage, warning him {{to stay away from}} his wife, much to Adrienne's horror. Later, unbeknownst to Adrienne, Don bludgeons Mike to death.|$|R
5|$|While {{the local}} townspeople believe all Carno's wives {{died of natural}} causes or accidentally, Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in {{grotesque}} ways. Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an alcoholic, is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has her mouth gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) is force-fed animal entrails through a funnel until she chokes to death. Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne, revealing {{in the form of a}} green ectoplasm the spirit of <b>Carno</b> before he had been possessed. He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released, and urges Adrienne to trap it once again.|$|E

25|$|Spitfire {{captured}} a French privateer brig Heureux Courier, of Granville on 19 June, ten leagues SSE of Scilly. The privateer was armed with sixteen brass French 6-pounders {{and had a}} crew of 54 men, others being away on the three captures she had made. She {{was on her way}} home from her first cruise. Her three captures were two Newfoundland brigs and a Portuguese schooner, Nostra Senora del <b>Carno,</b> De Casta Pinto, master. The privateer had cut out the schooner at St. Michael's (probably St Michael's Mount), where the schooner was loading. The British privateer Tartar, of Guernsey, recaptured the schooner.|$|E
500|$|Carnotaurus [...] is a genus {{of large}} {{theropod}} dinosaur {{that lived in}} South America during the Late Cretaceous period, between about 72 and 69.9 million years ago. The only species is Carnotaurus sastrei. Known from a single well-preserved skeleton, {{it is one of}} the best-understood theropods from the Southern Hemisphere. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in the Chubut Province of Argentina from rocks of the La Colonia Formation. Derived from the Latin <b>carno</b> [...] ("flesh") and taurus ("bull"), the name Carnotaurus means [...] "meat-eating bull", an allusion to the animal's bull-like horns. Carnotaurus is a derived member of the Abelisauridae, a group of large theropods that occupied the large predatorial niche in the southern Landmasses of Gondwana during the late Cretaceous. The phylogenetic relations of Carnotaurus are uncertain; it might have been closer to either Majungasaurus or Aucasaurus.|$|E
500|$|Successful mystery novelist Adrienne Delaney (Victoria Morsell) and her {{photographer}} husband Don Gordon (David Homb) {{have just}} purchased a remote mansion {{off the coast}} of a small New England island previously owned by a famous 19th-century magician, Zoltan [...] "Carno" [...] Carnovasch (Robert Miano), whose five wives all died mysteriously. Adrienne hopes to find an inspiration for her next novel in her new home, but starts having nightmares immediately upon moving in. She is comforted by the loving and supportive Don. Adrienne explores the estate, making mysterious discoveries like strange music, warnings written on her computer, and ominous messages from a fortune-teller automaton. Unbeknownst to the happy couple, <b>Carno</b> had practiced black magic when he previously lived in the mansion and had summoned an evil demon that possessed him and caused him to murder his wives.|$|E
500|$|The {{skeleton}} {{was collected}} {{on a farm}} named [...] "Pocho Sastre" [...] near Bajada Moreno in the Telsen Department of Chubut Province, Argentina. Because it was embedded in a large hematite concretion, a very hard kind of rock, preparation was complicated and progressed slowly. In 1985, Bonaparte published a note presenting Carnotaurus sastrei as a new genus and species and briefly describing the skull and lower jaw. The generic name (Latin <b>carno</b> [...] – [...] "flesh" [...] and taurus – [...] "bull") refers to the bull-like horns, while the specific name sastrei honors Angel Sastre, {{the owner of the}} ranch where the skeleton was found. A comprehensive description of the whole skeleton followed in 1990. After Abelisaurus, Carnotaurus was the second member of the family Abelisauridae that was discovered. For years, it was by far the best-understood member of its family, and also the best-understood theropod from the Southern Hemisphere. It was not until the 21st century that similar well-preserved abelisaurids were described, including Aucasaurus, Majungasaurus and Skorpiovenator, allowing scientists to re-evaluate certain aspects of the anatomy of Carnotaurus. The holotype skeleton is displayed in the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences, Bernardino Rivadavia; replicas can be seen in this and other museums around the world. Sculptors Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas manufactured a life-sized sculpture of Carnotaurus that is now on display in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This sculpture, ordered by the museum during the mid-1980s, is probably the first life restoration of a theropod showing accurate skin.|$|E

2500|$|In 728, Óengus son of Fergus {{defeated}} the shadowy Alpín. It {{seems likely that}} at this time, if not earlier, Nechtan had left the monastic life and was warring with Drest and Alpín. After Alpín was defeated a second time, the Annals of Tigernach say that Nechtan was restored to the kingship. A battle between Óengus's army and Nechtan's enemies at Monith <b>Carno</b> (perhaps Cairn O' Mounth, near Fettercairn) ended with the defeat of Nechtan's enemies, [...] among whom are named Biceot son of Moneit, Finguine son of Drostan and Feroth son of Finguine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1860, {{a parcel}} of land in this area—then just outside the city limits— was {{subdivided}} into 60 plots to create the exclusive colonia of Los Arquitectos.

Some of the first non-farm elements that were constructed here were “tivolis” or recreation gardens with restaurants and other services to cater to those who wished to spend time outside the city. [...] By the end of the 19th century, Mexico City was breaking out of its traditional boundaries westward over former haciendas and ranches. Country homes for the elite were being constructed, which eventually became permanent. To reach these homes and the tivoli gardens, mule-drawn trains were established along what is now Ribera de San Cosme. The first permanent city residents of the area were part of the upper classes that benefitted from the economic policies of Porfirio Díaz. They were soon followed by shopkeepers and laborers. as well as middle class developed from the rise of industry in Mexico.|$|E
