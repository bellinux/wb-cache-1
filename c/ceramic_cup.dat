2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{traditional}} low temperature and higher temperature firing techniques {{are used in the}} Guadalajara area, to produce ware from cheap objects to artistic productions. The two main pottery producing municipalities are Tonalá and Tlaquepaque. These two municipalities produce several different types of pottery and ceramics, principally [...] "bruñido", [...] "bandera", [...] "canelo", [...] "petate", [...] "betus" [...] and high-fire/stoneware. The best known of these styles is bruñido, which translates to burnished. It probably descends from polychrome produced in this area en the 19th century. The name {{comes from the fact that}} these pieces are not glazed, but rather they are given a slip and then polished with a stone or pyrite. Many of these pieces are slender necked jugs or lamp bases, often decorated with animals, such as rabbits, with distorted characteristics, giving them a surreal look. The pieces are usually painted with delicate tones of rose, gray-blue and white on a background of a light coffee color, light gray and sometimes green or blue. Each piece is individually created. The attraction of this pottery is its appearance, as it is too porous to hold any liquid or food. One exception to this are thick large tubs mainly to store water or for bathing. Water stored in this kind of vessel takes on a flavor from the pottery, which is desired by some people. Another exception is a water container with a fat body and long neck, with a <b>ceramic</b> <b>cup</b> placed upside down over the neck. These are called botellones, and are similar to carafes. One town that specializes in these is El Rosario, near Tonalá.|$|E

5000|$|Ethiopian or Eritrean {{coffee is}} a very {{important}} ceremonial drink. The [...] "coffee ceremony" [...] is common to the Tigray-Tigrigna and the Amhara.

This amount of coffee can be finished in one gulp if drunk cold; but, traditionally it is drunk very slowly as conversation takes place. When the beans are roasted to smoking, they are passed around the table, where the smoke becomes a blessing on the diners.

40|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} colonizing {{soil water}} sampling devices (lysimeters) reduced concentrations of biodegradable organic chemicals, including 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid methyl ester, alachlor, methyl m-chlorobenzoate, and metolachlor as water entered through porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>cups.</b> In some cases, losses exceeded 99 %. Additions of either a biocide (sodium hypochlorite) or a bacteriostat (copper salt) prevented microbial activity so that concentrations of test chemicals inside lysimeters equaled those outside. Field studies further indicated that treating lysimeters with a copper salt effectively prevented microbial activity.

5000|$|Milk tea is {{a popular}} part of many Hong Kongers' daily lives, {{typically}} served as part of afternoon tea, but also at breakfast or dinner. It enjoys nearly the same ubiquitous status that coffee holds in the West. Whilst not offered by more traditional Cantonese restaurants or dim sum teahouses, milk tea is standard fare in Hong Kong-style western restaurants and cha chaan teng, as well as Hong Kong's historic dai pai dong, with a price between HKD$12-16 (hot, one or two dollars more for cold).

5000|$|A {{tensiometer}} in {{soil science}} is a measuring instrument {{used to determine}} the matric water potential (...) (soil moisture tension) in the vadose zone. This device typically consists of a glass or plastic tube with a porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>cup,</b> and is filled with water. The top of the tube has either a built-in vacuum gauge or a rubber cap used with a portable puncture tensiometer instrument, which uses a hypodermic needle to measure the pressure inside the tensiometer. The tensiometer is buried in the soil, and a hand pump is used to pull a partial vacuum. As water is pulled out of the soil by plants and evaporation, the vacuum inside the tube increases. As water is added to the soil, the vacuum inside the tube pulls moisture from the soil and decreases. As the water in tensiometer is considered to be equilibrium with the soil water, the gauge reading of the tensiometer represents the matric potential of the soil.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{classification of}} dashpot timers are mercury-displacement timers. These {{depend on the}} displacement of a pool of mercury that make connection with two electrodes. There {{are two kinds of}} mercury displacement timers, delayed-make displacement timers and slow break displacement timers. Delayed-make displacement timers work by having a plunger floating in a container of mercury, when energy is applied to the coil it pulls the plunger into its center. The mercury that is displaced by this enters the thimble though an orifice. Inert gas trapped {{at the top of the}} thimble prevents the mercury from rising. Eventually the gas escapes through a ceramic plug, and this permits mercury to fill the thimble. When the mercury rises to a certain level it makes contact between electrodes. The amount of delay that this produces is determined when it is manufactured. Slow-break displacement timers work in the same way as delayed-make displacement timers only that when the coil is de-energized, the plunger rises to its original position, and mercury flows through the orifice to reach outside level. when it falls below the lip of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>cup,</b> electrical contacts become open. Its physical size is used to regulate the delay time of connection break. These timers are designed with a fixed delay period, usually to a maximum of 20 minutes.|$|E
