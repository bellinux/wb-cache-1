25|$|The {{system is}} powered by a {{lead-acid}} battery, which is charged by the car's electrical system using a dynamo or alternator. The engine operates <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points, which interrupt the current to an induction coil (known as the ignition coil).|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the spark}} voltage is also {{dependent}} on contact effectiveness, and poor sparking {{can lead to}} lower engine efficiency. A mechanical <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> system cannot control an average ignition current of more than about 3 A while still giving a reasonable service life, and this may limit {{the power of the}} spark and ultimate engine speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{ignition}} firing sequence {{begins with}} the points (or <b>contact</b> <b>breaker)</b> closed. A steady current flows from the battery, through the current-limiting resistor, through the primary coil, through the closed breaker points and finally back to the battery. This current produces a magnetic field within the coil's core. This magnetic field forms the energy reservoir {{that will be used}} to drive the ignition spark.|$|E

25|$|The flat twin {{cylinder}} 1948 Citroën 2CV used one double ended coil without a distributor, and just <b>contact</b> <b>breakers,</b> in a wasted spark system.|$|R
50|$|In older vehicles, {{a single}} coil would serve all the spark plugs via the {{ignition}} distributor. Notable exceptions are the Saab 92, some Volkswagens, and the Wartburg 353 which have one ignition coil per cylinder. The flat twin cylinder 1948 Citroën 2CV used one double ended coil without a distributor, and just <b>contact</b> <b>breakers,</b> in a wasted spark system.|$|R
25|$|A distributor-based {{system is}} not greatly {{different}} from a magneto system except that more separate elements are involved. There are also advantages to this arrangement. For example, {{the position of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points relative to the engine angle can be changed a small amount dynamically, allowing the ignition timing to be automatically advanced with increasing revolutions per minute (RPM) or increased manifold vacuum, giving better efficiency and performance.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{technology}} in the 1948 2CV was remarkable for the era. While colours and detail specifications were modified in the ensuing 42years, the biggest mechanical change was the addition of front disc brakes (by then already fitted for several years in the mechanically similar Citroën Dyane 6), in October 1981 (for the 1982 model year). The reliability of the car was enhanced by the minimalist simplification of the designers, being air-cooled (with an oil cooler), it had no coolant, radiator, water pump or thermostat. It had no distributor either, just a <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> system. Except for the brakes, there were no hydraulic parts on original models; damping was by tuned mass dampers and friction dampers.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the mechanical}} system {{is the use of}} breaker points to interrupt the low-voltage high-current through the primary winding of the coil; the points are subject to mechanical wear where they ride the cam to open and shut, as well as oxidation and burning at the contact surfaces from the constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and the opening of the <b>contact</b> <b>breakers,</b> which is responsible for spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|R

The Range includes the Rooster Booster Junior for small Flywheel Magneto fired engines and the RB1 which is a points assisted transistorised Electronic Ignition module for most other petrol engines.

25|$|When an {{inductive}} circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage {{across the open}} circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy may generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark {{may not be enough}} to damage the switch but may still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package.|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} form of {{spark ignition}} is that using a magneto. The engine spins a magnet inside a coil, or, {{in the earlier}} designs, a coil inside a fixed magnet, and also operates a <b>contact</b> <b>breaker,</b> interrupting the current and causing the voltage to be increased sufficiently to jump a small gap. The spark plugs are connected directly from the magneto output. Early magnetos had one coil, with the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> (sparking plug) inside the combustion chamber. In about 1902, Bosch introduced a double-coil magneto, with a fixed sparking plug, and the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> outside the cylinder. Magnetos are not used in modern cars, but because they generate their own electricity they are often found on small engines such as those found in mopeds, lawnmowers, snowblowers, chainsaws, etc. where a battery-based electrical system is not present for any combination of necessity, weight, cost, and reliability reasons. [...] They are also used on piston-engined aircraft engines. [...] Although an electrical supply is available, magneto systems are used mainly because of their higher reliability.|$|E
50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{and computer}} engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and {{are increasingly being}} incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from magneto in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact breaker (points), and these were increasingly superseded by Capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel magneto system with <b>contact</b> <b>breakers</b> to similar flywheel driven solid-state systems {{at about the same}} time.|$|R
2500|$|Traditional planetarium {{projection}} apparatus uses {{a hollow}} ball {{with a light}} inside, and a pinhole for each star, hence the name [...] "star ball". With some of the brightest stars (e.g. Sirius, Canopus, Vega), the hole must be so big to let enough light through {{that there must be}} a small lens in the hole to focus the light to a sharp point on the dome. In later and modern planetarium star balls, the individual bright stars often have individual projectors, shaped like small hand-held torches, with focusing lenses for individual bright stars. <b>Contact</b> <b>breakers</b> prevent the projectors from projecting below the 'horizon'.|$|R
2500|$|A single breaker {{driven by}} a cam and a return spring is limited in spark rate by the onset of contact bounce or float at high rpm.

2500|$|The KR200 ran on a [...] Fichtel & Sachs forced-air (fan) cooled single {{cylinder}} two-stroke engine positioned {{in front of}} the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine had two sets of <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> points and, to reverse, the engine was stopped and then restarted, going backwards. This was effected by pushing the key further in the ignition switch than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement.|$|E

When Stalker’s team was captured in Borovia by the local militia, Grunt <b>contacts</b> <b>Breaker</b> and gets the number for the current Joe headquarters. He talks to Roadblock and offers to go on the rescue operation, reasoning that being out of service will help with 'plausible deniability'. Roadblock tells Grunt there will be no rescue operation, 'official, covert or otherwise'. An 'otherwise' op later rescues the imprisoned officers.|$|R

25|$|Once a {{fault is}} detected, the circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>contacts</b> must open to {{interrupt}} the circuit; This is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the <b>contacts.</b> Circuit <b>breakers</b> may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a manual control lever to switch off the load or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use solenoids to trip the mechanism, and electric motors to restore energy to the springs.|$|R

50|$|The <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is {{operated}} by an engine-driven cam, {{and the position}} of the <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is set so that it opens (and hence generates a spark) at exactly the correct moment needed to ignite the fuel {{at the top of the}} piston's compression stroke. The <b>contact</b> <b>breaker</b> is usually mounted on a plate that is able to rotate relative to the camshaft operating it. The plate is rotated by a centrifugal mechanism, thus advancing the ignition timing (making the spark occur earlier) at higher revolutions. This gives the fuel time to burn so that the resulting gases reach their maximum pressure at the same time as the piston reaches the top of the cylinder. The plate's position can also be moved a small distance using a small manifold vacuum-operated servomechanism, providing advanced timing when the engine is required to speed up on demand. This helps to prevent pre-ignition (or pinging).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As {{is known}} that the vacuum circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>contact</b> {{materials}} of breaking capacity and welding performance {{are affected by the}} mechanical properties and fracture characteristics of contact material, but they haven't been paid attention now. The mechanical failure for circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>contact</b> wear is studied and the process characteristics are described for contact opening and closing. When the thermal stress analysis for the moving contact is finished, the displacement and stress cloud map can be gotten by the thermal deformation of moving contact. When the crash analysis for the static and moving contact is finished, the deformation of contact can be gotten. In this analysis, a reference will be provided for the same type of circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>contacts</b> designed in the future and some relevant measures can be taken to prolong the mechanical life of breakers...|$|R
5000|$|The UK Wireless World {{magazine}} of March 1970 published a detailed Capacitor-discharge Ignition system as an electronic hobby build project by R.M. Marston. The circuit {{of this system}} {{was similar to the}} Winterburn patent in that it used a push-pull converted switch mode oscillator for energy transfer to a store - discharge capacitor and conventional <b>contact</b> <b>breakers</b> to initiate a thyristor triggering discharge of the charged CD capacitor. It was stated to offer several advantages over conventional ignition. Among which: better combustion, easy starting even under subzero conditions, immunity to contactor (points) bounce and 2% - 5% fuel economy. Subsequent letters to Wireless World ( [...] March & May 1970), with Mr. Marston’s replies, further discussed aspects of the design and build. In July 1971 Mr. A.P. Harris, undergraduate of the City University London made a detailed electrical engineering analysis of the Marston design as well as automotive engine measurement trials to verify fuel economy. These confirmed the benefits of the CD ignition system. However, he found that the core ingredient of the CD design rested on careful hand winding of the switch mode transformer and appropriate selection of oscillator transistors and choice of oscillator frequency.|$|R

5000|$|A magnetic-hydraulic {{circuit breaker}} uses a solenoid coil to provide {{operating}} force {{to open the}} <b>contacts.</b> Magnetic-hydraulic <b>breakers</b> incorporate a hydraulic time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the current exceeds the breaker rating. During an overload, {{the speed of the}} solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current surges beyond normal running current for motor starting, energizing equipment, etc. Short circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to release the latch regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature. Ambient temperature affects the time delay but does not affect the current rating of a magnetic breaker.|$|R
40|$|Contact {{materials}} {{composed of}} Ag and W {{have been used}} in circuit breakers and other electrical switching systems for decades due to their excellent properties. A series of standard acceptance tests have been established by UL (Underwriters Laboratories) to ensure that circuit breakers meet certain criteria for performance and safety. These standard tests include: overload/temperature-rise, endurance and short-circuit conditions. In this dissertation, a study on the near-surface microstructures exhibited by untested commercial Ag/W circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>contacts,</b> and by those that have been subjected to the UL standard tests, is presented. The microstructural characteristics were investigated to deduce the degradation mechanisms during each type of test. A similar approach was also adopted to investigate the effects of natural aging and accelerated aging in dry and humid environments on the structure and degradation mechanisms for this type of contacts. Alloys composed of Ag 3 Sn and Cu 3 Sn intermetallic phases were proposed as candidate alloys for use in circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>contacts</b> to reduce the cost without compromising the breaker performance. Fundamental physical metallurgy studies were conducted to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the structure-property relationships for the candidate alloys. Results from solidification microstructures revealed the phase equilibria for Ag 3 Sn/Cu 3 Sn alloys. Studies on the defect structures in Ag 3 Sn/Cu 3 Sn alloys and in Ag 3 Sn single crystals showed that different deformation mechanisms operate in these iso-structural phases. The consequences of these observations for the potential of using Ag 3 Sn/Cu 3 Sn alloys in circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>contacts</b> is discussed...|$|R
