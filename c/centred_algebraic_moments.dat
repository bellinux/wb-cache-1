40|$|We {{propose a}} new affine-covariant feature, the Stable Affine Frame (SAF). SAFs {{lie on the}} {{boundary}} of extremal regions, i. e. on isophotes.

The primitives are extracted by an affine invariant process that exploits properties of bitangents and <b>algebraic</b> <b>moments.</b> Thus, instead of using closed stable isophotes, i. e.

40|$|Geometric {{modeling}} builds {{computer models}} for industrial design and manufacture from basic units, called patches. Many patches, including Bezier curves and surfaces, are pieces of toric varieties, which are objects from algebraic geometry. Statistical models are families of probability distributions used in statistical inference {{to study the}} distribution of observed data. Many statistical models, including the log-linear or discrete exponential models used to analyze discrete data, are also pieces of toric varieties. While these connections of geometric modeling and algebraic statistics to algebraic geometry were known, direct connections between these applied subjects were only recently discovered by the PIs [arXiv:/ 0706. 2116]. For example, iterative proportional fitting (IPF) from statistics {{can be used to}} compute patches, and linear precision in geometric modeling is related to maximum likelihood estimation in statistics.

40|$|There {{are very}} close ties between the two {{subjects}} of the title. In {{the early days of}} operator theory, this was mainly manifested in applications of harmonic (and complex) analysis to operator theory.

In like manner, Stone’s theorems on groups of unitary operators were proved with the aid of Bochner’s theorem characterizing those functions on the circle (or on the reals) which are the Fourier transforms of positive measures. The spectral theorem itself was obtained by various routes based on Bochner’s theorem, the trigonometric and/or <b>algebraic</b> <b>moment</b> theorem, etc. What is of more recent date (and the main focus of this exposition) are deep and interesting applications of operator theory to classical analysis.

40|$|AbstractThe Hankel vector {{approach}} {{in a recent}} work of the author with Zhao and Zhang on the general rational interpolation problem (GRIP) allows the problem to be reduced to {{what amounts to a}} limiting case, i. e. a high order rational interpolation at only a single node (infinity). In particular, it gives rise to a new method to find the coefficient matrix of the linear fractional parametrization of interpolants to the GRIP. This approach is extended in the present paper to the Nevanlinna-Pick (NP) interpolation problem with multiple nodes in the class of Nevanlinna functions, which can be in essence considered as a GRIP with certain symmetries. The Hankel vector, suitably adapted to the present situation, is in fact a finite nonnegative sequence relative to an axis if the problem is solvable—in particular, a finite positive sequence in the indeterminate case. This development leads to an intrinsic connection between the NP problem and problems of the truncated power moment and reconstructing generators of the Hankel vector in question, and therefore opens up certain ways for the discussion and solution of the NP problem and its relatives {{on the basis of the}} theories of the rational interpolation and <b>algebraic</b> <b>moment</b> problems...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze some shape-based image {{retrieval}} methods which use {{different types of}} geometric and <b>algebraic</b> <b>moments</b> and Fourier descriptors. Moments {{have been widely used}} in pattern recognition applications to describe the geometrical characteristics of different objects. They provide fundamental geometric properties (e. g. area, centroid, moment of inertia, etc [...] ). We consider various description techniques: Hu, Flusser and Taubin invariants, Legendre and Zernike moments, Generic Fourier Descriptors (GFD). The set of absolute orthogonal (i. e. rotation) moment invariants defined by Hu can be used for scale, position, and rotation invariant pattern identification. Flusser' s complete set of invariants appears as a particular case, with invariance only to rotation. The Taubin's affine moment invariants introduce the concept of covariant matrix. Legendre moments are based on orthogonal Legendre polynomials and are not invariant under image rotation. Zernike moments consist of a set of complex polynomials that form a complete orthogonal set over the interior of the unit circle. GFDs are derived by applying a modified polar Fourier transform on shape image. We have applied the retrieval methods on a collection of images chosen from MPEG 7 database. The image retrieval performance of each method is described by the precision-recall graph. In the paper we propose a novel approach that combines the described techniques after a coarse partitioning of the image dataset by their morphological features...|$|R

There {{is a need}} for a rapid, reproducible method, superior to human inspection and for the classification of cells. For solving these problems, quantitative digital-image analysis is applied and a novel method for classifications of affected blood cells from normal in an image of a microscopic section is presented. These blood cell images are acquired from different patient with sickle cell anemia, sickle cell disease and normal volunteers. Approach: The segmentation of blood cells is made by morphological operations such as thresholding, erosion and dilation to preserve shape and size characteristics. These features are extracted from segmented blood cells by estimating first, second order gray level statistics and <b>algebraic</b> <b>moment</b> invariants. In addition geometrical parameters are also computed. The analysis of extracted features is made to quantify their potential discrimination capability of blood cells as normal and abnormal. The results obtained prove that these features are highly significant and can be used for classification.

Results: For testing purposes, different sizes and various types of microscopic blood cell images were used and the classification efficiency is 80 % and 66. 6 % for normal and abnormal respectively.

It is based on a Digital EpiLuminescence Microscopy (DELM) tecnique, taking advantage of polarized light guided by optical fibers. To discriminate between malignant and benign melanocytic lesions, several dermatoscopical features have been proposed by different research groups, over the years. Nevertheless many are the attempts to reach reliable and objective classification procedures. We use, as a reference, the work by Stanganelli and Kenet. A Biomedical Engineering analyisis allows us to develop structured reference parameter tables, which enable to extract maximal information content from experimental dermatological data. The automatic classification parameters taken into account can be divided into two mainclasses: Characteristic Size Descriptor (point size, local, and global) and Intrinsic Descriptor (morphological, geometrical, chromatical, others).

These variations of GIT quotient are examples of more complicated wall crossings than the balanced wall crossings studied in recent work on derived categories and variation of GIT quotients. Our construction is algorithmic and quite explicit, allowing us to: 1) describe a tilting vector bundle which generates the derived category of such a GIT quotient, 2) provide a combinatorial basis for the K-theory of the GIT quotient in terms of the representation theory of G, and 3) show that our derived equivalences satisfy certain relations, leading to a representation of the fundamental groupoid of a "Kähler moduli space" on the derived category of such a GIT quotient.

We explain antisymmetrization; discuss the derivative of an alternating form and its corresponding anticommutative polynomial; define alternating spaces and their direct sum; establish decomposition and cancellation results for alternating spaces; and construct a Witt-Grothendieck group of alternating spaces. In Chapter Two we discuss hyperbolic alternating space. We compute the <b>centre,</b> <b>algebraic</b> isometry group and its corresponding Lie algebra, and prove a descent result. There are important parallels with Keet's results for hyperbolic symmetric spaces, as well as significant differences, especially in the methods we employ. In Chapter Three we develop a framework {{for the study of}} two aspects of forms of general Young symmetry type: their hyperbolics, and a generalization of the Weil-Siegel duality between symmetric and alternating bilinear forms. We introduce notions like nondegeneracy, derivative of a form, and derivative and integral symmetry types, and are then able to construct a hyperbolic space which is cofinal for spaces equipped with a form of the same symmetry type, and show that symmetry types are Siegel duals in our generalized sense if they have the same derivative symmetry type. In Chapter Four we present a few results and observations concerning nondegeneracytype conditions on symmetric forms. These include: an extension of Harrison's proof that nonsingularity implies nonzero Hessian to forms of arbitrary degree; a discussion of s-nondegeneracy and s-regularity; and a relation between a strong nondegeneracy condition on forms of even degree and the catalecticant, a classical invariant...|$|R

40|$|Fluidic self {{assembly}} (FSA) is {{a promising}} new method for manufacturing microscopic assemblies, which offers impressive advantages over traditional “top-down” fabrication methods. It works automatically by transporting {{large numbers of}} micro devices using hydrodynamic steering. The interaction of the fluid flow, {{the shape of the}} part, and the orientation and the shape of the binding sites all contribute to the final yield of the assembly process. Therefore, investigating the role of fluid forces during assembly is essential for optimizing of the FSA process. ^ In this thesis, a novel photolithography-based direct particle fabrication technique is presented {{that can be used to}} fabricate polymeric micro particles of varied and complex shapes with high throughput. This technique offers fine control over particle size and shape. These shape-specific particles can be used to model the micro devices used in FSA process. ^ To study the orientation and translation of such particles sliding on the substrate in a flow field can be very useful to improve the efficiency of the assembly process. Previous analytical and experimental works on single particle motions in viscous fluid are reviewed. Although there are no directly comparable analytical results, analytical trends and dependences on parameters in simplified system can shed some light on FSA performance. In particular, elliptical particles in simple shear flow show a potential of aligning particles by hydrodynamic forces. ^ A flow system is set up and experiments are carried out using particles of assorted shapes. Experimental results show the tendency of those particles to align to preferred orientations in the flow chamber by hydrodynamic forces. A micro imaging system is used to image the position and orientation of the particles. The preferred orientation of particles with different shapes was measured using <b>algebraic</b> <b>moment</b> theory.

40|$|Toward the {{development}} of an object recognition and positioning system, able to deal with arbitrary shaped objects in cluttered environments, we introduce methods for checking the match of two arbitrary curves in 2 D or surfaces in 3 D, when each of these subobjects (i. e., regions) is in arbitrary position, and we also show how to efficiently compute explicit expressions for the coordinate transformation which makes two matching subobjects (i. e., regions) coincide. This is to be used for comparing an arbitrarily positioned subobject of sensed data with objects in a data base, where each stored object is described in some “standard ” position. In both cases, matching and positioning, results are invariant with respect to viewer coordinate system, i. e., invariant to the arbitrary location and orientation of the object in the data set, or, more generally, to affine transformations of the objects in the data set, which means translation, rotation, and different stretchings in two (or three) directions, and these techniques apply to both 2 D and 3 D problems. The 3 D Euclidean case is useful for the recognition and positioning of solid objects from range data, and the 2 D affine case for the recognition and positioning of solid objects from projections, e. g., from curves in a single image, and in motion estimation. The matching of arbitrarily shaped regions is done by computing for each region a vector of centered moments. These vectors are viewpointdependent, but the dependence on the viewpoint is algebraic and well known. We then compute moment invariants, i. e., algebraic functions of the moments that are invariant to Euclidean or affine transformations of the data set. We present a new family of computationally efficient algorithms, based on matrix computations, for the evaluation of both Euclidean and affine <b>algebraic</b> <b>moment</b> invariants of data sets.
