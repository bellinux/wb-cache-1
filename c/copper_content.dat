5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the <b>copper</b> <b>content</b> of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E

Thermal calcination promoted the formation of copper aluminates and segregation of CuO from the bulk phases. TPR results showed 15 CMAO- 800 has the highest reduction rate, and the catalytic activities of iCMAO- 800 mixed oxides depend on both the reduction rates and the amounts of copper ions in mixed oxides.

40|$|Copper is {{required}} for structural and catalytic properties {{of a variety of}} enzymes participating in many vital biological processes for growth and development. Feeds provide most of the copper as an essential micronutrient consumed by animals, but inorganic copper could not be utilized effectively. In the present study, we aimed to develop transgenic mouse models to test if copper utilization will be increased by providing the animals with an exogenous gene for generation of copper chelatin in saliva. Considering that the S. cerevisiae CUP 1 gene encodes a Cys-rich protein that can bind copper as specifically as copper chelatin in yeast, we therefore constructed a transgene plasmid containing the CUP 1 gene regulated for specific expression in the salivary glands by a promoter of gene coding pig parotid secretory protein. Transgenic CUP 1 was highly expressed in the parotid and submandibular salivary glands and secreted in saliva as a 9 -kDa copper-chelating protein. Expression of salivary copper-chelating proteins reduced fecal <b>copper</b> <b>contents</b> by 21. 61 % and increased body-weight by 12. 97 %, suggesting that chelating proteins improve the utilization and absorbed efficacy of copper.
