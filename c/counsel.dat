5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain <b>counsel,</b> even if not entitled to appointed <b>counsel.</b> Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by <b>counsel</b> of their choice. The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice <b>counsel</b> is automatic reversal.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{outlines}} the main concepts of SocioDynamic <b>Counselling,</b> a constructivist approach to <b>counselling.</b> The {{development of the}} approach is briefly outlined, together with reasons for the need to invent a new <b>counselling</b> method. SocioDynamic <b>Counselling</b> is both a philosophy of helping {{and a set of}} <b>counselling</b> procedures designed {{to meet the needs of}} contemporary help-seekers. The <b>counselling</b> procedures-dialogical communication, life space description, mapping and cultural tools- are presented as important features of this <b>counselling</b> approach.

5|$|Whether <b>counsel</b> are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} <b>counsel</b> and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with <b>counsel</b> and that <b>counsel</b> be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by <b>counsel,</b> or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her <b>counsel</b> during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her <b>counsel</b> make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E

40|$|The <b>counselling</b> {{profession}} {{has been challenged}} {{to respond to the}} demands of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world. In personal <b>counselling,</b> the response has seen the increased adoption of principles, processes and approaches informed by the constructivist worldview, such as solution-oriented <b>counselling</b> and narrative <b>counselling.</b> Such a response is less evident in career <b>counselling,</b> which continues to be dominated by the approaches of the traditional positivist worldview. However, the early stages of a transition in career <b>counselling</b> are becoming more evident. This article overviews the antecedents of transition in career <b>counselling</b> and explores the influence of the constructivist and traditional positivist worldviews on elements of career <b>counselling.</b> Further, it examines the possible contribution of solution-oriented <b>counselling</b> and illustrates its application to career <b>counselling.</b> [Author abstract...|$|R

5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of <b>counsel</b> of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as <b>counsel</b> for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of <b>counsel</b> is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E

40|$|It {{is unfair}} to {{conclude}} that Western and Eastern differences have caused conflict {{in the practice of}} <b>counselling,</b> especially in mandated <b>counselling.</b> It is reasonable to assume that without the Western approach and understanding of <b>counselling,</b> the East would still be unable to develop their own theory of helping. How then does one compare different approaches? Such an assessment can be argued clearly from a cultural perspective {{as in the case of}} mandated <b>counselling.</b> This paper discusses the influence of culture which has shaped the practice of mandated <b>counselling</b> and the appropriate practice of mandated <b>counselling</b> in a Malaysian setting. Many of the points discussed here are drawn from the data informed by seven informants in a research entitled ‘Mandated <b>Counselling</b> In Malaysia: A Heuristic Phenomenological Inquiry Of Involuntary Participation’. The phenomenon of <b>counselling</b> as originated and practised in the West, which has served as the significant model for the Malaysian style of <b>counselling,</b> is discussed.

5|$|In {{the case}} of Powell v.

Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded this principle to cover all federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to State courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have <b>counsel</b> at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, the court has affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have <b>counsel</b> provided for them in interrogation {{after they have been}} arrested (Miranda v.
