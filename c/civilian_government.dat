5|$|Thơ's <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> {{was plagued}} by infighting. According to Thơ's assistant, Nguyễn Ngọc Huy, the {{presence}} of Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Tôn Thất Đính in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralysed the governance process. Đính and Đôn were subordinate to Thơ in the <b>civilian</b> <b>government,</b> but {{as members of the}} MRC they were superior to him. Whenever Thơ gave an order in the civilian hierarchy with which the generals disagreed, they would go to the MRC and countermand it.|$|E
5|$|A <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> was {{established}} in 1922 with its headquarters at Koror, replacing the military administration. The <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> initiated a programme to identify and collectivise unused land between 1923 and 1932 for redevelopment. Much of these land were used to build new industrial estates and expand towns to accommodate immigrants from Japan and Okinawa. In Japan, the government actively encouraged the Japanese and Okinawans to resettle in Micronesia, including Palau, and began establishing farming settlements. The first farming settlement {{was established}} at Ngaremlengui in 1926, but the settlers encountered problems with its humid tropical environment and abandoned it by 1930, although later settlements were established more successfully.|$|E

In October 1804, when a <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> went into effect, Harrison served as the Louisiana district's executive leader. Harrison administered the district's affairs for five weeks, until the Louisiana Territory was formally established, effective July 4, 1805, and Brigadier General James Wilkinson assumed the duties of the Louisiana territorial governor.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the Somali Republic's <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> merged the Somali Credit Bank (Credito Somalo) {{with the}} Banca Nazionale Somala. The earlier {{trusteeship}} administration had established the Somali Credit Bank in 1954 in the Trust Territory of Somalia.|$|E

50|$|The {{system of}} rule fluctuated between {{unstable}} <b>civilian</b> <b>governments</b> and interludes of military takeover.

40|$|The civil-military {{dynamic in}} Southeast Asia {{has been a}} contested issue for years. Although most {{countries}} in the region have been undertaken democratic governance, the military role in politics remains relatively unresolved. After having relatively stable <b>civilian</b> <b>governments</b> for over a decade, the Thai military launched another coup in 2014 to topple a democratically elected government. In Indonesia and the Philippines, the military has been moderately controlled by the democratically elected <b>civilian</b> <b>governments,</b> but their professional roles in sustaining democratic principles and values are also questionable. Accordingly, the crucial issues are the role that the military plays in the transition period, such as in Thailand, {{and the degree to which}} the military is institutionalised under civilian control in nascent democracies, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. These issues are addressed in the books discussed herein...|$|R

40|$|Explained and analyzed, in {{the context}} of the civil-military relationship, are the reasons why the American Revolution was not {{undermined}} by an American military tyranny. The early chapters are devoted to explaining the ideological and historical background of the American revolution with respect to American fears of power, anarchy, standing armies, and military despotism; the American 2 ̆ 7 s faith in their militia; and their insistence on civil supremacy being the guiding principle of the civil-military relationship. Also detailed is how the Continental Army was created, structured, and maintained so as to minimize the possibility of it subverting the <b>civilian</b> <b>governments.</b> Additionally addressed in the early chapters are the personal and political dynamics of the civil-military relationship. How the Continental Congress and state governments controlled and directed their military forces, as well as how the military controlled themselves, is detailed in the middle chapters. Also included in these chapters is an analysis of the military 2 ̆ 7 s often critical opinion of the <b>civilian</b> <b>governments</b> and the American people; explanations for those instances when the military threatened and violated the lives, liberties, and properties of their fellow citizens; and a discussion of the military 2 ̆ 7 s frequent involvement in and interference with the <b>civilian</b> <b>governments</b> and the political process. The last chapters are devoted to an analysis of the civil-military relationship during the last four years of the Revolutionary War, when it was most severely tested, and when the American Revolution was most susceptible to being undermined by a domestic military tyranny. Special attention is given in these chapters to the factors which prevented the Continental Army from subverting the <b>civilian</b> <b>governments,</b> particularly during the last year of the war. Also included, in the last chapter, is an analysis, {{in the context}} of several contemporary works on civil-military affairs, of the reasons for the American Revolution not being undermined by the American military forces. ...|$|R
5|$|Alfred Thayer Mahan's book The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783, {{published}} in 1890, was very influential in justifying the naval {{program to the}} <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> and to the general public. With {{the closing of the}} frontier, some Americans began to look outwards, to the Caribbean, to Hawaii and the Pacific, and with the doctrine of Manifest Destiny as philosophical justification, many saw the Navy as an essential part of realizing that doctrine beyond the limits of the American continent.|$|E
5|$|In early 1962 Nasser again {{attempted}} to wrest {{control of the}} military command from Amer. Amer responded by directly confronting Nasser {{for the first time and}} secretly rallying his loyalist officers. Nasser ultimately backed down, wary of a possible violent confrontation between the military and his <b>civilian</b> <b>government.</b> According to Boghdadi, the stress caused by the UAR's collapse and Amer's increasing autonomy forced Nasser, who already had diabetes, to practically live on painkillers from then on.|$|E
5|$|Seen as a restorer of democracy, Endara {{was later}} noted for having defended {{freedom of speech}} and {{democratic}} institutions. He also oversaw a reform of the Panamanian Defense Forces, purging Noriega loyalists, asserting the primacy of the <b>civilian</b> <b>government,</b> and returning the group from military to a national police force. In October 1994, the National Assembly passed an amendment abolishing the military at Endara's urging, becoming the second Latin American country to do so.|$|E

5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} a member of the Advisory Council of Transparency International. In a letter {{addressed}} to Nigeria's military ruler Sani Abacha in 1996, he called for the immediate release of General Olusegun Obasanjo, the former head of state of Nigeria, who had become the first military ruler in Africa to keep his promise to hand over power to an elected <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> but was later sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|As {{ultimate}} authority {{lay with}} the <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> the Cabinet, or a smaller War Cabinet, would require close access to senior military figures. This implied accommodation {{close to the}} armed forces' Central War Room. In May 1939 {{it was decided that}} the Cabinet would be housed within the Central War Room. In August 1939, with war imminent and protected government facilities in the suburbs not yet ready, the War Rooms became operational on 27 August 1939, only days before the invasion of Poland on 1 September, and Britain's declaration of war on Germany on 3 September.|$|E
5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free {{and fair elections}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, the first since the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a <b>civilian</b> <b>government,</b> but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim government. Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{missions}} {{were initially}} given financial support by the Japanese <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> and {{were encouraged to}} stamp out certain Animist rituals practiced by Palauans, but many were later imprisoned from the late 1930s onwards as the Japanese became suspicious of the missionaries' involvement in espionage activities. After the war, many of these shrines were abandoned or demolished, and Japanese-Palauans chose to adopt Christianity in favour of Buddhism or Shinto. In the 1980s and 1990s, miniature replicas of the Great Shinto Shrine, Peleliu and Angaur shrines were reconstructed. Unlike Shinto shrines during the Japanese colonial era, reconstructed shrines served as memorial sites for Japanese soldiers who in battles died during the Second World War, and are visited by Japanese tourists and family members of slain soldiers.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, {{both parties}} made similar {{proposals}} to reduce authoritarianism {{and the political}} influence of the military, and to maintain the Argentine claim in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. Alfonsín denounced a pact {{between the military and}} the Peronist unions that sought an amnesty for the military. He maintained that the armed forced should be subject to the <b>civilian</b> <b>government,</b> and that unions should be regulated. He also proposed an investigation into the actions of the military during the Dirty War. He closed his campaign by reading the preamble of the constitution of Argentina. The last rally was at the Plaza de la República, and was attended by 400,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Following the coup, a Military Revolutionary Council (MRC) was formed, {{comprising}} 12 generals including Đính, each of {{whom had}} equal voting power. They appointed a cabinet mainly consisting of civilians led by Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, {{who had been the}} titular Vice President under Diệm. Đính was initially made interior minister, but Thơ was said to have personally opposed the appointment. Eventually Minh, the head of the military junta, struck a compromise whereby Đính was made Security Minister and Administrative Affairs, which partially covered the interior ministry. He was the 2nd Deputy Chairman of the MRC behind Minh and Đôn. However, tension persisted as Thơ's <b>civilian</b> <b>government</b> was plagued by infighting. According to Thơ's assistant, Nguyễn Ngọc Huy, the presence of Đôn and Đính in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralyzed the governance process. Đính and Đôn were subordinate to Thơ in the <b>civilian</b> <b>government,</b> but as members of the MRC they were superior to him. When Thơ gave a cabinet order with which the generals disagreed, they went to the MRC and gave a counter-order. Đính and the new national police chief, General Xuân, were accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty. The junta performed indecisively and was heavily criticised, especially Minh, who was viewed as being too apathetic towards his country's situation. During the MRC's tenure, South Vietnam suffered more and more losses to the Vietcong.|$|E
50|$|In July 1964, {{the junta}} decreed the Agrarian Reform Law {{to commemorate the}} first anniversary of its {{assumption}} of power.
