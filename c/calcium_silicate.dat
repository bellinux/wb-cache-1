5|$|Many calcium {{compounds}} {{are used}} in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids. Calcium lactobionate is a white powder that {{is used as a}} suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate,</b> sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E

25|$|In the {{presence}} of heavy metals, <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> reacts in a different manner than limestone. As limestone raises the pH of the bulk solution, and if heavy metals are present, precipitation of the metal hydroxides (with extremely low solubilities) is normally accelerated and the potential of armoring of limestone particles increases significantly. In the <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> aggregate, as silicic acid species are absorbed onto the metal surface, the development of silica layers (mono- and bi-layers) lead {{to the formation of}} colloidal complexes with neutral or negative surface charges. These negatively charged colloids create an electrostatic repulsion with each other (as well as with the negatively charged <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> granules) and the sequestered metal colloids are stabilized and remain in a dispersed state - effectively interrupting metal precipitation and reducing vulnerability of the material to armoring.|$|E

50|$|The carbonate-silicate cycle {{equilibrium}} point is shifted on Venus due to surface temperatures above 300 °C, which favor {{the formation of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>silicates</b> over weathering. Thus, Venus has a high-density carbon-dioxide atmosphere.|$|R
25|$|Cements used in {{construction}} are usually inorganic, often lime or <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> based, {{and can be}} characterized as being either hydraulic or non-hydraulic, depending upon the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water (see hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime plaster).|$|E
25|$|A <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> feedstock, {{made from}} {{processed}} steel slag, {{can also be}} used to neutralize active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As the silicate anion captures H+ ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H4SiO4), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution to play many roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. In the bulk solution, the silicate anion is very active in neutralizing H+ cations in the soil solution. While its mode-of-action is quite different from limestone, the ability of <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> to neutralize acid solutions is equivalent to limestone as evidenced by its CCE value of 90-100% and its relative neutralizing value of 98%.|$|E

25|$|TNT {{is prone}} to {{exudation}} of dinitrotoluenes and other isomers of trinitrotoluene. Even small quantities of such impurities can cause such effect. The effect shows especially in projectiles containing TNT and stored at higher temperatures, e.g. during summer. Exudation of impurities leads to formation of pores and cracks (which in turn cause increased shock sensitivity). Migration of the exudated liquid into the fuze screw thread can form fire channels, increasing the risk of accidental detonations; fuze malfunction can result from the liquids migrating into its mechanism. <b>Calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> is mixed with TNT to mitigate the tendency towards exudation.|$|E

To reduce heat of hydration in the concrete, which produces <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydrate from belite, as much as 60% of the Portland cement was replaced with ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS).

25|$|Characteristically vessels were elaborately {{decorated}} with swirling patterns and intricate designs. Sometimes decorative incisions were added prior to firing, and sometimes these {{were filled with}} coloured dye to produce a dimensional effect. In the early period, the colours used to decorate pottery were limited to a rusty-red and white. Later, potters added additional colours to their products and experimented with more advanced ceramic techniques. The pigments used to decorate ceramics were based on iron oxide for red hues, calcium carbonate, iron magnetite and manganese Jacobsite ores for black and <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> for white. The black pigment, which was introduced during the later period of the culture, was a rare commodity: taken from a few sources and circulated (to a limited degree) throughout the region. The probable sources of these pigments were Iacobeni in Romania for the iron magnetite ore and Nikopol in Ukraine for the manganese Jacobsite ore. No traces of the iron magnetite pigment mined in the easternmost limit of the Cucuteni-Trypillia region {{have been found to}} be used in ceramics from the western settlements, suggesting exchange throughout the entire cultural area was limited. In addition to mineral sources, pigments derived from organic materials (including bone and wood) were used to create various colours.|$|E
40|$|This work aims at {{providing}} {{a better understanding}} of the mechanical properties of the reaction rim in the alkali-silica reaction. The elastic modulus of the <b>calcium</b> alkali <b>silicate</b> constituting the reaction rim, which is formed at the interface between alkali silicate and Ca(OH) 2 in a chemically-idealized system of the alkali-silica reaction, was studied using nano-indentation.
