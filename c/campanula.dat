While working as a gardener's boy during school holidays he had observed a specimen of <b>Campanula</b> pusilla (<b>Campanula</b> cochleariifolia) with a distorted corolla. He then described and published the first appearance of the causative agent, the mould Peronospora corollaea, in Britain, using the facilities of the Botany library.|$|E

She also bought a five-year-old mare in foal, Hay Harvest, for 5,500 guineas. When bred to Sayajirao, Carpatica produced the 1950s winner, Cavina.|$|E
5|$|Hyacinthoides non-scripta (formerly Endymion non-scriptus or Scilla non-scripta) is a bulbous {{perennial}} plant, {{found in}} Atlantic areas from north-western Spain to the British Isles, and also frequently {{used as a}} garden plant. It is known in English as the common bluebell or simply bluebell, a name which is used in Scotland {{to refer to the}} harebell, <b>Campanula</b> rotundifolia. In spring, H.non-scripta produces a nodding, one-sided inflorescence of 5–12 tubular, sweet-scented violet–blue flowers, with strongly recurved tepals, and 3–6 long, linear, basal leaves.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus {{began his}} {{expedition}} from Uppsala on May 12, 1732, {{just before he}} turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near Gävle he found great quantities of <b>Campanula</b> serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted {{on the way to}} examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (<b>Campanula</b> rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E
5|$|In total, 415 {{types of}} plants and 86 species of {{mushroom}} are recorded in the area. A number of local flower types are considered endemic to the Balkans, such as Dianthus deltoides and Allium breviradum. On the other hand, many endemic plants of central and northern Greece grow also in the park, like the Centaurea vlachorum. Moreover, rare species of the forests of Pindus mountains, typical of the lower geological layers, are Minuartia baldaci, Bornmuellera tymphaea, <b>Campanula</b> hawkinsiana, Viola dukadjinica and Silene pindicola. The most important places for the gathering of rare plants are the northern slopes of the peaks of Aftia, Flegga and Kapetan Kleidi. All the above places are very steep and difficult for grazing animals and therefore natural regeneration of the forest {{in this area is}} progressing normally and many rare plants are conserved. The serpentine soil, which is dominant {{in the area of the}} Pindus National Park also favors the growing of rare endemic plant species.|$|E

[...] M. campanulae has been documented to frequent flowers in the genus <b>Campanula,</b> several species of which are {{commonly referred to as}} bellflowers. [...] Subspecies include M. campanulae campanulae and M. campanulae wilmingtoni. [...] The genus Megachile is a cosmopolitan group of solitary bees, often called leafcutter bees and resin bees.

2500|$|The park's {{vegetation}} {{is mixed}} oak woodland and savannah and open grassland with extensive areas of chaparral {{and a number}} of endemic plant species, such as the Mount Diablo manzanita (Arctostaphylos auriculata), Mount Diablo fairy-lantern (Calochortus pulchellus), chaparral bellflower (<b>Campanula</b> exigua), Mount Diablo bird's beak (Cordylanthus nidularius), and Mount Diablo sunflower (Helianthella castanea). The park includes substantial thickets, isolated examples, and mixed ground cover of western poison oak. (It is best to learn the characteristics of this shrub and its toxin before hiking on narrow trails through brush and to be aware that it can be bare of leaves (but toxic to contact) in the winter.) ...|$|E
500|$|Megachile <b>campanulae</b> can be parasitized by {{a number}} of brood parasites, {{including}} Monodontomerus obscurus, a Chalcid wasp. [...] The kleptoparasitic bee Stelis louisae has been found in the nests. [...] Members of the genus Coelioxys are also known parasites of Megachile. [...] Kleptoparasitic bees characteristically deposit their eggs in the nests of other bees. [...] As this behavior {{is similar to that of}} cuckoo birds, such bees are referred to as cuckoo bees. [...] These host-parasite relationships are complex and the relationships between M. <b>campanulae</b> and other parasitic species may not be well described.|$|R
500|$|Solitary bees, such as M. <b>campanulae,</b> do {{not form}} colonies. While social insects (ants, yellow jackets, honeybees) work in colonies, leafcutter and resin bees work {{independently}} building nests. [...] Similar to honeybees, female bees perform nearly all essential tasks of brood rearing. [...] M. <b>campanulae</b> {{does not produce}} honey, but does perform other important beneficial tasks, pollinating crops and wild plants. [...] Although they can produce a mild sting, less intense than that from a honeybee, they are considered nonaggressive. [...] Bees in the family Megachilidae carry pollen {{on the underside of}} their abdomen. [...] Unlike honeybees, they do not have pollen baskets on their hind legs. [...] Most bees in the genus are small to medium in size, although M. pluto at 38mm is regarded as the largest bee in the world. [...] Many bees in the genus are referred to as leafcutters. [...] However, the mandibles of M. <b>campanulae</b> lack cutting edges; it belongs to the subgenus Chelostomoides, which use mud or resins to build.|$|R
500|$|On {{a smaller}} scale, human {{behaviors}} adversely affecting populations of bees, such as M. <b>campanulae,</b> can be mediated in other ways. [...] Many native bee species {{can be managed}} with minimal equipment. M. <b>campanulae</b> will nest in simple bee boxes. [...] These are constructed in simplest form by drilling holes in a block of wood. [...] The wood {{is attached to a}} post or wall, ideally in an area receiving adequate sun. [...] Holes of different diameter will be suited better for different bee species. [...] Since native pollinators forage in an area within about [...] of the nest, they can increase the productivity of a small garden.|$|R
2500|$|The Amrum {{forest was}} mainly planted in 1948 on {{an area of}} heath. Until then only a few forested regions could be found around the decoy ponds. With 180 hectares, Amrum has the largest ratio of forested land of all Germany's North Sea islands. Mainly pines, firs and birches can be found here. Meanwhile, the forest has largely lost its {{artificial}} nature. So one will encounter numerous plants on all levels and many species of fungi. The [...] "geestland", east of the forest, is mostly used for farming.

2500|$|Still Life with Apples, Pears, Lemons and Grapes (F382) was Van Gogh's {{opportunity}} to explore Blanc's recommendation about combining colors: [...] "If one brings together sulfur (yellow) and garnet (dark red), which is its exact opposite, being equidistant from nasturtium (orange) and <b>campanula</b> (blue-mauve), the garnet and sulfur will excite one another, because they are each others' complementaries." [...] In the background, Van Gogh used short brushstrokes of light blue and pink, giving {{the impression that the}} fruit is sitting in a basket. [...] Van Gogh may have seen Claude Monet's Still Life with Apples and Grapes in Paris, but while the subject matter is roughly the same, the composition is not. [...] Monet paints the fruit on a diagonally placed table to [...] "anchor his composition in space."
