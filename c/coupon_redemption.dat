5000|$|The receiver's {{particular}} type of reactions after seeing, hearing, or reading a message {{is known as a}} response. Receivers' responses can range from either non noticeable actions or noticeable actions. Non noticeable responses can be storing their information in memory and noticeable responses are immediate action such as dialing the commercials number to order a product advertised on television. One of the main goals of communication is receiving appropriate receiver responses, feedback closes the loop in the communications flow and lets the sender monitor how the intended message is being decoded and received. To achieve this goal one can ask indirectly or directly for the response, or assist the receiver in giving the response. [...] Receiving feed back can be more difficult for parties that advertise through the channels of mass media, because advertisers are not in direct contact with their customers so other methods must be obtained to determine how their messages have been received. While the critical form of feedback happens through sales, it is often hard to show a direct relationship between advertising and purchase behavior. So marketers; visit stores, check <b>coupon</b> <b>redemption,</b> use reply cards and listen to customer inquiries to achieve feedback. Once a significant amount of feedback/response study has been gathered advertisers would then have enough information to determine reasons for success or failure in the communication process and from there they can make appropriate adjustments.|$|E

The first approach is called the parallel scan where descriptive statistics related to the transactions {{in the current period}} are compared to the descriptive statistics for the prior periods. Large differences signal that something has changed. Had Knight Capital used such a metric on August 1, 2012 they would have seen, {{in a matter of minutes}} that their trading system was out of control. Nigrini also advocates risk scoring as a continuous monitoring methodology. Here forensic units (e.g., bank account customers, franchisees, travel agents, <b>coupon</b> <b>redemptions,</b> and locations) are scored on various predictors. The scores for the predictors are averaged and each unit ends up with a single risk score. High scores suggest a high risk of the behavior of interest and low scores are associated with a low risk. Audit activity would be directed towards those forensic units with high scores. The risk scoring approach can be programmed.|$|R

Coupons, as special price promotions, are used extensively by food manufacturers and retail-ers to enhance consumer demand for food products. In 2000, 166 billion grocery coupons were distributed and 3. 5 billion of them were redeemed (The Food Institute). For the pur-pose of designing effective coupon strategies, {{it is important to know}} (a) what affects con-sumers ’ decisions to redeem coupons and (b) how <b>coupon</b> <b>redemption</b> affects sales. How-ever, unlike generic food advertising, which has been examined extensively in the literature (Capps and Schmitz, Forker and Ward, Kinnu-can and Venkateswaran, Kinnucan et al.), food (grocery) coupons have not been the subject of much research; in particular, questions (a) and (b) have not been well studied. Decisions by the household on how much to purchase, what quality of commodity to se-lect, and whether to redeem coupons are usu-ally made at the same time. Therefore, any study of <b>coupon</b> <b>redemption</b> that does not con-sider demand would in general give biased results.

40|$|Market {{segmentation}} is a {{key component}} of conjoint analysis which addresses consumer preference heterogeneity. Members in a segment are assumed to be homogenous in their views and preferences when worthing an item but distinctly heterogenous to members of other segments. Latent class methodology is one of the several conjoint segmentation procedures that overcome the limitations of aggregate analysis and a-priori segmentation. The main benefit of Latent class models is that market segment membership and regression parameters of each derived segment are estimated simultaneously.

40|$|The {{management}} of coupon promotions {{is an important}} issue since it {{is still one of the}} major promotion media. Although new distribution channels arise, the allocation of coupons does not go without problems. Companies are investing thoroughly in an attempt to convince as many customers as possible to buy their products. This results in a competitive battle between retailers and manufacturers since both target the same customer base. In this paper the methodology used by retailers and manufacturers to determine their target selection for promotional actions is improved by building separate predictive models for the same customer base. One model makes predictions concerning the redemption behavior of promotions that are distributed by the retailer while another model does the same for promotions issued by manufacturers. A logistic regression is used to predict <b>coupon</b> <b>redemption</b> behavior. The performance of the models will be quantified by the classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The experiments are carried out on a real-life data set obtained from a world-wide FMCG retailer. The contributions of this study are as follows. First, we are able to make predictions concerning customers' <b>coupon</b> <b>redemption.</b> Secondly, the use of separate models for retailers' and manufacturers' <b>coupon</b> <b>redemption</b> makes it possible to split the entire customer base in four different segments. This enables a reduction of the conflict, which is likely to lead to higher profits for both parties.

Each machine has an inclined ramp 10-13 feet long, up which the player must roll the balls. A sudden increase in incline {{at the end of}} the ramp (called the [...] "ball-hop") launches the balls above the plane of the ramp toward a series of rings that direct the balls into holes of varying point values, the smallest and hardest to reach usually giving the most points. The machine dispenses coupons to the player, either during the game as various score thresholds are reached, or all at once after the game ends based on the final score. The coupons are typically traded at the arcade for prizes, the more valuable prizes requiring more <b>coupons</b> for <b>redemption.</b> Some machines award large bonuses of coupons to players who attain or surpass a posted exceptionally high score.|$|R

Therefore, this research not only fills existing gaps in the literature but also enriches it by synthesizing views from different academic disciplines. This dissertation concentrates on grocery products. Data is collected from about 2500 adults, primarily residing in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The conceptual framework is based on the theory of reasoned action, which suggests that an individual's beliefs influence his/her attitude towards the consequences of actions, and attitudes, in turn, influence the individual's actions. Toward this end, the model incorporates intention to redeem coupons, intention to keep or spend savings and intention of how to spend savings from <b>coupon</b> <b>redemption</b> as the dependent variables, and several other independent variables. Behavioral independent variables are measured using items borrowed from established scales, as well as those developed exclusively for the current study. Standard statistical tools such as factor analysis and accepted measures of reliability and validity (Cronbach's alpha) are applied and reported, while structural equation modeling has been used to re-validate certain findings. Multivariate regression is applied for testing the hypotheses. Results indicate that several psychological (e. g. arousal-seeking, novelty-seeking tendency), socio-economic (e. g. income effect, opportunity cost) and behavioral factors (e. g. savings propensity, switching behavior) influence the individual's intention to redeem a coupon.

40|$|Purpose- In 2009, U. S. coupons set a {{new record}} of 367 billion coupons distributed. Yet, while coupon {{distribution}} is on the rise, redemption rates remain below 1 %. This article shows how recognizing context variables, such as proximity, weather, part of town and financial incentives interplay to determine a coupon campaigns ’ success. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports an empirical study conducted in co-operation with a restaurant chain: 9. 880 Subway coupons were distributed under different experimental context conditions. Redemption behavior was analyzed {{with the help of}} logistic regressions. Findings – We found that even though proximity drives <b>coupon</b> <b>redemption,</b> city center campaigns seem to be much more sensitive to distance than suburban areas. The further away the distribution place from the restaurant the less does the amount of monetary incentive determine the motivation to redeem. Practical implications – When designing a coupon campaign for a company, coupon distribution should not follow a ‘one-is-good-for-all-strategy ’ even for one marketer within one product category. Instead each coupon strategy should carefully consider contextual influence. Originality – This article is the first to our knowledge that systematically investigates the impact of context variables on <b>coupon</b> <b>redemption.</b> We focus on context variables that electronic marketing channels will be able to easily incorporate into personalized mobile marketing campaigns...|$|E
50|$|Results & Implications: Although the two <b>coupons</b> had {{equivalent}} <b>redemption</b> values, {{the median}} {{price of the}} 1% chance of winning the European vacation was $20, but $5 for the tuition coupon, indicating that the weight of 1% we place on affect-rich prizes is greater than for affect-poor prizes. Based on results from the 1% condition, PT would predict that at a 99% chance of winning, the European coupon would still be priced higher than the tuition coupon. On the contrary, the affective approach found that in the 99% chance of winning condition, the median price of the European coupon was $450, whereas that of the tuition coupon was $478. Our weighting of the 99% probability as smaller for the affect-rich European coupon than the affect-poor tuition coupon indicates probability-outcome dependence for affect-rich outcomes. Affect-rich outcomes yield more pronounced overweighting of small probabilities, but more pronounced underweighting of large probabilities.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prolific}} author on dedicated portfolio theory, Martin L. Leibowitz, {{was the first}} to refer to dedicated portfolios as “cash matching” portfolios. He demonstrated how they are the simplest case of the technique known as bond portfolio immunization. In his sketch of its history, he traces the origin of immunization to Frederick R. Macaulay who first suggested the notion of “duration” for fixed income securities in 1938. Duration represents the average life of the <b>coupon</b> payments and <b>redemption</b> of a bond and links changes in interest rates to the volatility of a bond’s value. One year later, J.R. Hicks independently developed a similar formulation referred to as the “average period.” In 1942, T.C. Koopmans pointed out in a report that, by matching the duration of the bonds held in a portfolio to the duration of liabilities those bonds would fund, the effects of interest rate changes could be mitigated or nullified completely, i.e. immunized. In 1945, Paul Samuelson formulated essentially the same concept, calling it the “weighted-average time period.” None of these earliest researchers cited each other’s work, suggesting each developed the concept independently. The work culminated in a 1952 paper by a British actuary, F. M. Redington.|$|R
