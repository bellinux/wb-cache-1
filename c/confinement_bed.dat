40|$|Sediment budgets {{developed}} for high gradient rivers {{are subject to}} large uncertainties in the quantification of source-area and storage terms. Fluxes of the coarse fraction of the supply (bed load) can be constrained from measurements, but {{the time and effort}} required to measure these fluxes is prohibitive in most cases. In this presentation, we discuss the development of a sediment routing model that tracks downstream changes in the flux and grain size distribution of the bed load through a 250 km reach of the Colorado River in western Colorado and eastern Utah. The model is formulated for nine reaches where values of discharge, width, reach-average slope and roughness have been measured or verified. The reaches are defined geographically by changes in lithology which affect valley <b>confinement.</b> <b>Bed</b> surface grain size distributions (GSDs) have been measured at 78 locations across the study area, but these distributions are used as a test of the model, not as input, except at the upstream boundary. The model is formulated under the assumption that the coarse sediment load is derived from the bed surface, and transport capacity is determined by local hydraulic conditions and grain size. Estimates of the bankfull bed load transport capacity for each reach are computed for 14 size fractions of the surface sediment, and fractional transport rates are summed to get the bed load transport capacity of that reach. In the adjacent reach, the GSD and fluxes of each size fraction from upstream are used to determine the mean grain size, and fractional transport capacity of that reach. Calculations proceed downstream from one reach to the next, and illustrate linked changes in (1) bed load transport capacity, and (2) grain size distributions of the bed surface. Results show that the model-derived GSDs match the measured GSDs very closely, except for the two most distal reaches where the slope is affected by uplift associated with salt diapirs. The mismatch between modeled and observed GSDs in these reaches occurs because the slope is not self-formed, consequently the model overestimates the local transport capacity in relation to supply. Except for these two reaches, the modeled bed load fluxes seem very reasonable (Qb ~ 0. 5 - 1. 0 kg/m/s at bankfull discharge), and exhibit downstream trends that are consistent with trends reported in two previous studies...|$|E

40|$|Finishing pigs {{were fed}} for 3 years in bedded hoop {{structures}} and a confinement building with slotted floors in central Iowa. When {{summer and winter}} feeding periods for 3 years were combined, the trials showed that the finishing pigs in hoops ate 4. 9 % more feed, grew 1. 7 % faster, and required 3. 4 % more feed per unit of liveweight gain than confinement pigs. The mortality rate was similar and percentage of culled and light pigs was higher for hoops compared with confinement. Also, the hoop pigs had 4. 9 % thicker backfat with 4. 8 % smaller loin muscle area and 1 percentage unit less of carcass lean and carcass yield compared with confinement pigs. The efficiency of lean gain was also poorer for the hoop pigs. The hoop pigs required 6. 8 % more feed per unit of lean gain. Because the hoops are unheated structures, there were seasonal effects. The hoop pigs ate more feed, particularly in the winter, grew faster in the summer, and were less efficient in the winter than the confinement pigs. The hoop pigs had thicker backfat in the summer only and were less efficient in converting feed to lean in the winter only. The hoop pigs had a greater incidence of roundworm infestations. Therefore, hoop pigs {{may need to be}} fed diets somewhat differently than the diets fed to confinement pigs to optimize lean growth, and the control of internal parasites in hoop pigs may need to be more aggressive than in <b>confinement.</b> <b>Bedding</b> use was approximately 237 lb/pig on a year-round basis.

40|$|Osteoporosis, {{associated}} with a high turnover of bone and acute bone loss, occurs {{in a number of}} clinical models, such as following prolonged steroid therapy, extremity and spinal immobilisation, and often is {{associated with}} fracture. <b>Confinement</b> to <b>bed</b> and subsequent hypodynamism relating to the pain following a vertebral fracture may activate the process of high bone turnover and acute bone loss.

Salmon calcitonin, a potent inhibitor of osteoclast activity, has been shown to prevent bone loss in all clinical models of acute bone loss due to increased bone turnover and osteoclastic resorption. In addition, salmon calcitonin has a potent analgesic effect, thereby causing a reduction in bone pain and improvement in functional capacity. For these reasons, calcitonin remains a first-line therapy in bone loss related to a hyper-resorptive state. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|River {{classification}} is {{a useful}} tool for researchers and managers wishing to organise, simplify and understand the forms and processes within freshwater systems.

Therefore, we aimed to determine how long-term <b>bed</b> <b>confinement</b> affects bone metabolism. This study included 36 patients who had been bedridden from birth due to severe immobility. Bone mineral density and bone metabolism markers were compared to the bedridden period in all study patients. Changes in the bone metabolism markers during a follow-up of 12 years were studied in 17 patients aged < 30 years at baseline. The bone mineral density was reduced (0. 58 ± 0. 19 g/cm 3), and the osteocalcin (13. 9 ± 12. 4 ng/mL) and urine N-terminal telopeptide (NTX) levels (146. 9 ± 134. 0 mM BCE/mM creatinine) were greater than the cutoff value for predicting fracture. Among the bone metabolism markers studied, osteocalcin and NTX were negatively associated with the bedridden period. During the follow-up, osteocalcin and parathyroid hormone were decreased, and the 25 (OH) vitamin D was increased. NTX at baseline was negatively associated with bone mineral density after 12 years.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in the home and worksite on the health of adults in the United States. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Nationally representative population. PARTICIPANTS: 43, 732 adults who completed the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention supplement in the 1991 National Health Interview Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of restricted activity, <b>bed</b> <b>confinement,</b> and work absence in the two weeks preceding the survey and self-reported health status among adults with and without exposure to ETS. RESULTS: We found that only 20. 2 % of never- smokers and 23. 1 % of former smokers reported exposure to ETS at home or work, whereas 87. 2 % of current smokers reported exposure to ETS. Among never-smokers, after adjusting for covariates, people who were exposed to ETS {{were more likely to report}} one or more days of restricted activity (relative risk (RR) = 1. 27, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 10 to 1. 46), one or more days of <b>bed</b> <b>confinement</b> (RR = 1. 43, 95 % CI = 1. 19 to 1. 73), and one or more days of work absence (RR = 1. 33, 95 % CI = 1. 05 to 1. 73) in the two weeks before the survey than were people without such exposure. We detected smaller trends for one or more days of restricted activity among current and former smokers (RR = 1. 16, 95 % CI = 0. 97 to 1. 40; and RR = 1. 11, 95 % CI = 0. 82 to 1. 51), one or more days of <b>bed</b> <b>confinement</b> among current smokers (RR = 1. 34, 95 % CI = 0. 95 to 1. 88), and one or more days of work absence among former smokers (RR = 1. 13, 95 % CI = 0. 84 to 1. 50) in the two weeks before the survey than among people without such exposure, although the CIs were wide and chance cannot be excluded as an explanation for these findings. Never- smokers (RR = 1. 47, 95 % CI = 1. 34 to 1. 62), former smokers (RR = 1. 22, 95 % CI = 1. 07 to 1. 39) and current smokers (RR = 1. 31, 95 % CI = 1. 10 to 1. 56) exposed to ETS were all more likely to report a less than very good health status than were people without such exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that never-smoking adults exposed to ETS report more acute health effects than unexposed, never-smoking adults, and suggests similar findings in current and former smoking adults. ...|$|R
