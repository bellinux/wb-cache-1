5|$|Both Conte di <b>Cavour</b> and {{her sister}} ship, , participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, where the latter was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers {{attacked}} the fleet at Taranto in November 1940, and Conte di <b>Cavour</b> was torpedoed. She was deliberately grounded, with most of her hull underwater, and her repairs were not completed before the Italian surrender in September 1943. The ship was then captured by the Germans, but they made no use of her. She was damaged in an Allied air raid in early 1945 and capsized seven days later. Conte di <b>Cavour</b> was eventually scrapped in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Conte di <b>Cavour</b> {{sailed to}} North America and visited ports in the United States {{as well as}} Halifax, Canada. Giulio Cesare made port visits in the Levant in 1919 and 1920. Conte di <b>Cavour</b> was mostly {{inactive}} in 1921 because of personnel shortages and was refitted at La Spezia from November to March 1922. Both battleships supported Italian operations on Corfu in 1923 after an Italian general and his staff were murdered on the Greco-Albanian border; Benito Mussolini was {{not satisfied with the}} Greek Government's response so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island. Conte di <b>Cavour</b> bombarded the town with her 76mm guns, killing 20 and wounding 32 civilians.|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} told upon rather good {{authority}} that <b>Cavour's</b> retirement is simply a feint, {{and that he will}} recover his position presently.|$|R
50|$|In 1848, {{he joined}} a group of Garibaldian volunteers, that went to Milan to fight with the Manara Legion, against the Austrians. In 1859, he was again to briefly join <b>Cavour's</b> armed forces in Bologna.|$|R
5|$|Conte di <b>Cavour</b> escorted King Victor Emmanuel III and {{his wife}} aboard Dante Alighieri, on a state visit to Spain in 1924 and was placed in reserve upon her return until 1926, when she {{conveyed}} Mussolini on a voyage to Libya. The ship was again placed in reserve from 1927 until 1933. Her sister became a gunnery training ship in 1928, after having been in reserve since 1926. Conte di <b>Cavour</b> was reconstructed at the CRDA Trieste Yard while Giulio Cesare was rebuilt at Cantieri del Tirreno, Genoa between 1933 and 1937. Both ships participated in a naval review by Adolf Hitler in the Bay of Naples in May 1938 and covered the invasion of Albania in May 1939.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{participated in}} the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, when Giulio Cesare was lightly damaged.

She was grounded with most of her hull underwater and her repairs were not completed before the Italian surrender in September 1943. Conte di <b>Cavour</b> was scrapped in 1946. Giulio Cesare escorted several convoys, and {{participated in the}} Battle of Cape Spartivento in late 1940 and the First Battle of Sirte in late 1941. She was designated as a training ship in early 1942, and escaped to Malta after Italy surrendered. The ship {{was transferred to the}} Soviet Union in 1949 and renamed Novorossiysk. The Soviets also used her for training until she was sunk when a mine exploded in 1955. She was scrapped in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Conte di <b>Cavour,</b> {{named after}} the statesman Count Camillo Benso di <b>Cavour,</b> was laid down at La Spezia Arsenale, La Spezia, on 10 August 1910, and {{launched}} on 10 August 1911. She was completed on 1 April 1915, {{and served as a}} flagship in the southern Adriatic Sea during World War I. She saw no action, however, and spent little time at sea. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as MAS torpedo boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.|$|E
50|$|Though {{he withdrew}} as editor in October 1848, Il Risorgimento paved <b>Cavour's</b> way towards {{entering}} the government—he was appointed prime minister to Vittorio II Emanuele in 1852, after Carlo Alberto's resignation— and a decade's career engineering Italian unification.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Genoa, and through <b>Cavour's</b> {{influence}} secured the professorship of history and geography at Genoa's Polytechnic Institute. In 1858 he founded the Società Ligure di Storia Patria, a society to promote the study of national history.|$|R
60|$|I {{have the}} papers. I am {{much the better}} for some things in them. There's to be the {{universal}} suffrage, the withdrawal of troops, whatever I wanted. <b>Cavour's</b> despatch to the Swiss is also excellent. Those injured martyrs wanted the bone in their teeth, that's all.|$|R
5|$|Conte di <b>Cavour</b> was {{the name}} ship of the three s built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1910s. She served during both World War I and World War II, {{although}} she was little used and saw no combat during the former. The ship supported operations during the Corfu Incident in 1923 and {{spent much of the}} rest of the decade in reserve. She was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before.|$|E
5|$|Several {{foreign-owned}} hotels {{were established}} around the square, making it popular with visitors to London. Brunet's Hôtel at No.25 was opened by Louis Brunet in 1800, later expanding to Nos.24 and 26 {{during the following}} decade. It was bought by Francis Jaunay in 1815 known as Jaunay's Hôtel. The Hôtel Sablonière et de Provence opened at No.17–18 in 1845 as the Hôtel de Provence, and renamed in 1869. It closed in 1919 and became a public house. The <b>Cavour,</b> at No.20 at the southeast of the square, opened in 1864. It was badly damaged in World War II but subsequently restored.|$|E
5|$|The first {{design in}} the second {{generation}} of Italian dreadnoughts, the Conti di <b>Cavour</b> class was also designed by Edoardo Masdea. They were ordered {{in response to the}} French s. They remedied many of the deficiencies of the previous design; the most significant improvement was a dramatically more effective arrangement of the main battery. Ten guns were arranged in twin turrets superfiring over triple turrets forward and aft, and a third triple turret was placed amidships. All thirteen guns could fire on the broadside, but the firing arcs for most of the guns were significantly improved.|$|E
50|$|La Nazione {{merged with}} <b>Cavour's</b> famous {{political}} newspaper, Il_Risorgimento_(newspaper). Based in Florence, Italy, it is published in fourteen editions including {{those for the}} regions of Tuscany, Umbria and for the Province of La Spezia in Liguria. The early contributors include Edmondo de Amicis, Carlo Lorenzini, Giovanni Spadolini, Giuseppe Prezzolini and Mario Luzi.|$|R

He contributed a preface and notes to Horace Mann's Report of an Educational Tour in Germany, &c., 1846; edited, with Henry James Slack, the {{memorial}} edition (1865, &c.) of the Works of William Johnson Fox; and translated Count <b>Cavour's</b> Thoughts on Ireland, &c., 1868.|$|R
50|$|The Right was {{represented}} {{the interests of}} the Northern bourgeoisie and the Southern nester aristocracy. Its members were mostly large landowners, industrialists and people related to the military, supporting free trade market and centralism. On economy, the Right supported free trade and laissez-faire, while on social issues it favoured a strong central government, obligatory conscription and, during the <b>Cavour's</b> era, the secular Law of Guarantees, causing Pope Pius IX's Non Expedit.|$|R
5|$|The last {{segment of}} US8 in Wisconsin was paved in 1937 between <b>Cavour</b> and Armstrong Creek; the highway in Minnesota was paved in its {{entirety}} by 1940. Near Hawkins, a pair of sharp curves near the Rusk–Price county line were removed as the State Highway Commission realigned the highway to follow a straighter course. The US8/US51 concurrency was altered the next year to a shorter overlap running southward near Heafford Junction. The former routing of US8 was redesignated County Trunk Highway K (CTH-K) after it was transferred back to county control.|$|E
5|$|The three ships {{had limited}} careers during World War I, {{and did not}} see action. On the night of 2/3 August 1916, Leonardo da Vinci was sunk by an {{internal}} explosion. She was raised in 1919; the navy planned to repair and modernize her, but lacked sufficient funds, and she was sold in 1923. The two surviving ships were heavily rebuilt in the mid-1930s, and both saw action during World War II. On the night of 11/12 November 1940, both ships were attacked by British torpedo bombers in the Battle of Taranto. Conti di <b>Cavour</b> was badly damaged, and had not been fully repaired when Italy surrendered in September 1943. Giulio Cesare meanwhile escaped unscathed, and participated in the battles of Cape Spartivento and First Sirte in November 1940 and December 1941, respectively. After {{the end of the}} war, Conti di <b>Cavour</b> was scrapped, and Giulio Cesare was surrendered to the Soviet Union. Renamed Novorossiysk, she was ultimately sunk in October 1955 by an old German mine left over from World War II. Her wreck was later salvaged in 1957 and broken up thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} of the Formidabile class were ordered by Camillo Benso, Count of <b>Cavour,</b> then both the Prime Minister and Naval Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860, {{shortly before the}} {{unification}} of Italy. The ships were originally intended to be armored floating batteries, but they were redesigned as sea-going ironclads after construction began. These ships were the first components of a major naval expansion program {{that was designed to}} prepare a fleet of ironclad warships capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire to be its main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice.|$|E
2500|$|General La Marmora succeeded to <b>Cavour's</b> {{post and}} insisted on {{following}} the treaty terms, even sending a letter to Tuscany asking that they restore their Grand Duke. (Bettino Ricasoli, virtual dictator of Tuscany at the time, wrote about this appeal to his brother, saying [...] "Tell General La Marmora that I have torn his letter into a thousand pieces.") France continued direct talks with Piedmont on the destiny of the central Italian states, all of whose autocrats supported unification with Piedmont but were restrained by the treaty, which called {{for the restoration of}} their old governments.|$|R
50|$|Appointed Piedmontese {{minister}} of the interior, he resigned office shortly after <b>Cavour's</b> death, but was subsequently chosen to be {{minister of}} finance by Farini, whom he succeeded as Prime Minister in 1863. With the help of Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta he concluded (September 15, 1864) the September Convention with France, whereby Napoleon III agreed to evacuate Rome, and Italy to transfer her capital from Turin to Florence. The convention excited violent opposition at Turin, in consequence of which Minghetti was obliged to resign office. He took little part in public life until 1869, when he accepted the portfolio of agriculture in the Menabrea Cabinet.|$|R

25|$|<b>Cavour</b> {{had retired}} to his estate at Leri, out of {{politics}} but concerned about the King’s alliance with Garibaldi’s revolutionaries and his desire to renew the war with Austria without allied support. When the weak La Marmora cabinet resigned, Victor Emmanuel was reluctant to have <b>Cavour</b> as premier again due both to their quarrel over the treaty of Villafranca and Cavour's success in preventing the king from marrying his mistress after the queen's death. But <b>Cavour</b> was sent for on January 20, 1860.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cavour</b> persuaded Victor Emmanuel {{to write}} a letter to Garibaldi, {{requesting}} that he not invade the mainland; the letter was indeed sent, but the King secretly wished Garibaldi to invade. He wrote another letter asking him to go ahead, but this was apparently never sent. <b>Cavour</b> meanwhile attempted to stir up a liberal revolution in Naples, but the populace was unreceptive. Garibaldi invaded, attempting to reach Naples quickly before <b>Cavour</b> found a way to stop him. On September 7, he entered Naples, at that time the largest city in Italy, and unilaterally declared Victor Emmanuel the King of Italy. Garibaldi was now military dictator of southern Italy and Sicily, and he imposed the Piedmontese constitution but publicly demanded that <b>Cavour</b> be removed, which alienated him slightly from Victor Emmanuel.|$|E
50|$|He expounded his {{political}} creed and his policy as minister to Charles Albert (from February 1835 to October 1847) in his Memorandum storico-politico, published in 1851, a document {{of great interest}} {{for the study of}} the conditions of Piedmont and Italy at that time. In 1853 he was elected deputy for San Quirico, but he persisted in regarding his mandate as derived from the royal authority rather than as an emanation of the popular will. As leader of the Clerical Right in the parliament he strongly opposed <b>Cavour's</b> policy, which was eventually to lead to Italian unity, and on the establishment of the Kingdom of Italy he retired from public life.|$|R
50|$|The Italian Peninsula's {{history of}} {{fragmentation}} and colonization by foreign powers (especially France, Spain and Austria-Hungary) between {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire and its unification in 1861 played a considerable role in further jeopardizing the linguistic situation. When the unification process took place, the newly founded country used Italian mainly as a literary language. Many Romance and non-Romance regional languages were spoken throughout the Italian Peninsula and the islands, each with their own local dialects. Following Italian unification Massimo Taparelli, marquis d'Azeglio, one of <b>Cavour's</b> ministers, is said to have stated that while Italy had been created, there still was to create Italians (that is, a common national identity).|$|R
50|$|He {{resigned}} {{office on}} the proclamation of the republic after the flight of the pope to Gaeta in 1849, resumed {{it for a while}} when Pius returned to Rome with the protection of French arms, but when a reactionary and priestly policy was instituted, he went into exile and took up his residence at Turin. There he became convinced that it was only through the House of Savoy that Italy could be liberated, and he expounded his views in <b>Cavour's</b> paper Il Risorgimento, in La Frusta and Il Piemonte, of which latter he was at one time editor. He also wrote his chief historical work, Lo Stato Romano dal 1815 al 1850, in four volumes (Turin, 1850).|$|R
25|$|English {{historian}} Denis Mack Smith says <b>Cavour</b> was {{the most}} successful parliamentarian in Italian history {{but he was not}} especially liberal. <b>Cavour</b> was often dictatorial, ignored his ministerial colleagues and parliament, and interfered in parliamentary elections. He also practiced transformism and other undesirable policies which were carried over into post-Risorgimento Italy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cavour</b> {{formed a}} {{coalition}} with Urbano Rattazzi {{known as the}} Connubio ("union"), uniting the moderate men of the Right and of the Left, and brought about {{the fall of the}} d'Azeglio cabinet in November 1852. The King reluctantly accepted <b>Cavour</b> as prime minister, the most conservative possible choice, but their relationship was never an easy one.|$|E
25|$|The {{architect}} of Italian unification was Count Camillo Benso di <b>Cavour,</b> the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{unification}} of Italy in the mid-19th century, the Papal States resisted incorporation into the new nation, even as all the other Italian countries, except for San Marino, joined it; Camillo <b>Cavour's</b> dream of proclaiming the Kingdom of Italy from the steps of St. Peter's Basilica {{did not come to}} pass. The nascent Kingdom of Italy invaded and occupied Romagna (the eastern portion of the Papal States) in 1860, leaving only Latium in the Pope's domains. Latium, including Rome itself, was annexed during the capture of Rome. For nearly sixty years, relations between the Papacy and the Italian government were hostile, and the status of the Pope became known as the [...] "Roman Question".|$|R
5000|$|The {{paper was}} founded {{by a group of}} liberals and monarchists {{a few days after the}} {{annexation}} of Lombardy to Piedmont-Sardinia in the wider context of Italian unification. Its founders were wealthy members of the city's leading families, politically supportive of the Piedmontese First Minister, Count <b>Cavour's</b> unification strategy. Three of the most promininent of them, Giovanni Visconti Venosta, Gaetano Negri and Stefano Jacini were members of the [...] "Constitutional Association". [...] The starting paid up share capital of 300,000 lire was considered lavish at the time. Beneath its title early editions of La Perseveranza carried the motto [...] "Usque ad finem" [...] ("On to completion" [...] / [...] "On to the end").|$|R
50|$|In 1854, through <b>Cavour's</b> influence, he {{was elected}} a deputy to the Italian parliament. He {{retained}} his seat until 1864, passing the summer in England and fulfilling his parliamentary duties at Turin in the winter. On {{the outbreak of the}} Austro-Sardinian War of 1859, he proceeded to Lombardy as war correspondent of The Times. The campaign was so brief that the fighting was over before he arrived, but his connection with The Times endured for twenty years. He was a forcible and picaresque writer, with a remarkable command of the English language. In 1876, {{he was the first to}} describe, along with Edwin Pears, the Turkish atrocities in Bulgaria for the British public. He materially helped to establish that friendly feeling towards Italy which became traditional in England.|$|R
