We demonstrate the potentialities of such algorithm on different <b>crossing</b> <b>seams</b> of benzene, z-penta- 3, 5 -diemminium and 1, 3 -butadiene. The second algorithm has instead been designed to explicitly compute the intersection-space minimum energy coordinate. Our computations show how an intersection seam and the energy along it can unambiguously defined.

40|$|Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations {{were performed}} to investigate the quintet, triplet, and singlet potential energy surfaces associated with the C-H activation of methane by laser-ablated molybdenum (Mo) atoms recently observed experimentally by Andrews and co-workers. The present computational study aims {{to better understand the}} nature of the reaction mechanisms for C-H activation by Mo atoms. The processes for activation of methane by the excited Mo atoms appear to produce CH 3 -MoH, CH 2 =MoH 2, and CH≡MoH 3 complexes. The <b>crossing</b> <b>seams</b> between the potential energy surfaces and possible spin inversion processes for the direct conversion of methane to a high oxidation state transition metal complex that contains a carbon-metal double or triple bond are examined using the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) approach. The minimum energy reaction pathway is found to involve spin inversion three times in different reaction steps. In total, three spin states (quintet, triplet, and singlet) are involved in going from the entrance channel to the exit channel: 5 Mo + CH 4 → CH 3 - MoH (51) → CH 2 =MoH 2 (32) → CH≡MoH 3 (13). The first <b>crossing</b> <b>seam</b> exists prior to TS 1 - 2, a three-centered transition state for the H-transfer of complex 1 to form a double carbon-metal bond complex 2. This <b>crossing</b> <b>seam</b> is a key aspect in the reaction pathway because the molecular system should change its spin multiplicity from the quintet state to the triplet state near this crossing region, which leads to a significant decrease in the barrier height of TS 1 - 2 from 51. 0 to 33. 8 kcal mol - 1 at the B 3 LYP level of theory. The second <b>crossing</b> <b>seam</b> between the quintet potential energy surface (PES) and the singlet PES is found not to play a significant role because the triplet potential energy surface lies significantly below the quintet and singlet potential energy surfaces. Accordingly, the molecular system would preferentially move on the triplet potential energy surfaces before encountering the second <b>seam.</b> The <b>crossing</b> <b>seam</b> between the triplet exit channel and the singlet exit channel can take place, in which complex 13 containing a triple carbon-metal bond is formed via an H-transfer process. This <b>crossing</b> <b>seam</b> will again lead to a spin inversion from the triplet to the singlet state, and this leads to a large decrease in the height of the reaction barrier from 40. 8 to 17. 2 kcal mol - 1. © 2008 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The photodynamical process starts with a fast (3 ̆c 100 fs) planar relaxation from the S 2 ππ* state into the πOπ* minimum of the S 2 state. The calculations demonstrate that two π-excited states (denoted ππ* and πOπ*) are actually involved in this stage.

The MRCI method was used for computing the nonadiabatic interaction between the two lowest excited ππ * states (S 2 (La, CT) and S 1 (Lb, LE)) and the corresponding minimum on the <b>crossing</b> <b>seam</b> (MXS) whereas the ADC(2) calculations were dedicated to assessing the role of the πσ * state. The MXS structure was found to have a twisting angle of ∼ 50 °. The branching space does not contain the twisting motion of the dimethylamino group and thus is not directly involved in the deactivation process from S 2 to S 1. Polar solvent effects are not found to have a significant influence on this situation.

Photodissociation is an important method used to thoroughly investigate the fundamental issues of chemical reactivity. Photodissociation involves molecules and reaction fragments moving over ground- and excited-state potential surfaces (PESs). Molecules can move on a single PES (adiabatic pathway) or can cross over from one PES to another (nonadiabatic pathways). For a full theoretical understanding of a photodissociation mechanism, all of the important nonadiabatic and adiabatic pathways must be determined. This is not an easy task.

At the highest level, the explicit possibility of excited-state CH dissociation and consideration of the Rydberg π− 3 s state was included into the electronic wavefunction. The initial dynamics is characterised by the torsional motion and the crossing between the bright π−π * state with S 1, the latter having primarily Rydberg character with only a minor contribution of the repulsive valence π−σ * state. Due to back-rotation to planar structures after 17 fs, {{part of the population}} flows into the Rydberg states. The lifetime for this fraction of trajectories is significantly longer than that for the valence population. An analysis of the latter population shows that the decay to the ground state proceeds mainly at the pyramidalised conical intersection. Thus, no major qualitative mechanistic changes as compared to previous dynamics simulations are observed for the valence population.

We then proceed to apply the ADC(2) method to the photochemistry of 8 -vinylguanine (8 vG), a minimally modified analogue of guanine which, unlike the naturally occurring nucleobase, displays intense fluorescence, indicative of a much longer-lived excited electronic state. The emissive electronic state of 8 vG is identified as an ππ*-type intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state, in which a charge of roughly − 0. 2 e is transferred from the guanine moiety onto the vinyl substituent. The main radiationless deactivation pathway competing with fluorescence is expected to involve the molecule leaving the minimum on the ICT ππ* state, and reaching a region of the S 1 adiabatic state where it resembles the La ππ* state of unmodified 9 H-guanine.

This reaction {{is an important}} step in a sequence of events in the overall NO detoxification reaction involving trHbN. The simulations (approximately 160 ns in total) reveal that the reaction favors a pathway including (i) NO binding to oxy-trHbN, followed by (ii) rearrangement of peroxynitrite-trHbN to nitrato-trHbN, and finally (iii) nitrate dissociation from nitrato-trHbN. Overall, the reactions occur within tens of picoseconds and the <b>crossing</b> <b>seam</b> of the reactant and product are found to be broad. The more conventional pathway, where the peroxynitrite-trHbN complex undergoes peroxide cleavage to form free NO(2) and oxo-ferryl trHbN, is found to be too slow due to a considerable barrier involved in peroxide bond dissociation. The energetics of this step is consistent with earlier electronic structure calculations and make this pathway less likely. The role of Tyr 33 and Gln 58 in the NO dioxygenation has been investigated by studying the reaction in mutants of trHbN. The mutation study suggests that residues Tyr 33 and Gln 58 preorient the reactive ligands through a highly dynamical H-bonding network which facilitates the reaction.

From the quantum mechanical point of view, we show that the transfer of population to the electronic ground state originating from a wave packet launched on the excited state occurs in a stepwise fashion. The evolution of wave packets launched on the electronic ground state is instead more complex because the <b>crossing</b> <b>seam</b> is located close {{to the bottom of}} the electronic excited state. We next use the mapping formalism, which replaces the discrete electronic degrees of freedom by continuous ones, to obtain a classical description of the coupled electronic states. We propagate gaussian swarms of trajectories to show that this approach can be used to calculate the populations in each electronic state. We finally propose a very simple trajectory surface hopping model, which assumes that trajectories have a constant probability to jump onto the other state in a particular region of the phase space and a null hopping probability outside from this region. Quasiclassical calculations show that this model enables a precise estimation of complex quantities, like for example the projection of the instantaneous probability density on given planes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{competitive}} photodissociation of bromoacetyl chloride BrCH 2 COCl in {{the first}} (1) A" state (S- 1) by 248 nm photons is investigated by nonadiabatic wave packet simulations. We show that the preferential breaking of the stronger C-Cl bond (alpha to the excited carbonyl) over the weaker C-Br bond (beta) {{could be explained by}} a diabatic trapping or nonadiabatic recrossing as previously proposed. Our energy resolved flux analysis agrees fairly well with the experimental branching ratio (C-Cl:C-Br= 1. 0 : 0. 4). Even if this does not prove the mechanism, this at least prevents to discard it. A reduced dimensionality approach based on constrained Hamiltonian is used. The nonadiabatic dissociation is studied in the two C-O/C-X (X=Br, Cl) subspaces to emphasize the role of the C-O vibration upon [n(O) [...] >pi(CO) *] excitation. The internal torsion and wagging dihedral angles are frozen at their Franck-Condon value, according to preliminary dynamical tests. The other inactive coordinates are optimized at the trans and C-s constrained geometry {{in the first}} excited state. Corresponding 2 D cuts in the potential energy surfaces have been computed at the CASSCF level. The nonadiabatic kinetic couplings are highly peaked along an avoided <b>crossing</b> <b>seam</b> in both cases. A two-state diabatic model with a constant potential coupling is proposed in the two C-O/C-X subspaces. The inclusion of the C-O stretching in the active coordinates improves the value of the branching ratio over our previous 1 D computation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the theoretical {{development and implementation}} of a second-oider description of conical intersections. Several novel methodologies are presented and new aspects of the field are discussed. The conditions leading to a Born-Oppenheimer failure are outlined and a general formulation ofthe second-order description of conical intersections is introduced. Topological features of the two crossing potential energy hypersurfaces are investigated, and an analytical description of the crossing energy is proposed. This formulation yields an analytical definition ofthe intersection-space seam energy Hessian. A set of examples is then presented to demonstrate the applicability of the intersection-space frequency analysis to photochemical and Jahn-Teller problems. The definition of an intersection-space Hessian has allowed us to develop a new and more efficient conical intersection optimization algorithm. Aspects of its implementation and performance on different <b>crossing</b> <b>seams</b> are discussed in detail. As a consequence of using a better defined Hessian, a smother and faster convergence is achieved. Moreover, the possibility of optimizing saddle points on the crossing hyperline is also investigated. A novel algorithm to compute the minimum energy coordinate within the space of intersection is presented. This coordinate connects three points uniquely within the intersection space: two minima through a saddle point. The efficiency ofthe algorithm has been analysed and its possible applications to photochemical problems are discussed. Finally, a new methodology to select the relevant modes in a photochemical reaction is described, which exploits the second-order description of conical intersections. Theoretical predictions are shown to be consistent with dynamics studies on the internal conversions of ketene and benzene. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Potential energy surfaces (PESs) play essential {{roles in the}} study of chemical dynamics. The adiabatic ground-state PES of N 4 was constructed with permutationally invariant polynomials and is suitable for treating high-energy vibrational-rotational energy transfer and collision-induced dissociation in N 2 -N 2 collisions. Our adiabatic PES reproduces the ab initio data well but adiabatic surface fitting is not designed to reproduce the cuspidal ridges at state crossings. This motivates working with the diabatic representation for the photodissociation where state <b>crossing</b> <b>seams</b> are key global features. Diabatic representations are also very convenient for fitting state couplings. A new diabatization scheme based on complete-active-space self-consistent-field diabatic molecular orbitals and the fourfold way was proposed to obtain smooth diabatic potentials and couplings at the multi-configurational quasi-degenerate perturbation theory level of electronic structure theory. The new scheme has been used to study the photodissociation of phenol in which three electronic states are involved. A new method for fitting global potential energy surfaces of multi-dimensional reactive systems was developed and is called the anchor points reactive potential (APRP) scheme. The full-dimensional 3 x 3 matrix of diabatic potential energy surfaces and couplings for the nonadiabatic photodissociation of phenol was constructed with the APRP method. Multidimensional tunneling calculations through the barrier on the shoulder of the conical intersection of the S 1 and S 2 states of phenol suggest the adiabatic nature of the early dynamics of phenol photodissociation and the importance of tunneling in the photodissociation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the hybrid method ONIOM {{is applied to}} {{computing}} the reaction pathways and vibrational modes of molecules embedded within complex environments. ONIOM combines different levels of theory in order to treat the most chemically important regions of the molecule at a sufficiently high level of theory, while simultaneously including the steric and electronic effects of {{the remainder of the}} molecule such that the calculation remains affordable. Normal mode analysis also allows characterisation of critical points located on the Potential Energy Surface (PES). While the ONIOM PES is well defined for a given combination of theories, this does not ensure that the PESs for each individual level of theory are qualitatively the same. In cases where they differ this may cause the curvature of the ONIOM PES to be sensitive to method combinations and ONIOM partitioning. We present a method for analysing the ONIOM Hessian to indicate where such situations occur. The ONIOM method is then applied to computing vibrational modes of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). This enhances interpretation of spectra obtained from time-resolved femtosecond spectroscopy. ONIOM(QM:MM) reduces the cost associated with assembly of the Hessian matrix and reformulation of the CPHF equations enables inclusion of the environment electronic effect in the normal mode analysis. This has been used to understand how chromophore vibrational modes are modified through covalent and hydrogen bonding, transition dipole coupling, accidental degeneracy and the vibrational Stark effect. In the final application, ONIOM(CAS:MM) models how the protein environment of the Photoactive Yellow Protein (PYP) modifies reaction pathways. The protein enhances trans-cis isomerization compared to vacuum. ONIOM allows separate analysis of the steric and electronic roles of the protein environment and reveals that the steric effect disfavoured the gas-phase pathway while the electronic environment allows the alternative pathway to directly access the intersection <b>crossing</b> <b>seam.</b> Open Acces...|$|R
