5|$|Most of the {{buildings}} on Mackinac Island are built of wood, a few are of stone, and most have <b>clapboard</b> siding. The architectural styles on the island span 300 years, from the earliest Native American structures to the styles of the 19th century. The earliest structures were built by the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe (Chippewa) tribes before European exploration. At least two buildings still exist from the original French settlement in the late 18th century. Mackinac Island has the only example of northern French rustic architecture in the United States, and one of few survivors in North America.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Roxboro House {{date back}} to 1799. The Georgian period house {{constructed}} of frame and <b>clapboard</b> was expanded in 1810. At one point in its history, Roxboro House was owned by Dr. Caspar Wistar who published the first American textbook of anatomy in 1811. Wistar {{was president of the}} American Philosophical Society and his friend, Thomas Nuttall, a famous botanist, named the Wisteria vine after him. In 1965 the Philadelphia Historical Commission added this house to its list of registered buildings (No. 141). Prior to the University's purchase of the property in 1998, the house was being used as a bed and breakfast establishment.|$|E
5|$|Robert Mark Realty {{bought the}} former station in 1986 and renovated it {{at a cost}} of $175,000. Work began in October 1987 and was more than halfway done by January 1988. Matt Bialecki, the {{architect}} who had overseen the renovation of the former New Paltz opera house as a restaurant, served as the project's architect. Wilro Builders served as the contractor. The building's design follows a Shingle Style architecture and its sidings are both shingle and <b>clapboard.</b> There are bay windows on the east and west faces, and rafters are partly visible.

5|$|The Danebod Gym Hall {{was erected}} in 1904 {{and is a}} {{cruciform}} <b>clapboard</b> building. The {{two sides of the}} entrance arm project forward to the eaves, and the sides plus a small roof enclose the entrance. It was originally built as a space for Danish gymnastics, folk dancing, music, theatrical performances, larger social gatherings, and worship for the Folk School students and other locals. Every year in the Gym Hall, the Danebod Lutheran Church upholds the Danish tradition of dancing around the Christmas tree. The basement is also commonly used for crafts such as stained glass and woodworking. In 1928 it was enlarged with a stage, basement and furnace. Many home talent plays were presented there, and it is still used for an occasional play, and is also used by the camps and retreats for folk dancing. Points of interest are the statue with an original canvas curtain with advertising, bars used years ago by gymnasts (on the south wall), and the original wainscoting on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod Lutheran Church (also {{known as}} the Cross Church at Danebod) was {{dedicated}} Sunday, June 16, 1895. It is a cruciform <b>clapboard</b> building with a square placed obliquely in the center. The tower in the middle is carried at a 45 degree angle to {{the arms of the}} cross. The outside and interior detailing of the church is Eastlake. It was built largely with volunteer labor and money pledged by the early settlers, who had little to give. Points of interest include the altar chairs, kerosene lamps, architectural structure, wainscoting walls and ceiling, porthole windows as in a ship, hand-carving on the altar, pulpit and railing, the candelabra and altar cloth, hand-carved stone baptismal font, the Star of Bethlehem in the ceiling, Bertel Thorvaldsen's statue of Christ, the Celtic cross, and pictures in the narthex. The church is located at 101 Danebod Court. The church was established by the organization that later became the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (DELCA). This organization later merged into the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) in 1962 and then into the largest Lutheran church in the U.S. in 1988: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Danebod Lutheran Church remains a part of the ELCA still today.|$|E

25|$|The {{house is}} a simple two-room {{structure}} with a central chimney. Its framework is composed of a dozen heavy so-called H-bents, visible on {{the interior of the}} house, that resemble goal posts with diagonal braces. This is an ancient northern European method of construction that contrasts with the boxlike house frames that evolved in England. The house had a high-pitched roof that created a large loft for storage. The roof was covered with shingles, and the exterior walls were clad with horizontal wood <b>clapboard</b> siding. A section of the <b>clapboard</b> has been removed at one corner to expose a reconstruction of the brick nogging used as insulation. The interior walls were stuccoed between the upright supports of the H-bents.|$|E
