40|$|ABSTRACT: Road safety {{has become}} a major social issue with the number of cars and trucks {{increasing}} day by day. This project focuses on development of a <b>crash</b> warning and <b>avoidance</b> system that monitors the environment of the vehicle constantly and assisting the driver in avoiding a collision. This idea targets a low cost, retrofit scheme which can be used in Indian roads to prevent the worst case scenarios in road crashes. This system incorporates an ARM based processing unit running RTOS which uses a camera to detect a crash scenario and send control signals to corresponding Electronic Control Units. I...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{large sample}} of U. S. firms {{for the period}} 1995 - 2008, we provide strong and robust {{evidence}} that corporate tax avoidance is positively associated with firm-specific stock price crash risk. This {{finding is consistent with}} the following view: Tax avoidance facilitates managerial rent extraction and bad news hoarding activities for extended periods by providing tools, masks, and justifications for these opportunistic behaviors. The hoarding and accumulation of bad news for extended periods lead to stock price crashes when the accumulated hidden bad news crosses a tipping point, and thus comes out all at once. Moreover, we show that the positive relation between tax <b>avoidance</b> and <b>crash</b> risk is attenuated when firms have strong external monitoring mechanisms such as high institutional ownership, high analyst coverage, and greater takeover threat from corporate control markets.

At present there are several works regarding pre <b>crash</b> detection & <b>avoidance</b> system from obstacle. But we are lacking to priorities crash with human or animals compared to obstacles. What would be the situation when a system has to choose between human and obstacles? If the system is unable to detect human {{then there is a}} probability to hit humans instead of obstacles. To solve this problem in this work we have priorities humans or animals first. Car will avoid human or animal first then if possible it will try to avoid obstacles also.

Aims: To explore the: (1) self-reported compliance of drivers with road rules regarding substance-impaired driving and other risky driving behaviours (e. g., speeding, driving while tired), one year after progression from a Learner to a Provisional (intermediate) licence; and (2) interrelationships between substance-impaired driving and other risky driving behaviours (e. g., crashes, offences, and Police avoidance). Methods: Drivers (n = 1076; 319 males) aged 18 - 20 years were surveyed regarding their sociodemographics (age, gender) and self-reported driving behaviours including <b>crashes,</b> offences, Police <b>avoidance,</b> and driving intentions. Results: A relatively small proportion of participants reported driving after taking drugs (6. 3 % of males, 1. 3 % of females) and drinking alcohol (18. 5 % of males, 11. 8 % of females). In comparison, a considerable proportion of participants reported at least occasionally exceeding speed limits (86. 7 % of novices), and risky behaviours like driving when tired (83. 6 % of novices). Substance-impaired driving was associated with avoiding Police, speeding, risky driving intentions, and self-reported crashes and offences. Forty-three percent of respondents who drove after taking drugs also reported alcohol-impaired driving. Discussion and Conclusions: Behaviours of concern include drink driving, speeding, novice driving errors such as misjudging the speed of oncoming vehicles, violations of graduated driver licensing passenger restrictions, driving tired, driving faster if in a bad mood, and active punishment avoidance. Given the interrelationships between the risky driving behaviours, a deeper understanding of influential factors is required to inform targeted and general countermeasure implementation and evaluation during this critical driving period. Notwithstanding this, a combination of enforcement, education, and engineering efforts appear necessary to improve the road safety of the young novice driver, and for the drink-driving young novice driver in particular.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{propensity}} of drivers to engage in <b>crash</b> <b>avoidance</b> maneuvers in relation to driver attributes, critical events, crash characteristics, vehicles involved, road characteristics and environmental attributes. Five alternative actions involving emergency lateral and speed control maneuvers are considered: “no avoidance maneuvers”, “braking”, “steering”, “braking & steering”, and “other maneuvers”. The importance of avoidance maneuvers derives from the key role of responsible, proactive and state-aware road users within the concept of sustainable safety systems, {{as well as from}} the key role of the ability of drivers to perform effective corrective maneuvers for the success of automated in-vehicle warning and driver assistance systems. The analysis is conducted by means of a mixed logit model that accommodates correlations across alternatives and heteroscedasticity. Data for the analysis are retrieved from the General Estimates System (GES) crash database for the year 2009. Results show that (i) the nature of the critical event that made the crash imminent influences the choice of <b>crash</b> <b>avoidance</b> maneuvers, (ii) women and elderly have a lower propensity to conduct <b>crash</b> <b>avoidance</b> maneuvers, (iii) fatigue and distractions have a greater negative impact on the tendency to engage in <b>crash</b> <b>avoidance</b> maneuvers than alcohol consumption, (iv) difficult road conditions increase the propensity to perform <b>crash</b> <b>avoidance</b> maneuvers, (v) visual obstruction and artificial illumination have an adverse effect on the probability to carry on <b>crash</b> <b>avoidance</b> maneuvers, and (vi) the combination “braking & steering” is more closely related to “steering” than “braking”...|$|E
