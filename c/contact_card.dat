Later that day he sees Sienna being hassled by DS Gavin Armstrong (Andrew Hayden-Smith) in the street, Warren confronts DS Armstrong, telling him to back off. Warren realises the police are turning on Sienna and fears they will twist the evidence {{in an attempt to}} fit the murder of Patrick on her. He organises false two passports for them both to leave the country, he tells Sienna to prepare to flee later that evening. After parting with Sienna, Warren bumps into Joel. Warren asks him whether he is working with Ryan to which Joel denies. Warren tell's Joel that Maxine is pregnant and informs him she is his ex-girlfriend, Mitzeee's, sister and that Maxine could go to prison over her involvement in the burial of Patrick's body. Joel reveals he overheard Warren organising false passports and warns him that he needs to stay around for his and Maxine's baby, he tells Warren if he leaves with Sienna, he'll be a criminal {{for the rest of his}} life. Joel leaves and Warren goes to meet his contact to collect the passports, Sienna calls him in a panic, advising him they need to leave immediately, however Warren has a change of heart and tells Sienna he needs to be a dad and stay in Hollyoaks. Sienna is wrongfully imprisoned for Patrick's murder. Maxine tells Warren that the baby is Adam's so he finds out from hospital that the baby is his so he is determined to be a father again but Maxine is accidentally locked in the hospital lift by Nico and Peri thinking it is Cameron she later loses the baby and Warren overhears Nico on the phone to Peri so he angrily confronts her panicked Nico tells Warren it was Cameron who did it so Warren nicks Leelas phone and he locks him and Cameron in the lift telling Cameron he has hurt Leela and Warren then attacks him but Maxine stops him, Maxine later finds out it was Nico and tells Warren and also tells Warren about Carly Bradley and Trevor Royle and that she thinks Sienna Is covering up for Patrick the two later go to see Sienna and Warren tells her he knows everything Nico has done Sienna refuses to retract her statement in till Warren tells he she changes it or he will go after her himself Sienna gets out and the two try to sort things out and she gets a phone call off Peri tellIng Sienna Tom is in danger so Warren goes to find him with the help of Sienna worried for Sienna's safety Warren tells her to go home and he will find Tom instead later the maze is set on fire and Warren realises Sienna is in there so he runs in and sees Sienna is stuck and Nico he faces a choice but despite Sienna pleading to save Nico Warren instead decides to save her, not Nico, due to his revenge for killing his and Maxine unborn baby and they get out as the Maze collapses killing Nico.|$|E

30|$|The eyelets in {{the model}} {{represent}} the uppermost eyelet of each carrier whilst the forming ring was modelled as a fully constrained part. The normal distance of the moving eyelets to the fixed eyelet was constant for all simulations. All the eyelets and the forming ring had an inner radius of 7 mm and were modelled using solid elements with a minimum element length of 1.8 mm at its inner diameter. The yarns were 700 mm long and modelled with beam elements having a length of 1.5 mm. The beams were modelled using the Hughes-Liu element formulation (Hughes and Liu 1981 a;), with a 2 x 2 Gauss quadrature. Although this setup would introduce bending stiffness to the beam elements, the length-to-diameter ratio would make the bending stiffness very small {{with respect to the}} axial stiffness. Moreover, this approach resulted in more robust handling of beam-to-beam and beam-to-solid contact compared to using the same beams with only one integration point through the thickness. The aspect ratio between different types of elements close to one was found the best in dealing with the contact between yarn and eyelet during the braiding process. Yarn-to-yarn and yarn-to-eyelet contact were defined among all parts in the LS-Dyna <b>contact</b> <b>card.</b> The static (FS) and dynamic (FD) coefficient of friction amongst the yarns were defined as 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, whilst the FS and FD among the yarns and the eyelets were both 0.1.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} and synthesise {{the findings from}} all randomised controlled trials that have examined the effectiveness of treatments of patients who have deliberately harmed themselves. Design: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of psychosocial and physical treatments. Studies categorised according to type of treatment. When {{there was more than}} one investigation in a particular category a summary odds ratio was estimated with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Setting: Randomised trials available in electronic databases in 1996, in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register in 1997, and from hand searching of journals to 1997. Subjects: Patients who had deliberately harmed themselves shortly before entry into the trials with information on repetition of behaviour. The included trials comprised 2452 randomised participants with outcome data. Main outcome measure: Repetition of self harm. Results: 20 trials reported repetition of self harm as an outcome variable, classified into 10 categories. Summary odds ratio (all for comparison with standard aftercare) indicated reduced repetition for problem solving therapy (0. 73; 95 % confidence interval 0. 45 to 1. 18) and for provision of an emergency <b>contact</b> <b>card</b> in addition to standard care (0. 45; 0. 19 to 1. 07). The summary odds ratios were 0. 83 (0. 61 to 1. 14) for trials of intensive aftercare plus outreach and 1. 19 (0. 53 to 2. 67) for antidepressant treatment compared with placebo. Significantly reduced rates of further self harm were observed for depot flupenthixol versus placebo in multiple repeaters (0. 09; 0. 02 to 0. 50) and for dialectical behaviour therapy versus standard aftercare (0. 24; 0. 06 to 0. 93).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lifestyle and {{behaviour}} change are {{important factors in}} the prevention of cardiovascular disease and reduction of premature mortality. Public health initiatives have focused on opportunities for healthcare staff to deliver lifestyle advice routinely in primary and secondary care but there is no consistent approach to onward referrals and the rate of uptake of advice remains low. We do not know if advice is more effective in supporting behaviour change when a systematic approach is taken that includes identification of barriers to change, directing patients toward services, referral to services, and feedback on outcome. METHODS AND DESIGN: This is a single-centre, randomized, unblinded feasibility trial in an acute hospital setting which aims to assess the feasibility of a definitive trial and provide proof of concept for the systematic delivery of individualized lifestyle advice in patients managed through an acute cardiology in-patient service. Patients will be recruited before discharge and randomized to two groups. A control group will receive the usual lifestyle assessment and referral, while an intervention group will receive the usual assessment plus the new individualized lifestyle assessment and referral. The new assessment will inform assignment of each patient to one of three categories based on personal barriers to change. Patients may be referred to a formal lifestyle-change programme, through the 'Leeds Let's Change' website, or they may be guided in self-management, using goal setting, or they may be assigned to a 'deferment' category, for reassessment at follow-up. These latter patients will be given a <b>contact</b> <b>card</b> for the 'Leeds Let's Change' service. DISCUSSION: Lifestyle change is an important mechanism for improving health and wellbeing across the population but there are widely acknowledged difficulties in addressing lifestyle factors with patients and supporting behaviour change. A systematic approach to assessment would facilitate audit and provide an indicator of the quality of care. The new assessment template has been designed to be quick and easy to use in practice and could, for example, be added to a primary care consultation or form part of a nursing discharge assessment in an acute setting.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{possible}} existence of the repeat phenomenon in police motor vehicle stops. Design/methodology/approach – The study involved a mid-western police department. Data were collected from <b>contact</b> <b>cards</b> completed by police officers making motor vehicle stops between July 1, 2001 and December 31, 2001. <b>Contact</b> <b>cards</b> included information concerning the stop itself, driver, passengers, motor vehicle, and the officer making the stop. Individual identifiers of police officers allowed for an analysis of individual officer performance concerning motor vehicle stops. A Poisson process and logistic regression {{were used in the}} analysis. Findings – Analyses revealed that motor vehicle stops are not randomly distributed across police officers and, in fact, a significant concentration of motor vehicle stops among few officers existed. Situational variables such as reason for the stop and time of the stop were significant predictors of high-performing officers. Research limitations/implications – Limitations of the results include an immeasurable bias due to officers 2 ̆ 7 discretion in completing <b>contact</b> <b>cards</b> for every motor vehicle stop, lack of external validity due to the specific circumstances surrounding the data collection, and the ‘time window effect’. Future research should focus on neighborhood level data collection, ‘hot spots’ for motor vehicle stops, the existence of high-performing (repeat) officers in field (pedestrian) stops, potential differences in racial disparity of motor vehicle stops across high- and low-performing officers. Practical implications – The results of this study may offer insights into personnel and deployment practices based on officer performance. Originality/value – This study is one of few on officer performance that included individual identifiers of police officers. This unique aspect of the data allowed for the analysis of a little-researched area: officer productivity in motor vehicle stops...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} and synthesise {{the findings from}} all randomised controlled trials that have examined the effectiveness of treatments of patients who have deliberately harmed themselves. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases screened: MEDLINE (from 1966 -February 1999); PsycLit (from 1974 -March 1999); Embase (from 1980 -January 1999); The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) No. 1 1999. Ten journals {{in the field of}} psychiatry and psychology were hand searched for the first version of this review. We have updated the hand search of three specialist journals in the field of suicidal research until the end of 1998. Reference lists of papers were checked and trialists contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs of psychosocial and/or psychopharmacological treatment versus standard or less intensive types of aftercare for patients who shortly before entering a study engaged in any type of deliberately initiated self-poisoning or self-injury, both of which are generally subsumed under the term deliberate self-harm. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from the original reports independently by two reviewers. Studies were categorized according to type of treatment. The outcome measure used to assess the efficacy of treatment interventions for deliberate self-harm was the rate of repeated suicidal behaviour. We have been unable to examine other outcome measures as originally planned (e. g. compliance with treatment, depression, hopelessness, suicidal ideation/thoughts, change in problems/problem resolution). MAIN RESULTS: A total of 23 trials were identified in which repetition of deliberate self-harm was reported as an outcome variable. The trials were classified into 11 categories. The summary odds ratio indicated a trend towards reduced repetition of deliberate self-harm for problem-solving therapy compared with standard aftercare (0. 70; 0. 45 to 1. 11) and for provision of an emergency <b>contact</b> <b>card</b> in addition to standard care compared with standard aftercare alone (0. 45; 0. 19 to 1. 07). The summary odds ratio for trials of intensive aftercare plus outreach compared with standard aftercare was 0. 83 (0. 61 to 1. 14), and for antidepressant treatment compared with placebo was 0. 83 (0. 47 to 1. 48). The remainder of the comparisons were in single small trials. Significantly reduced rates of further self-harm were observed for depot flupenthixol vs. placebo in multiple repeaters (0. 09; 0. 02 to 0. 50), and for dialectical behaviour therapy vs. standard aftercare (0. 24; 0. 06 to 0. 93). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There still remains considerable uncertainty about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments of self-harm patients are most effective, inclusion of insufficient numbers of patients in trials being the main limiting factor. There is a need for larger trials of treatments associated with trends towards reduced rates of repetition of deliberate self-harm. The results of small single trials which have been associated with statistically significant reductions in repetition must be interpreted with caution and it is desirable that such trials are also replicated...|$|E
