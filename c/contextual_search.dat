40|$|Purpose: When using a {{computerised}} {{index of}} words originating {{from a large}} collection of radiological reports, users tend to encounter a human-computer language barrier. This obstacle arises whenever a complex query cannot be adequately formulated in the language required by the computer interface. This study seeks to alleviate this interface problem. Methods and Materials: Since its conception in 2004, the indexing system developed at the Ghent University Hospital covers 130 million words originating from 2 million reports. The index contains 350, 000 unique words and results are typically returned within 31 ms. To counter the problems related to complex queries, we educated the users regarding basic search engine features: word grouping, wildcards, and binary logic. We also implemented word stemming in four European languages, automatic rewriting of queries for common synonyms, and <b>contextual</b> <b>searching.</b> Results: Following education, users started to pick up search engine features: phrases (3. 0 %), wildcards (2. 9 %), binary operator “and” (4. 6 %), “not” (1. 7 %), “or” (1. 2 %), and parentheses (0. 6 %). Both the word stemming and the automatic inclusion of synonyms received positive feedback. However, only administrators used <b>contextual</b> <b>searching</b> because of the composite syntax. Conclusion: The search engine features we implemented helped to move the interface language barrier away from our users.

5000|$|The {{basic form}} of <b>contextual</b> <b>search</b> {{is the process}} of {{scanning}} the full-text of a query in order to understand what the user needs. Web search engines scan HTML pages for content and return an index rating based on how relevant the content is to the entered query. HTML pages that have a higher occurrence of query keywords within their content are not rated higher. Users have limited control over the context of their query based on the words they use to search with. [...] For example, users looking for the menu portion of a website can add “menu” to the end of their query to provide the search engine with context of what they need. The next step in contextualizing search is for the search service itself to request information that narrows down the results, such as Google asking for a time range to search within.|$|E
40|$|Search engines such as Google {{function}} {{by matching}} key {{words in a}} query to occurrences found in target web pages. However, this approach will not always yield results the user intended. For example, ?Vinh Nghiem? coincidentally {{is the name of}} a famous pagoda in Vietnam and also the author of this work. Since the pagoda is so popular, search engines naturally rank web pages related to it higher than those of the person. Furthermore, a Google search for ?Vinh Nghiem in the context of person? would be inadequate since most web pages that do fit this context would not actually contain the word 'person'. I propose a novel approach for <b>contextual</b> <b>search,</b> using mutual information and lexico-syntactic patterns, and I have performed a human subject study to test the efficacy of this approach. Results on <b>contextual</b> <b>search</b> queries have been highly promising, with precision and recall rates both over 94 %, compared to Google?'s precision and recall rates of under 55 %.

This paper presents Y!Q—a {{first of its kind}} large-scale <b>contextual</b> <b>search</b> system—and provides an overview of its system design and architecture. Y!Q solves two major problems. First, how to capture high quality search context. Second, how to use that context in a way to improve the relevancy of search queries. To address the first problem, Y!Q introduces an information widget that captures precise search context and provides convenient access to its functionality at the point of inspiration. For example, Y!Q can be easily embedded into web pages using a web API, or it can be integrated into a web browser toolbar. This paper provides an overview of Y!Q’s user interaction design, highlighting its novel aspects for capturing high quality search context. To address the second problem, Y!Q uses a semantic network for analyzing search context, possibly resolving ambiguous terms, and generating a contextual digest comprising its key concepts. This digest is passed through a query planner and rewriting framework for augmenting a user’s search query with relevant context terms to improve the overall search relevancy and experience. We show experimental results comparing contextual Y!Q search results sideby-side with regular Yahoo! web search results. This evaluation suggests that Y!Q results are considered significantly more relevant.

40|$|In robotics, lower-level {{controllers}} {{are typically}} {{used to make}} the robot solve a specific task in a fixed context. For example, the lower-level controller can encode a hitting movement while the context defines the target coordinates to hit. However, in many learning problems the context may change between task executions. To adapt the policy to a new context, we utilize a hierarchical approach by learning an upper-level policy that generalizes the lower-level controllers to new contexts. A common approach to learn such upper-level policies is to use policy search. However, the majority of current <b>contextual</b> policy <b>search</b> approaches are model-free and require a high number of interactions with the robot and its environment. Model-based approaches are known to significantly reduce the amount of robot experiments, however, current model-based techniques cannot be applied straightforwardly to the problem of learning contextual upper-level policies. They rely on specific parametrizations of the policy and the reward function, which are often unrealistic in the <b>contextual</b> policy <b>search</b> formulation. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based <b>contextual</b> policy <b>search</b> algorithm that is able to generalize lower-level controllers, and is data-efficient.

Bayesian optimization approaches to <b>contextual</b> policy <b>search</b> (CPS) offer data-efficient policy learning that generalize over a context space. We propose to improve data- efficiency by factoring typically considered contexts into two components: target- type contexts that correspond to a desired outcome of the learned behavior, e. g. target position for throwing a ball; and environment type contexts that correspond to some state of the environment, e. g. initial ball position or wind speed.

40|$|Contextual {{information}} retrieval (CIR) {{is a critical}} technique for today’s search engines in terms of facilitating queries and returning relevant information. Despite its importance, little {{progress has been made}} in its application, due to the difficulty of capturing and representing contextual information about users. This thesis details the development and evaluation of the <b>contextual</b> SERL <b>search,</b> designed to tackle some of the challenges associated with CIR from the World Wide Web. The <b>contextual</b> SERL <b>search</b> utilises a rich contextual model that exploits implicit and explicit data to modify queries to more accurately reflect the user’s interests as well as to continually build the user’s contextual profile and a shared contextual knowledge base. These profiles are used to filter results from a standard search engine to improve the relevance of the pages displayed to the user. The <b>contextual</b> SERL <b>search</b> has been tested in an observational study that has captured both qualitative and quantitative data about the ability of the framework to improve the user’s web search experience. A total of 30 subjects, with different levels of search experience, participated in the observational study experiment. The results demonstrate that when the contextual profile and the shared contextual knowledge base are used, the <b>contextual</b> SERL <b>search</b> improves search effectiveness, efficiency and subjective satisfaction. The effectiveness improves as subjects have actually entered fewer queries to reach the target information in comparison to the contemporary search engine. In the case of a particularly complex search task, the efficiency improves as subjects have browsed fewer hits, visited fewer URLs, made fewer clicks and have taken less time to reach the target information when compared to the contemporary search engine. Finally, subjects have expressed a higher degree of satisfaction on the quality of contextual support when using the shared contextual knowledge base in comparison to using their contextual profile. These results suggest that integration of a user’s contextual factors and information seeking behaviours are very important for successful development of the CIR framework.
