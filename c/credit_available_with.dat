To construct the lock, 9.1 million m3 of earth was excavated, and 22,000 tonnes of structural steel, three times the amount required to build the Eiffel Tower.

5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and <b>credits</b> <b>available</b> to taxpayers <b>with</b> the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|R
30|$|Increasing {{subsidies}} (SER) with {{no credit}} availability: In the simulations that assumed no <b>credit</b> was <b>available,</b> but <b>with</b> a compensatory increase in subsidy {{at the highest}} (Malawian) level (also Fig.  3), the probability of adoption increased in all cases except in Malawi where credit availability was eliminated but SER was unchanged, leading {{to a reduction in}} probability of adoption from 34 to 31 %. The high levels of SER more than made up for the lack of credit. As a suggestion for policy or future research, a more specific policy would provide subsidies for the adoption of MTM, especially as the adoption of MTM can be considered to infer social benefits in terms of better environmental impacts such as soil loss mitigation and reduction of pollution from soil erosion.|$|R
50|$|Though all {{unique in}} term structure, {{each of these}} three {{financing}} instruments - two pure and one hybrid - were at risk of failure. The 12 year fully amortizing mortgage was perhaps the best option, but represented a substantial monthly obligation for the retail borrower even in the status quo, and thus an unmeetable one {{in the event of an}} acute economic crisis. The Philadelphia Plan and the pure 5-year balloon mortgage both presented the borrower with a lesser monthly obligation, but were predicated upon the assumption of freely <b>available</b> <b>credit</b> <b>with</b> which to refinance the principal at maturity which exposed them to substantial risk of default under an acute financial crisis characterized by tightening credit.|$|R

40|$|Good afternoon. My name is Peter Tatian and I am {{a senior}} {{researcher}} in the Urban Institute’s Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center. I {{am happy to}} provide this testimony on subprime and predatory mortgage lending {{with the hope that}} it will be useful to the Council in its consideration of measures needed to protect homeowner equity. Subprime vs. Predatory Lending Subprime loans are those that have higher costs (such as higher interest rates) than prime loans. Subprime loans are designed for applicants with poor credit histories, high loan-to-home-value ratios, or other credit risk characteristics that would disqualify them from lower cost, prime-rate loans. Subprime lending has made <b>credit</b> <b>available</b> to households <b>with</b> low incomes or credit scores that would not allow them to qualify for prime-rate loans. Nevertheless, as is now becoming all too clear, subprime lending can be detrimental if borrowers who take out higher-cost loans later have difficulty repaying them and risk defaulting on those loans. We do not have any local data on defaults for subprime loans, but national data suggest that {{is likely to be a}} growing problem. As reported in this morning’s Washington Post, the number of subprime borrowers who missed payments climbed to a four-year high and the number of foreclosures on all homes jumped to its highest level in nearly four decades...|$|R

It builds up a simple theoretical approach based on specific assumptions on entrepreneurial choice intended for sources of credit as investment to their house-based industries and thus evaluates the theoretical frame-work to a self-surveyed data set. It is empirically tested that the decision of the entrepreneurs is formed, basically, by the interaction between the cost of access to formal credit and the relative efficiency of formal and informal lending mechanisms. Institutional credit can’t be effectively served until and unless a proper interlinked credit policy coupled with default management strategies, flexible terms and conditions along with wide branch networks sets up...|$|R

Non-partisan analyses of Romney’s tax plan estimated that it could have added more than $3 trillion to the federal deficit, and would have favored the highest-earning Americans, possibly raising annual taxes on middle-class earners by as much as $2,000. Romney and supporters of his tax plan said that such analyses were unreliable because they were based on assumptions about specific measures that were not detailed in the plan and because they had not adequately accounted for the positive effects on economic growth that Romney said his plan would generate. And that lower tax rates would lower rates of Tax evasion.|$|R
