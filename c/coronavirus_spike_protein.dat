The HR 1 helices form an exceptionally long (120 Å) internal coiled coil stabilized by hydrophobic and polar interactions. A striking arrangement of conserved asparagine and glutamine residues of HR 1 propagates from two central chloride ions, providing hydrogen-bonding “zippers” that strongly constrain the path of the HR 2 main chain, forcing it to adopt an extended conformation at either end of a short HR 2 α-helix...|$|E

Whereas sialic acid is the only receptor determinant known so far for IBV, TGEV requires interaction with its receptor aminopeptidase N to initiate infection of cells. Binding tests with soluble <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> carrying an IgG Fc-tag revealed pronounced differences between these two viral proteins. Binding of the IBV <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> to host cells was in all experiments sialic acid dependent, whereas the soluble TGEV spike showed binding to APN but had no detectable sialic acid binding activity.

40|$|Proteolytic {{cleavage}} of <b>Coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> at {{the appropriate}} time and location results in efficient virus entry activation. Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), specifically, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS 2) when expressed on target cells, enhance SARS coronavirus entry by activating spike cleavage. This study investigated the effect of TTSPs expressed in Coronavirus producer cells. Murine Hepatitis Virus strain A 59 (MHV A 59) viruses produced in the absence of TMPRSS 2 required target cell protease activity - either cell surface serine proteases or endosomal acidophilic proteases - for entry. MHV A 59 viruses produced in the presence of TMPRSS 2 were less infectious overall, but a portion of the viruses contained 2 ̆ 2 pre-primed 2 ̆ 2 Spikes and were activated for entry in the absence of target cell protease activity.

Chemical cross-linking and sedimentation experiments showed that the spike of transmissible gastroenteritis virus is a homotrimer of the S membrane glycoprotein. The spike protein was synthesized as a 175, 000 -apparent-molecular-weight (175 K) monomer subunit that is sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Assembly of monomers into a trimeric structure was found to occur on a partially trimmed polypeptide {{and to be a}} rate-limiting step, since large amounts of monomers failed to trimerize 1 h after completion of synthesis. Terminal glycosylation of newly assembled trimers, resulting in the biosynthesis of three 220 K oligomers, occurred with a half time of approximately 20 min. Monomeric (230 K to 240 K) processed forms were also observed in cells and in virions. The 175 K monomeric form expressed four major antigenic sites previously localized within the amino-terminal half of the S polypeptide chain; however, two classes of trimer-restricted epitopes (borne by three 220 K and/or three 175 K oligomers) were identified.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{potential}} of using non-human coronaviruses for cancer therapy, we first established their ability to kill human tumor cells. We found that the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and a felinized murine hepatitis virus (fMHV), both normally incapable of infecting human cells, could rapidly and effectively kill human cancer cells artificially expressing the feline coronavirus receptor aminopeptidase N. Also 3 -D multilayer tumor spheroids established from such cells were effectively eradicated. Next, we investigated whether FIPV and fMHV could be targeted to human cancer cells by constructing a bispecific single-chain antibody directed {{on the one hand}} against the feline <b>coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> [...] responsible for receptor binding and subsequent cell entry through virus-cell membrane fusion [...] {{and on the other hand}} against the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The targeting antibody mediated specific infection of EGFR-expressing human cancer cells by both coronaviruses. Furthermore, in the presence of the targeting antibody, infected cancer cells formed syncytia typical of productive coronavirus infection. By their potent cytotoxicity, the selective targeting of non-human coronaviruses to human cancer cells provides a rationale for further investigations into the use of these viruses as anticancer agents...|$|E

40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly emergent virus {{responsible for}} a worldwide epidemic in 2003. The <b>coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> belong to class I fusion proteins, and are characterized by the existence of two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR 1 and HR 2. The HR 1 region in coronaviruses is predicted to be considerably longer than that in other type I virus fusion proteins. Therefore the exact binding sequence to HR 2 from the HR 1 is not clear. In this study, we defined the region of HR 1 that binds to HR 2 {{by a series of}} biochemical and biophysical measures. Subsequently the defined HR 1 (902 − 952) and HR 2 (1145 − 1184) chains, which are different from previously defined binding regions, were linked together by a flexible linker to form a single-chain construct, 2 -Helix. This protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and forms a typical six-helix coiled coil bundle. Highly conserved HR regions between mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> suggest a similar three-dimensional structure for the two fusion cores.

To delineate the amino acid sequences involved in receptor-binding activity, we have compared the S 1 N(330) proteins of seven different mouse hepatitis virus MHV strains that are able to utilize the MHV receptor protein. Three conserved regions (sites I, II, and III) were found to consist of more than 10 identical amino acids, and they were analyzed for receptor-binding activity by site-directed mutagenesis. S 1 N(330) with a substitution at position 62 from the N terminus of S 1 in region I and that with substitutions at positions 212, 214, and 216 in region II showed no receptor-binding activity. The S 1 N(330) mutants without receptor-binding activity were not able to prevent virus binding to the receptor. These results suggest that the receptor-binding site on S 1 N(330) is composed of regions located apart from each other in the protein's primary structure, in which Thr at position 62 as well as amino acids located at positions 212, 214, and 216 are particularly important...|$|E

40|$|The <b>coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> S is {{responsible}} for important biological activities including virus neutralization by antibody, cell attachment, and cell fusion. Recently, we have elucidated the amino acid sequence of an S determinant common in murine coronaviruses (W. Luytjes, D. Geerts, W. Posthumus, R. Meloen, and W. Spaan, J. Virol. 63 : 1408 - 1412, 1989). A monoclonal antibody directed to this determinant (MAb 5 B 19. 2) protected mice against acute fatal infection. In this study, BALB/c mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide of 13 amino acids corresponding to the binding site of MAb 5 B 19. 2, which was either extended with an amino acid sequence of influenza virus hemagglutinin or conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Both immunogens induced S-specific antibodies in mice, but only the hemagglutinin-peptide construct protected them against lethal challenge. In contrast to mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV- 4), MHV-A 59 was not neutralized in vitro by MAb 5 B 19. 2. Neither MHV-A 59 nor MHV- 4 was neutralized in vitro by antibodies comprising by the synthetic peptides.

40|$|Viruses {{have evolved}} complex ways to {{penetrate}} host barriers and cause disease. One {{of the most}} important barriers the virus has to cross is the cellular membrane. Enveloped viruses accomplish this task by viral glycoprotein-mediated binding to host cells and fusion of virus and host cell membranes. For the <b>coronaviruses,</b> viral <b>spike</b> (S) <b>proteins</b> execute these cell entry functions. In my dissertation research I focused on understanding the <b>coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> as well as other cofactors required for S-mediated entry into cells. The S proteins are set apart from other viral and cellular membrane fusion proteins by their extensively palmitoylated membrane-associated tails. In our experiments, substitution of alanines for the cysteines that are subject to palmitoylation had effects on both S incorporation into virions and S- mediated membrane fusions. In specifically dissecting the effects of endodomain mutations on the fusion process, we used antiviral peptides that bind only to folding intermediates in the S-mediated fusion process, and found that mutants lacking three palmitoylated cysteines remained in transitional folding states nearly ten times longer than native S proteins. This slower refolding was also reflected in the paucity of post-fusion six-helix bundle configurations amongst the mutant S proteins. Viruses with fewer palmitoylated S protein cysteines entered cells slowly and had reduced specific infectivities. These findings indicate that lipid adducts anchoring S proteins into virus membranes are necessary for the rapid, productive S protein refolding events that culminate in membrane fusions. The membrane fusion process also requires an S protein conformational flexibility that is facilitated by proteolytic cleavages. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus S proteins rely on host cell proteases for fusion activation. I identified the human lung transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS 2, as an important factor for SARS coronavirus entry. TMPRSS 2 co-localized on cell surfaces with the virus receptor ACE 2, and enhanced the cell entry of both SARS S - pseudotyped HIV and authentic SARS-CoV. Enhanced entry correlated with TMPRSS 2 -mediated proteolysis of both S and ACE 2. These findings indicate that a cell-surface complex comprising a primary receptor and a separate endoprotease operate as portals for activation of SARS coronavirus cell entry...|$|R

We show that the cytoplasmic domain, not the transmembrane domain, determines the association with the M protein and suffices to effect the incorporation into viral particles of chimeric spikes as well as of foreign viral glycoproteins. The essential sequence was mapped to the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain, which is also known to be of critical importance for the fusion function of the S protein. Consistently, only short C-terminal truncations of the S protein were tolerated when introduced into the virus by targeted recombination.

40|$|Background: Precise {{determination}} of conformational epitopes of neutralizing antibodies represents a key {{step in the}} rational design of novel vaccines. A powerful experimental method to gain insights on the physical chemical nature of conformational epitopes is the selection of linear peptides that bind with high affinities to a monoclonal antibody of interest by phage display technology. However, the structural characterization of conformational epitopes from these mimotopes is not straightforward, {{and in the past}} the interpretation of peptide sequences from phage display experiments focused on linear sequence analysis to find a consensus sequence or common sequence motifs. Results: We present a fully automated search method, EpiSearch that predicts the possible location of conformational epitopes on the surface of an antigen. The algorithm uses peptide sequences from phage display experiments as input, and ranks all surface exposed patches according to the frequency distribution of similar residues in the peptides and in the patch. We have tested the performance of the EpiSearch algorithm for six experimental data sets of phage display experiments, the human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER- 2 /neu), the antibody mAb Bo 2 C 11 targeting the C 2 domain of FVIII, antibodies mAb 17 b and mAb b 12 of the HIV envelope protein gp 120, mAb 13 b 5 targeting HIV- 1 capsid protein and 80 R of the SARS <b>coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> <b>protein.</b> In all these examples th...|$|E

These structures are essential for the initiation of infection through attachment of the virus to cellular receptors followed by fusion to host cell membranes. The S protein can also mediate the formation of syncytia in infected cells. The S protein is a type I transmembrane protein that is very large compared to other viral fusion proteins, and all except a short carboxy-terminal segment of the S molecule constitutes the ectodomain. For the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), it has previously been established that S protein assembly into virions is specified by the carboxy-terminal segment, which comprises the transmembrane domain and the endodomain. We have genetically dissected these domains in the MHV S protein to localize the determinants of S incorporation into virions. Our results establish that assembly competence maps to the endodomain of S, which was shown to be sufficient to target a heterologous integral membrane protein for incorporation into MHV virions. In particular, mutational analysis indicated a major role for the charge-rich carboxy-terminal region of the endodomain. Additionally, {{we found that the}} adjacent cysteine-rich region of the endodomain is critical for fusion of infected cells, confirming results previously obtained with S protein expression systems...|$|E

In addition to a well-recognized cleavage site at the S 1 –S 2 boundary, a second proteolytic cleavage site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S 2 domain (R 797). C-terminal to this S 2 cleavage site is a conserved region flanked by cysteine residues C 822 and C 833. Here, we investigated the importance of this well conserved region for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion activation. We show that the residues between C 822 –C 833 are well conserved across all coronaviruses. Mutagenic analysis of SARS-CoV S, combined with cell–cell fusion and pseudotyped virion infectivity assays, showed a critical role for the core-conserved residues C 822, D 830, L 831, and C 833.

To compare the inhibitory effect of the sHRP in each pathway, we selected two sHRPs, which showed a strong inhibitory effect on the interaction of two heptad repeats in a rapid and virus-free in vitro assay system. We found that they efficiently inhibited SCoV infection of the protease-mediated cell surface pathway but had little effect on the endosomal pathway. This finding suggests that sHRPs may effectively prevent infection in the lungs, where SCoV infection could be enhanced by proteases produced in this organ.

Recently, we identified a dilysine endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval signal and a tyrosine-based endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Here, an infectious cDNA clone of IBV was used to address the importance of the S protein trafficking signals to virus infection. We constructed infectious cDNA clones lacking the ER retrieval signal, the endocytosis signal, or both. The virus lacking the ER retrieval signal was viable. However, this virus had a growth defect at late times postinfection and produced larger plaques than IBV. Further analysis confirmed that the mutant S protein trafficked though the secretory pathway faster than wild-type S protein. A more dramatic phenotype was obtained when the endocytosis signal was mutated. Recombinant viruses lacking the endocytosis signal (in combination with a mutated dilysine signal or alone) could not be recovered, even though transient syncytia were formed in transfected cells.

In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it has been shown that virus entry requires the endosomal protease cathepsin L; however, it was also found that infection of SARS-CoV could be strongly induced by trypsin treatment. Overall, in terms of how cleavage might activate membrane fusion, proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV S protein remains unclear. Here, we identify a proteolytic cleavage site within the SARS-CoV S 2 domain (S 2 ′, R 797). Mutation of R 797 specifically inhibited trypsin-dependent fusion in both cell–cell fusion and pseudovirion entry assays. We also introduced a furin cleavage site at both the S 2 ′ cleavage site within S 2 793 -KPTKR- 797 (S 2 ′), as well as at the junction of S 1 and S 2. Introduction of a furin cleavage site at the S 2 ′ position allowed trypsin-independent cell–cell fusion, which was strongly increased by the presence of a second furin cleavage site at the S 1 –S 2 position. Taken together, these data suggest a novel priming mechanism for a viral fusion protein, with a critical proteolytic cleavage event on the SARS-CoV S protein at position 797 (S 2 ′), acting in concert with the S 1 –S 2 cleavage site to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity...|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} human coronavirus 229 E/OC 43 nested multiplex nucleocapsid gene PCR and South-western blotting {{protocol was}} developed and utilised to screen clinical specimens {{for the presence of}} human coronaviruses 229 F and human coronaviruses OC 43. Clinical specimens comprised 100 nasal washings obtained from children with asthma at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester, U. K. in 1990 and 200 nasal secretions obtained from adults presenting with the common cold in Kumasi, Ghana, in 1993. Fourteen of the U. K. clinical specimens were found to contain human coronaviruses (12 human coronavirus 229 E and 2 human coronavirus OC 43) whilst 43 of the African clinical specimens were found to contain human coronaviruses (26 human coronavirus 229 E and 17 human coronaviruses OC 430).;A nested human coronavirus 229 E spike gene cycle sequencing PCR protocol was also developed and utilised to generate sequence data from the spike genes of chronologically and geographically distinct human coronaviruses 229 E (these chronologically and geographically distinct human coronavirus 229 E isolates comprising :- a) reference human coronavirus 229 E American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain VR- 74, b) U. K. human coronavirus 229 E isolate LR! 281 and c) African human coronavirus 229 E isolate A 162). Sequence data was obtained from approximately 90 % of the spike genes of these isolates.;When the resultant human coronavirus 229 E spike gene sequences were translated into protein and compared with one another, {{it was found that the}} translated human <b>coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> sequences were relatively similar between these chronologically and geographically distinct isolates. These results may indicate that spike gene variation is not a major factor in the aetiology of human coronavirus 229 E re-infection...|$|E
40|$|Coronavirus {{entry is}} {{mediated}} by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein. The 180 -kDa oligomeric S protein of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A 59 is posttranslationally cleaved into an S 1 receptor binding unit and an S 2 membrane fusion unit. The latter is thought to contain an internal fusion peptide and has two 4, 3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat regions designated HR 1 and HR 2. HR 2 is located close to the membrane anchor, and HR 1 is some 170 amino acids (aa) upstream of it. Heptad repeat (HR) regions are found in fusion proteins of many different viruses and form an important characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins. We investigated the role of these regions in coronavirus membrane fusion. Peptides HR 1 (96 aa) and HR 2 (39 aa), corresponding to the HR 1 and HR 2 regions, were produced in Escherichia coli. When mixed together, the two peptides were found to assemble into an extremely stable oligomeric complex. Both {{on their own and}} within the complex, the peptides were highly alpha helical. Electron microscopic analysis of the complex revealed a rod-like structure ∼ 14. 5 nm in length. Limited proteolysis in combination with mass spectrometry indicated that HR 1 and HR 2 occur in the complex in an antiparallel fashion. In the native protein, such a conformation would bring the proposed fusion peptide, located in the N-terminal domain of HR 1, and the transmembrane anchor into close proximity. Using biological assays, the HR 2 peptide was shown to be a potent inhibitor of virus entry into the cell, as well as of cell-cell fusion. Both biochemical and functional data show that the <b>coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> is a class I viral fusion protein...|$|E
40|$|The murine <b>coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> (S) <b>protein</b> {{contains}} a leucine zipper domain which is highly conserved among coronaviruses. To assess {{the role of}} this leucine zipper domain in S-induced cell-to-cell fusion, the six heptadic leucine and isoleucine residues were replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant S proteins were analyzed for cell-to-cell membrane fusion activity {{as well as for}} progress through the glycoprotein maturation process, including intracellular glycosylation, oligomerization, and cell surface expression. Single-alanine-substitution mutations had minimal, if any, effects on S-induced cell-to-cell fusion. Significant reduction in fusion activity was observed, however, when two of the four middle heptadic leucine or isoleucine residues were replaced with alanine. Double alanine substitutions that involved either of the two end heptadic leucine residues did not significantly affect fusion. All double-substitution mutant S proteins displayed levels of endoglycosidase H resistance and cell surface expression {{similar to those of the}} wild-type S. However, fusion-defective double-alanine-substitution mutants exhibited defects in S oligomerization. These results indicate that the leucine zipper domain plays a role in S-induced cell-to-cell fusion and that the ability of S to induce fusion may be dependent on the oligomeric structure of S...|$|R
40|$|HKU 1 {{is a human}} betacoronavirus {{that causes}} mild yet {{prevalent}} respiratory disease 1, and {{is related to the}} zoonotic SARS 2 and MERS 3 betacoronaviruses, which have high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Cell tropism and host range is determined in part by the <b>coronavirus</b> <b>spike</b> (S) <b>protein</b> 4, which binds cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion. As the largest known class I fusion protein, its size and extensive glycosylation have hindered structural studies of the full ectodomain, thus preventing a molecular understanding of its function and limiting development of effective interventions. Here we present the 4. 0 Å resolution structure of the trimeric HKU 1 S protein determined using singleparticle cryo-electron microscopy. In the pre-fusion conformation, the receptor-binding subunits, S 1, rest above the fusion-mediating subunits, S 2, preventing their conformational rearrangement. Surprisingly, the S 1 C-terminal domains are interdigitated and form extensive quaternary interactions that occlude surfaces known in other coronaviruses to bind protein receptors. These features, along with the location of the two protease sites known to be important for coronavirus entry, provide a structural basis to support a model of membrane fusion mediated by progressive S protein destabilization through receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage. These studies should also serve as a foundation for the structure-based design of betacoronavirus vaccine immunogens. NI...|$|R
40|$|We have {{expressed}} and characterized the {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} <b>coronavirus</b> (SARS-CoV) <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> in cDNA-transfected mammalian cells. The full-length <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> (S) was newly synthesized as an endoglycosidase H (endo H) -sensitive glycoprotein (gp 170) that is further modified into an endo H-resistant glycoprotein (gp 180) in the Golgi apparatus. No substantial proteolytic cleavage of S was observed, suggesting that S is not processed into head (S 1) and stalk (S 2) domains as observed for certain other coronaviruses. While the expressed full-length S glycoprotein was exclusively cell associated, a truncation of S by excluding the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains {{resulted in the}} expression of an endoplasmic reticulum-localized glycoprotein (gp 160) as well as a Golgi-specific form (gp 170) which was ultimately secreted into the cell culture medium. Chemical cross-linking, thermal denaturation, and size fractionation analyses suggested that the full-length S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV forms a higher order structure of ∼ 500 kDa, which is consistent with it being an S homotrimer. The latter was also observed in purified virions. The intracellular form of the C-terminally truncated S protein (but not the secreted form) also forms trimers, but with much less efficiency than full-length S. Deglycosylation of the full-length homotrimer with peptide N-glycosidase-F under native conditions abolished recognition of the protein by virus-neutralizing antisera raised against purified virions, suggesting the importance of the carbohydrate in the correct folding of the S protein. These data should aid in the design of recombinant vaccine antigens {{to prevent the spread of}} this emerging pathogen...|$|R
