5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and <b>calcium</b> <b>ion</b> channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{problems}} of applying anionic surfactants in, for example, laundry detergents is the precipitation of calcium salts. Much effort has been directed towards avoiding precipitation.

25|$|Neurotransmitter {{release is}} {{dependent}} on an external supply of Ca2+ ions which enter axon terminals via voltage-gated calcium channels. Vesicular fusion with the terminal membrane and release of the neurotransmitter {{is caused by the}} generation of Ca2+ gradients induced by incoming action potentials. The Ca2+ ions cause the mobilization of newly synthesized vesicles from a reserve pool to undergo this membrane fusion. This mechanism of action was discovered in squid giant axons. Lowering intracellular Ca2+ ions provides a direct inhibitory effect on neurotransmitter release. After release of the neurotransmitter occurs, vesicular membranes are recycled to their origins of production. <b>Calcium</b> <b>ion</b> channels can vary depending on the location of incidence. For example, the channels at an axon terminal differ from the typical calcium channels of a cell body (whether neural or not). Even at axon terminals, <b>calcium</b> <b>ion</b> channel types can vary, {{as is the case with}} P-type calcium channels located at the neuromuscular junction.|$|E

25|$|Bungarotoxin is a {{compound}} with known interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which constitute {{a family of}} ion channels whose activity is triggered by neurotransmitter binding. Bungarotoxin is produced {{in a number of}} different forms, though one of the commonly used forms is the long chain alpha form, α-bungarotoxin, which is isolated from the banded krait snake. Though extremely toxic if ingested, α-bungarotoxin has shown extensive usefulness in neuroscience as it is particularly adept at isolating nAChRs due to its high affinity to the receptors. As there are multiple forms of bungarotoxin, there are different forms of nAChRs to which they will bind, and α-bungarotoxin is particularly specific for α7-nAChR. This α7-nAChR functions to allow <b>calcium</b> <b>ion</b> influx into cells, and thus when blocked by ingested bungarotoxin will produce damaging effects, as ACh signaling will be inhibited. Likewise, the use of α-bungarotoxin can be very useful in neuroscience if it is desirable to block calcium flux in order to isolate effects of other channels. Additionally, different forms of bungarotoxin may be useful for studying inhibited nAChRs and their resultant <b>calcium</b> <b>ion</b> flow in different systems of the body. For example, α-bungarotoxin is specific for nAChRs found in the musculature and κ-bungarotoxin is specific for nAChRs found in neurons.|$|E
25|$|The catecholamines, {{epinephrine}} and norepinephrine, secreted by the {{adrenal medulla}} form {{one component of}} the extended fight-or-flight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have similar effects: binding to the beta-1 adrenergic receptors, and opening sodium and <b>calcium</b> <b>ion</b> chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.|$|E
25|$|Baclofen is {{considered}} to be at least as effective as diazepam in reducing spasticity, and causes much less sedation. It acts as a GABA agonist at GABAB receptors in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons expressing this receptor, most likely due to increased potassium ion conductance. Baclofen also inhibits neural function presynaptically, by reducing <b>calcium</b> <b>ion</b> influx, and thereby reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in both the brain and spinal cord. It may also reduce pain in patients by inhibiting the release of substance P in the spinal cord, as well.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing isobaric-isothermal replica-exchange {{molecular}} dynamics and the all-atom explicit-solvent model, we studied the equilibrium binding of Aβ monomers to a zwitterionic dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer coincubated with <b>calcium</b> <b>ions.</b> Using our previous replica-exchange {{molecular dynamics}} calcium-free simulations as a control, we reached three conclusions. First, <b>calcium</b> <b>ions</b> change the tertiary {{structure of the}} bound Aβ monomer by destabilizing several long-range intrapeptide interactions, particularly the salt bridge Asp 23 -Lys 28. Second, calcium strengthens Aβ peptide binding to the DMPC bilayer by enhancing electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids and lipid polar headgroups. As a result, Aβ monomer penetrates deeper into the bilayer, making disorder in proximal lipids and bilayer thinning more pronounced. Third, because <b>calcium</b> <b>ions</b> demonstrate strong affinity to negatively charged amino acids, a considerable influx of calcium into the area proximal to the bound Aβ monomer is observed. Consequently, the localizations of negatively charged amino acids and <b>calcium</b> <b>ions</b> in the Aβ binding footprint overlap. Based on our data, we propose a mechanism by which <b>calcium</b> <b>ions</b> strengthen Aβ-bilayer interactions. This mechanism involves two factors: 1) <b>calcium</b> <b>ions</b> make the DMPC bilayer partially cationic and thus attractive to the anionic Aβ peptide; and 2) destabilization of the Asp 23 -Lys 28 salt bridge makes Lys 28 available for interactions with the bilayer. Finally, we conclude that a single Aβ monomer does not promote permeation of <b>calcium</b> <b>ions</b> through the zwitterionic bilayer...|$|R

25|$|Both {{sympathetic}} and parasympathetic stimuli {{flow through the}} paired cardiac plexus near {{the base of the}} heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1–T4) to both the SA and AV nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heartrate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and <b>calcium</b> <b>ion</b> channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions.|$|E
25|$|Although most injury {{responses}} {{include a}} calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is rapid {{separation of the}} proximal and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury. Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma, and eventually leads to bead like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions {{at the site of}} injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by influx of <b>calcium</b> <b>ion),</b> suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process. Thus the axon undergoes complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hrs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are currently unknown.|$|E
25|$|Parasympathetic {{stimulation}} {{leads to}} acetylcholine (ACh) release onto the salivary acinar cells. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors, specifically M3, and causes an increased intracellular <b>calcium</b> <b>ion</b> concentration (through the IP3/DAG second messenger system). Increased calcium causes vesicles within the cells to fuse with the apical cell membrane leading to secretion. ACh also causes the salivary gland to release kallikrein, an enzyme that converts kininogen to lysyl-bradykinin. Lysyl-bradykinin acts upon {{blood vessels and}} capillaries of the salivary gland to generate vasodilation and increased capillary permeability respectively. The resulting increased {{blood flow to the}} acini allows production of more saliva. In addition, Substance P can bind to Tachykinin NK-1 receptors leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequently increased saliva secretion. Lastly, both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous stimulation can lead to myoepithelium contraction which causes the expulsion of secretions from the secretory acinus into the ducts and eventually to the oral cavity.|$|E
