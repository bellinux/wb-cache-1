5|$|The Charlemagne-class ships did not {{function}} {{well in a}} head sea. Stormy weather in the Bay of Biscay in 1900 caused the captain of Gaulois to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship's forward gun turret and casemates were flooded out and that the ship generated enormous sheets of spray when water came over the bow. Like most French capital ships of the period, they had pronounced tumblehome. Gauloiss captain also said that his ship was a steady gunnery platform and manoeuvered well in tight spaces but he criticized the armour layout as not high enough to prevent munitions from penetrating above the main armour belt and detonating below the secondary armament positions.|$|E

The second season began filming at the school in 2009, and first aired on January 16, 2010. The show was cut from one hour to 30minutes and focused on new transfer students instead of current SCPA students, leading some students and parents to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> admission process had been compromised. The school denied the claim.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E

This, and similar complaints made by other NFL teams, would prompt the NFL during the 2004 offseason to instruct all of the league's officials to strictly enforce these types of fouls.|$|E

In this way everyone participated in the collection process. No one possessing any portion of it was left out, and so no one had reason for expressing concern about the verses collected, nor could anyone <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> text had been gathered from only a select few.|$|E

25|$|During the night, {{elements}} of the American 82nd Airborne Division mounted an aerial assault on a Taliban compound. One of the Chinook helicopters {{taking part in the}} raid was apparently hit by an RPG round and crashed, killing five Americans, a Briton and a Canadian on board. Lastay Kulang ended on June 14, with the strategic outcome unclear. NATO stated that their forces cleared Sangin and Gereshk of Taliban and thus secured the Kajaki District. In contrast, the Taliban claimed that they still control much of Kajaki, and some of the Sangin districts. These claims were confirmed by the local residents, who <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Taliban returned as soon as NATO and ANA troops had left.|$|E
25|$|Despite the market, {{the park}} has {{suffered}} serious deterioration over the past 20 years due to crime, nearby prostitution {{and the proliferation of}} non-art street vendors. While the homeless move out for the Sunday market, they dominate the park {{for the rest of the}} week. The result has been graffiti, garbage, dog waste and playgrounds in poor conditions. It is common to see cushions, and chairs as well and drying clothes on the park’s statues. In fact, by Sunday, the smell can be strong enough that art vendors need to clean with detergent and pine cleaner before setting up. The Cuauhtémoc borough invested 5 million pesos for cleaning, repairs and the improvement of drainage and lighting, and the homeless were expelled from the park in 2005, but area residents <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> problems have returned.|$|E

25|$|On 20 December 1421, {{the king}} {{determined}} that the Moorish residents that did not respect the contract between the prelate, cabido and population, should be obliged to pay 100 reis fine, which were then applied {{to the construction of}} the walls. Yet, even by the Cortes of Lisbon (1446), the Bracarense procurators continued to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> population continued to pay for the city walls, whose construction was suspended. They attributed these complaints to the King's uncle, Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza, who was the project's comptroller, and public works in the comarca of Entre Douro e Minho. Between 1456 and 1459, during the Cortes of Lisbon, there was a new denunciation against the uncompleted project, whose budget had already been squandered. As the walls began to deteriorate, the blame fell to Aires Ferreira, a squire in the House of the Duke of Braganza.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Edmonds {{proposed}} a {{volume on the}} occupation in the Rhine Province by British Army on the Rhine (BAOR), to counter a recent German book but the Treasury refused to pay. Edmonds hoped that the War Office would find the money, began to collect information from former commanders and staffs of the BAOR and ensured the storage of BAOR records. By 1939, poor offices, lack of promotions and government parsimony, led him to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> official history, a national memorial, was being neglected. When Daniel retired in late 1939, Edmonds took on the duties of Secretary as well as Director and on 15 November, the Historical Section was evacuated to St. Anne's on Sea, Lancashire and thence to the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth in April 1942. In February, the Committee for the Control of Official Histories decided to let Edmonds write the volume. R. A. Butler, President of the Board of Education, said that the volume would be useful as a historical background for the Armistice and disarmament terms to be imposed on Germany. In 1987, Bayliss wrote that utility was the main criterion but that it also kept Edmonds busy, having been passed over for {{the writing of the}} official histories of the Second World War. Edmonds was pleased because he saw it as the final volume of his Western Front campaign history.|$|E
500|$|The city of Cleveland, Tennessee {{has held}} an annual art show {{in honor of}} Nipper each fall for over 40 years. The show is named the Nillie Bipper Arts and Crafts Festival; [...] "Nillie Bipper" [...] is an {{intentional}} play on Nipper's first and last names, done for humorous purposes. However, the first year the festival was held, many people called the local newspaper office to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> organizers had gotten Nipper's name wrong. Nipper was also chairperson of Cleveland's Creative Guild, which promoted art within the city.|$|E

500|$|Some <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{sculpture}} {{does not}} depict Jordan's well-known open-mouthed tongue wag. Chicago Tribune art critic Alan G. Artner says the inscription {{at the base}} that reads [...] "The best there ever was. The best there ever will be." [...] refers only to the subject and not the sculpture. [...] Following the Bulls' second three-peat after Jordan's return, the statue became a sports mecca for fans to gather and take photographs. ESPN The Magazine listed the sculpture {{as one of the}} ten greatest sports photo opportunities in 1998.|$|E
500|$|On July23, 1923, Raphael Beck, who had {{designed}} the seal for the 1901Pan-American Exposition, wrote to Mint Director Scobey to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reverse design resembled his seal, {{which he had}} copyrighted in 1899, and that Beach should be given no further credit for it. The letter was forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts for comment. In October, Fraser wrote to Beck, stating that he had suggested to Beach that he use figures to represent the continents instead of maps, {{and that he had}} never seen the Pan-American seal until Scobey forwarded the letter. According to Bowers, [...] "A comparison of the 1901 and 1923 designs, however, shows that this was highly unlikely." ...|$|E
500|$|Meyerbeer {{was always}} {{concerned}} to intensify the theatricality of his operas, even when new ideas emerged {{at a relatively}} late stage in the music's composition. An example of his receptiveness was {{the addition of the}} provocative [...] "Ballet of the Nuns" [...] in the third act of Robert le diable, at the suggestion of Duponchel. The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led in fact to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). In Le prophète the skating ballet, which created a great sensation, was composed after rehearsals had begun, in order to capitalise on the new craze for roller skates. The theatre was also able to use new electrical lighting effects to create a powerful sunrise, and to depict the conflagration which ends the opera.|$|E

500|$|While the {{majority}} of the staff were pleased with [...] "Tapestry", Piller felt that the premise was tired and was concerned that it was simply a take on the film It's a Wonderful Life. He said that some scenes were [...] "very talky", and the direction and some performances were [...] "flat". Moore participated in an AOL chat in 1997, where he described [...] "Tapestry" [...] as [...] "one of the best things I wrote and one of TNGs finest episodes". Some fans wrote in to the staff to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> episode glorified violence, and was against the principles of Star Trek. Jeri Taylor admitted that the episode could be seen as violent, but it never crossed the mind of any of the staff during production. She {{went on to say that}} if they had realized that [...] "Tapestry" [...] could be considered to promote violence, then they would have corrected it to ensure that it wouldn't be viewed as such.|$|E
500|$|Eagle became {{immensely popular}} {{with people of}} all ages and walks of life.

[...] The Lancet reported on one doctor who read Eagle on his rounds. [...] It was sent to soldiers in Korea, to refugee camps, and was praised by Geoffrey Grigson on the BBC Home Service. [...] Wolf Mankowitz proclaimed Dan Dare a [...] "Hero of Our Time", and the Earl of Jellicoe was reported to have read the comic in the library of Westminster Palace. [...] Lord Mountbatten supposedly placed a subscription order for his nephew, Prince Charles, and on one occasion rang Hulton to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> comic had not arrived; a replacement was quickly despatched. [...] Years later Morris sent the prince a copy of The Best of Eagle (1977); Charles replied and thanked him for the [...] "fond memories". [...] The comic was not universally popular, however, as it was quickly banned in South Africa.|$|E
500|$|After the concert, Tammy {{and several}} other girls are invited backstage, where they think the Jonas Brothers {{want to have sex}} with them. Instead, they {{convince}} the girls to wear purity rings as a pledge to abstinence, and tell them to get all of their friends to start wearing them as well because [...] "That is just the way we roll" [...] (a reference to one of their songs). To appease his girlfriend, Kenny reluctantly begins wearing a purity ring. As Kenny becomes dull as a result and ceases to spend time with his friends, it is revealed that the Jonas Brothers are being forced to wear and promote purity rings by their boss, Mickey Mouse. He is fearsome, greedy, sadistic, and foul-mouthed, and verbally berates and violently beats them when they <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rings are overshadowing their music and projecting the wrong message. Mickey explains that the rings allow him to sell sexual stimulation to young girls while giving the false appearance of innocence and purity. Concerned for their friend, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman attempt to confront the Jonas Brothers at a televised appearance in Denver; but Mickey, mistaking the boys for secret agents hired by DreamWorks (or Michael Eisner) to sabotage the televised appearance, tranquilizes them and takes them prisoner backstage.|$|E
