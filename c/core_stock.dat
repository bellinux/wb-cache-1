Currently its management is divided into different functional units in the Mediterranean (GFCM, General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean) and two stocks in the Atlantic: the Southern and the Northern Stock. The basis for the definition of this management stock structure is under permanent discussion and in the latest years there were an increased amount of genetic studies addressing this topic. Integrated ecosystem assessment requires an improved understanding of the marine ecosystem to provide an effective advice. To this end we have gathered hake genetic information from different studies with the aim of developing a spatial assessment model that links the current stocks.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of two thin-walled outer tubes showed that more extensive alpha working of the billet <b>core</b> <b>stock</b> results in more uniform cladding on the extruded tube. In {{an effort to}} eliminate breakthrough and to reduce eccentricity, shift, and bending of the mandrel, two experimental coppernickel billets with Zircaloy sleeves were extruded to check a modified billet design. lt was observed that the final grain size of the unalloyed uranium core of a thin- walled outer tube is insensitive to small variations in the cooling rate from the beta-treatment temperature. An axia' load of 3000 pounds applied to a thin- walled outer tube during autoclaving was ineffective in preventing bowing of the tube. Shipping experiments demonstrated that current packaging methods of thin- walled inner tubes do not prevent bowing during transit. The fabrication of specimens for the capsule irradiation program was concluded with the shipment of sixteen specimens and excess extruded tube stock to Savannah River Laboratory. The following core compositions were represented: U- 1 wt. % Si, unalloyed dingot uranium, U- 0. 3 wt. % Al- 0. 5 wt. % Si, and U- 0. 3 wt. % Cr- 0. 3 wt. % Mo. All irradiation specimens were supplied in the beta-treated condition. The mechanical behavior of Zircaloy- 4 -clad dingot uranium tube sections was evaluated {{as a function of}} the cooling rate from the beta treatment temperature. The results indicate that the mechanical behavior is approximately independent of the cooling rate and that, in testing to failure, fracture initiates within the core.

40|$|The <b>core</b> of <b>stock</b> {{portfolio}} diversification is to pick stocks from different correlation clusters when forming portfolios. The {{result is that}} the chosen stocks will be only weakly correlated with each other. However, since correlation matrices are high dimensional, it is close to impossible to determine correlation clusters by simply looking at a correlation matrix. It is therefore common to regard industry groups as correlation clusters. In this thesis, we used three visualization methods namely Hierarchical Cluster Trees, Minimum Spanning Trees and neighbor-Net splits graphs to “collapse” correlation matrices’ high dimensional structures onto two-dimensional planes, and then assign stocks into different clusters to create the correlation clusters. We then simulated sets of portfolios where each set contains 1000 portfolios, and stocks in each of the portfolio were picked from the correlation clusters suggested by each of the three visualization methods and industry groups (another way of determine correlation clusters). The mean and variance distribution of each set of 1000 simulated portfolios gives us an indication of how well those clusters were determined. The examinations were conducted on two sets of financial data. The first one is the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial average which contains relatively small number of stocks and the second one is the ASX 200 which contains relatively larger number of stocks. We found none of the methods studied consistently defined correlation clusters more efficiently than others in out-of-sample testing. The thesis does contribute the finance literature in two ways.

40|$|Understanding {{patterns}} of natural forest expansion in rural regions {{under the influence}} of urbanization processes is crucial for integrated spatial planning across the urban-to-rural gradient. As a matter of fact, forest expansion is the only natural process that may counteract the consumption of the ecosystem capital and ecosystems services of rural lands due to uncontrolled urban sprawl. The paper addresses this topic in the paradigmatic case study of the countryside of Rome (Italy), characterized by counter dynamics of forest expansion and suburbanization. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) is applied to classify the forest landscape structure twice (1974 and 2008) according to seven categories (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, branch) with different potential functional role as elements of a green infrastructure. Main findings are: (i) forest cover increased from 11 % to 16 % between 1974 and 2008; forest land uptake exceeds 4 % of total study area, but shows a slower pace than the growth of built-up areas (10 %); (ii) forest expansion has been to a large extent achieved by “sprawling” of islets (1. 6 % of the study area) along the stream network; (iii) more compact forest expansion has taken place on 0. 2 % of the study area in the form of additions to existing core areas or creation of new ones and (iv) the establishment of a network of protected areas nearby Rome has played a key role for the conservation and further expansion of core areas; yet, local loss of 1974 <b>core</b> areas <b>stocks</b> in a few protected areas indicates need of further law enforcement to ensure effective protection of the natural capital from degradation processes or even land conversion into built-up areas.

The City of Winnipeg has been confronted by many ofthe same planning concerns faced by other North American cities, although there have been a number of innovative and sometimes unique local planning efforts. Among the more important concerns faced by this city are a growing suburban area and an increasingly deserted downtown, neighbourhood decay and an aging inner <b>core</b> housing <b>stock,</b> increasing poverty and community distress, housing affordabilty and the need to preserve the city's inventory of heritage buildings and satisfy transportation demands. In the post-war period, a variety of reports and studies have been produced by public and private sources Qncluding academic and student researchers) related to urban planning in Winnipeg. They focus on topics such as community renewal and revitalization, downtown development, heritage districts, housing, land use, parks, the Winnipeg region/fringe and transportation. During this period, planning moved from a technical land use function to a greater focus on community based participation and concern for the environment. This growing mass of documents has much to offer to professional planners, government decision-makers, students and community groups both in the city and elsewhere. As present and future planning initiatives are debated, these documents are a valuable legacy. A variety of planning-related literature reviews relevant to Winnipeg have appeared.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EconomicsLloyd B. Thomas JrDennis L. WeismanThis {{dissertation}} {{has focused}} primarily {{on the relationship between}} aggregate private output and a measure of the public fixed capital stock for the U. S. economy using two different approaches for the years 1947 - 2005. The study starts with a brief survey of the existing literature on the relationship between private output and public capital and continues with an analysis of data on some macroeconomic variables related to private output and public capital. It employs a production function approach to provide empirical estimates and analyze its econometric problems, and continues with a vector autoregression (VAR) model. It uses two criteria, the Akaike Information Criterion and the Schwartz Bayesian Criterion, to compare the performance of the two models tested. There are several differences between this study and the existing literature. The most important difference is that each of the other studies uses only a single approach to analyze the relationship between the public capital stock and private economic growth while this study uses two different methodologies to analyze the same relationship and tests the two models using the same aggregate macroeconomic annual data on the U. S. economy from 1947 to 2005. This study represents the first attempt to provide estimates of the elasticities of private output with respect to the private capital stock, private labor stock, public nonmilitary capital <b>stock,</b> and public <b>core</b> infrastructure capital <b>stock</b> by employing two different approaches so that the comparison of the elasticities resulting from the two different approaches can be most meaningful. Moreover, this study also represents the first attempt to provide estimates of the marginal products of the above four inputs. Second, the studies that employ a production function approach are ad hoc and so is the production function approach of this study, but the production function approach section of this study is the only one having an explicit capital evolution equation for both the private and the public capital stock. All of the other studies using annual data use aggregate macroeconomic data on related variables for less than thirty years while this study employs aggregate data from 1947 to 2005 (fifty nine years). Lastly, the other production function studies are incomplete {{in the sense that they}} either do not attempt to deal with some major econometric problems such as a common trend (resulting in a spurious correlation) and the direction of the causation or when they do acknowledge major econometric problems, they do not do anything to correct them. This study, on the other hand, will try to detect major econometric problems. Once the problem is detected, the study will employ measures to deal with the problem. 	Major findings of this study are as follows. First, the causation runs from the public fixed capital stock to private output rather than in the other direction. Second, most of the studies in the existing literature report a positive impact of the private fixed capital stock on private output that is too small to be credible, whereas they report a positive impact of the public fixed capital stock on private output that is too large to be credible. However, the estimates of this study suggest not only a positive impact of the public capital stock on private output that seems credible but also a positive and very large impact of the private capital stock on private output. Third, the results of several joint hypothesis tests conducted show that there is enough sample evidence to claim that not only that the private sector operates under constant returns to scale in all inputs, private and public, for the years 1947 - 2005 but also that the private fixed capital stock is more important to the aggregate private production process than either of the two measures of the public fixed capital stock...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of asset allocation is widely {{discussed in the}} academic literature and free of any controversy. It constitutes the essential foundation of investment decisions and is the main determinant of portfolio performance. However, {{there is no consensus}} on how much wealth should be allocated on a given asset class, as this depends on numerous variables such as return expectations, risk aversion, macroeconomic circumstances, illiquidity and the specific investment horizon. The original basis for asset allocation has been eroded during the last decade, as the traditionally main assets such as bonds, stocks and real estate have been affect-ed by significant losses and are subject to considerable uncertainty. This makes it even more difficult for fund managers to decide how much wealth should be allocated to the various potential assets. Stock markets have suffered substantially through macroeconomic distortions reflected in high volatility and poor average performance. Bonds, which constitute a major share of institutional investment portfolios, are currently heavily influenced by growing gov-ernmental debt obligations. The former “save haven” of real estate was the main activator of the recent financial crisis and property markets lost substantially in value. These impacts on investment portfolios have substantially altered investor perceptions and attitudes towards their original asset allocation strategy. In order to avoid further substantial losses as experienced during recent years, investors are now seeking sources of diversification to supplement <b>core</b> assets like <b>stocks,</b> bonds and real estate. In this context, private invest-ments in infrastructure have been identified by many institutional investors as a viable alter-native. The infrastructure asset universe can be divided into two main categories: economic and social infrastructure. Economic infrastructure includes long-lasting, large-scale physical structures like transportation and communication infrastructure, as well as energy and utility facilities. Social infrastructure, on the other hand, includes education, healthcare, waste dis-posal and judicial facilities. Despite this diversity and heterogeneity, infrastructure assets are considered to have attractive investment characteristics. The nature of infrastructure as a con-servative, tangible and real asset seems to constitute a viable alternative to synthetic and com-plex financial products. Furthermore, due to their monopolistic nature, infrastructure invest-ments are expected to provide stable and predictable long-term cash flows, which may enable investors to match their long-term liabilities. This monopolistic character and the provision of basic services, might induce cash flows which are less vulnerable to economic downturns than those from other, more cyclical assets. In consequence, infrastructure might be able to stabilize portfolio returns and reduce volatility. The private involvement in the infrastructure sector is driven by financial strains on governments, which render the public sector unable to guarantee adequate infrastructure provision. However, this imbalance between infrastructure provision and demand is expected to gain further momentum and increase privatization pressure over the long run. Nevertheless, despite the promising future infrastructure’s track record and its investment history are still young, raising the question of whether infrastructure will really be able to meet optimistic investor expectations. The infrastructure sector still lacks of professional structures and standardization at different levels and additionally faces a classification problem within the portfolio. Accordingly, infra-structure assets are often managed together with (seemingly) related assets like real estate. Short histories and a lack of good quality direct performance data still impede independent (academic) research and render infrastructure investment in-transparent, which in turn hinders investment. The objective of this dissertation is to deal with some of these shortcomings and to coherently analyze the role of direct infrastructure in a diversified portfolio, by using a novel set of direct infrastructure performance data. In order to provide robust and meaningful results, the dissertation deals with a number of different aspects which are important to the asset allocation management process. In particular, the investigation accounts for different markets, empirical models, expected returns, target rates, market phases, nominal and real returns, hedging abilities in the context of liabilities and systematic market risk. Furthermore, there is a specific and detailed focus on the relationship between real estate and infrastructure and on the relationship between direct and indirect infrastructure returns...|$|R
