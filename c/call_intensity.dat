40|$|MSc (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Acoustic {{communication}} in anurans plays {{a critical role}} in species recognition, defending territories and resources, and finding a mate. Anurans use a number of different call note types to communicate, from which the most notable are advertisement- and aggression calls. Optimum weather conditions are a precursor to the commencement of the breeding season for all frog species and their calling behaviour is therefore readily influenced by atmospheric conditions. Male frogs within a chorus also tend to call from territories within a specific range of distances from one another. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine a possible context in which call note types are produced, 2) to determine the effect of atmospheric conditions on calling behaviour and 3) to determine the spacing distances between males and females in a chorus of Queckett’s River Frog (Amietia quecketti). Pre-recorded note types were used in a playback experiment to determine a context for elicited responses. A context was derived for six of the responses. Advertisement (clicks and whines), aggression (creaks), encounter (tonal notes), territorial (whine-tonal notes), and release calls (squeaks) were described. Calls and atmospheric conditions were recorded and correlated for an entire breeding season. Water temperature, wind speed, humidity and barometric pressure had a significant effect on <b>calling</b> <b>intensity.</b> As water temperature decreased <b>calling</b> <b>intensity</b> increased, while increased wind temperature led to increased <b>calling</b> <b>intensity.</b> Amietia quecketti <b>calls</b> from the water, explaining the effect while increased wind speed decreases water temperature and can carry sound further. Both humidity and barometric pressure showed increased <b>calling</b> <b>intensity</b> only at specific levels. Humidity and barometric pressure have a direct effect on one another, which most likely causes the correlation between <b>calling</b> <b>intensity</b> and both these variables. In this study A. quecketti was shown to have breeding ponds for males and resting ponds and positions for non-gravid females. This prevents unwanted or unnecessary amplexus. Males showed much smaller and less variable territory sizes than females. This is most likely because males have a small range of optimal spacing distance while females move towards and away from males. The presence of vegetation resulted in smaller territories. This is possibly because smaller males act as satellite males and cannot be seen by larger males in vegetation. The size of males did not affect territory size. Males have a specific inter-male spacing distance regardless of size. Master...|$|R

40|$|Two-choice phonotaxis {{has long}} been a useful {{experimental}} tool for determining the effects of variation in male call characteristics on female mating preferences. Such studies have revealed an almost universal preference by females for low frequency calls (Ryan 1980, 1983; Forester & Czarnowsky 1985; Robertson 1986; Telford & Passmore, unpublished data) and high intensity calls (Fellers 1979; Arak 1983 a; Dyson 1985; Forester & Czarnowsky 1985). Because <b>call</b> <b>intensity</b> cannot be used by females as a cue for assessing male fitness attributes (Arak 1983 b), preferences displayed by females for high intensity calls have provided a unique opportunity to test the validity of evoking adaptive female choice to explain frequency preferences. By decreasing the intensity of the low frequency call relative to its high frequency alternative, it has been established that <b>call</b> <b>intensity</b> has a powerful overriding influence on female preferences for low frequency calls (Schwartz 1986; Telford & Passmore, unpublished data; but see Robertson 1986). Recently, we established (Dyson & Passmore 1988) that altering the temporal relationship between two identical stimuli, thereby introducing a leader-follower call pattern, is another factor influencing female mating preferences. Under these conditions, females respond exclusively to the leading call. Additional experiments using different frequency calls with the same temporal relationship revealed that a preference for leading calls is frequency-independent (Dyson & Passmore 1988). These, and previous results, established that both <b>call</b> <b>intensity</b> and call leadership negate female ability and/or tendency to select males on the basis of call frequency. We attempted to determine whether the selective response by females to leading calls persists when an intensity difference between the leading and following calls occurs or whether, like frequency preferences, leadership preferences are intensity-dependent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Echolocating bats {{adjust the}} time–frequency {{structure}} such as sweep rate and pulse interval of their sonar calls {{when they move}} from open space to vegetation-dense environments. Emitted <b>call</b> <b>intensity</b> is equally important for echolocation, but adjustment of signal intensity to different habitats has never been systematically studied in any bat species. To address this question, we recorded sonar calls of the Neotropical trawling insectivo-rous bat Macrophyllum macrophyllum (Phyllostomidae) at three sites with different obstacle densities (clutter). We found a clear correlation between emitted intensity and degree of clutter, with intensity proportional to decreasing clutter. In highly cluttered, semicluttered, and open spaces, M. macrophyllum emitted calls with mean source levels (sound pressure level (SPL) 10 cm from the bat’s mouth) of 100, 105, and 111 dB SPL root mean square (rms), respectively. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} documen-tation of dynamic intensity adjustments in bats. Phyllosto-mid bats were previously considered silent, but the 111 -dB SPL rms emitted by free-ranging M. macrophyllum in open space is comparable to output in aerial insectivorous bats from other families. Our results suggest that the acoustic constraints of habitats are better predictors of <b>call</b> <b>intensity</b> than phylogeny and therefore likely to be major drivers shaping the sonar system of bats in the course of evolution...|$|E

40|$|Amount {{of calling}} {{activity}} (calling effort) {{is a strong}} determinant of male mating success in species such as orthopterans and anurans that use acoustic communication {{in the context of}} mating behaviour. While many studies in crickets have investigated the determinants of calling effort, patterns of variability in male calling effort in natural choruses remain largely unexplored. Within-individual variability in calling activity across multiple nights of calling can influence female mate search and mate choice strategies. Moreover, calling site fidelity across multiple nights of calling can also affect the female mate sampling strategy. We therefore investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of acoustic signaling behaviour in a wild population of the field cricket species Plebeiogryllus guttiventris. We first studied the consistency of calling activity by quantifying variation in male calling effort across multiple nights of calling using repeatability analysis. Callers were inconsistent in their calling effort across nights and did not optimize nightly calling effort to increase their total number of nights spent calling. We also estimated calling site fidelity of males across multiple nights by quantifying movement of callers. Callers frequently changed their calling sites across calling nights with substantial displacement but without any significant directionality. Finally, we investigated trade-offs between within-night calling effort and energetically expensive calling song features such as <b>call</b> <b>intensity</b> and chirp rate. Calling effort was not correlated with any of the calling song features, suggesting that energetically expensive song features do not constrain male calling effort. The two key features of signaling behaviour, calling effort and <b>call</b> <b>intensity,</b> which determine the duration and spatial coverage of the sexual signal, are therefore uncorrelated and function independently...|$|E
