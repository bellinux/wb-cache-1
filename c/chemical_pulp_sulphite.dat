40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} {{production}} has three major processing steps: pulping, bleaching, and paper production. The type of pulping {{and the amount}} of bleaching used depend {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the desired qualities of the end product. <b>Sulphite</b> <b>pulping</b> is one of the <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes that can be used. It involves chemically pulping the wood using SO 2 adsorbed in a base solution. <b>Sulphite</b> <b>pulping</b> produces a weaker paper than some other types of pulping, but the pulp is less coloured, making it more suitable for printing, often with little bleaching. The production of <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulps</b> (European Commission 2001) is much smaller than the production of kraft <b>pulps</b> and <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulps</b> are more used in special purposes in papermaking rather than being an alternative market pulp grade for kraft pulps. Very little unbleached <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulp</b> is made and the yield is a little higher which can be attributed to the lower pH in the cooking. Not all <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulping</b> and related processes that could result in the emission of significant amounts of NMVOC, SOx, particulates, NOx and CO are included under SNAP Code 040603.

30|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> fibres are {{produced}} through <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> where lignin and hemicellulose are extracted. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> fibres have a surface, which is characterised {{by a particular}} pattern created by wrinkles and microfibrils in the outer layers of the fibre wall structure (Figure 1 a). The surface structure of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> fibres corresponds mainly to the primary and S 1 layers of the fibre wall, which are preserved during <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping.</b> Contrary to the outer layers of the fibre wall (primary and S 1 layers), the S 2 layer is characterised by having a structure of microfibrils organised in a helical manner [12].|$|R
50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> is {{produced}} by combining wood chips and chemicals in large vessels known as digesters where heat and the chemicals break down the lignin, which binds the cellulose fibres together, without seriously degrading the cellulose fibres. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> is used for materials {{that need to be}} stronger or combined with mechanical pulps to give a product different characteristics. The kraft process is the dominant <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> method, with the sulfite process being second. Historically soda pulping was the first successful <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> method.|$|R
40|$|Biological pulping (biological pre{{treatment}}) {{has been}} an area {{where it has been}} stated {{that there is a need}} for a “breakthrough technology”. Biological pulping is the treatment of lignocellulosic materials with oxidative lignin-degrading microorganism enzymes prior to pulping process. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of different biomass concentration on biological pretreatment to <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process. By using three different concentrations of biomass (B 1, B 2 and B 3) banana stem waste will be treated through biological pretreatment. Treated banana stem waste will be proceeding to <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process. Untreated banana stem waste as control will also experienced <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process through the same conditions. Compositions of lignin, cellulose and glucose have been analyzed before and after biological pretreatment and after <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process by using different method and procedures. From this study, the higher biomass concentration gives the higher percentage of lignin degradation. Biological pretreatment shows the positive response to <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process where banana stem waste that have been treat in biological pretreatment process degrade the lignin in the short period of time in <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process where it takes only 30 minutes to degrade the lignin compare to 2 hours <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes that have been stated in the literature review.

50|$|The {{two major}} classifications of <b>pulp</b> are <b>chemical</b> and mechanical. <b>Chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> {{formerly}} used a sulphite process, but the kraft process is now predominant. Kraft pulp has superior strength to <b>sulphite</b> and mechanical <b>pulps.</b> Both <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> and mechanical pulps may be bleached {{to a high}} brightness.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>pulps,</b> such {{as those}} from the kraft process or sulfite pulping, contain much less lignin than {{mechanical}} pulps, (<5% compared to approximately 40%). The goal in bleaching <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> is to remove essentially all of the residual lignin, hence the process {{is often referred to}} as delignification. Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) was initially used to bleach <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps,</b> but was largely replaced in the 1930s by chlorine. Concerns about the release of organochlorine compounds into the environment prompted the development of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching processes.|$|R

50|$|To make pulp from wood, a <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> process {{separates}} lignin from cellulose fibres.

Paper made from <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> are also known as wood-free papers-not to be confused with tree-free paper; this is because they do not contain lignin, which deteriorates over time. The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper, but this consumes 5% of the fibres; <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes are not used to make paper made from cotton, which is already 90% cellulose.|$|R

The effects of using up to 30 % bagasse <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> in a blend with hardwood CMP pulp, with or without softwood kraft pulp, were studied. The results showed that superior hand sheet properties could be achieved by using bagasse chemical pulp; in comparison with main mill pulp furnish (83 % hardwood CMP pulp and 17 % imported long fiber pulp).

40|$|The way {{in which}} the washing of pulp is {{affected}} by the type of pulp used was investigated in this work by using a new measurement technique. The experimental equipment developed was a test piston press equipped with a γ-radiation source and a scintillation detector that was used to measure concentrations within the pulp bed during the washing process. Three types of <b>pulps</b> were used: <b>sulphite,</b> kraft and mechanical (groundwood) pulp. It was shown that the washing of mechanical pulp differs greatly from the washing of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp.</b> The dispersion coefficient was found to be a factor 10 larger for mechanical <b>pulp</b> than for <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp.</b> The difference was explained by the difference in fibre properties: the shorter fibres and the large amount of fibres present in groundwood pulp facilitate well-formed beds in which little channelling is present. It was also concluded from the local measurements that the dispersion effect {{at the top of the}} bed of the mechanical pulps was mostly attributed to inlet mixing. The influence of inlet mixing on the overall dispersion coefficient was however small. This result illustrates the usefulness of the new measurement technique since it could not have been obtained using traditional measurement techniques...|$|R

50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> {{processes}} such as the kraft (or sulphate) {{process and}} the sulfite process remove much of the hemicelluloses and lignin. The kraft process does less damage to the cellulose fibres than the sulfite process, thereby producing stronger fibres, but the sulfite process makes pulp that is easier to bleach. The <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes {{use a combination of}} high temperature and alkaline (kraft) or acidic (sulfite) chemicals to break the chemical bonds of the lignin.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> {{involves}} dissolving lignin {{in order}} to extract the cellulose from the wood fiber. The different processes of <b>chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> include the Kraft process, which uses caustic soda and sodium sulfide and is the most common; alternatively, the use of sulfurous acid {{is known as the}} sulfite process, the neutral sulfite semichemical is treated as a third process separate from sulfite, and soda pulping which is the least ecologically hazardous utilizing sodium hydroxide or anthraquinone.|$|R
