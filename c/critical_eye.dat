25|$|The book {{received}} a mixed reception from the Pagan community itself. Many welcomed it, praising {{it as an}} authoritative account of Wiccan history, but others were more critical, arguing that Hutton had prematurely rejected the idea that Wicca was the continuation of an ancient, pre-Christian tradition. Several Wiccans taking the latter view openly published their criticisms, with the Wiccan Jani Farrell-Roberts {{taking part in a}} published debate with Hutton in the British Pagan magazine The Cauldron (2003), whilst the New Zealander Ben Whitmore published a short book casting a <b>critical</b> <b>eye</b> on Hutton's work, entitled Trials of the Moon (2010).|$|E

In 55, Agrippina was {{forced out of the}} palace by her son to live in {{imperial}} residence. Nero deprived his mother of all honors and powers, and even removed her Roman and German bodyguards. Nero even threatened his mother he would abdicate the throne and would go to live on the Greek Island of Rhodes, a place where Tiberius had lived after divorcing Julia the Elder. Pallas also was dismissed from the court. The fall of Pallas and the opposition of Burrus and Seneca, contributed to Agrippina's loss of authority.|$|E

25|$|Seen another way, {{patients}} with heart, liver, lung, or kidney failure have a dismal prognosis for survival, so the toxicity associated with immunosuppression is warranted (the benefits of graft survival outweigh {{the risks associated}} with the medications). But for the subset of {{patients with}} diabetes and preserved kidney function, even those with long-standing and difficult-to-control disease, the prognosis for survival is comparatively much better. In addition to the immunosuppressive toxicities, other risks are associated with the islet transplant procedure itself, including intra-abdominal hemorrhage following the transplant, and portal vein thrombosis. The fact that there is already a good alternative to islet transplantation (i.e. the modern intensive insulin regimen) forces us to regard any newer, riskier interventions with a <b>critical</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fleming, a keen Hawthorn fan, {{appeared}} on Before the Bounce in 2009 with Jason Dunstall and Danny Frawley, a weekly Australian football program broadcast on Foxtel, {{before becoming a}} regular on the show's successor After the Bounce. Recognising his capacity for unique sporting insights (developed through deep contemplation of Bowlology theory) the show's producers gave Fleming a role akin to 'editor at large' in his segment Turn It Up. In this widely acclaimed segment, Fleming cast a <b>critical</b> <b>eye</b> over the AFL and society in general, raising the taboo and confronting issues that others often feared to raise. He also ran {{a part of the}} show featuring a broken chocolate wheel. Although now semi-retired from his role on After The Bounce, his Turn It Up segment has become a mainstay of the show's format, having been bequeathed to Andrew 'Gazey' Gaze upon Flem's departure. The chocolate wheel was never seen again.|$|E

25|$|In The Book of J (1990), he and David Rosenberg (who {{translated}} the Biblical texts) portrayed {{one of the}} posited ancient documents that {{formed the basis of}} the first five books of the bible (see documentary hypothesis) as the work of a great literary artist who had no intention of composing a dogmatically religious work (see Jahwist). They further envisaged this anonymous writer as a woman attached to the court of the successors of the Israelite kings David and Solomon—a piece of speculation which drew much attention. Later, Bloom said that the speculations didn't go far enough, and perhaps he should have identified J with the Biblical Bathsheba. In Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine (2004), he revisits some of the territory he covered in The Book of J in discussing the significance of Yahweh and Jesus of Nazareth as literary characters, while casting a <b>critical</b> <b>eye</b> on historical approaches and asserting the fundamental incompatibility of Christianity and Judaism.|$|E
25|$|His {{interest}} in first-hand {{investigation of the}} human nature was accompanied, at least after he reached maturity, by a distaste for generous and universalist theories. Caragiale viewed their impact on Romanian society with a <b>critical</b> <b>eye.</b> Like Junimea, he was amused by the cultural legacy of 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries, and by its image in National Liberal discourse. Nevertheless, he claimed {{that there was a}} clear difference between the first generation of liberal activists—Ion Câmpineanu, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, and Nicolae Bălcescu—and the new liberal establishment, which, as he believed, had come to cultivate hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption. He exemplified the latter group by citing some of its prominent members: Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu. At one point, he argued that, had they not died young, the leaders of 1848 could have found themselves best represented by the Conservatives. He recorded the way in which National Liberal politicians claimed to take inspiration from the revolt, and pointed out that the 1848 slogans had become rallying calls for the most banal causes.|$|E

500|$|John Profumo {{was born}} in 1915, of Italian descent. He first entered Parliament in 1940 as the Conservative member for Kettering, while serving with the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, and {{combined}} his political and military duties through the Second World War. He lost his seat in the 1945 general election, but was elected in 1950 for Stratford-on-Avon. From 1951 he held junior ministerial office in successive Conservative administrations. In 1960, Macmillan promoted him to Secretary of State for War, a senior post outside the cabinet. [...] After his marriage in 1954 to Valerie Hobson, one of Britain's leading film actresses, he may have conducted casual affairs, using late-night parliamentary sittings as his cover. Profumo's tenure as war minister coincided with a period of transition in the armed forces, involving the end of conscription {{and the development of}} a wholly professional army. His performance was watched with a <b>critical</b> <b>eye</b> by his opposition counterpart George Wigg, a former regular soldier.|$|E
500|$|In April 1914, Sibelius mailed {{the score}} and parts to the United States, calling the piece [...] (this {{intermediate}} {{version of the}} tone poem is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Yale" [...] version). On 12 and 20April 1914, Parker wrote on behalf of Stoeckel, expanding upon the initial agreement: Sibelius's American patron now wished him to travel to and conduct a program of his music at the Norfolk festival; as compensation, Sibelius would receive $1,200, as well as an honorary doctorate of music from Yale University. Although he already had sent the manuscript to Norfolk, Sibelius was not satisfied with the score and immediately began to revise the piece, eventually opting for a complete overhaul ("Isn't it just like me to rework the tone poem—at the moment I am ablaze with it."). Although Sibelius was prone to revising his compositions, such effort was usually undertaken when preparing a piece for publication or after having heard it first performed in concert. With respect to the Yale version, it is possible the invitation to attend the music festival in person prompted Sibelius to [...] "reassess" [...] the tone poem with a more <b>critical</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} to become one marked by controversy in another way. <b>Critical</b> <b>Eye</b> – Great Britain United, a Channel 4 documentary of 12 September featured interviews {{with a number of}} club personnel. [...] Amongst them was chairman Ron Noades, who commented [...] "when you're getting into mid-winter in England, you need a few hard white men to carry the artistic black players through". Noades claimed he was reported out of context, an allegation rejected by the programmes makers, and his comments stunned Palace's many black players. Ian Wright left the club soon after, transferring to Arsenal for £2.5 million. Palace finished tenth in the First Division, losing rising England star John Salako to a cruciate ligament injury. A breakaway by the top 22 clubs saw Palace become founder members of the new FA Premier League for the 1992–93 season. However, they would be without the services of another key player – Mark Bright – who was sold to Sheffield Wednesday and the Eagles struggled to score goals without him. They were demoted on goal difference, after Oldham Athletic's 4–3 victory over Southampton. Palace's 49 points from 42 games that season became the joint-highest total of any club ever to have been relegated from the top flight of English football, and remains a Premier League record. Palace's drop prompted the resignation of manager Steve Coppell after nine years at the helm, and he was succeeded by his assistant Alan Smith.|$|E
500|$|The journal Man {{published}} a highly negative review by P. G. Rivière of the University of Oxford. Criticizing {{what he saw}} as the [...] "chatty 'Holier-than-Thou' tone" [...] of the book, Rivière asserted that at only 160 pages of text, Arens had failed to give sufficient attention to the subject and evidence, instead devoting much of the space to constructing and demolishing straw men arguments. Coming to the defence of those who believe the account of Staden regarding cannibalism among the Tupinambá by arguing that it could indeed reflect the German explorer's genuine experiences, Rivière notes that Arens has not tackled all of the claims which assert that this South American people committed anthropophagy. Furthermore, he expresses his opinion that Arens' work has made him reassess the evidence for Tupinambá cannibalism, the existence of which he is now even more thoroughly convinced. Proclaiming it to be both a [...] "bad" [...] and a [...] "dangerous" [...] book, he finally expresses his fear that it might prove to be [...] "the origin of a myth". Similarly, Shirley Lindenbaum of the New School for Social Research published her highly negative review of Arens' work in the journal Ethnohistory. Casting a <b>critical</b> <b>eye</b> on his claims, she notes that his use of source material was [...] "selective and strangely blinkered", which detracted from his ideas of [...] "collective prejudice" [...] which she considers valuable. Critiquing his discussion of the Fore people of New Guinea as being littered with inaccuracies, she draws comparisons between cannibalism and sexual activity, noting the latter is also not directly observed by anthropologists but nonetheless undoubtedly goes on. She furthermore expresses surprise that the work was ever designed for a scholarly audience because of its poor levels of accuracy.|$|E
500|$|The Man-Eating Myth was {{reviewed}} by Ivan Brady for the American Anthropologist journal. He {{noted that the}} framework for Arens' scepticism was not coherent and was never spelled out explicitly in the text, even {{if it could be}} deduced from reading the entirety of the work. Brady sees this framework as an [...] "unsophisticated" [...] version of positivism and naturalism, an approach that he laments was becoming increasingly popular in anthropology. Casting a <b>critical</b> <b>eye</b> over Arens' scepticism, he admits to being perplexed as to why only [...] "direct observation" [...] will do as evidence, pondering whether Arens would accept anything short of affidavits by practicing cannibals as evidence for the practice. Brady notes that there are other activities in the world that surely go on [...] such as masturbation in monasteries and homosexual activity in the armed forces [...] but that these would be hidden by a veil of secrecy and therefore difficult to observe directly, suggesting that the same may be true for cannibalism. Moving on, Brady attacks Arens' criticism of anthropology, believing that he has constructed a straw man argument by comparing the early accounts of travellers to the later, 20th-century accounts of anthropologists, and lambasts him for portraying himself as an objective figure in the debate. He argues that in cases such as that of the Carib people, the evidence for cannibalism is [...] "indeterminate", rather than negative, as Arens believes. Concluding his review, Brady admits that he agrees with Arens' premise that socially accepted cannibalism is not as globally widespread as some anthropologists have suggested, but disagreed that anthropologists have been as [...] "reckless" [...] in their claims as Arens charges them with, and furthermore disagrees with Arens' suggestion that the cause can be blamed on poor observation standards.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps Janis' {{greatest}} genius lay in exhibiting {{the work}} of acknowledged masters alongside that of emerging artists.
