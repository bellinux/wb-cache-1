40|$|SAR {{instruments}} require careful calibration {{to ensure}} the fidelity of the image data. The use of reference targets {{on the ground as}} calibration standards is a proven technique. However, for new generations of SAR instruments using new wavelengths with polarimetric and interferometric modes, new calibration techniques need to be considered. Transponders which code the signal received from the SAR before retransmission have the advantages of unambiguous detection and decoupling of the signal from the surrounding targets. The <b>coded</b> <b>transponder</b> technique and its use fro SAR calibration are discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{compared}} {{reproductive performance}} and behaviour of does {{raised in a}} group-housing system and in a regular cage system. The group-housing pen was divided into different functional areas for suckling, resting, and eating and special hiding areas for kits when they had left the nest-boxes and does to favour the species specific behavioural traits. Does had access to their nest-box {{by means of an}} individual Electronic Nest-box Recognition System (ENRS) activated by a <b>coded</b> <b>transponder</b> placed in their eartags. Eight does were housed in each pen. Natural mating (NM, with a buck in the group) or artificial inseminations (AI) were applied. Litter size, kit mortality and kit weight at 14 d of age were similar for group-housing and cages when NM were applied. With a natural reproduction rhythm group-housing led to an increase of + 38 % of litters. However, from a management point of view, a cycled production system with AI is preferred. With AI and group-housing, a lower kindling rate and a lower kit weight at weaning were found. The lower kindling rate was partly caused by pseudo-pregnancies that were found in 23 % ($P < 0. 01 $) of the does in the group-housing system against 0 % in the control group. Sixteen to 20 % of the does in the group-housing system had skin injuries, which is an indicator for aggression among does. Most of the injuries were seen on the body and most of them were superficial bites. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that group-housing of rabbit does seems possible, but {{more research is needed to}} solve the problems of the decreased kindling rate and occurrence of pseudo-pregnancies, the lower weight at weaning and aggressiveness among does...|$|E
