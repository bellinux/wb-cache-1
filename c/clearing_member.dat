40|$|Intraday margin is a {{generally}} accepted risk management tool of central counterparties to cover increased risk exposure during the day. Central counterparties may call for intraday margin {{on a routine}} basis, but also in case of extreme price volatility or large changes in positions of <b>clearing</b> <b>members.</b> An increase {{in the use of}} a routine intraday margin call can be seen at central counterparties in the EU.

40|$|AbstractThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has {{a policy}} {{framework}} for how <b>clearing</b> <b>member</b> banks should treat their exposures to central counterparties (CCPs). Default funds {{play a crucial}} role as a risk mitigant in this framework. Furthermore, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (together abbreviated as CPSS-IOSCO) produced a set of 26 principles for financial market infrastructures. For a CCP to be deemed a qualified CCP, it has to abide by these principles. <b>Clearing</b> <b>member</b> banks with trade exposures to a qualified CCP will get preferential capital treatment under the BCBS framework. None of the principles or the policy framework requires, or forces a CCP to have a default fund. However, regulators prefer CCPs to have default funds in place to enhance their credit risk management practices, as required by principles 4 and 6 of the CPSS-IOSCO, before they will be qualified. We consider the merits of the BCBS's requirements for a clearing house, in a developing country such as South Africa, to become a qualified clearing house and conclude that a CCP with prudent risk management processes and controls, should not be disqualified if a default fund is not established...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUsing daily data on {{margins and}} {{variation}} margins for all clearing {{members of the}} Chicago Mercantile Exchange, we analyze the clearing house exposure {{to the risk of}} default by clearing members. We find that the major source of default risk for a <b>clearing</b> <b>member</b> is proprietary trading rather than trading by customers. Additionally, we show that extreme losses suffered by important clearing firms tend to cluster, which raises systemic risk concerns. Finally, we discuss how private insurance could be used to cover the loss from defaults by clearing members...|$|E
40|$|The G 20 OTC (over-the-counter) {{derivatives}} reforms impose large collateral/liquidity {{demands on}} <b>clearing</b> <b>members</b> of Central Counterparty (CCP) clearing platforms {{in the form}} of initial margins, variation margins and contributions to the default fund. In Heath et al. (2016), it was shown how this introduces a trade-off between liquidity risk and solvency risk with the system manifesting considerable systemic risk from these two sources of risk while CCP penetration is at current levels. The authors extend this analysis to include the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) skin-in-the-game requirements for CCPs, which aim to ameliorate the contributions to the default fund by <b>clearing</b> <b>members</b> and also to prevent moral hazard problems associated with the too-interconnected-to-fail (TITF) status of CCPs as more and more derivatives are centrally cleared.
