25|$|John Casey {{expanded}} Braniff's capacity {{during the}} summer of 1981. An unforeseen strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) caused delays and a decrease in traffic that created large losses for Braniff. Casey then implemented the Braniff Strikes Back Campaign in the fall of 1981, streamlining the carrier's air fare structure into a simplified two-tier fare system. As part of this campaign, some Boeing 727s were divided into Braniff Premier Service (traditional First Class service) and <b>Coach</b> <b>Class.</b> The remainder of the 727s were all-Coach Class with reduced fares. The campaign was not successful, pushing Braniff's bread-and-butter business travelers over to traditional airlines with First Class on all flights.|$|E
500|$|Stanton {{wanted the}} Axioms {{interior}} to resemble Shanghai and Dubai. Eggleston studied 1960s NASA paintings {{and the original}} concept art for Tomorrowland for the Axiom, to reflect that era's sense of optimism. Stanton remarked [...] "We are all probably very similar in our backgrounds here [...] in that we all miss the Tomorrowland that was promised us from the heyday of Disneyland," [...] and wanted a [...] "jet pack" [...] feel. Pixar also studied the Disney Cruise Line and visited Las Vegas, which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting. Eggleston based his Axiom designs on the futuristic architecture of Santiago Calatrava. Eggleston divided {{the inside of the}} ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue, and white of the BnL logo. The <b>coach</b> <b>class</b> with living/shopping spaces has [...] "S" [...] shapes as people are always looking for [...] "what's around the corner". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs. The premier class is a large Zen-like spa with colors limited to turquoise, cream, and tan, and leads on to the captain's warm carpeted and wooded quarters and the sleek dark bridge. In keeping with the artificial Axiom, camera movements were modeled after those of the steadicam.|$|E

2500|$|BUA began {{operations}} {{from its}} new base at Gatwick Airport with a mixed fleet of 43 airliners and 47 helicopters. The former included Douglas DC-3 Dakota/C-47 Skytrain, DC-4/C-54 Skymaster and DC-6 piston airliners {{as well as}} more modern Bristol Britannia and Vickers Viscount turboprops. These continued serving the all-economy Safari and colonial <b>coach</b> <b>class</b> (British residents only) routes to East, Central, Southern and West Africa pioneered by both Airwork and Hunting-Clan, as well as operating trooping flights from Stansted under contract to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and assorted passenger and freight charter flights these airlines and their associates had provided. During its first year of operation, the BUA group's 90-strong fleet flew 17.8 million revenue miles (28.6 million revenue kilometres), carrying 631,030 passengers, 143 million pounds (lb) (64,867 [...] tonnes (t)) of freight and 25,749 cars (carried by Channel Air Bridge).|$|E

2500|$|Don't Get Too Comfortable, {{which is}} subtitled [...] "The Indignities of <b>Coach</b> <b>Class,</b> The Torments of Low Thread Count, The Never-Ending Quest for Artisanal Olive Oil, and Other First World Problems" [...] was {{published}} in 2005 and also consists of comical autobiographical essays. Some of the essays were originally published in shorter form elsewhere and some original. The over-riding theme of the articles is the absurdity and excessiveness in American life: the book is about luxuries and privileges being treated as deserved rights. Rakoff said that {{the moral of the}} book is that there should be [...] "a little more guilt out there" [...] and [...] "we could all, myself included, count our blessings, acknowledge our privileges." [...] The book was generally praised by critics. The New York Times said, [...] "Rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly and wittily portrayed". Emily Gordon says that in his [...] "bursts of pure enthusiasm, he's a delectable Cole Porter, Nicholson Baker and Sarah Vowell smoothie". However, Rakoff was criticised in the Washington Post for misusing the word [...] "like", with the reviewer suggesting that Rakoff's prose could use tightening. In The New York Times, Jennifer 8. Lee said the book was [...] "no more than a collection of vaguely related magazine pieces" [...] rather than [...] "a coherent seriocomic manifesto", that some essays were off-theme, and not about narcissism and excess.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1961, BUA {{applied to}} the Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB), a {{predecessor}} of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), for {{a large number of}} domestic and international short-, medium- and long-haul scheduled route licences to give its scheduled network the critical mass to become financially viable by 1965, and to provide sufficient work for a planned Â£20 million fleet of new jets comprising four long-haul Vickers VC10s and five short-/medium-haul DH 121 Tridents. BUA's applications included a request for twice-weekly all-economy/colonial <b>coach</b> <b>class</b> flights linking Gatwick with Istanbul, Teheran, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Bangkok and Singapore, with a weekly extension to Hong Kong and Tokyo, respectively. BUA intended to inaugurate its first-ever scheduled services to Asia with DC-6Cs or Britannias, which were to be replaced with the new VC10s at a later stage. The airline planned to charge standard IATA fares on all sectors. In addition, it proposed to offer British residents flying to Singapore and Hong Kong in Skycoach an 18% discount on the equivalent economy class fares. In May of that year, BUA became the first independent airline in the UK to launch a brand-new jet aircraft, when it placed an order for ten short-/medium-haul BAC One-Eleven 200 series. The same month, the airline placed an order for four Vickers VC10 long-haul jets costing [...] Â£2.8 million apiece. Laker personally negotiated these orders with both manufacturers. The combined order value was Â£20 million. At that time, the ATLB conducted a hearing into BUA's applications for over 20 scheduled route licences to enable it to expand the European network to include a number of major trunk routes from its Gatwick base, such as Gatwick to Paris, Milan, ZÃ¼rich, Amsterdam and Athens, in competition with existing services of BEA from Heathrow. Although the ATLB granted BUA the requested licences for 12 of these routes, the airline was unable to use them without actual traffic rights.|$|E
