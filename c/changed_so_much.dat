The coupled micro- and macro-cell corrosion process involved in a typical chloride-induced corrosion is numerically simulated.

Results show that macrocell corrosion rate may not <b>change</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> while microcell corrosion rate increases a lot as oxygen permeability increases with corrosion-induced cover crack.
