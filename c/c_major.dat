5|$|Rossini wrote a brief {{instrumental}} passage, {{probably to}} establish the key of <b>C</b> <b>major</b> and the mood for the following Sanctus. The Ritornello and the Sanctus which follows are in effect in the same key of <b>C</b> <b>major</b> (both in 6/8).|$|E
5|$|During the hiatus in Brussels, Wolfgang {{turned his}} {{attention}} briefly from performing to composing. On 14 October he finished an Allegro for harpsichord, which would later {{be incorporated into the}} <b>C</b> <b>major</b> sonata, K. 6, which he completed in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The bassoon sustains its B {{from the}} final chord of the first {{movement}} before moving up a semitone to middle C. This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical <b>C</b> <b>major</b> slow movement. The movement is in ternary form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own Songs Without Words. The theme to the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical <b>C</b> <b>major</b> theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.|$|E

5|$|At (1:18), the song's main melody is introduced, {{played by}} a guitar, the bass guitar and a glockenspiel, with a chord {{progression}} of E minor, <b>C</b> <b>major</b> seventh, G major, and D major. This is repeated until (3:28), when the guitars fade out into the background, and the drumbeat ends, leaving only the ride cymbal to keep the beat, and the main melody, which is repeated until it gradually fades out, leaving ambient guitar noise.|$|E
5|$|At the Leipzig {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria. The cantata was transposed from <b>C</b> <b>major</b> to E-flat major at Leipzig, where the recorders may {{have been replaced by}} transverse flutes.|$|E
5|$|BWV Anh. 30 is a Magnificat in <b>C</b> <b>major</b> for SSAATTBB {{choir and}} orchestra, copied by Bach around 1742.

5|$|Despite the hectic {{schedule}} {{during this}} short visit, Wolfgang still {{found time to}} write his Symphony in F, K.112 (No.13). He contrived a further symphony from the Ascanio overture, by adding a finale to the two existing movements. Another symphony, K.96/111b, in <b>C</b> <b>major,</b> is sometimes allocated to this visit to Milan, {{but it is not}} certain when (or indeed whether) Wolfgang actually wrote it.|$|E
5|$|The anthem is {{performed}} in 4/4 (common time) or in 2/4 (half time) {{in the key}} of <b>C</b> <b>major,</b> and has a tempo of 76 beats per minute. Using either time signature, the anthem must be played in a solemn and singing manner (Russian: Торжественно and Распевно). The government has released different notations for orchestras, brass bands and wind bands.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the piece is unusually symmetric. It opens and closes with a duet including a chorale text.

5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). A passage for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a <b>C</b> <b>major</b> crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} operas, Wagner {{composed}} relatively {{few pieces of}} music. These include a symphony in <b>C</b> <b>major</b> (written {{at the age of}} 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle. The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of the Apostles), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia and two choral movements framing two arias, one for soprano (S), {{the other a}} duet for tenor (T) and bass (B). As in Bach's other early cantatas, there are no recitatives. Besides the three solo voices, Bach scored the work for a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins (Vl), viola (Va), cello (Vc), bass (violone) and continuo, as {{a copy of the}} score from around 1731 by Johann Ludwig Dietel, a student of Bach, shows. The duration has been given as 10 minutes and the main key as <b>C</b> <b>major.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fauré's major sets of piano {{works are}} {{thirteen}} nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed across {{the decades of}} his career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, {{by way of a}} turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, Thème et variations in <b>C</b> <b>major,</b> and Huit pièces brèves. For piano duet, Fauré composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil André Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Wagner {{enrolled}} at the Leipzig University, where he {{became a member of}} the Saxon student fraternity. He took composition lessons with the Thomaskantor Theodor Weinlig. Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons. He arranged for his pupil's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated to him) to be published as Wagner's Op. 1. A year later, Wagner composed his Symphony in <b>C</b> <b>major,</b> a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832 and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833. He then began to work on an opera, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding), which he never completed.|$|E
5|$|In September 1828 Chopin, {{while still}} a student, visited Berlin {{with a family}} friend, {{zoologist}} Feliks Jarocki, enjoying operas directed by Gaspare Spontini and attending concerts by Carl Friedrich Zelter, Felix Mendelssohn and other celebrities. On an 1829 return trip to Berlin, he was a guest of Prince Antoni Radziwiłł, governor of the Grand Duchy of Posen—himself an accomplished composer and aspiring cellist. For the prince and his pianist daughter Wanda, he composed his Introduction and Polonaise brillante in <b>C</b> <b>major</b> for cello and piano, Op.3.|$|E

5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace – Trio: Un poco più lento. The A {{section of}} the scherzo uses a playful leaping rolled chord figure that is rhythmically and harmonically {{reminiscent}} of the opening bars of the sonata. The B section {{is dominated by the}} juxtaposition of two distant tonal realms. It commences in C-major for a rollicking theme that is abruptly interrupted by a downward-rushing C-sharp minor scale without any modulatory preparation, in a striking cyclic reference to the climax of the preceding movement's middle section. Following this outburst, the B section quietly ends in C-sharp minor a grace-note melody identical in contour to a figure from the theme of the Andantino (2–1–7–1–3–1), before modulating back to the movement's tonic. <b>C</b> <b>major</b> returns in the concluding A section, this time more tonally integrated into its A-major surroundings, by modulatory sequences. The ternary form trio in D major uses hand crossing to add melodic accompaniment to the chordal theme, and is rhythmically and harmonically based on the opening of the Allegro.|$|E
5|$|Other British composers who feature {{significantly}} in Boult's discography include Holst, Ireland, Parry, and Walton. Despite {{his reputation as}} a pioneer in Britain of the works of the Second Viennese School and other avant-garde composers, the record companies, unlike the BBC, remained cautious about recording him in this repertory, and only a single recording of a Berg piece represents this side of Boult's work. In the core continental orchestral repertoire, Boult's recordings of the four symphonies of Brahms, and the Great <b>C</b> <b>major</b> Symphony of Schubert were celebrated in his lifetime and have remained in the catalogues during the three decades after his death. Late in his recording career he recorded four discs of excerpts from Wagner's operas, which received great critical praise. The exceptional breadth of Boult's repertoire has left some well-regarded recordings of works not immediately associated with him, among which are versions of Franck's Symphony (recorded in 1959), Dvořák's Cello Concerto with Mstislav Rostropovich (1958), and a pioneering recording of Mahler's Third Symphony taped live in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The most manifestly {{cyclical}} work of {{the three}} sonatas is the Sonata in A major. In the sonata's scherzo, a joyous passage in <b>C</b> <b>major</b> is suddenly interrupted by a fierce downward rushing scale in C-sharp minor, which closely recalls a parallel passage at {{the climax of the}} preceding movement; this is followed in the scherzo by a dance theme whose melody is derived from the Andantino's opening melody. This unique moment {{is one of the most}} explicit, audible cyclic references in the sonata trilogy. Another important cyclic element in the A major Sonata is the subtle similarities and connections that exist between each movement's ending and the following movement's opening; the connection between the opening and ending of the sonata as a whole, is even bolder: the sonata ends in a cancrizans of its opening, a framing device which is probably unprecedented in the sonata literature.|$|E
