40|$|The {{study of}} the {{internal}} organisation of Jayme II´s Registra secreta shows {{the existence of a}} specific «system» for the gathering of diplomatical registered papers in chapters called legatio. However, this method of classification does not exclude other ones and these registers can be considered as an experimental laboratory for the arrangement and the location of registered documents. The <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registers</b> and the interventions of the scribes within conduce then to look for the functions they are assigned with: allowing an easier control of the uses of the documentation by the king´s ambassadors, the Registra secreta take part, at the chancery, in a living memory of the administration of diplomatical matters. L'étude de l'économie interne des Registra secreta de Jacques II montre l'existence d'un «système» spécifique de rassemblement de la documentation diplomatique sous des rubriques legatio. Ce mode de classification n'est cependant pas exclusif, et les registres constituent un véritable lieu d'expérimentation pour l'ordonnancement et le repérage de la documentation enregistrée.

The report's major focal points include rates of eligibility, registration and voter turnout by race or ethnicity, age and income. <b>The</b> largest survey <b>of</b> voting behavior is the U. S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS and Population Estimates Program are <b>the</b> primary sources <b>of</b> data for this report, which presents frequency tables generated from responses to the November 2006 CPS. Some cross-tabulations are provided to show how those responses interact with race, income and age. This report is organized in three major sections: population, registration and voting. In the first section, we describe the size and demographic <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> Ohio's overall population and voting-eligible population. Next, we examine the racial (and ethnic), age and income characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's <b>registered</b> population. We conclude by describing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disparities in <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> and voting populations.

40|$|The {{matching}} {{function that}} postulates {{a relationship between}} <b>the</b> flow <b>of</b> new matches and stock of job seekers and vacancies has attracted considerable attention, both theoretical and empirical during the last decade. In this paper <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> a matching function are examined by using a large panel data set from Finland. The data has a high frequency and it is highly disaggregated, comprising monthly data on 174 work-to-travel areas from a 12 -year period between January 1991 and August 2002. We test for density effects, i. e. <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> markets on matching efficiency. The robustness and importance of our empirical findings are guaranteed by <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> data. First <b>the</b> data allows us to model matching functions for two different measures of endogenous variables, namely total matches and total outflow from unemployment. Second, we can measure job seekers by their origin, i. e. whether they are unemployed, employed or outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labour force. We can thus construct matching models where <b>the</b> measure <b>of</b> job matches and <b>the</b> pool <b>of</b> job searchers are consistent with each other. Third, the data includes information on <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> job seekers, including age, sex and <b>the</b> share <b>of</b> short- and long-term unemployment. These controls provide interesting information on possible differences in matching rates by these groups. ...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the year}} 2000, a plan begun for <b>the</b> {{numerical}} control <b>of</b> wild boars (Sus scrofa) in <b>the</b> province <b>of</b> Treviso. Initially, {{this type of}} control was conducted only by the Provincial Police, after this first phase the plan involved certified operators (hunters). The objective is {{to act on the}} determinating on adult females in order to strongly limit <b>the</b> increment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole population. The following 3 control techniques have been utilized: 1) shooting from selected sites, 2) live trapping and killing in cage traps (chiusini), 3) “random” shooting by the Provincial Police. The data were collected by operators and police agents immediately after <b>the</b> shooting <b>of</b> each single animal by filling a record card called the “ Record card of Information and Shooting”, and subsequently <b>registered</b> by <b>the</b> Hunting Office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Province <b>of</b> Treviso. <b>The</b> following age classes have been established: younger than 4 months (striated), between 5 and 12 months (reds), and older than 12 months (blacks). The present work takes into consideration and analyses the data relative to <b>the</b> general <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> animals and <b>the</b> biometrical dimensions collected (length from head to trunk, metatarsus length, chest measurement and length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout). The shootings took place throughout <b>the</b> whole territory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province, during the period from January 2006 through September 2009 inclusive. During this time, a total of 1264 animals were captured, with a maximum number of 397 boars being captured in 2008. The most frequently applied technique was shooting from selected sites and involved mainly animals older than 12 months (blacks). With <b>the</b> technique <b>of</b> cage traps, on <b>the</b> contrary, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals captured were below 12 months (striated and reds), even if <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> this particular method was limited. The “random” shooting method was used less and less over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> these 5 years. Concerning sex and age, <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> cases has shown that the specifications set forth for <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> this control plan have been adhered only partially. In fact, although the animals above 12 months (blacks) have been the ones most frequently captured, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> females shot was inferior to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males. It is evident that <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> wild boars in <b>the</b> Province <b>of</b> Treviso involves all alpine hunting district (northern area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province) and only sporadically <b>the</b> hunting areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan. According to <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data regarding biometrics, it has been revealed that the differences between males and females, although limited and concerning above all only 2 parameters (chest measurement and length head trunk), reveal a remarkable variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscle mass and, consequently, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weight. The correlations between total weight and the 4 morphometric parameters (length from head to trunk, metatarsus length, chest measurement and length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snout) are close, and decrease only slightly with an increase in age...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} paper reports <b>the</b> {{preliminary results}} <b>of</b> isotopic analyses {{that have been}} carried out on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> 55 water-wells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alluvial Friuli Plain. Most wells are located in the Low Plain between the spring and the coast lines, where a multistrata aquifer system characterizes the underground environment. One well is located in the High Plain, bounded by the Tagliamento moraines to the N and the spring line to the S; it reaches the unconfined aquifer system continuously developing in the highly pervious alluvial sediments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sector. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waters (sampled in April 2003 – April 2006 – July 2006 – October 2006 – March 2007) are shown and compared to the ones coming from 17 sampling points of surfacing spring waters and to <b>the</b> weighted mean <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipitations <b>registered</b> in some stations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area (Trieste, Basovizza, Udine and Rivo). <b>The</b> outcoming distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above-mentioned isotopes related with the Northern Italy Meteoric Water Line (MWL_S) and the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) supports <b>the</b> meteoric origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studied groundwaters. <b>The</b> involvement <b>of</b> precipitations occurring at higher altitude and/or at lower temperature in past ages is pointed out.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry is widely recognised as being inherent with risk and uncertainty. This necessitates {{the need for}} effective project risk management to achieve <b>the</b> project objectives <b>of</b> time, cost and quality. A popular tool employed in projects to aid in <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> risk is a risk register. This tool documents the project risks and is often employed by the Project Manager (PM) to manage the associated risks on a project. This research aims to ascertain how widely risk registers are used by Project Managers {{as part of their}} risk management practices. To achieve this aim entailed interviewing ten PMs, to discuss their use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk <b>register</b> as a risk management tool. The results from these interviews indicated <b>the</b> prevalent use <b>of</b> this document and recognised its effectiveness in <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> project risks. <b>The</b> findings identified the front end and feasibility phases of a project as crucial stages for using risk registers, noting it as a vital ingredient in the risk response planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision making process. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk <b>register</b> was also understood, with an insight into how PMs produce and develop this tool also ascertained. In conclusion, this research signifies <b>the</b> extensive use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk <b>register</b> by PMs. A majority of PMs were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> view that risk registers constitute an essential component of their project risk management practices. This suggests a need for further research {{on the extent to which}} risk registers actually help PMs to control the risks in a construction project, particularly residual risks, and how this can be improved to minimize deviations from expected outcomes. ...|$|R
