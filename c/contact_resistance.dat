25|$|For each {{interface}} between two objects {{in contact with}} each other, {{there will be a}} temperature drop across the interface. For such composite systems, the temperature drop across the interface may be appreciable.

Self-consistent simulations show that these extremely small nonalloyed <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> are due to {{the suppression of the}} depletion depth in the GaAs channel and tunneling through the SLS layer. Similar structures on InGaAs channels have led to nonalloyed specific <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> of about 1. 5 x 10 to the - 8 th ohm sq cm.

40|$|A gated four probe {{measurement}} technique to isolate <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> in field effect measurements on disordered organic semiconductors was investigated. Organic field effect transistors (OFETs) were prepared with two additional electrodes in the contact geometry protruding into the source-drain channel {{to monitor the}} variation in potential across the channel. Two high impedance electrometers {{were used to determine}} the potential at the contact. This technique allows to directly determine the magnitude of the parasitic <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> between metal <b>contact</b> and organic semi-conductor from the drop in potential at the contact regions. The effects of <b>contact</b> <b>resistances,</b> which can falsify measurements on bulk transport parameters such as the field effect mobility, can be then eliminated during material characterization. Additionally, the temperature and electric field dependence of the <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> offers valuable information about the charge injection and extraction processes between metal and organic semiconductor. The effects of the four probe geometry, specifically the effect of the channel electrodes on the current-voltage characteristics, of hole transport in a polythiophene (P 3 HT) OFET with Au contacts were investigated and found not to influence device performance, except at currents << 1 nA. The IV characteristics were shown to follow the expected FET behaviour. From the variation in potential along the channel it was found that <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> at the source contact (charge injecting contact) are minimal while <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> at the drain contact (charge extracting contact) are significant, resulting in a much lower effective source-drain voltage than that applied to the device...|$|R
25|$|When two solid bodies come in contact, such as A and B in Figure 1, heat {{flows from}} the hotter body to the colder body.

40|$|AbstractFor n-type {{solar cell}} concepts, B {{emitters}} are commonly diffused in a BBr 3 -based process. However, the metallization of these p+ layers is challenging. Up to now, low <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> on B emitters were only {{reported to be}} possible using Al-containing Ag screen-printing pastes. A drawback of the addition of Al to the paste is that, facilitated by the Al, deep metal spikes grow into the Si surface. As these spikes are deep enough to penetrate the emitter and affect the space charge region, they are made responsible for low Voc values that limit solar cell efficiency. However, in 2015 Engelhardt et al. reported specific <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> around 1 mΩcm 2 of Al-free Ag screen-printed contacts on B emitters diffused by inductively coupled plasma plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposited SiOx:B layers. In their process the doping layer remained on the wafer serving as surface passivation layer. The low <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> were attributed {{to the presence of}} the doping layer. In this work we use two Al-free Ag screen-printing pastes for contacting a BBr 3 -based B emitter. Specific <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> well below 10 mΩcm 2 are reached on alkaline textured wafers with dielectric layer. It is shown that with the use of Al-free Ag screen-printing pastes deep spiking can be avoided and therefore a wider window of firing parameters is available. These results allow the use of the same screen-printing paste {{on both sides of the}} solar cell. Additionally it is shown, that with an old generation Al-free Ag paste low specific <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> can only be achieved in a narrow firing window at low temperatures. The addition of Te to the old generation paste shifts and broadens the temperature range for which low specific <b>contact</b> <b>resistances</b> are reached to higher firing temperatures...|$|R

40|$|The {{fill factor}} {{determined}} from a measured current-voltage {{characteristic of a}} bare solar cell depends on the number and positions of the electrical contacting probes. Nine different geometries for contacting the front side busbars are {{used to measure the}} current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a 5 busbar industrial-type passivated emitter and rear totally diffused (PERT) solar cell under standard testing conditions. The fill factors of the measured I-V characteristics vary from 78. 5 %abs to 80. 6 %abs. We further measure the <b>contacting</b> <b>resistance</b> of 3 different contacting probes to estimate the sensitivity of measurements with different contacting geometries on random <b>resistance</b> variations. The <b>contacting</b> <b>resistance</b> is 60 mΩ for nine-point probes and 80 mΩ for four- and single-point probes. We determine the magnitude of <b>contacting</b> <b>resistance</b> variations from measurements at different probe positions to be ± 30 mΩ. Using this variation, we perform numerical simulations and find a larger sensitivity on random resistance variations for tandem- (pairs of current- and sense probes) compared to triplet (one sense- between two current probes) configurations. The corresponding fill factor deviation is approximately 0. 1 %abs for tandem configurations when the <b>contacting</b> <b>resistances</b> of up to two current probes are altered.

40|$|Coupled {{process and}} device {{simulation}} {{has been applied}} to investigate the physical processes which determine the performance and scaling properties of fully depleted thin-silicon-body SOI based (FD-SOI) NMOS transistors at gate lengths of 40 nm and below. A comparison of simulation results with measurements of electrical characteristics of the FD-SOI NMOS transistors showed that the electrical performance of such transistors can only be reproduced by simulation, if <b>contact</b> <b>resistances,</b> ballistic electron transport, quantum mechanical depletion of the electrons near the gate dielectric, and mechanical stress are accounted for. The mechanical stress in thin-silicon-body SOI transistors is simulated as a result of two silicidation processes: the source/drain contact CoSi 2 silicidation and NiSi gate silicidation. The resulting stress in the silicon channel at the end of processing is tensile along the gate length, non-uniform and reaches maximum values in excess of 1 GPa.
