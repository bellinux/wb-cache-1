50|$|The valve {{is usually}} {{constructed}} as a circular poppet valve with a <b>conical</b> <b>seat,</b> {{inserted into the}} cylinder from the outside. A protrusion on the inside is hit by the piston as it approaches top dead centre, forcing the valve open.|$|E
50|$|If {{the pilot}} valve is opened, water drains {{from the upper}} chamber and its {{pressure}} is reduced. The pilot valve is always larger in flowrate than the filling through the throttle valve. Pressure in the annular chamber now forces the piston upstream, lifting the valve body from the <b>conical</b> <b>seat</b> and opening the valve.|$|E

5000|$|By 1912 Anzani {{had built}} the world's first two row radial engine, the 10 {{cylinder}} Anzani 10, which came in two sizes, the bigger 12.1 litre one producing 100-110 hp. By the middle of 1913 the company had a double version with four rows of five cylinders, rated at 200 hp called the Anzani 20. [...] This was displayed at the Paris show of that year and had {{much in common with}} the ten cylinder engine. An air-cooled motor, its cylinders were made of cast iron, with integral cooling fins. [...] The pistons and their rings were also cast iron, machined inside and out. <b>Conical</b> <b>seats</b> for the inlet and exhaust valves were ground into the flat cylinder head, the nickel steel valves being of the poppet type. The automatic, atmospheric pressure operated inlet vales of the earliest Anzani engines were retained, but, as in other later Anzanis the exhaust valves were push-rod and rocker operated.|$|R
50|$|Anti-dribble {{action is}} {{provided}} by a second valve <b>seat,</b> below the <b>conical</b> main <b>seat</b> (i.e. on the pump side). This is a cylindrical valve, fitting a cylindrical seat. This valve seat closes first, before the mitre valve, and shuts off the fuel flow. As the seat is cylindrical though, the spring pressure does not hold the seat surfaces {{together to make a}} tight seal, and so the mitre valve is still needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{check valve}} aspect is a conical valve or 'mitre valve', held against a {{matching}} <b>conical</b> <b>seat</b> by a spring. As these valves must work at high pressure, the valve faces are accurately ground to shape. The valve is also held accurately concentric to its seat by a fluted extension, usually cross-shaped or three-winged, below the seat. This extension {{is merely a}} guide and does not act as a valve.|$|E
50|$|Wheels must {{be fitted}} {{with the correct}} type of lug nuts on wheel studs, or bolts. Lug nuts (aka wheel nuts in British English) are usually either flat, tapered (generally at 60 degrees and {{referred}} to as <b>conical</b> <b>seat),</b> or ball seats, meaning the mounting surfaces are flat, tapered, or spherical respectively.Most Mercedes have ball lug seats from the factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered lug design. Wrong lug nuts for the wheel will not properly center it and cause wobble. Some manufacturers (e.g. Toyota and Lexus) have used taper lug nuts for steel wheels and flat seated lug nuts for alloy wheels.|$|E

40|$|Arguably {{the most}} complex <b>conical</b> {{functions}} are <b>seated</b> in human cognition, the how and why {{of which have been}} debated for centuries by theologians, philosophers and scientists alike. In his best-selling book, An Astonishing Hypothesis: A Scientific Search for the Soul, Francis Crick refined the view that these qualities are determined solely by cortical cells and circuitry. Put simply, cognition is nothing more, or less, than a biological function. Accepting this to be the case, {{it should be possible to}} identify the mechanisms that subserve cognitive processing. Since the pioneering studies of Lorent de No and Hebb, and the more recent studies of Fuster, Miller and Goldman-Rakic, to mention but a few, much attention has been focused on the role of persistent neural activity in cognitive processes. Application of modern technologies and modelling techniques has led to new hypotheses about the mechanisms of persistent activity. Here I focus on how regional variations in the pyramidal cell phenotype may determine the complexity of cortical circuitry and, in turn, influence neural activity. Data obtained from thousands of individually injected pyramidal cells in sensory, motor, association and executive cortex reveal marked differences in the numbers of putative excitatory inputs received by these cells. Pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex have, on average, up to 23 times more dendritic spines than those in the primary visual area. I propose that without these specializations in the structure of pyramidal cells, and the circuits they form, human cognitive processing would not have evolved to its present state. I also present data from both New World and Old World monkeys that show varying degrees of complexity in the pyramidal cell phenotype in their prefrontal cortices, suggesting that cortical circuitry and, thus, cognitive styles are evolving independently in different species...|$|R

More in details, starting from the analysis of the experimental behavior of an actual valve showing inefficient characteristic curves, the metering openings leading to the transition from under to over compensation are individuated. Then, a 3 D CFD steady-state, incompressible and isothermal analysis is involved, mainly to evidence the valve discharge coefficient and flow-forces variations with operating conditions. After, two alternative valve configurations, presenting a low pressure region designed to optimize the flow-forces compensation, are characterized through the 3 D CFD analysis...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} design of an all metal, fast response, bipropellant, shut-off valve {{for use on}} long duration space missions is reported. The valve provides the flow control capability for a 1, 000 lb thrust, bipropellant engine using oxygen difluoride and diborane as propellants. The shutoff seal selection is a soft-on-hard metal concept. The soft seal is a spherical shell that seats against a hard <b>conical</b> <b>seat.</b> Beryllium copper and beryllium nickel seals were selected to seal against an electrolyzed Inconel 718 seat. Poppet shaft sealing is achieved by use of hydroformed, Inconel 718 bellows.

40|$|A {{torque meter}} {{comprising}} hollow-keyed, {{input and output}} female shafts adapted to receive the male shafts of the power source and machine respectively. Each shaft has a circular flange whose face is perpendicular to the center line of the shafts. Each flange has a plurality of equally spaced cylindrical recesses machined into the inside face thereto adapted to receive conical inserts therein. Balls are contained by the conical inserts and transmit the rotational movement from the input to the output shaft. A stationary housing extends around the input and output shaft and has a transducer shell secured thereto. When {{force is applied to}} the input shaft to cause movement, the balls encounter torsional resistance which causes the balls to roll up the ramps of the <b>conical</b> <b>seat</b> inserts to separate the two torque flanges. The force transmitted through the balls causes rotation to the output shaft and produces tension to the stationary transducer shell. The stationary transducer shell is instrumented with semi-conductor strain gauges...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discloses}} {{the design}} procedure of a docking mechanism for space applications. The mechanism has {{to recover the}} misalignments between two spacecraft, {{as well as to}} dissipate the energy due to the relative velocity that is left by the precision limits of GNC system during docking maneuvers. The proposed mechanism is composed of an active part mounted on a chaser spacecraft and a passive one mounted on a target spacecraft. The active part is equipped with a variable length probe made of a linear actuator hinged on an active two degrees of freedom rotational joint. A couple of electrical actuators conveniently installed control the orientation movement of the main one, in order to point it towards a specific housing on the target. The pointing movements are controlled by means of an optical system. A clasping device is placed on the tip of the probe to accomplish the soft docking with a <b>conical</b> <b>seat</b> mounted on the target side. This seat is hinged by a passive two degrees of freedom rotational joint so as to allow it to be oriented under the action of the active probe. Once the rod is inserted inside the <b>conical</b> <b>seat,</b> the probe is retracted. The retraction progressively approaches both spacecraft, and orients them toward the central position. Before the retraction ends a set of passive shock absorbers provides a final alignment. Finally, the hard docking takes place with several hooks creating a stiff coupling between the spacecraft. The main probe actuator and the actuators that control the probe rotation are optimized in terms of relative kinetic energy dissipation, energy consumption and exchanged force reduction during the maneuver between spacecraft. The paper describes the system layout and the different control phases of the docking maneuver. It examines the design parameters in order to provide a preliminary configuration of the mechanism, as well as the main requirements for the mechanical components, actuators, and sensors. Moreover, a 3 D mathematical model to study the interaction between target and chaser during docking maneuver is presented. Dynamic simulations have been used to design proper geometries for the mechanical interfaces, to create and tune the parameters of the system components, as well as to define sensors requirements.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this work is {{the design of a}} docking {{mechanism}} for the STRONG mission. This foresees the transport of a standard space platform carrying payloads from Low Earth Orbit into greater orbits by means of a space tug. The mission periodically also envisions the refueling of the space tug by a dedicated docking mechanism with an orbital tank. On the base of the mission described above, the task of this mechanism is to mechanically couple the space tug with LEO located space vehicles. The docking system has to recover the maximum position and attitude misalignments, due to the GNC performances, between the two spacecraft during the docking maneuver. To do this several concepts have been defined aiming to provide different solutions to the docking problem. Among these concepts the optimal solution may be found by defining some trade-off criteria and applying them to a selection procedure. Draft design tools have been created for each concept in order to evaluate their characteristic parameters involved in the trade off procedure. Four mechanical concepts were individuated: a mechanism based on the Stewart-Gough platform, a passive central mechanism (probe-drogue), a mechanism formed by articulated arms transporting grippers to grasp the mounting ring of the expendable launch system Vega and a central active mechanism. The first mechanism is a 6 SPS parallel manipulator that may operate following two different control approaches for the soft docking phase. The first control logic is characterized by a position control loop with an optical feedback. The second one instead rules the impedance of the platform. The second concept is a "classical" probe-drogue mechanism similar to the one present in the Russian Progress, Soyuz and the European ATV spacecrafts. This mechanism consists of a rod mounted on the chaser that has to be introduced inside a <b>conical</b> <b>seat</b> on the target side. The third mechanism consists of one active degree of freedom group of articulated arms equipped with grippers able to grasp the mounting ring present in all the payloads launched with the Vega rocket. Finally, the last mechanism is a three degrees of freedom central mechanism. This mechanism is at first controlled in position with an optical sensor. This phase ends when the rod of the mechanism is inserted inside a small <b>conical</b> <b>seat.</b> Subsequently, spring loaded elements perform the soft docking followed by an impedance control phase and then the hard docking phase concludes the task. The paper shows the analysis carried out to provide a preliminary design of the mentioned concepts that will be the base of a trade off procedure to select the optimal on...|$|E
