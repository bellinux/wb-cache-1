5|$|As of 1994, {{the line}} was intact and {{operational}} from Ganddal to Foss-Eigeland and the cement factory there. Here, an internal crane track has been welded across the line. From Foss-Eigeland to Figgjo, the track is intact. At Figgjo, a bridge has been demolished, {{and it is not}} possible to traverse that section. Except for a number of level crossings where the tracks have been asphalted over, the line remains intact to Ålgård. At Ålgård Station the tracks have been removed, but the station building and depot remains. The station at Foss-Eigeland has been converted to a church, while the station at Figgjo had been taken over by a wholesaler. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The Norwegian National Rail Administration retains ownership and <b>can</b> <b>in</b> the future renovate the line for operation.|$|E

Before the WWE Championship match, Eugene came to the ring to cut a promo. He reminded the fans that he was Eric Bischoff's nephew, before being interrupted by The Sandman.

5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid <b>can,</b> <b>in</b> theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum <b>can,</b> <b>in</b> turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing <b>can</b> <b>in</b> turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E

5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions <b>can</b> <b>in</b> turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can {{have a significant effect}} on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, Cau et al. reconsidered {{the ecology}} of Balaur again in their reevaluation of its phylogenetic position, arguing that if Balaur was an avialan, it would be phylogenetically {{bracketed}} by taxa {{known to have been}} herbivorous, such as Sapeornis and Jeholornis. This suggests a non-hypercarnivorous lifestyle to be a more parsimonious conclusion and supports Cau's initial interpretations of its specializations. This is also indicated by the reduced third finger, the lack of a gynglymoid lower articulation of the second metatarsal and the rather small and moderately recurved second toe claw. Balaur had a broad pelvis, a broad foot, a large first toe, and broad lower ends of the metatarsals relative to the articulation surfaces; such a combination <b>can</b> <b>in</b> the remainder of the Theropoda only be found with the herbivorous Therizinosauridae.|$|E

5|$|Ngô Đình Cẩn (1911 – 9 May 1964) was {{a younger}} brother and confidant of South Vietnam's first president, Ngô Đình Diệm, and an {{important}} member of the Diệm government.

5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine.

In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis <b>can</b> <b>in</b> itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs <b>can,</b> <b>in</b> practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E
5|$|Standard USB hub ports {{can provide}} from the typical 500mA/2.5W of current, only 100mA from non-hub ports.
