40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the controls on organic, inorganic, and volatile species distributions in hydrothermal fluids venting at Von Damm and Piccard, two recently discovered vent fields at the ultra slow spreading Mid-Cayman Rise, Earth's deepest mid-ocean ridge. A {{wide variety of}} possible temperatures and substrates for fluid/rock reaction exist at ultraslow spreading ridges. The flux of chemicals delivered to the ocean by circulating vent fluids exerts a major control on mass transfer {{into and out of}} the oceanic crust and supports chemosynthetic ecosystems. In Chapter 2, abiotic organic synthesis is shown to occur via two distinct mechanisms in the serpentinizing Von Damm system. Longstanding questions concerning the spatial, temporal, and mechanistic nature of carbon transformations in deep-sea hot springs are addressed. In contrast with the current paradigm, CH 4 is not actively forming during circulation of H 2 -rich vent fluids, but instead is derived from fluid inclusions in the host rocks. Chapters 3 and 4 present in-depth studies of the chemical and isotopic compositions of aqueous species in vent fluids at Von Damm and Piccard to elucidate the role of reaction temperature, pressure, substrate composition, and water/rock mass ratios during the chemical evolution of hydrothermal fluids at oceanic spreading centers. At Von Damm, sequential reaction of gabbroic and peridotite substrates at intermediate temperatures can explain generation of the observed fluids. Geochemical modeling shows that talc-quartz assemblage is expected to precipitate during fluid mixing with seawater at the seafloor. At Piccard, extremely high temperature subsurface water/rock reaction results in high temperature fluids that are richer in dissolved H 2 than any previously observed fluids worldwide. At both locations, high-H 2 conditions promote the abiotic reduction of [Epsilon]CO 2 to formate species, which may fuel a subsurface biosphere. In Chapter 5, multiple sulfur isotopes were measured on metal sulfide deposits, So, and fluid H 2 S to constrain sulfur sources and the isotopic systematics of precipitation in a wide variety of seafloor hydrothermal vents. Areas studied include the eastern Manus Basin and Lau Basin back-arc spreading centers, the unsedimented basalt-hosted Southern East Pacific Rise, and the sediment-hosted Guaymas Basin mid-ocean ridge spreading centers. Limited isotope fractionation between fluid H 2 S and precipitating chalcopyrite implies that sulfur isotopes in a <b>chimney</b> <b>lining</b> may record past hydrothermal activity. by Jill Marie McDermott.

50|$|The {{courthouse}} {{is designed}} in the Second Empire style with traces of Italianate style. The rectangular building is lined with Buena Vista sandstone with a rusticated foundation and smooth stones lining the floors above. The windows were designed as arches until long rectangular panels were placed during the renovation. Above each window is a decorative head casing {{in the shape of}} an arch or pediment. A central projection on the front facade is topped by a tower. The tower contains the main entrance with pilasters on either side holding a balcony. A pediment rests at the top floor and is surmounted by a statue of Justice. The tower rises to a dome which is capped by a spire. Four stone <b>chimneys</b> <b>line</b> the sides of the courthouse. The flat roof was once a mansard and is supported by a decorative entablature.|$|R

60|$|As the Prince spoke, Beckendorff {{stood with}} his arms crossed behind him, and his chin resting upon his chest, but his eyes {{at the same time}} so raised as to look his Highness full in the face. Vivian was so struck by his posture and the {{expression}} of his countenance, that he nearly omitted to bow when he was presented. As his name was mentioned, the Minister gave him a sharp, sidelong glance, and moving his head slightly, invited his guests to enter the house. The gentlemen accordingly complied with his request. Passing through the bow window, they found themselves in a well-sized room, the sides of which were covered with shelves filled with richly-bound books. There was nothing in the room which gave the slightest indication that the master of the library was any other than a private gentleman. Not a book, not a chair was out of its place. A purple inkstand of Sèvre, and a highly-tooled morocco portfolio of the same colour, reposed on a marqueterie table, and that was all. No papers, no despatches, no red tape, and no red boxes.

50|$|A {{traditional}} {{weaving mill}} {{would have a}} two- or three-storey preparation area for pirning the yarn, beaming and sizing attached to an engine house with a 500 hp mill engine, boiler house and <b>chimney.</b> The <b>line</b> shafts from the engine would pass into a large single-storey weaving shed with its characteristic sawtooth roof with north lights. Weaving was the principal activity here, the larger spinning mills of the Oldham Limited of the late 19th century ware built in towns further south. The Burnley loom was a narrow loom that produced grey cloth suitable for printing. Here we find many such stone-built mills such as the Waterloo Shed north of Trafalgar Street and the Wiseman Street Shed, the Sandygate Shed (c1860), and the brick-built Woodfield Mill (1886).|$|R

Between 1945 and 1947, the Reading Railroad rebuilt thirty of their heavy I-10 class 2-8-0 Consolidations to booster-fitted 4-8-4 Northern locomotives with 70 in diameter driving wheels. An additional ring was added at the smokebox {{end of the}} boiler, which increased {{the length of the}} boiler tubes from 13 ft to 20 ft, and a larger smokebox was installed which increased the distance between the tube plate and the <b>chimney</b> centre <b>line</b> from 34 in to 111 in. Steam pressure was raised from [...] Four syphons were fitted, three in the firebox proper and one in the combustion chamber. A twelve-wheeled tender was attached, weighing 167 tons in working order, with a capacity of 23.5 tons of coal and 19000 gal of water. A new cast-steel frame was used, with the cylinders cast integral and roller bearings on all axles. They were reclassified to T1 and numbered 2100 to 2129. Two of these locomotives, preserved for hauling special trains, were still in use in 1963.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe present {{high-resolution}} (R= 400 000) {{observations of}} interstellar Ca ii and Na i absorption lines towards seven {{stars in the}} direction of the southern opening of the recently identified Local Interstellar <b>Chimney.</b> These <b>lines</b> of sight probe the lower Galactic halo (0. 3 ≲|z|≲ 2. 5 kpc), without the complication of sampling dense foreground interstellar material. In addition to components with velocities expected from Galactic rotation, these stars also exhibit components with negative local standard of rest velocities, which are contrary to the sense of Galactic rotation for the sightlines observed. After a discussion of possible origins for these peculiar velocities, we conclude that at least some of them result from gas falling towards the Galactic plane from distances of |z|≳ 300 pc. The narrow linewidths are generally inconsistent with temperatures as high as the ∼ 6000 K generally assumed for the so-called Lockman layer. Rather, the picture that emerges is one of a scattered, generally infalling, population of high-|z| diffuse clouds, seemingly not very different from those encountered in the local interstellar medium. Overall, we argue that our results are most consistent with a ‘Galactic fountain’ model...|$|R
50|$|By 1897 Prior had {{developed}} {{his theory of}} texture. Prior {{tried to find a}} way beyond historical style and vernacular logic. The wall surfaces are highly textured, incorporating the philosophy Prior expounded in his paper. The cavity walls are of brick, with a locally quarried red sandstone outer leaf. Pebbles from the beach and river are embedded in the mass concrete, adding pattern and texture to the walls. The stone is roughly dressed, uncoursed and varied by the inclusion of large boulders. The building was originally thatched. The large <b>chimney</b> stacks were <b>lined</b> with terracotta flues and cased in sandstone with spark arresters. The upper floors were constructed of concrete reinforced with nine inch logs at two and a half foot centres. This was partly done as fireproofing.|$|R
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the <b>chimney.</b> Each incineration <b>line</b> has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|R
40|$|Birds have {{undoubtedly}} been {{colliding with}} manmade structures ever since humans started building things skyward. The earliest documented instances of collision mortali- ty {{in this country}} are from the late 18002 ̆ 7 s (Coues 1876, Merriam 1885) and the problems continue unabated today. The total avian mortality due to collisions with manmade obstacles is probably greater every year as buildings, towers, <b>chimneys,</b> overhead power <b>lines,</b> and other structures are erected in ever-increasing numbers. Weir (1976) provides an excellent review of bird migration, weather, and collision mortality associated with various types of structures. The biological significance of collision mortality to any species is unknown. There are too many other factors, such as total population size, natural mortality levels, and other human related influences, for which insufficient data exist {{to be able to put}} the collision mortality factor in proper perspective. Recognizing these limitations, Banks (1979) recently analyzed avian mortality, including collisions, related to human activities and estimated that about 4. 75 million (0. 05...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} novel {{indication}} {{for the use}} of chimney grafts to preserve flow to the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for aortobi-iliac aneurysms with coexistent bilateral occlusion of the internal iliac arteries (IIA). Technique: Via a cutdown over the left axillary artery, a 5 -F vertebral catheter was delivered over a conventional 0. 035 -inch hydrophilic guidewire to selectively catheterize the IMA via a 7 -F shuttle sheath, which was then advanced at least 2 cm into the target vessel. The first chimney graft was advanced into the sheath, and a standard EVAR procedure followed. The chimney graft was deployed at least 2 cm in the IMA; a second chimney graft was advanced and deployed with at least 2 cm overlapping with the first chimney stent parallel and outside of the main abdominal endograft and below the lowest renal artery. The <b>chimney</b> grafts were <b>lined</b> with additional bare nitinol stents. The technique is demonstrated in two male patients who suffered from symptomatic aortobi-iliac aneurysm with patent IMAs and bilateral IIA occlusion.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a surge of {{interest}} in the use of UAVs for asset surveying applications including <b>chimney</b> stacks, power <b>lines,</b> wind turbines and other structural assets. Most commercial systems available are manual, relying on a human operator to fly the UAV or drone, and a manual process of image stitching and analysis to check for faults and defects. Errors in the position of the inspection drone make guaranteeing full coverage and accurate defect registration particularly problematic with this approach. This paper details our work at University of Strathclyde, conducted under the UK Research Centre in Non-Destructive Evaluation, in areas that are essential to improving the accuracy of such drone based structural asset inspection; we describe this set of approaches for improving the ability of drones to make such measurements. We present the results of a study aimed at better understanding of the positional accuracy and stability of UAV’s when used in indoor and outdoor environments for inspection purposes, utilising high precision laser tracking and photogrammetric approaches. Coverage path planning approaches were implemented to ensure full area coverage and provide accurate registration of faults. Finally, using image stitching – it is possible to get both full area visualisation of the structure, and more importantly to reconstruct a 3 D CAD model of the surface of the structure under inspectio...|$|R
6000|$|A {{few days}} ago the {{industry}} suffered a check which, lasting not more than two minutes, lost several hundred pounds of hand-fired tea. It was something after this way. Into the stillness of a hot, stuffy morning came an unpleasant noise as of batteries of artillery charging up all the roads together, {{and at least one}} bewildered sleeper waking saw his empty boots where they 'sat and played toccatas stately at the clavicord.' It was the washstand really but the effect was awful. Then a clock fell and a wall cracked, and heavy hands caught the house by the roof-pole and shook it furiously. To preserve an equal mind when things are hard is good, but he who has not fumbled desperately at bolted jalousies that will not open while a whole room is being tossed in a blanket does not {{know how hard it is}} to find any sort of mind at all. The end of the terror was inadequate--a rush into the still, heavy outside air, only to find the' servants in the garden giggling (the Japanese would giggle through the Day of Judgment) and to learn that the earthquake was over. Then came the news, swift borne from the business quarters below the hill, that the coolies of certain factories had fled shrieking at the first shock, and that all the tea in the pans was burned to a crisp. That, certainly, was some consolation for undignified panic; and there remained the hope that a few tall <b>chimneys</b> up the <b>line</b> at Tokio would have collapsed. They stood firm, however, and the local papers, used to this kind of thing, merely spoke of the shock as 'severe.' Earthquakes are demoralising; but they bring out all the weaknesses of human nature. First is downright dread; the stage of--'only let me get into the open and I'll reform,' then the impulse to send news of the most terrible shock of modern times flying east and west among the cables. (Did not your own hair stand straight on end, and, therefore, must not everybody else's have done likewise?) Last, as fallen humanity picks itself together, comes the cry of the mean little soul: 'What! Was that all? I wasn't frightened from the beginning.' ...|$|R
