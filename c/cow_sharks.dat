40|$|The large size, high {{trophic level}} and wide {{distribution}} of Hexanchiformes (<b>cow</b> and frilled <b>sharks)</b> should position this order as important apex predators in coastal and deep-water ecosystems. This review synthesizes available information on Hexanchiformes, including information not yet published, {{with the purpose}} of evaluating their conservation status and assessing their ecological roles in the dynamics of marine ecosystems. Comprising six species, this group has a wide global distribution, with members occurring from shallow coastal areas to depths of c. 2500 m. The limited information available on their reproductive biology suggests that they could be vulnerable to overexploitation (e. g. small litter sizes for most species and suspected long gestation periods). Most of the fishing pressure exerted on Hexanchiformes {{is in the form of}} commercial by-catch or recreational fishing. Comprehensive stock and impact assessments are unavailable for most species in most regions due to limited information on life history and catch and abundance time series. When hexanchiform species have been commercially harvested, however, they have been unable to sustain targeted fisheries for long periods. The potentially high vulnerability to intense fishing pressure warrants a conservative exploitation of this order until thorough quantitative assessments are conducted. At least some species have been shown to be significant apex predators in the systems they inhabit. Should Hexanchiformes be removed from coastal and deep-water systems, the lack of sympatric shark species that share the same resources suggests no other species would be capable of fulfilling their apex predator role in the short term. This has potential ecosystem consequences such as meso-predator release or trophic cascades. This review proposes some hypotheses on the ecology of Hexanchiformes and their role in ecosystem dynamics, highlighting the areas where critical information is required to stimulate research directions...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} life history {{patterns}} is vital in understanding how organisms {{have evolved to}} fit in the natural world. This generally involves examining features that are both physiological and behavioral, and correlate to the dynamics of growth and reproduction throughout an organism’s life cycle. Chondrichthyan fishes are unique in the fact they have evolved a very different set of life history parameters from teleosts which has made them extremely vulnerable to over fishing. Determining both the general and species-specific life history patterns in elasmobranchs is a pivotal first step in understanding how their life history strategies will influence population growth or decline, but {{a limited amount of}} biological information is available on most species. Sharks in the order Hexanchiformes represent several interesting paradoxes among neoselechians. They are considered some the most ancient and widespread of sharks as well as top predators throughout much of their range, but still remain poorly understood in terms of their specific life history patterns. The overall effect of decreasing numbers of apex predators in marine systems, such as Hexanchids, is tremendously difficult to foresee but appears to be ecologically and economically significant, as well as long lasting. The status of many Hexanchid stocks remains data deficient, although worldwide fishing pressure remains prevalent. The particular life history traits of Hexanchiformes suggest they are highly K selected as a group and possess low ecological resilience, making them highly vulnerable to over-exploitation. By investigating the life history characteristics of <b>cow</b> and frilled <b>sharks</b> and incorporating the data into a Life History Matrix for Hexanchiformes any lack of critical life history information will be readily identifiable, allowing for greater insight when establishing regulations and policies aimed at conservation...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} taxonomy, biogeography and biology of <b>cow</b> and frilled <b>sharks</b> (Chondrichthyes: Hexanchiformes). This taxon comprises two families, four genera and six extant species. The hexanchoids are a distinctive group of sharks characterized by six or seven paired gill openings, a single dorsal fin and an anal fin. Adult males of this group lack a siphon sac, but have in its place a clasper sac. This structure, which develops along the claspers, is unique to the Hexanchiformes. Hexanchoid sharks are widely distributed in area and depth. This group ranges from coastal bays and harbors along the open coast out across the continental shelf and down along the slopes to considerable depths. They occur from the equatorial zone to sub-polar regions. However, {{little is known about}} the ecology and life history of these sharks. Intraspecific variation of meristic counts were generally low for the Hexanchidae, but high for the Chlamydoselachidae, indicating that subpopulations, subspecies or even additional, new species exist within this family. Based on the indicators used in this study, maturity in male frilled sharks was attained at 916 mm TL, perlon sharks between 700 and 800 mm TL, sixgill sharks approximately 3140 mm TL, bigeyed sixgill sharks at about 1250 mm TL and sevengill sharks at approximately 1550 mm TL. Male reproductive success did not appear to be seasonal since males were found to contain viable sperm all year round. Female perlon sharks begin maturing between 950 mm and 1100 mm TL. Gravid females and newborns were absent from the other size classes and it is suspected that they aggregate in different locations to those of adult males and non-breeding females. Adult females are known at 4210 mm TL and immature at 3500 mm TL, However, a more accurate estimate of the size at maturity is wanting. Newborn sixgills were caught off southern Namibia during mid to late summer over three successive seasons. The occurrence of gravid females carrying term embryos during spring months and newborns during the summer months suggests a late spring or summer pupping period. Sixgill and sevengill sharks give birth in areas of high primary productivity. Energetically, this is advantageous for the newborns to be placed in an area with an abundant food source. The rapid growth rates of sixgill and sevengill sharks over the first year would enhance their survivorship since neither species has many predators. The number of female sevengills entering the breeding population is regulated to ensure that some portion of the population is reproductively active at any one time. The "staggering" of females which enter into the breeding population in any given year indicates a two year reproductive cycle. Fecundity estimates for 19 specimens with a largest egg diameter of at least 40 mm indicates a litter size of 67 to 104. The recapture of an adult female sevengill in approximately the same location in which it was tagged suggests that the same individual sharks may return to the same breeding grounds. As with any predators, sharks tend to exploit advantages over their prey. The hexanchoids, especially the sevengill, have evolved complex foraging strategies including social facilitation whereby they actively hunt in packs for large prey species. Sharks of the order Hexanchiformes, although lacking the diversity of the major shark orders, nonetheless play an integral role in the marine environment. The group's success can be attributed to their apical trophic position. In most habitats in which they occur, hexanchoids have no comparable competitors since equivalent sized sympatric squaloids and carcharhinoids feed at a lower trophic level...|$|R
