The plasma levels of TGF-β 1 and VEGF were tested by ELISA. The relationship between plasma levels of TGF-β 1, VEGF and <b>CT</b> perfusion <b>imaging</b> parameters were analyzed.

Methods Sixty-four patients with benign and malignant pulmonary nodules underwent 16 -slice spiral <b>CT</b> perfusion <b>imaging.</b> The <b>CT</b> perfusion <b>imaging</b> was analyzed for TDC (time density curve), perfusion parametric maps, and the respective perfusion parameters. Immunohistochemical findings of MVD (microvessel density) measurement and VEGF expression was evaluated. Results The shape of the TDC of peripheral lung cancer was similar to those of inflammatory nodule. PH (peak height), PHpm/PHa (peak height ratio of pulmonary nodule to aorta), BF (blood flow), BV (blood volume) value of peripheral lung cancer and inflammatory nodule were not statistically significant (all P > 0. 05). Both showed significantly higher PH, PHpm/PHa, BF, BV value than those of benign nodule (all P 0. 05). In the case of adenocarcinoma, BV, BF, PS, PHpm/PHa, and MVD between poorly and well differentiation and between poorly and moderately differentiation were statistically significant (all P 0. 05). PH, PHpm/PHa, BV, and PS of benign nodule were significantly lower than those of peripheral lung cancer (all P Conclusion Multi-slice spiral <b>CT</b> perfusion <b>imaging</b> closely correlated with tumor angiogenesis and reflected MVD measurement and VEGF expression.

Today it is the gold standard for most surgeries. Starting with a simple appendectomy, partial kidney resections and partial liver resections, etc. The laparoscopic approach is expanding. The image quality, the possibility of imaging the patient in the surgical position and the guidance of the instruments facilitate this approach.(Efficacy of DynaCT for surgical navigation during complex laparoscopic surgery: an initial experience. Partial resection of the kidney, leaving as much healthy tissue, meaning kidney function to the patient has been described some time ago (Nephron sparing surgery for renal tumors: indications, techniques and outcomes.). The challenges the surgeons face is the loss of natural 3D vision and tactile sensing. Through small ports he/she has to rely on the images provided by the endoscope and is unable to feel the tissue. In a hybrid operating room the anatomy can be updated and imaged in real time. 3D images can be fused and/or overlaid on live fluoroscopy or the endoscope.
