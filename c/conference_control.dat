Other control functionality enabled by MSCML {{includes the}} ability to increase or decrease the volume on a leg or on the call and the capability to create sub-conferences. MSCML also addresses other feature requirements for large-scale conferencing applications, such as sizing and resizing of a conference. SIP and MSCML are used to develop and deploy services within the IP applications and services architecture. This network topology consists of application servers and media servers which work together in a client-server relationship, with application servers (clients) providing the service logic for each specific application and the media server (server) acting as a shared media processing resource for the applications. The media server operates as an independent entity, managing and allocating its processing resources to match the requirements of each application. Its primary role is to handle requests from the application server for performing media processing on packetized media streams.|$|E

40|$|<b>Conference</b> <b>control</b> is an {{integral}} part in many-to-many communications that is used to manage and co-ordinate multiple users in conferences. There are different types of conferences which require different types of control. Some of the features of <b>conference</b> <b>control</b> may be user invoked while others are for internal management of a conference. In recent years, ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) have standardised two main models of conferencing, each system providing a set of <b>conference</b> <b>control</b> functionalities that are not easily provided in the other one.

40|$|Peer to Peer (P 2 P) systems {{inherently}} {{have high}} scalability, robustness and fault tolerance {{because there is}} no centralized server and the network self-organizes itself. This is achieved at the cost of higher latency for locating the resources of interest in the P 2 P overlay network. This paper describes the design and implementation of campus video conference system based on P 2 P architecture that was tested within premises of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria. The proposed Campus video conference system is made up of five modules which are the media stream engine, the <b>conferencing</b> <b>control</b> protocol, transmission module, TCP/UDP module and the user interface module. The media stream engine is responsible for audio/video capture and playback, the <b>conferencing</b> <b>control</b> protocol defines a set of conventions governing the structure and behavior of communication messages, the transmission module consists of a peer and a distribution network constituting of the peers also the delivery and exchange of streaming data while the audio manager and video manager use TCP/UDP to broadcast to other peer. The proposed system will offer smooth video conferencing with low delay and seldom and short freezes. It is believed that this videoconference system will bring video telephony to a new level of quality and will lead to a new trend in everyday communications in the university community...|$|R

This paper describes, CAIRO (Collaborative Agent Interaction and synchROnization system), a system for managing participants in a distributed conference.
