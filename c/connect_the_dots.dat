5|$|Dylan, a 28 year-old grad student, is {{depressed}} {{because he}} {{is in love with}} his best friend, Kira, but she is dating Dylan's roommate, Mason. He has a cynical worldview and criticizes the world for its materialism, {{and at the same time}} wishes he could connect better with the people in it. When his roommate is away one night, Dylan and Kira begin a secret affair. When Dylan overhears Mason and Kira discussing how pitiful he is, Dylan decides to commit suicide. He jumps off a tall building, but survives due to unlikely events. That night, he is visited by a demon who claims he spared Dylan's life. The demon says Dylan must now murder one person for every additional month he wants to live. Dylan convinces himself this was a hallucination, but he begins to grow sick as the end of the month approaches. When the demon appears a second time, Dylan decides to track down a man who molested Dylan's friend when they were children. After shooting him, Dylan's sickness goes away. The next month, Dylan struggles to find another target he feels deserves to die. He settles on a brothel run by a Russian mob. He murders one of the men, but is violently beaten by one of the sex workers before he escapes. His unexplained injuries lead Kira to end their secret romance, although they remain friends. Dylan begins taking boxing lessons and stalking a corrupt businessman. A detective, Lily Sharpe, begins to <b>connect</b> <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> between Dylan's murders; the Russian mob begins to hunt for Dylan.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert, in {{a review}} for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of four, {{considering}} it confusing and uninteresting. He also included the film in his [...] "most hated films" [...] list.

[...] In his review for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson wrote, [...] "Ultimately, The Usual Suspects may be too clever for its own good.

500|$|Pre-Code scholar Thomas Doherty {{summarized}} the practical effects: Even for moral guardians of Breen's dedication, however, film censorship {{can be a}} tricky business. Images must be cut, dialogue overdubbed or deleted, and explicit messages and subtle implications excised from what the argot of film criticism calls the [...] "diegesis". Put simply, the diegesis is {{the world of the}} film, the universe inhabited by the characters existing in the landscape of cinema. [...] "Diegetic" [...] elements are experienced by the characters in the film and (vicariously) by the spectator; [...] "nondiegetic" [...] elements are apprehended by the spectator alone.... The job of the motion picture censor is to patrol the diegesis, keeping an eye and ear out for images, languages, and meanings that should be banished from the world of film.... The easiest part of the assignment is to <b>connect</b> <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> and connect what is visually and verbally forbidden by name. … More challenging is the work of the textual analysis and narrative rehabilitation that discerns and redirects hidden lessons and moral meanings.|$|E

He could not afford to buy the numerous rolls of 16mm film required to shoot live action.

2500|$|In {{a special}} for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver said that [...] "What has puzzled many {{observers}} about the Occupy Wall Street protests {{is precisely the}} lack of an obvious connection between their disobedience (the occupation of parks and streets) and their political and economic complaints. This is why Occupy's turn toward foreclosed housing is so important. While it takes heroic acts of imagination to <b>connect</b> <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> between the occupation of Zuccotti Park and worries about economic inequality, political corruption and the excessive power of banks, the connection between these issues and the occupation of foreclosed housing is obvious".|$|E
2500|$|On May 20, 2010, Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch of Reason {{announced}} {{the winners of}} the publication's [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] contest. Gillespie and Welch warned the reader not to view the image [...] "if you are offended by graphical representations of the Prophet Mohammed." [...] Of the images highlighted, Gillespie and Welch explained: [...] "The single most important element–and the thing that ties these selections together–is that each image forces the viewer to do two things. First, they consciously call into question the nature of representation, no small matter in fights over whether it is allowed under Islamic law to depict Mohammed ... Second, each of the images forces the viewer to actively participate not simply in the creation of meaning but of actually constructing the image itself." [...] There were two images in the position of runner-up – one was an artistic rendition of a tobacco smoking pipe. The depiction references surrealist artist René Magritte, and includes the text, [...] "This is not a pipe. This is Muhammed." [...] The Reason journalists commented that the image toyed with Magritte's [...] "famous statement about the necessary disjuncture between a picture and the thing it seeks to represent." [...] The second runner-up was a parody of the Where's Waldo? series, and the winner was a <b>connect</b> <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> picture. Commenting on the winner of the Reason contest, Gillespie and Welch concluded, [...] "There is a deeper lesson here: <b>Connect</b> <b>the</b> <b>dots</b> and discover that we all must be Spartacus on Everybody Draw Mohammad Day. And that in a free society, every day is Everybody Draw Mohammed Day." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has been conducted}} on Aboriginal mental health and health promotion.   However, implementation and impacts of culturally relevant health promotion strategies have not been equally addressed. This article provides an interim evaluation of <b>Connecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dots,</b> an innovative project designed to support and promote the mental health of Aboriginal youth and families in urban areas in British Columbia. <b>Connecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dots</b> adapted <b>the</b> Communities that Care (CTC) model, a prevention planning program promoting positive youth development and reducing risk factors that predict youth’s future involvement in problem behaviors. This article devotes specific attention to the necessitated adaptations of the CTC model to promote cultural relevancy in urban Aboriginal communities. Evaluation findings suggest that Aboriginal communities can successfully adopt mainstream evidence-based programming, provided that programs permit adaptations to meet the communities’ needs. For urban Aboriginal communities, programs must be re-conceptualized so that the linear, western delivery model is transformed to a holistic and circular implementation approach congruent with Aboriginal worldviews. In <b>the</b> <b>Connecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dots</b> project, inclusion of traditional Aboriginal practices and key Aboriginal representatives were among the most well received model adaptations. Evaluation participants reported that the adaptations made to the CTC framework have been critical to sustainability. </p...|$|R
