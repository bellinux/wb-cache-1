DNA is bound to tiny particles of gold or tungsten which are subsequently shot into plant tissue or single plant cells under high pressure. The accelerated particles penetrate both the cell wall and membranes. The DNA separates from the metal and is integrated into plant DNA inside the nucleus. This method has been applied successfully for many cultivated crops, especially monocots like wheat or maize, for which transformation using Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been less successful. The major disadvantage of this procedure is that serious damage can be done to the <b>cellular</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E

Furthermore, {{in the case of}} <b>cellular</b> <b>tissues,</b> the wet condition of tissues must be maintained, because drying on the surface causes cell damage. To keep the wet condition, a captive-bubble based contact-angle measurement was developed [14], however, this measurement is difficult to apply to cell culture dish systems in vitro because the entire culture dish must be immersed into a liquid pool.|$|R

Using high b values (800 – 1000 [*]s/mm 2) allows suppression of background {{signals from the}} normal liver parenchyma and results in increased contrast between the normal liver and lesions, facilitating the detection of hepatic focal lesions [60]. DWI enables the detection of small lesions around vessels and in {{the periphery of the}} liver which is sometimes challenging to be detected on T 2 -WI [61, 62]. DWI is also valuable especially when contrast media is contraindicated [63 – 65].|$|R

6000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{we have a}} clear and {{distinct}} account given to Poiteau (11/98. 'Annales de la Soc. de l'Hort. de Paris' tome 7 1830 page 93.) by M. Adam, who raised the plant, showing that C. adami is not an ordinary hybrid; but is what may be called a graft-hybrid, that is, one produced from the united <b>cellular</b> <b>tissue</b> of two distinct species. M. Adam inserted in the usual manner a shield of the bark of C. purpureus into a stock of C. laburnum; and the bud lay dormant, as often happens, for a year; the shield then produced many buds and shoots, one of which grew more upright and vigorous with larger leaves than the shoots of C. purpureus, and was consequently propagated. Now it deserves especial notice that these plants were sold by M. Adam, as a variety of C. purpureus, before they had flowered; and the account was published by Poiteau after the plants had flowered, but before they had exhibited their remarkable tendency to revert into the two parent species. So {{that there was no}} conceivable motive for falsification, {{and it is difficult to}} see how there could have been any error. (11/99. An account was given in the 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857 pages 382, 400, of a common laburnum on which grafts of C. purpureus had been inserted, and which gradually assumed the character of C. adami; but I have little doubt that C. adami had been sold to the purchaser, who was not a botanist, in the place of C. purpureus. I have ascertained that this occurred in another instance.) If we admit as true M. Adam's account, we must admit the extraordinary fact that two distinct species can unite by their <b>cellular</b> <b>tissue,</b> and subsequently produce a plant bearing leaves and sterile flowers intermediate in character between the scion and stock, and producing buds liable to reversion; in short, resembling in every important respect a hybrid formed in the ordinary way by seminal reproduction.] ...|$|E

Thin sections of a leaf of Dionaea were made by my son, and the cells, both those of the central and of the more superficial layers, were found much elongated, with their longer axes directed towards the midrib; and it is in this direction that the motor impulse must be sent with great rapidity from one lobe to the other, as both close simultaneously. The central parenchymatous cells are larger, more loosely attached together, and have more delicate walls than the more superficial cells.

60|$|This process I {{discovered}} by having accidentally left {{a piece of}} wool near a tendril; and this led me to bind a quantity of flax, moss, and wool loosely round sticks, and to place them near tendrils. The wool must not be dyed, for these tendrils are excessively sensitive to some poisons. The hooked points soon caught hold of the fibres, even loosely floating fibres, and now there was no recoiling; on the contrary, the excitement caused the hooks to penetrate the fibrous mass and to curl inwards, so that each hook caught firmly one or two fibres, or a small bundle of them. The tips and the inner surfaces of the hooks now began to swell, and {{in two or three}} days were visibly enlarged. After a few more days the hooks were converted into whitish, irregular balls, rather above the 0.05th of an inch (1.27 mm.) in diameter, formed of coarse <b>cellular</b> <b>tissue,</b> which sometimes wholly enveloped and concealed the hooks themselves. The surfaces of these balls secrete some viscid resinous matter, to which the fibres of the flax, &c., adhere. When a fibre has become fastened to the surface, the <b>cellular</b> <b>tissue</b> does not grow directly beneath it, but continues to grow closely on each side; so that when several adjoining fibres, though excessively thin, were caught, so many crests of cellular matter, each not as thick as a human hair, grew up between them, and these, arching over on both sides, adhered firmly together. As the whole surface of the ball continues to grow, fresh fibres adhere and are afterwards enveloped; so that I have seen a little ball with between fifty and sixty fibres of flax crossing it at various angles and all embedded more or less deeply. Every gradation in the process could be followed--some fibres merely sticking to the surface, others lying in more or less deep furrows, or deeply embedded, or passing through the very centre of the cellular ball. The embedded fibres are so closely clasped that they cannot be withdrawn. The outgrowing tissue has so strong a tendency to unite, that two balls produced by distinct tendrils sometimes unite and grow into a single one.|$|E
60|$|Herr Magnus asserts {{with much}} truth that graft-hybrids {{resemble}} {{in all respects}} seminal hybrids, including their great diversity of character. There is, however, a partial exception, inasmuch as the characters of the two parent forms are not often homogeneously blended together in graft- hybrids. They much more commonly appear in a segregated condition,--that is, in segments either at first, or subsequently through reversion. It {{would seem that the}} reproductive elements are not so completely blended by grafting as by sexual generation. But segregation of this kind occurs by no means rarely, as will be immediately shown, in seminal hybrids. Finally it must, I think, be admitted that we learn from the foregoing cases a highly important physiological fact, namely, that the elements that go to the production of a new being, are not necessarily formed by the male and female organs. They are present in the <b>cellular</b> <b>tissue</b> in such a state that they can unite without the aid of the sexual organs, and thus give rise to a new bud partaking of the characters of the two parent-forms.|$|E
60|$|The collar (called the peristome by Cohn) is evidently formed, {{like the}} valve, by an inward {{projection}} of {{the walls of the}} bladder. The cells composing the outer surface, or that facing the valve, have rather thick walls, are of a brownish colour, minute, very numerous, and elongated; the lower ones being divided into two by vertical partitions. The whole presents a complex and elegant appearance. The cells forming the inner surface are continuous with those over the whole inner surface of the bladder. The space be- [page 402] tween the inner and outer surface consists of coarse <b>cellular</b> <b>tissue</b> (fig. 20). The inner side is thickly covered with delicate bifid processes, hereafter to be described. The collar is thus made thick; and it is rigid, so that it retains the same outline whether the bladder contains little or much air and water. This is of great importance, as otherwise the thin and flexible valve would be liable to be distorted, and in this case would not act properly.|$|E

30|$|The surface {{wettability}} is {{an index}} of affinity between a liquid and a solid surface [1]. Because this index depends on the functional groups of surfaces, contaminants adhered on a surface, or surface roughness, the wettability value is useful for assessing physical and chemical properties. Especially, bio-surfaces such as biomaterials and <b>cellular</b> <b>tissues</b> are important targets for wettability assessment, because bio-surfaces interact with other materials via both physical and chemical interaction [21]. For example, temperature responsive cell culture dishes are important biomaterials for fabricating cell sheets based on the wettability change on the dishes obtained by controlling the surface temperature [4, 13, 23]. Such cell sheet technologies are applicable to regenerative medicine for the malfunction of various organs and tissues [2, 3, 5 – 7, 11, 12, 15]. Regarding <b>cellular</b> <b>tissues,</b> one possible application could be in treatment of dry eye syndrome; this is a corneal disorder wherein the corneal surface loses its tear film because of less secretion of tears and/or wettability loss on the corneal surface [10]. In analysis of disease occurrence, in vitro systems which use cell culture dishes are often used. Therefore, the wettability assessment method applicable to cell culture dish systems is in high demand.|$|R
60|$|A {{few words}} must be added on the {{complete}} abortion of organs. When a part becomes diminished by disuse prolonged during many generations, {{the principle of}} economy of growth, together with intercrossing, will tend to reduce it still further as previously explained, but this will {{not account for the}} complete or almost complete obliteration of, for instance, a minute papilla of <b>cellular</b> <b>tissue</b> representing a pistil, or of a microscopically minute nodule of bone representing a tooth. In certain cases of suppression not yet completed, in which a rudiment occasionally reappears through reversion, dispersed gemmules derived from this part must, according to our view, still exist; we must therefore suppose that the cells, in union with which the rudiment was formerly developed, fail in their affinity for such gemmules, except in the occasional cases of reversion. But when the abortion is complete and final, the gemmules themselves no doubt perish; nor is this in any way improbable, for, though a vast number of active and long-dormant gemmules are nourished in each living creature, yet there must be some limit to their number; and it appears natural that gemmules derived from reduced and useless parts would be more liable to perish than those freshly derived from other parts which are still in full functional activity.|$|E
60|$|Finally, {{the facts}} given {{in this chapter}} prove in how close and {{remarkable}} a manner the germ of a fertilised seed and the small cellular mass forming a bud, resemble each other in all their functions--in their power of inheritance with occasional reversion,--and in their capacity for variation of the same general nature, in obedience to the same laws. This resemblance, or rather identity of character, {{is shown in the}} most striking manner {{by the fact that the}} <b>cellular</b> <b>tissue</b> of one species or variety, when budded or grafted on another, may give rise to a bud having an intermediate character. We have seen that variability does not depend on sexual generation, though much more frequently its concomitant than of bud reproduction. We have seen that bud-variability is not solely dependent on reversion or atavism to long-lost characters, or to those formerly acquired from a cross, but appears often to be spontaneous. But when we ask ourselves what is the cause of any particular bud-variation, we are lost in doubt, being driven in some cases to look to the direct action of the external conditions of life as sufficient, and in other cases to feel a profound conviction that these have played a quite subordinate part, of not more importance than the nature of the spark which ignites a mass of combustible matter.|$|E
