50|$|To {{the west}} of the hamlet are the West Pentire Fields, which have been {{designated}} as an Important Plant Area, by the organisation Plantlife, for its arable flora, especially poppies and <b>corn</b> <b>marigolds.</b> These fields are owned by the National Trust.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Denis Cheason {{and made}} by Barry Sharman, {{the design is}} formed {{from a number of}} {{separate}} images. The top part of design is based on a Roman belt discovered in a burial ground near Girton College. The centre is derived from the family coat of arms of Anne-Maria Cotton, who endowed the first Girton village school, together with geese, kept at Washpit, that provided quills for use in the University of Cambridge. The flowers near the village's name are <b>corn</b> <b>marigolds</b> which were once common in the village, and at the base is the cross of Saint Andrew to whom the parish church is dedicated.|$|R
50|$|Mount Kedros (Όρος Κέντρος), is a {{mountain}} {{on the island}} of Crete in Greece. It is located southwest of the Ida massif with which it forms the two flanks of the Amari Valley. Mount Kedros is conical-shaped and made of limestone. Its landscape abounds with canyons and rock cliffs and is almost barren, with dry scrubs and phrygana being the major forms of vegetation. Kedros grows endemic or rare flowers such as tulips, anemones, <b>corn</b> <b>marigolds,</b> turban buttercups, tassel hyacinths, orchids, etc., and provides ideal conditions for the nesting of falcons as well as larger birds of prey such as griffon vultures, golden eagles and Bonelli's eagles. Owing to the significance of its flora and fauna, Mount Kedros is a node of the Natura 2000 network of protected areas. An E4 mountain footpath climbs up to the highest peak of the site. To the north of Kedros are located the plateau Gious Kampos and the Kissano gorge.|$|R

50|$|Glebionis segetum (syn. Chrysanthemum segetum) is {{a species}} of the genus Glebionis, {{probably}} native only to the eastern Mediterranean region but now naturalized in western and northern Europe as well as China and parts of North America. Common names include <b>corn</b> <b>marigold</b> and corn daisy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>corn</b> <b>marigold</b> {{appears to}} have been a serious weed during the 13th century in Scotland, as {{suggested}} by a law of Alexander II which states that if a farmer allows so much as a single plant to produce seed in amongst his crops, then he will be fined a sheep.|$|E
50|$|Yolk {{color is}} {{dependent}} on the diet of the hen; if the diet contains yellow/orange plant pigments known as xanthophylls, then they are deposited in the yolk, coloring it. Lutein is the most abundant pigment in egg yolk. A colorless diet can produce an almost colorless yolk. Yolk color is, for example, enhanced if the diet includes products such as yellow <b>corn</b> and <b>marigold</b> petals. In the US, the use of artificial color additives is forbidden.|$|R
40|$|Carotenoids {{are one of}} {{the most}} used natural {{colorants}} due to their non-toxic nature and wide occurrence. Carotenoids are commonly found in orange, yellow and green fruits and vegetables. Lutein is a yellow pigment ranking among carotenoids. Lutein occurs in green vegetables, fruits like mango and papaya, red paprika, alfalfa, algae, yellow <b>corn,</b> and <b>marigold</b> flower. In animals it occurs in egg yolks and also in the macular region of the eye retina. Humans are not able to synthesize lutein depending entirely on natural sources or dietary supplements...|$|R

5000|$|Calendula (...) , [...] is a genus {{of about}} 15-20 species of annual and {{perennial}} herbaceous {{plants in the}} daisy family Asteraceae that are often known as marigolds. They are native to southwestern Asia, western Europe, Macaronesia, and the Mediterranean. Other plants are also known as marigolds, such as <b>corn</b> <b>marigold,</b> desert marigold, marsh marigold, and plants of the genus Tagetes.The genus name Calendula is a modern Latin diminutive of calendae, meaning [...] "little calendar", [...] "little clock" [...] or possibly [...] "little weather-glass". [...] The common name [...] "marigold" [...] refers to the Virgin Mary.The most commonly cultivated and used member of the genus is the pot marigold (Calendula officinalis). Popular herbal and cosmetic products named 'calendula' invariably derive from C. officinalis.|$|E
50|$|The gardens were {{established}} in 1973 by Alan Gray and Graham Robeson, who have created a 32 acre design which incorporates exuberant and innovative planting alongside a more traditional formal design. On an unpromising site, close to the North Sea and surrounded by arable prairie, the gardens are protected from harsh onshore wind by a shelter belt of Monterey Pine trees which created a unique micro-climate. Exotic and unusual plants {{from around the world}} flourish alongside more hardy species. Notable are the tree ferns, succulents and palms which surround the house, as is the Californian 'Desert Wash', the Exotic Garden with a water sculpture and a large cornfield sown with a selection of native but now scarce 'weeds' such as Cornflower, Poppy and <b>Corn</b> <b>Marigold.</b> The gardens contain an interesting collection of sculptures by local artists as well as many architectural features.|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research were 1) to study nutrient content in soil samples taken from Roi - Et College of Agriculture and Technology Campus, 2) to study the social factors, economic factors and technological factors the effect on soil conservation of Roi - Et College of Agriculture and Technology students, 3) the development of soil conservation activities Learning package efficiency of 80 / 80, 4) to Study and to compare the knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding soil conservation of students of Roi - Et College of Agriculture and Technology. The student activities package of learning soil conservation was enrolled by 40 people in its club. These people were selected by purposive sampling. The instruments were used in this research as follows; 1) scientific analysis, 2) social questionnaire on economic and technological factors affecting soil conservation, 3) test of knowledge about soil conservation, 4) test of attitudes about soil conservation, 5) test of skill about soil conservation. The experimental research was designed to use students as key informants. The statistics analysis {{was used in the}} research as follows: frequency, percentage, average, standard deviation, test results, assumptions which included a dependent t-test statistical at the significance level of 0. 05. The results of the study were as follows: 1) The study found that the amount of soil nutrient content (N: P: K) around cultivated plants in an area of converted agriculture land have the significance: Soil checks collected in plots from soil containing morning glory, chrysanthemums, <b>marigolds,</b> <b>corn</b> and cassava, and had neutral pH. 2) The results of the analysis determing the factors that affected the conservation of soil found economic factors were at a high level Social factors and technology factors were moderate thus leading the approach that has come to create of learning activities package in soil conservation. 3) The results showed that the efficiency of the manual was 83. 58 / 87. 88 which had a threshold value set at 80 / 80. The effectiveness was in the index (E. I.) of 0. 696. 4) Determining the before and after learning Skills of the Students knowledge and attitudes in soil. Previous studies have found that students with the knowledge, attitudes and soil conservation skill after learning, were at the level of statistical significance. 05. So, it showed that the use of activity package to learn about the conservation of the teaching gave students the knowledge, attitudes and skills to increase soil conservation...|$|R
5000|$|Ralph Ashton is {{mentioned}} in a passage which Dr. Hibbert-Ware has explained with much ingenuity, though not with absolute certainty. According to this, <b>corn</b> <b>marigold</b> (Chrysanthemun segetum) grew so {{extensively in the}} low wet land about Ashton as to be inimical to the crops, and {{the lord of the}} manor had an annual inspection and levied fines on those tenants on whose lands it was seen. This power, delegated to Ralph Ashton and his brother Robert, {{is said to have been}} made the pretext of such tyrannical exactions that on one of these visitations the tenants rose in desperation and the [...] "Black Knight" [...] was slain. Others hold that it was whilst exercising in the northern parts his despotic powers as vice-constable that he excited the terror expressed in the legendary rhyme:— :Sweet Jesu, for thy mercy's sake::And for thy bitter passion,:Save us from the axe of the Tower,::And from Sir Ralph of Ashton. The effigy of the Black Knight is still paraded through the town of Ashton on Easter Monday.|$|E
40|$|Encouraging {{natural enemies}} by growing {{attractant}} plants {{is a highly}} effective method of pest control in organic systems. However, {{it is important to}} establish which plants are most effective at attracting benefi cial insects. Experiments were carried out by 179 HDRA members, who grew four plant species (Coriander, <b>Corn</b> <b>Marigold,</b> Fennel and Phacelia) in their gardens and allotments. Over the course of the growing season, assessments were made on the growth and fl owering of the plants and the presence of four key groups of benefi cial insect (ladybirds, hoverfl ies, lacewings and parasitic wasps). Phacelia established quickly and its long fl owering period meant it attracted insects throughout the summer. However, Phacelia was only the most attractive plant {{at the end of the}} season and insects preferred the other trial plants when they were in fl ower. Results highlight the importance of growing a range of fl owering plants to provide resources for benefi cials throughout their activity period...|$|E
