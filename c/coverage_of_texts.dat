5000|$|The first partial English and French {{translations}} in the 1950s were {{an indirect}} {{result of the}} Bolshevik revolution, which brought many Russian intellectuals into Western Europe. T. S. Eliot persuaded his fellow directors of the publishing house Faber and Faber to publish a partial translation into English from the Theophan Russian version, which met with surprising success in 1951. A more complete English translation, from the original Greek, began in 1979 with a collaboration between G. E. H. Palmer, Kallistos Ware, and Philip Sherrard. They released {{four of the five}} volumes of the Philokalia between 1979 and 1995. In 1946, the first installment of a ten volume Romanian translation by Father Dumitru Stăniloae appeared. In addition to the original Greek text, Stăniloae added [...] "lengthy original footnotes of his own" [...] as well as substantially expanding the <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> by Maximus the Confessor, Symeon the New Theologian, and Gregory Palamas. This work is 4,650 pages in length. Writings by the Trappist monk Thomas Merton on hesychasm also helped spread the popularity of the Philokalia, along with the indirect influence of J. D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey, which featured The Way of a Pilgrim as a main plot element.|$|E

40|$|Using {{text mining}} and {{visualization}} techniques {{to identify the}} topical <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> corpora is increasingly common {{in a number of}} disciplines.

40|$|How do we {{find the}} right word for the job? Where does that word come from? Why do we spell it like that? And {{how do we know}} what it means? Words are all around us - we use them every day to {{communicate}} our joys, fears, hopes, opinions, wishes and demands - but we don't often think about them too deeply. In this highly accessible introduction to English words, the reader will discover what the study of words can tell them about the extraordinary richness and complexity of our daily vocabulary and about the nature of language in general. Assuming no prior knowledge of linguistics, the book covers a wide range of topics, including the structure of words, the meaning of words, how their spelling relates to pronunciation, how new words are manufactured or imported from other languages, and how the meaning of words changes with the passage of time. It also investigates how the mind deals with words by highlighting the amazing intellectual feat performed routinely when the right word is retrieved from the mental dictionary. This revised and expanded second edition brings the study of words right up to date with <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> messaging and email and includes new material on psycholinguistics and word meaning.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, native and {{non-native}} speakers were different {{in a way}} that native speakers restored the replaced phonemes in words better than those in non-words, while non-native speakers restored the replaced phonemes in words and non-words equivalently (lexical factor). It seems that lexical context supported the phonemic restoration of native speakers, but not the restoration of non-native speakers (Samuel 1981 a, b, 1996; Warren 1970; Warren and Warren 1970; Warren and Obusek 1971; Warren and Sherman 1974). The availability of lexical context seems to differ between native and non-native speakers, and it largely depends on listeners’ language proficiency. The vocabulary size of listeners is likely to play a significant role for phonemic restoration. In general, the average American high school graduates are deemed to have approx. 40, 000 – 80, 000 reading vocabulary in their mental lexicon (Aitchison, 2012), while how much of these are shared among non-native speakers would depend on each non-native speaker’s vocabulary size. While Hirsch and Nation (1992) suggested, in the field of second language reading, that 98 – 99  % <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> (approx. ‘one unknown word in every 50 – 100 running words’) is required for a good command of reading comprehension, the comparable amount of vocabulary, along with listening experience to various pronunciation, would be essential for a good command of listening comprehension. It is likely that native speakers have more lexical advantages in phonemic restoration, while second language listeners with a large vocabulary size might also enjoy lexical advantages in phonemic restoration. Expanding the vocabulary size in second language, along with listening experience, is indispensable for successful phonemic restoration.|$|R
40|$|Language Documentation, {{as defined}} by Himmelmann (2006), aims at {{compiling}} and preserving linguistic data for studies in linguistics, literature, his- tory, ethnology, sociology. This initiative is vital for endangered languages such as Occitan, a romance language spoken in southern France and in several valleys of Spain and Italy. The documentation of a language concerns all its modalities, covering spoken and written language, various registers and so on. Nowadays, Occitan documentation mostly consists of data from linguistic atlases, virtual libraries from the modern to the contemporary period, and text bases for the Middle Ages. BaTelÒc is a text base for modern and contemporary periods. With the aim of creating a wide <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> collections, BaTelÒc gathers not only written literary texts (prose, drama and poetry) but also other genres such as technical texts and newspapers. Enough material is already available to foresee a <b>text</b> base <b>of</b> {{hundreds of millions of}} words. BaTelÒc not only aims at documenting Occitan, it is also designed to provide tools to explore texts (different criteria for corpus selection, concordance tools and more complex enquiries with regular expressions). As for linguistic analysis, the second step is to enrich the corpora with annotations. Natural Language Processing of endangered languages such as Occitan is very challenging. It is not possible to transpose existing models for resource-rich languages directly, partly because of the spelling, dialectal variations, and lack of standardization. With BaTelÒc we aim at providing corpora and lexicons for the development of basic natural language processing tools, namely OCR and a Part-of-Speech tagger based on tools initially designed for machine translation and which take variation into account.
