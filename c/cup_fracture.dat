40|$|The {{effects of}} {{impurity}} iron content {{and a change}} from uniaxial to plane strain tension on AA 5754 Al-Mg sheet alloys were investigated. This was done by studying the fracture evolution in each case. These alloys do not exhibit the progressive damage accumulation often found in ductile commercial metals, because of a relatively low second-phase iron intermetallic volume fraction and a propensity for shear localization at large plastic strains. Necking strains and the strains at which intense shear localization occurred were not influenced by iron content. Once void nucleation has occurred, an increase in iron content causes {{a reduction in the}} strain necessary to attain failure. In addition, an increase in iron content also changes the fracture mode from double <b>cup</b> <b>fracture</b> to void sheet fracture. A change from uniaxial to plane strain tension reduces the strain to fracture and creates conditions for shear localization to occur more readily. Finally, the negative strain rate sensitivity exhibited at room temperature further increases the tendency toward shear localization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{investigation}} of copper and aluminum ring samples {{was carried out}} using magnetic pulse loading. Two modifications of the magnetic pulse technique were used. They {{were based on a}} GKVI- 300 high-voltage narrow-pulse generator Morozov et al. (2011). It is possible using these two approaches to decrease the period of the harmonic load up to 100 ns. The study of fracture surfaces of aluminum and copper samples after the test was carried out on an optical microscope Axio-Observer-Z 1 -M in a dark field, and study of the cross sections structure - in the bright field or C-DIC. The structure has been studied in cross sections after appropriate etching. Grain size and the number of pores on the surface of cross sections were determined after etching. Microhardness was measured on a PMT- 3 device with a load of 20 g. The optical micrographs of aluminum demonstrate that the long pulse causes almost fully ductile fracture. In the case of the short pulse, the number of fibers decreases: the fracture surface exhibits the signs of both ductile <b>cup</b> <b>fracture</b> and brittle crystalline fracture with cracks, which are sometimes rather deep. In addition, the short pulse results in twinning, which seems surprising for aluminum featuring a high stacking fault energy. It is seen that under short loading dynamic recrystallization occurs. As for copper samples before loading they were in the form of single crystal and after loading their structure due to dynamic recrystallization consists of small grain. The specimen with notch has more developed dynamic recrystallization shear bands...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{outcomes}} in deep drawing process is a cup fractures that occur {{at the bottom of the}} cup shell. This <b>cup</b> <b>fracture</b> is cause by many parameters like blank holder force (BHF), blank diameter, friction between punch and blank, normal anisotropy of material, blank thickness and many more. The main objectives of the present study is to find the value of limiting drawing ratio (LDR) in LDR test and to predict the forming limit behaviour of sheet metal in deep drawing by construct a forming limit diagram (FLD) in FLD test for both aluminium AA 1100 and copper. To determine the drawability of aluminium AA 1100 and copper, LDR test with variable of blank diameters (80 mm, 85 mm, 90 mm, 95 mm and 100 mm) and two set of BHF (with spring constant is 16. 3 N/mm and 10 N/mm) was utilized. On the other hand, the parameters that have used in FLD test is variable of blank thickness (1 mm and 0. 6 mm) and surface condition of a blank using aluminium AA 1100 as a constant material. In surface condition of a blank, a lubricant have been added to investigate the effect of friction between blank and punch in deep drawing process. It is observed that higher blank diameter and BHF raises the value of LDR and thus increases the drawability of aluminium AA 1100 sheet and copper sheet. For FLD test, the level of FLD is increasing with increasing of blank thickness of aluminium AA 1100. Besides that, the present of lubricant also raised the level of FLD and thus lessen the tendency of aluminium AA 1100 sheet to rupture. From both of the experiment, it can be concluded that the formability of sheet metal is increasing due to increasing of blank diameter, blank thickness, BHF and present of lubricant. Besides that, the formability of aluminium AA 1100 sheet is better compare to copper sheet...|$|E

The formability characteristics such as diametrical ratio, maximum drawing load, depth of <b>cup</b> up to <b>fracture</b> are to be evaluated. This test is related to drawing test. This test can be performed by using parameters such as friction, process parameters and without blank holder. In fukui’s conical cup drawing test a single specimen with dimensions drawn into conical <b>cup</b> until the <b>fracture</b> is occurred at the bottom of cup by help of flat cylindrical punch and without using the blank holder. The base diameter of <b>fracture</b> conical <b>cup</b> is used to determination of diametrical Ratio.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the finite element (FE) failure predictions and analyses {{of a typical}} wire for civil engineering applications with various crack-like lamination types (Single and double), geometries (straight-end and inclined-end) and orientations (longitudinal, lateral and transverse). FE prediction {{and analysis of the}} failure of notched pre-cracked wires with a surface across-the-thickness crack-like lamination validated with experimental results are also presented. The FE predicted fracture shape for the notched pre-cracked wires that consists of a <b>cup</b> and cone <b>fracture</b> shape below the bottom tip of the surface across-the-thickness crack-like lamination agrees with the experimental fracture shape. Wires with the double straight-end and double inclined-end crack-like/line-type laminations exhibit a “slant-middle W” and a “zigzag” fractures respectively. Above and below the lateral mid-width across-the-thickness lamination, the wires with the lateral mid-width across-the-thickness lamination exhibit a combination of a transverse mid-thickness flat fracture that is perpendicular to the lateral mid-width across-the-thickness lamination and negatively inclined slant fractures {{on each side of the}} mid-thickness flat fracture at the remaining outer edges of the wire's thickness. On both the front and back sides of the transverse mid-thickness across-the-width lamination, the wires with the transverse mid-thickness across-the-width lamination exhibit a combination of transverse flat fractures parallel to the transverse mid-thickness across-the-width lamination and positively inclined slant fractures at the outer edges of the wire's thickness. FE failure analysis reveals that fracture initiations do not always begin at the termini of every longitudinal crack-like/line-type lamination as reported in a published fractographic failure analysis report of wires with longitudinal crack-like laminations. Fracture initiation only begins at the termini/tip of longitudinal inclined-end crack-like laminations and at the termini/tip of transverse and lateral laminations. FE failure analysis also reveals that wires with single straight-end, double straight-end and double inclined-end longitudinal crack-like/line-type laminations do not exhibit <b>cup</b> and cone <b>fractures</b> as reported. This work further demonstrates the need to employ FE failure analysis as a complimentary or alternative failure analysis approach where the destruction/alteration of the fracture markings by corrosion could affect the accuracy of fractographic failure analysis.

In this research, {{variations}} of tensile properties and fracture behavior of 316 L {{austenitic stainless steel}} weld metal {{as a function of}} aging temperature and time have been investigated. Stainless steel plates were butt-welded using GTAW process. Weld metal tensile specimens were subjected to various aging heat treatments at temperatures of 750 and 850 °C for periods of 1 to 100 hours prior to tensile tests at 25 and 500 °C. Dissolution of delta-ferrite and formation of sigma phase network during aging resulted in a mild increase in tensile strength and significant reduction in ductility, particularly at 25 °C. Although fracture surfaces exhibited ductile features, the dimple morphology and the macroscopic fracture mode were found to be affected by aging. The unaged weld metal exhibited a classic mode of <b>cup</b> and cone <b>fracture,</b> whereas slant and flat types of fracture modes were observed in the aged weld metals, with the slant mode being dominant at 500 °C.

Long-term data outcome studies for this population are lacking. We report on the long-term outcome of 20 acetabular fractures in 20 patients treated with impaction bone grafting and a cemented cup after a mean follow-up of 18 years (range, 12 - 26 years). METHODS: The group consisted of 14 males (70 %) and six females (30 %) {{with an average age}} of 53. 3 years (range, 35 - 75 years) at time of surgery. No patients were lost to follow-up. Four patients died and three patients underwent a revision; at review 13 patients were still living with their implant in situ. Survivorship analysis was performed at 20 years follow-up for three endpoints. RESULTS: Survival rate with endpoint revision for any reason at 20 years postoperative was 74. 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 40 - 91 %), 80. 0 % (95 % CI, 41 - 95 %) for endpoint aseptic loosening, and 63. 9 % (95 % CI 32 - 84 %) for endpoint radiographic failure. Three acetabular components were revised at 14. 5, 15. 3, and 16. 7 years postoperative. Two cups failed for aseptic loosening and one cup failed due to septic loosening.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction Implant neck {{fracture}} {{involving a}} non-modular femoral stem {{is rare in}} primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Occasional cases have been reported following laser etching of the Corailtm stem, but risk factors have not been precisely determined. We therefore performed a retrospective study {{on a series of}} Corailtm stems with laser neck etching, in order to: (1) determine the exact implant neck fracture rate at 10 years, and (2) identify associated risk factors. Hypothesis Laser etching increases the rate of implant neck fracture. Materials and methods Between October 2002 and December 2003, 295 THAs were consecutively performed using the Corailtm stem with laser neck etching, in 286 patients: 151 male (53 %), 135 female (47 %); mean age, 63 years (range, 18 - 89 years); mean weight, 73 kg (range, 45 - 120 kg). Stems were standard in 240 cases (81 %) and lateralized in 55 (19 %). The main assessment criterion was stem replacement for implant neck fracture. Results At a mean 10 years' follow-up (range, 1 - 11 years), 11 patients were lost to follow-up (4 %) and 35 had died (12 %) (with stem in situ). Overall 10 -year stem survival was 91 % (95 % CI: [87 - 94 %]). Sixteen patients (5. 4 %) underwent revision surgery for implant neck fracture, 6 (2 %) bone and joint infection and in 4 cases (1. 3 %) the stem was replaced preventively for fracture risk suspected during a revision procedure on the <b>cup.</b> All <b>fractures</b> were of the fatigue type, implicating implant neck laser etching. Mean time to fracture was 4. 5 years (range, 1. 4 - 9. 8 years). Risk factors comprised: weight > 80 kg (P = 0. 002) (OR = 5. 7; 95 % CI: 1. 9 - 17), age < 60 years (P = 0. 02) (OR = 3. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 9. 6), male gender (P = 0. 01) (OR = 14. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 9 - 113) and lateralized stem (P < 0. 001) (OR = 6. 5, 95 % CI: 2. 3 - 18). Conclusion The present 5. 4 % fracture rate was higher than in registry data (< 1 %). Fracture mechanisms involved excessive stress in an area under tension, leading to fatigue fracture. Male gender, high weight and young age were risk factors, as in the literature for fatigue fracture. Location and depth of laser etching induced fatigue fracture. The study demonstrated that laser etching creates an area of weakness in the implant neck and should therefore be eschewed {{in this part of the}} femoral stem.

40|$|A {{continuum}} plasticity {{yield function}} is developed that captures tension/compression asymmetry and its evolution as exhibited by HCP {{materials such as}} magnesium alloy sheet. The model, referred to herein as “CPB 06 ex 3 ev”, {{is based upon the}} CPB 06 [1] yield surface which is extended in this research to consider evolution of asymmetry and anisotropy under monotonic loading. The model is further modified to incorporate thermal softening and strain rate effects. Mechanical characterization experiments are performed to acquire uniaxial tensile and compressive stress-strain data along a range of in-plane and through-thickness loading orientations. Experiments are performed for a range of strain rates (0. 001 - 1 s- 1) and temperatures (23 - 250 °C). A strong, evolving asymmetry is observed at room temperature when comparing tensile and compressive flow stresses and r-values, while asymmetry and anisotropy are reduced dramatically as temperature is increased. AZ 31 B exhibits moderate strain rate sensitivity at room temperature, however, the rate sensitivity increases with temperature. The CPB 06 ex 3 ev model is applied to simulate AZ 31 B magnesium alloy sheet. An error minimization scheme is used to fit the yield function and evolution coefficients over the entire data set. The calibrated model is shown to capture the evolving asymmetric/anisotropic response of both flow stresses and r-values in tension and compression, while also fitting the flow stress at the biaxial tension and pure shear locations on the yield locus. The model, which uses three stress transformations, is implemented within a user defined material model (UMAT) and linked to the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA. In order to assess the finite element implementation of the CPB 06 ex 3 ev model, a series of validation experiments were performed and corresponding finite element models were developed: (i) room temperature three-point bending; (ii) elevated temperature (250 °C) limiting dome height experiments; and, (iii) warm cup drawing experiments. The three point bend simulations demonstrated the importance of capturing material asymmetry and the associated shift in neutral axis. Comparison between the warm forming experiments and models revealed qualitative agreement between the predicted punch load-displacement and strain distributions. The CPB 06 ex 3 ev formulation was able to capture the anisotropy trends in terms of the differences in strains measured along the sheet rolling versus transverse directions. Beyond the constitutive characterization and modeling effort, the cup draw formability experiments have provided interesting insight into the effect of temperature and temperature distribution within the AZ 31 B sheet. The current work has served to show the existence of a process window in which the blank center temperature must lie below the die temperature but above the temperature for activation of non-basal slip systems (to avoid low temperature fracture). Two modes of failure have been identified at the process window boundaries in which the <b>cup</b> either <b>fractures</b> due to low temperature (brittle) failure or a high temperature (necking) failure...|$|R
40|$|Background Compromised rheumatic bone is a {{potential}} risk factor for mechanical complications in cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA) in cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Increased rates of intra-operative fractures, component migration and (early) aseptic loosening are to be expected. Despite this, cementless THA is performed in cases of RA. Methods A literature search on cementless THA in RA was performed in EMBASE (1993 - 2011), Medline (1966 - 2011) and the Cochrane Library. A systematic review was conducted with a special emphasis on mechanical complications. Results Twenty-three case series and five studies of implant registries were included. Acetabular fractures and/ or migration of the cup were reported in 9 out of 22 studies of the <b>cup.</b> Proximal femoral <b>fractures</b> and/or subsidence of the stem were reported in 14 out of 20 studies of the stem. Six studies compared failure rates of uncemented and cemented components due to aseptic loosening. The overall failure rate ratio (uncemented/cemented) for the cup was 0. 6 (95 % CI: 0. 14 - 2. 60) and for the stem 0. 71 (95 % CI: 0. 06 - 8. 55), both favoring uncemented fixation. The failure rates in case series without a control group were compared to the NICE criteria (failure rate/ 1). The overall failure rate for the cup was 0. 97 (95 % CI: 0. 50 - 1. 88) and for the stem 0. 79 (95 % CI: 0. 44 - 1. 41). Failure rates of aseptic loosening of higher than 1 (favoring cemented fixation) were reported in 6 out of 26 studies of the cup and in 2 out of 25 studies of the stem. In all these studies, the inferior implant designs were blamed, and {{not the type of}} fixation or the quality of the bone. Conclusions Despite substantial rates of mechanical stem complications, no evidence was found to establish that cementless components perform less well than cemented components. The results justify the use of cementless THA in RA patients. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} different strain rates and sample sizes, tensile specimens of the reactor steels X 6 CrNiNb 18 10 (1. 4550) and 20 MnMoNi 5 5 (1. 6310) were fabricated and tested at room temperature. The structures and fractures of these samples were examined to detect such influences on the fracture behaviour of these materials. The tensile samples of the austenitic steel X 6 CrNiNb 18 10 with a diameter of 3 mm in the uniform section were tested at strain rates of 10 "-" 3, 10 "-" 1, 10, and 200 s"-" 1. In these series, the loss of ductility due to the deformation velocity could be shown. This behaviour was recognizable in the lower necking of the fractures and the tendency to larger dimple diameters in the fracture surfaces. These specimens were compared with another series of tensile tests using geometrically similar specimens of 30 mm diameter. The strain rates during the tensile tests were 10 "-" 3 and 150 s"-" 1. With increasing strain rate and diameter of the gauge length, a decrease of the necking could be determined together with increasing dimple diameter. The tensile samples of the steel 20 MnMoNi 5 5 with 3 and 30 mm diameter were tested again at 10 "-" 3 and 200 s- 1. Under all test conditions, the samples were broken in a ductile mode; either cup and cone, shear or milling cutter type of fractures were observed. As a particular result of the size effect, the 30 mm samples were broken at the low strain rate with a milling cutter type fracture, while the small samples broke with a <b>cup</b> and cone <b>fracture.</b> In the necking {{and the formation of}} the voids in the fracture surface, such an influence of the test parameters could not be observed as could be seen in the austenitic steel.
