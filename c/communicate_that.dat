5|$|On February 4, 2015 it was {{revealed}} that during the recording of their main TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing consciousness and falling in a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain, after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to <b>communicate</b> <b>that</b> the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered as of yet. Police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral {{disorders}} {{are difficult to}} study in animal models because {{it is difficult to}} know what animals are thinking and because animal models used to assess psychopathologies are experimental preparations developed to study a condition. Can a monkey effectively <b>communicate</b> <b>that</b> he is sad or that he feels overwhelmed? Lacking the ability to use language to study behavioral disorders like depression and stress questions the validity of those studies conducted. It can be difficult to attribute human afflictions to non-human animals.|$|E

25|$|On March 2, 1992, while praying at the Ohel, {{the site}} where his {{father-in-law}} is buried, Schneerson suffered a massive stroke. That very evening, while he was being treated for his stroke and Chabad Chassidim around the world gathered for prayer, some of the messianists broke out in song and dance. It was {{during this period of}} illness and inability to <b>communicate</b> <b>that</b> the messianic movement reached its greatest fervor, and became more vocal of their hope that Schneerson would soon be the Mashiach. This also troubled many people who felt that it was being imposed upon Schneerson as something he had no control over.|$|E
25|$|Fuller {{states that}} in the Nikayas, right-view {{includes}} non-dependence on knowledge and views, and mentions the Buddha's simile of his dhamma as a raft that must be abandoned. He finds that the Atthakavagga's treatment of knowledge and wisdom {{is parallel to the}} later Patthana's apparent criticism of giving, holding the precepts, the duty of observance, and practicing the jhanas. In his view, both texts exhibit this particular approach not as an attack on practice or knowledge, but to point out that attachment to the path is destructive. Similarly, the text's treatment of concentration meditation is intended to warn against attachment to insight, and <b>communicate</b> <b>that</b> insight into the nature of things necessarily involves a calm mind.|$|E
25|$|Upon Genie's {{removal from}} this {{location}} in April 1977 she required a two-week stay at Children's Hospital, {{where she was}} able to see her mother and the Riglers, and her condition somewhat improved but she continued mostly using sign language to <b>communicate.</b> <b>That</b> month, Curtiss and Fromkin obtained a year-long grant from the National Science Foundation to continue working with Genie. Authorities then moved to another foster home for several months, an arrangement in which Genie reportedly did fairly well but which unexpectedly ended in late 1977, and after giving her temporary accommodations through the end of December of that year authorities moved her into a different location. In early January 1978 Curtiss wrote these moves were all very hard on Genie, causing continued regression in all aspects of her life, and that their frequency heightened their traumatic impact.|$|E

25|$|Dachs is German for badger, a {{term used}} for hunting dogs with short legs. The name Dachsbracke may reflect that the Dachsbracke dogs were bred down in size by {{crossbreeding}} long-legged Bracken with the Dachshund. Historically, the term Bracke {{was used in}} German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water (related to the English word brackish). In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries <b>communicate</b> <b>that</b> game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on a leash by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade. The Dachsbracke are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} year of life, infants are unable to {{communicate}} with language. Instead, infants communicate with gestures. This phenomenon is known as prelinguistic gestures, which are nonverbal ways that infants <b>communicate</b> <b>that</b> also had a plan backed with the gesture. Examples of these could be pointing at an object, tugging on the shirt of a parent to get the parent's attention, etc. Harding, 1983, devised the major criteria that come along with the behavior of prelinguistic gestures and their intent to communicate. There are three major criteria that go along with a prelinguistic gesture: waiting, persistence, and ultimately, development of alternative plans. This process usually occurs around 8 months of age, where an appropriate scenario may be of a child tugging on the shirt of a parent to wait for the attention of the parent who would then notice the infant, which causes the infant to point to something they desire. This would describe the first two criteria. The development of alternative plans may arise if the parent does not acknowledge what the infant wants, the infant may entertain itself to satisfy the previous desire.|$|E

[...] In Shakespeare's time, [...] "complexion" [...] carried both outward and inward meanings, as did the word [...] "temperate" [...] (externally, a weather condition; internally, a balance of humours). The second meaning of [...] "complexion" [...] would <b>communicate</b> <b>that</b> the beloved's inner, cheerful, and temperate disposition is constant, unlike the sun, which may be blotted out on a cloudy day.

500|$|Hubbard {{took three}} major new {{initiatives}} {{in the face}} of these challenges. [...] "Ethics Technology" [...] was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology. It required Scientologists to [...] "disconnect" [...] from any organization or individual—including family members—deemed to be disruptive or [...] "suppressive". According to church-operated websites, “A person who disconnects is simply exercising his right to communicate or not to communicate with a particular person." [...] Hubbard stated: “Communication, however, is a two-way flow. If one has the right to communicate, then one must also have the right to not receive communication from another. It is this latter corollary of the right to <b>communicate</b> <b>that</b> gives us our right to privacy.” Scientologists were also required to write [...] "Knowledge Reports" [...] on each other, reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods. Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable [...] "Misdemeanors", [...] "Crimes", and [...] "High Crimes". The [...] "Fair Game" [...] policy was introduced, which was applicable to anyone deemed an [...] "enemy" [...] of Scientology: [...] "May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Science writer Timothy Ferris has {{posited that}} since galactic {{societies}} {{are most likely}} only transitory, an obvious solution is an interstellar communications network, or a type of library consisting mostly of automated systems.

Ferris calls this the [...] "Interstellar Internet", with the various automated systems acting as network [...] "servers". [...] If such an Interstellar Internet exists, the hypothesis states, communications between servers are mostly through narrow-band, highly directional radio or laser links. Intercepting such signals is, as discussed earlier, very difficult. However, the network could maintain some broadcast nodes in hopes of making contact with new civilizations.|$|E
