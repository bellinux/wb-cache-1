25|$|Driver {{changes are}} permitted, however {{starting}} the race {{with a different}} driver than whom qualified the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> result in the car starting {{at the rear of}} the field.

Daimler is not planning to sell the electric version outside Europe.|$|R
25|$|Dominance is {{a strong}} reason to seek for a {{solution}} among always-switching strategies, under fairly general assumptions on {{the environment in which}} the contestant is making decisions. In particular, if the car is hidden by means of some randomization device – like tossing symmetric or asymmetric three-sided die – the dominance implies that a strategy maximizing the probability of winning the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> be among three always-switching strategies, namely it will be the strategy that initially picks the least likely door then switches no matter which door to switch is offered by the host.|$|E
25|$|The {{driver is}} {{responsible}} for {{checking to see if}} the representative box on the screen correctly identifies the parking space; if the space is large enough to park, the box will be green in color; if the box is incorrectly placed, or lined in red, using the arrow buttons moves the box until it turns green. Once the parking space is correctly identified, the driver presses OK and takes his/her hands off the steering wheel, while keeping the foot on the brake pedal. When the driver slowly releases the brake, while keeping the foot on the brake pedal, the <b>car</b> <b>will</b> then begin to back up and steer itself into the parking space.|$|E
