500|$|At the 2014 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Doha, Qatar, Cielo {{won three}} gold and two bronze medals, into the best Brazilian {{participation}} of all time, {{where the country}} won the competition for the first time. In the Men's 4 × 50 metre medley relay, formed by Cielo, Felipe França, Nicholas Santos and Guilherme Guido, considered the [...] "Dream Team" [...] by Cielo himself (formed only by medalists or world champions in their respective individual events), Brazil won the gold shattering the world record {{with a time of}} 1:30.51. In the Men's 50 metre freestyle, Cielo went to the final in first place with a time of 20.80 seconds, but in the final, he had problems with his start and at the turn, finishing with a time of 20.88 and getting the bronze. His rival, the French Florent Manaudou, won the gold beating the world record. Cielo also helped the Brazilian 4 × 50 metre mixed freestyle relay (formed by Cielo, João de Lucca, Etiene Medeiros and Larissa Oliveira) to win the bronze medal, beating the South American record with a time of 1:29.17, only 4 hundredths of Russia, which won the silver medal. In this race, Cielo opened with a time of 20.65, showing that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> better time in the 50-metre freestyle final. On {{the last day of the}} competition, Cielo won the rematch against Manaudou, in the Men's 100 metre freestyle, where Manaudou was also favorite, but was defeated by Cielo, who won the gold with a time of 45.75. Cielo also closed the competition with a flourish, leading the Brazilian quartet to an unprecedented gold in the traditional Men's 4 × 100 metre medley relay, with a time of 3:21.14, South American record. Cielo took the relay in fourth place and surpassed everyone with an incredible split time of 44.67.|$|E
500|$|... "Gimme More" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists {{and a great}} number of amateurs. In late 2007, American singer-songwriter Marié Digby posted an {{acoustic}} cover of [...] "Gimme More" [...] along with a cover of Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] in her YouTube account. Both became viral hits, with [...] "Gimme More" [...] gaining more than 300,000 views in two weeks. Shortly after, Digby became the eighth most subscribed-to artist on YouTube. She joked about the situation saying, [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> karaoke video to , but I just had my stripper pole taken out the other day from my living room, and it just wouldn't have been the same". The same year, Australian pop singer Sia released an acoustic version of the song. Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy covered the song on their third studio album Overworld, released on February 13, 2008. Matthieu De Ronde of Archaic Magazine commented [...] " [...] one of the most unexpected covers of all time, [...] this track has been given a somewhat comical but enjoyable makeover, but who said that metal couldn’t be fun?". American singer-songwriter Christopher Dallman played a cover of the song during many of his concerts in 2007. Two years later, he showed his version to his producer Rachel Alina, who prompted him to release an EP of Spears's covers. The EP, titled Sad Britney, was released on November 9, 2009, and also contained covers of [...] "Radar", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "...Baby One More Time". It became Dallman's first record to chart on iTunes. He also released a music video for [...] "Gimme More", which was criticized by Spears's fans who thought Dallman was making fun of her. He explained, [...] "There have been a few folks who have misinterpreted what I was doing and thought that I was somehow making fun of her, which really isn’t the case.

2500|$|Smart Bomb Interactive {{stated that}} the {{inspiration}} for Flying Ace came from their well received 2006 title, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron.

[...] "But of course, it was Charles M. Schulz’s original strips of Snoopy as the World Famous WWI Flying Ace that are the ultimate inspiration" [...] added Stacey.

[...] Not content with his explanation, Stewart showed videos in which Cramer recommended ways to drive down stock prices by spreading false rumors, deceiving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and deliberately misleading journalists. Cramer admitted {{that he can do}} better, and that he can change. He also pointed out the mass illusion on Wall Street and the finance industry in general that, in the words of former Merrill Lynch CEO Stanley O'Neal, [...] "fixed income and credit (i.e. the economy) were no longer cyclical in nature", and that this illusion had permeated Wall Street and all other industries connected to it, including the finance networks.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{requirements}} given by Mancuso to Nimoy when asking him to oversee The Undiscovered Country {{was to have a}} handover moment between The Original Series and [...] The initial idea was to have the film introduce an element that would later be picked up by The Next Generation, and was discussed with Nimoy, Meyer and the series producer Rick Berman. It was agreed that Nimoy would make an appearance as Spock in the series, across a two-part episode, in an idea developed by Berman and Michael Piller. The actor was sold on the idea that Spock would be a central figure in an attempt to reunite the Vulcan and Romulan people in a peaceful manner, which Nimoy liked. The two parts of the episode were shot out of order to accommodate Nimoy's availability across five days. Piller later suggested in hindsight that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> great deal more with Spock but the reunification of the Vulcan and Romulan people was of sufficient [...] "cosmic significance" [...] to warrant the return of the character to television.|$|E
