5|$|Each <b>Cosmos</b> player {{named to}} a NASL all-star team is named below, {{along with his}} regular season and {{play-off}} statistics. The nationality given for each player {{is based on the}} national team represented, or his birthplace if he is uncapped. No NASL all-star from the <b>Cosmos</b> was born in the United States or Canada. During the club's 14 NASL seasons, the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award was won by a <b>Cosmos</b> player on five occasions, which are also detailed below.|$|E
5|$|After the , (his 19th with Santos), Pelé {{retired from}} Brazilian club {{football}} although {{he continued to}} occasionally play for Santos in official competitive matches. Two years later, {{he came out of}} semi-retirement to sign with the New York <b>Cosmos</b> of the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the 1975 season. Though well past his prime at this point, Pelé was credited with significantly increasing public awareness and interest of the sport in the United States. Hoping to fuel the same kind of awareness in the Dominican Republic, he and the <b>Cosmos</b> team played in an exhibition match against Haitian team, Violette AC, in the Santo Domingo Olympic Stadium on 3 June 1976, where over 25,000 fans watched him score a winning goal in the last seconds of the match, leading the <b>Cosmos</b> to a 2–1 victory. He led the <b>Cosmos</b> to the 1977 NASL championship, in his third and final season with the club.|$|E
5|$|D. The <b>Cosmos</b> did {{not enter}} an indoor league for the 1982–83 season.|$|E
5|$|Georges Dumézil {{theorized that}} Víðarr {{represents}} a cosmic figure from an archetype {{derived from the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans. Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space, due to his placement of {{his foot on the}} wolf's lower jaw and his hand on the wolf's upper jaw, and horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the <b>cosmos,</b> and the <b>cosmos</b> can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|In April 1885, the <b>Cosmos</b> Club {{considered}} {{purchasing the}} house from the Tayloe family. The influential club already owned most of the block north of the Tayloe House, and was expanding rapidly. It valued the home at $60,000 and the furnishings at an additional $5,000. The <b>Cosmos</b> Club declined to buy the home after an investigation found {{that the cost of}} upgrading the Tayloe property for its use would be too costly.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cosmos</b> Club finally {{purchased}} {{the house on}} December 1, 1917. It used the home as its women's annex, and converted the stables into a meeting hall.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{characters from}} different Final Fantasy games and {{centers on a}} great conflict between <b>Cosmos,</b> goddess of harmony, and Chaos, the god of discord. The two summon multiple warriors {{to fight for their}} sides in their thirteenth war. During the story, the player controls the ten warriors chosen by <b>Cosmos,</b> the protagonists from the first ten Final Fantasy games, in their journey. The game's English and international versions also give access to other features such an arcade mode.|$|E
5|$|E. The <b>Cosmos</b> {{pulled out}} of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) after 33 games, citing low attendances. The MISL also used the games behind system, and ranked both goals and assists as one point.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, Nash {{participated in}} a {{training}} session with the Italian soccer club Inter Milan at the New York Red Bulls' facilities in New Jersey. He also trained with the New York <b>Cosmos</b> B of the American fourth-division National Premier Soccer League in 2015.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, Philadelphia {{played at}} home versus the New York <b>Cosmos</b> of the second-tier North American Soccer League {{in what was}} only Curtin's second game as head coach. Overtime was again needed as the teams ended {{regulation}} tied at one apiece before Sébastien Le Toux scored the game-winner in the 115th minute. Shortly after the goal, a melee erupted between the teams that resulted in two <b>Cosmos</b> players and one Union player being sent off for pushing and shoving. Two of New York's assistant coaches were also ejected for their parts in the disorder.|$|E
5|$|The Guardians of the Galaxy travel {{throughout}} the <b>cosmos</b> and {{struggle to keep}} their newfound family together while helping Peter Quill learn more about his true parentage and facing against new enemies.|$|E
5|$|The NASL all-star teams {{selected}} by the league {{at the end of}} each season included a total of 18 <b>Cosmos</b> players. These include numerous well-known players from outside the United States, signed from European or South American clubs. Examples of these are erstwhile West Germany captain Franz Beckenbauer and the former Brazil international players Pelé and Carlos Alberto; there were many others. Among the American players representing the <b>Cosmos</b> were two players born in Yugoslavia: U.S. international defender Werner Roth and Siegfried Stritzl, a midfielder. Canada international John Kerr, originally from Scotland, also turned out for New York during the early 1970s. Former Italy forward Giorgio Chinaglia holds many of the side's records pertaining to individual performance, appearing in the most matches, scoring the most goals and points, and sharing the record for most all-star appearances (six) with Vladislav Bogićević, a member of the Yugoslavia national team before his time with the <b>Cosmos.</b>|$|E
5|$|The New York <b>Cosmos</b> were an American soccer club {{based in}} New York. The side was {{originally}} created in 1971 by brothers Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun, {{with the support}} of Warner Brothers president Steve Ross. The new team entered the North American Soccer League (NASL), which was in its fourth season. Bankrolled by parent company Warner Communications, the <b>Cosmos</b> became the NASL's most successful side, winning a record five championships in front of the league's largest crowds. The team included international stars signed from European and South American clubs, including Brazilians Pelé and Carlos Alberto, West German Franz Beckenbauer, Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia and many others.|$|E
5|$|The {{large-scale}} {{structure of}} the <b>cosmos</b> is represented by groups and clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the superclusters. The collective matter is formed into filaments and walls, leaving large voids between.|$|E
5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the <b>cosmos,</b> the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015, Samaras was {{reported}} to have agreed terms with Serie A club Sampdoria, but the move fell through as the club were unhappy with the results of his medical. Afterwards, he spent time in New York to rehabilitate from a back injury, and in November 2015 was linked with a move to the New York <b>Cosmos,</b> although once again no move actually materialised.|$|E
5|$|In Dissidia Final Fantasy (an action {{game with}} several Final Fantasy heroes and villains), Tidus is the hero from Final Fantasy X: a warrior from the goddess, <b>Cosmos,</b> whose father {{works for the}} rival god Chaos. Tidus has two uniforms in this game, and his {{thoughts}} and actions refer to Final Fantasy X. With the cast, he reappears in the prequel Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy and represents Chaos in the previous war. Tidus is confronted by Yuna and offers his life to save her from an attack by the villain Emperor, but is saved by Jecht to become a warrior of <b>Cosmos.</b> In addition to his previous outfits, Tidus has a design based on an illustration by Square artist Yoshitaka Amano. He appears in the 2015 Dissidia reboot of the two previous games, representing Final Fantasy X. Tidus is a playable character in the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy rhythm game. He also appears in World of Final Fantasy, and Fortune Street: Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the darkest}} night of hate and {{intolerance}} we see impossible love stories conquering what our governments and societies declare is legally 'allowed' to be love... It is for love that transcends the romantic conception {{of man and}} woman and stretches out into the impossibilities of the <b>cosmos.</b> It leaves room for failure but hopes for success.|$|E
5|$|Pelé's goalscoring {{record is}} often {{reported}} by FIFA as being 1281 goals in 1363 games. This figure includes goals scored by Pelé in friendly club matches, like international tours Pelé completed with Santos and the New York <b>Cosmos,</b> {{and a few}} games Pelé played in for the Brazilian armed forces teams during his national service in Brazil. He was listed in the Guinness World Records for most career goals scored in football his goalscoring record.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Crease {{presented}} {{himself as a}} foe of the Hudson's Bay Company's hegemony over the colony, and in 1860 {{was elected to the}} Vancouver Island House of Assembly as an independent member representing Victoria. However, he was soon criticised by the British Colonist (a paper run by opposition leader Amor de <b>Cosmos)</b> for being too cozy with the HBC-backed government. The following year, as if to prove de <b>Cosmos</b> right, governor Sir James Douglas appointed Crease Attorney-General of British Columbia, and Crease resigned his seat in the Assembly. He was a key member of the government, responsible for pushing literally hundreds of laws through the legislature, in between his continuing circuit tours, most of which was concerned with regulating the resource-based economic activity of the colony, including land settlement and gold mining. His legislation cemented his reputation as an advocate of free trade.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett also {{collaborated with}} British science fiction author Stephen Baxter on a {{parallel}} earth series. The first novel, entitled The Long Earth {{was released on}} 21 June 2012. A second novel, The Long War, was released on 18 June 2013. The Long Mars was published in 2014. The fourth book in the series, The Long Utopia, was published in June 2015, and the fifth, The Long <b>Cosmos,</b> in June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Some exact {{solutions}} describe {{gravitational waves}} without any approximation, e.g., a wave train traveling through empty space or Gowdy universes, varieties of an expanding <b>cosmos</b> filled with gravitational waves. But for gravitational waves produced in astrophysically relevant situations, {{such as the}} merger of two black holes, numerical methods are presently {{the only way to}} construct appropriate models.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{is found}} in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed, or by planting grasses and perennial plants, such as zinnias, <b>cosmos,</b> bee balm, or globe thistle, which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.|$|E
5|$|The Botanic Garden (1791) {{is a set}} of two poems, The Economy of Vegetation and The Loves of the Plants, by the British {{poet and}} naturalist Erasmus Darwin. The Economy of Vegetation celebrates {{technological}} innovation, scientific discovery and offers theories concerning contemporary scientific questions, such as the history of the <b>cosmos.</b> The more popular Loves of the Plants promotes, revises and illustrates Linnaeus's classification scheme for plants.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cosmos</b> Club vacated the Tayloe House in 1952 {{to move to}} new {{headquarters}} in the Townsend Mansion at 2121 Massachusetts Avenue NW, at which time the building was purchased by the U.S. government and used for offices. From October 1958 until November 1961, {{the headquarters of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were in the Tayloe House. T. Keith Glennan, the first Administrator of NASA, also had his office in the structure.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{viewed the}} <b>cosmos</b> as highly structured; there were {{thirteen}} {{levels in the}} heavens, and nine levels in the underworld; the mortal world occupied a position between the heavens and the underworld. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west was black.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} objects outside our galaxy is {{a branch of}} {{astronomy}} concerned with the formation and evolution of Galaxies, their morphology (description) and classification, the observation of active galaxies, and at a larger scale, the groups and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the latter {{is important for the}} understanding of the large-scale structure of the <b>cosmos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{regarded as}} foreign elements in Roman culture, {{music and dance}} had existed in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the tibia (Greek aulos), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices to ward off ill influences. Song (carmen) {{was an integral part}} of almost every social occasion. The Secular Ode of Horace, commissioned by Augustus, was performed publicly in 17 BC by a mixed children's choir. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the <b>cosmos,</b> and was associated particularly with mathematics and knowledge.|$|E
5|$|For some readers, Arthur C. Clarke's more {{straightforward}} novelization of {{the script}} is key to interpreting the film. Clarke's novel explicitly identifies the monolith as a tool created by an alien race that has been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic form to biomechanical, and finally achieving a state of pure energy. These aliens travel the <b>cosmos</b> assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Conversely, film critic Penelope Houston wrote in 1971 that because the novel differs in many key respects from the film, it perhaps should not {{be regarded as the}} skeleton key to unlock it.|$|E
5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian <b>cosmos.</b> This {{laid the groundwork for}} Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was the basis of his attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Walter Baade {{became the}} first {{astronomer}} to identify a nebula as a supernova remnant when he suggested that the Crab Nebula was the remains of SN 1054. He noted that, while it had {{the appearance of a}} planetary nebula, the measured velocity of expansion was much too large to belong to that classification. During the same year, Baade first proposed the use of the Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator. Later, the work of Allan Sandage and Gustav Tammann helped refine the process so that Type Ia supernovae became a type of standard candle for measuring large distances across the <b>cosmos.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2015, in an {{interview}} given to the French weekly magazine Air et <b>Cosmos,</b> Jean-Charles Marcos, CEO of Akka Research, explained that once developed and marketed the Air-Cobot should cost between 100,000 and 200,000 euros. He could meet civilian needs in nondestructive testing and also military ones. A possible continuation of the project could be {{the use of the}} robot on aircraft larger than the Airbus A320. The CEO also revealed that Akka Technologies plans to work on a duo of robots for inspection: the same mobile platform for the lower parts, and a drone for the upper parts. If funding is allocated then this second phase would take place during the period 2017–2020.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{politicians}} who have attended Dalhousie include three Prime Ministers of Canada, R.B. Bennett, Joe Clark, and Brian Mulroney. Eight graduates {{have served as}} Lieutenant Governors: John Crosbie, Myra Freeman, Clarence Gosse, John Keiller MacKay, Henry Poole MacKeen, John Robert Nicholson, Fabian O'Dea, and Albert Walsh. Twelve graduates have served as provincial premiers: Allan Blakeney, John Buchanan, Alex Campbell, Amor De <b>Cosmos,</b> Darrell Dexter, Joe Ghiz, John Hamm, Angus Lewis Macdonald, Russell MacLellan, Gerald Regan, Robert Stanfield, Clyde Wells, and Danny Williams. The first woman appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, Bertha Wilson, was a graduate from Dalhousie Law School.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our <b>cosmos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Observations of the {{large-scale}} {{structure of the}} Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the <b>cosmos.</b> Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded {{over the course of}} 13.8 billion years to its present condition. The concept of the big bang {{can be traced back to}} the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1977, Pelé {{closed out}} {{his career in}} an {{exhibition}} match between the <b>Cosmos</b> and Santos. Santos arrived in New York after previously defeating the Seattle Sounders in New Jersey, 2–0. The match was played {{in front of a}} sold out crowd at Giants Stadium and was televised in the United States on ABC's Wide World of Sports as well as throughout the world. Pelé's father and wife both attended the match, as well as Muhammad Ali and Bobby Moore.|$|E
