The term stability refers to the higher predictability of a released <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>plan</b> (or a load plan), and also signifies the robustness of a manufacturing process against internal/external uncertainties. The objective of CRP mentioned in this study is to determine a stable allocation of each manufacturing resource to given operation orders with the aim of minimizing the probability that the resource requirement of each operation order exceeds the capacity of corresponding resource. Through some computational simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed CRP method is applicable as a short-term CRP method by applying it to a flexible job-shop manufacturing system...|$|R

40|$|Master {{production}} schedule (MPS) {{plays an important}} role in an integrated production planning system. It converts the strategic planning defined in a production plan into the tactical operation execution. The MPS is also known as a tool for top management to control over manufacture resources and becomes input of the downstream planning levels such as material <b>requirement</b> <b>planning</b> (MRP) and <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>planning</b> (CRP). Hence, inappropriate decision on the MPS development may lead to infeasible execution, which ultimately causes poor delivery performance. One must ensure that the proposed MPS is valid and realistic for implementation before it is released to real manufacturing system. In practice, where production environment is stochastic in nature, the development of MPS is no longer simple task. The varying processing time, random event such as machine failure is just some of the underlying causes of uncertainty that may be hardly addressed at planning stage so that in the end the valid and realistic MPS is tough to be realized. The MPS creation problem becomes even more sophisticated as decision makers try to consider multi-objectives; minimizing inventory, maximizing customer satisfaction, and maximizing resource utilization. This study attempts to propose a methodology for MPS creation which is able to deal with those obstacles. This approach takes into account uncertainty and makes trade off among conflicting multi-objectives at the same time. It incorporates fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) and discrete event simulation (DES) for MPS development...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{aimed to}} develop a {{practical}} finite <b>capacity</b> material <b>requirement</b> <b>planning</b> (FCMRP) system based {{on the needs of}} an automotive-part manufacturing company in Thailand. The approach includes a linear programming model to determine the optimal start time of each operation to minimize the weighted average of total earliness, total tardiness, and average flow-time considering the finite capacity of all work centers and precedence of operations. Important factors of the proposed FCMRP system were objective function weights and dispatching rules. Effects of these factors on the performance measures were statistically analyzed based on a real situation of an auto-part factory. Statistical results showed that the dispatching rules and objective function weights had significant effects on the performance measures of the proposed FCMRP system. The proposed FCMRP system offered a good trade-off between conflicting performance measures and resulted in the best weighted average performance measure when compared with conventional forward and forward-backward finite capacity scheduling systems...|$|R

The objective is to minimize {{the total cost of}} underutilization, overtime production, and carrying inventory. Although it is desirable to achieve a stable inventory level in a production system, the stochastic nature of the demand causes inventory fluctuation over the planning horizon. As a result, we incorporate in our model the deviation of the actual inventory level from the ideal inventory level as a set of chance constraints, which may be violated with a specified probability. In this way the SLP problem is transformed into an ordinary deterministic LP problem, which can be solved efficiently and cheaply on computers to obtain the optimal planning strategy...|$|E

If the Planning-needs of process time capacity is not optimum, then it will disturb {{the production}}-scheduled and caused loss profit for the time and process session. So, it will be needed a planning method to the time capacity for a good production that suitable for the maximum output to fulfill market- demand. PT.

The classification procedure is complex and hump yards constitute bottlenecks in the rail freight network, often causing outbound trains to be delayed. One {{of the problems is}} that planning for the allocation of tracks at hump yards is difficult, given that the planner has limited resources (tracks, shunting engines, etc.) and needs to foresee the future <b>capacity</b> <b>requirements</b> when <b>planning</b> for the current inbound trains. In this paper, we consider the problem of allocating classification tracks in a rail freight hump yard for arriving and departing trains with predetermined arrival and departure times. The core problem can be formulated as a special list coloring problem. We focus on an extension where individual cars can temporarily be stored on a special subset of the tracks. An extension where individual cars can temporarily be stored on a special subset of the tracks is also considered. We model the problem using mixed integer programming, and also propose several heuristics that can quickly give feasible track allocations. As a case study, we consider a real-world problem instance from the Hallsberg Rangerbangård hump yard in Sweden. Planning over horizons over two to four days, we obtain feasible solutions from both the exact and heuristic approaches that allow all outgoing trains to leave on time. RANPLA...|$|R

40|$|Technological {{development}} and market diversification increase {{the complexity of}} modern manufacturing environments. Although the popular literature on lean management practices and quality improvement programs describe numerous ways of decreasing the complexity of manufacturing processes, the complete elimination of complexity is seldom possible. Thus, one needs {{to understand how to}} mitigate the performance effects of complexity with appropriate management practices. The research questions of this dissertation ask first, what do we already know about operations management under complexity, and second, how the applicability of day-to-day operations management practices depends upon the different dimensions of complexity. The research question on the existing knowledge about operations management under complexity is answered in two steps. First, I present a comprehensive review of organization-theoretical literature on the concept of complexity. This review results in a number of propositions on different ways of managing complexity. Second, I analyze the evidence for those propositions in a systematic literature review of recent operations management research. The results of that review point to a number of contribution opportunities, which guide the empirical studies that address my second research question. The research question on the applicability of operations management practices under different kinds of complexity is addressed with three studies within the same focused sample of 163 machinery manufacturing processes. The first study examines how the applicability of different order management practices depends upon the complexity arising from product customization. The second study examines the effects of process complexity on the applicability of different capacity planning methods. The third study examines the effects of different kinds of uncertainties on the applicability of different exception processing routines. As the studied practices begin from the acquisition of orders and end in the delivery of products, they constitute a holistic view of day-to-day operations management in manufacturing firms. The empirical analyses result in three contingency-theoretical propositions. First, I argue that product configurator tools, available-to-promise verifications, and configuration management practices are only applicable with specific levels of customization in products' configurations and components. Second, I argue that rough-cut capacity planning methods are only applicable with job-shop processes, <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>planning</b> is only applicable with batch-shop processes, and finite loading methods are only applicable with bottleneck-controlled batch shops and assembly lines. Third, I argue that only formal automated exception reporting channels are applicable when urgent glitches are being resolved in production processes. Meanwhile, only formal interpersonal exception reporting channels are applicable when equivocal glitches are being resolved. The theses have immediate practical implications for managers who are responsible for production processes in complex task environments. The studies show that none of this dissertation's theses are commonly known by practitioners nor discussed in the literature. In addition to the immediate implications for the studied environments, the theses can be theoretically generalized to other environments that satisfy certain boundary conditions. Examples can be found in service production, healthcare operations, and software development. The resulting middle-range theories of operations management in complex task environments can be tested in future studies with random samples of processes from other operations management contexts...|$|R

This CASE/ERP's main modules, which based on ERP theory. The thesis specifies every module's actual business requirements, business data flow, database structure, and main function design. CASE/ERP is a software package for the enterprise's management. It includes almost every aspects of the enterprise. The main modules of CASE/ERP are purchase, inventory, sale, distribution, transportation, general ledger, financial table, accounts receivable, account payable, budget, fixed assets, salary, cost, production data, master production scheduling, material requirements planning, <b>capacity</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>planning,</b> workshop control, just in time production, human resource, facilities, quality control, business forecast and policy decision etc. CASE/ERP is essentially different from the single module development software. Its modules are highly integrates, one module's data can be shared with another. High integration bring more difficulties to the software design and implementation. The modules of CASE/ERP are related with database. We design the databases according to the principle of 'one thing one database'. We describe almost every attributes of an entity in one database. Then along with the business process flow, we design the correlation functions (using by different department) to update some attributes of the entity. The system design of CASE/ERP has three main lines, they are purchase-sale-inventory, manufacture and finance. The business within each main line is relatively tight connection. And we establish relationships between main lines by common database. The module providing the data, writes the information into the common databases. The module using the data, reads the information from the common databases. The thesis introduces the design and implementation process of CASE/ERP's material, manufacture, sales, financing, and cost. The content of each chapter and the relationship between them are specified as follows: The material system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as purchase requirement, purchase order, goods receiving, and the inventory business. The main function of this system includes collecting the requirements of material from the material requirements and inventory reordering planning; referring to the vendor's status and the material's purchase lot policy and lead time to make purchase orders; checking and accepting purchase material; registering warehouse account; distributing material in warehouse, recording each inventory operation information such as material in, out, moving, and taking stock. The manufacture system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as production data, MPS (master production scheduling), MRP (material requirements planning), CRP (<b>capacity</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>planning),</b> workshop control and JIT (just in time production) etc. The main functions of this system are: recording production data, such as product structure, working center and manufacture routing etc.; working out master production scheduling according to the customer order and sales forecast; calculating the need quantity and need time of the material for manufacture, working out the material requirements planning; comparing the working load and the capability of working center in a period of time, working out the capacity requirements planning; arranging the production mission of workshop and production line. The sales system of CASE/ERP deals with sales planning, sales order, goods delivering, and sales invoice. Sales order is the center of the sales business. The main functions of this system are: referring to the yearly production planning to work out the products sales planning; recording the customers' orders; making out the shipment sheet, recording the actual shipment information; making out the sales invoice and notifying the financial department to settle the account receivable. The financing system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as general ledger, cash control, financial table, accounts payable, account receivable, etc. The financing system controls all the enterprise's economical activities, account the enterprise's current assets and fixed assets and liabilities and owner's equity. The main functions of this system are: applying for reimbursement; checking the account of cash in bank; defining and printing financial table; settling the account payable for purchase goods; settling the account receivable for sale products. The cost system of CASE/ERP includes such contents as standard cost calculate, actual cost calculate, cost planning. The cost system distributes the direct materials and the direct labor and manufacturing expenses to the products, and calculates the actuarial cost for each product. Cost system compares the actuarial cost with the planning cost and the standard cost. Through the comparison, we can analyze whether the actuarial cost structure is right, and find the right way to reduce production costs. CASE/ERP conforms to the method provided by software engineering during the development process. By reason of the limit of pages, the thesis only specifies main module's design and implementation process, and only describes some main database structures and main programs flow charts. At present, CASE/ERP has already been successfully used in some large enterprises. It brings many benefits for enterprise's management...|$|E

In this paper, the case of a single observation station and Gaussian noise communication channel with an eavesdropper is considered. The channel <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> is studied from the information the-oretic perspective. The smart grid is modeled as a linear dynamic system. Then, the channel <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> is studied for the {{state estimation}} of general linear dynamic systems and then applied in the system state estimation in smart grid. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> in typical configurations of smart grid. I...|$|R

We model the constellation as an N # N mesh-torus topology under a uniform all-to-all tra#c model.

In both cases, we use a method of `cuts on a graph' to obtain lower bounds on <b>capacity</b> <b>requirements</b> and subsequently find algorithms for routing and failure recovery that meet these bounds.

From a model of ill-known requirements expressed in quantity for a date and a dependency between requirements expressed by a logic relation, a graph is built which represents all the possible <b>requirement</b> <b>plans.</b> From this graph, the decision maker can choose a plausible <b>requirement</b> <b>plan.</b> This method is illustrated on an example...|$|R
