40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency and decrease the costs of power generation, gas turbines {{have to be able to}} operate using a wide range of alternative fuels, such as crude oil, biogas or unclean syngas. Many of the alternative fuels contain substantial amounts of contaminants, especially sulphur. This means that gas turbine components will be exposed to environments in which not only oxidation but also sulphidation will be an issue. Such components are typically coated with protective coating systems, including MCrAlY-coatings and thermal barrier coatings. However, during service, after the long term exposure to cyclic temperature coatings may crack or spall, thereby allowing direct access of the hot gases to the superalloys surface. Therefore the oxidation resistance of the Ni-base superalloy to oxidizing/sulphidizing atmospheres becomes an important factor for the lifetime of the turbine components. In the present work the oxidation behaviour of Ni-base superalloys in high pO 2, SO 2 -containing environments have been studied. For this purpose, screening tests of commercial alloys commonly used in stationary gas turbines, were performed to establish the sensitivity of alloys to the presence of SO 2 in the test gas (synthetic air). Based on the screening test results, commercial Ni-base superalloys with similar Cr and Al contents were chosen to determine which parameters affect the material resistance against the enhanced attack by SO 2. In the first part of the thesis, the behaviour of alloys with 12 - 14 % Cr and 3 - 4 % Al, namely PWA 1483 and Rene 80, in synthetic air is compared with that in synthetic air + 2 % SO 2 at 1050 °C. The second part of the present investigation concerns the behaviour of Ni-base superalloys with 5 - 6 % Al and 6 - 8 % Cr. For the latter comparison two alloys were chosen: CMSX 4 and CM 247. The results of the present work clearly show that Ni-base alloys such as PWA 1483 and Rene 80, as well as CMSX 4 and CM 247 exhibit tremendous differences in resistance to SO 2 attack in high pO 2 gas, in spite of possessing similar Cr and Al contents. The overall corrosion behaviour in the SO 2 containing gas critically depends on the other alloy constituents. The far better resistance of PWA 1483 and CMSX 4 in the SO 2 -containing environment is shown to be related to the rapid development of a dense alumina scale, which prevents access of molecular SO 2 to the metal surface and effectively supresses sulphidation. In contrast, a porous chromia based scale formed on Rene 80. The latter type of surface scale allows easy molecular access of SO 2, which eventually results in breakaway oxidation triggered by formation of internal <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphide.</b> The formation of fast growing porous chromia scale on Rene 80 was attributed to the Ti addition of 5 wt. %, which increases the growth rate of the Cr 2 O 3 -scale by p-type doping thereby suppressing the formation of a protective alumina scale. Furthermore, Ta addition to Ti containing Ni-base alloys, such as in PWA 1483, was found to promote external alumina scale formation by forming a mixed Ti/Ta oxide compound, hence preventing the enhancement of chromia growth by Ti incorporation. The effect of Ti and Ta on the scale formation was verified by using model alloys of the same base composition Ni- 9 Co- 14 Cr- 3 Al. Owing to a high Al-content of 5. 6 wt. % CMSX 4 formed rather pure alumina scale after relatively short period of transient oxidation. In contrast, CM 247 with the same Al-content formed an Al-rich oxide scale with high amounts of Hf and B-containing oxides, which compromised its resistance to sulphidation and resulted in rapid failure in synthetic air + 2 % SO 2. Using model alloys it was shown that the addition of B is detrimental for the oxidation resistance of Ni-base alloys with 8 wt. % Cr and 5 - 6 wt. % Al. The formation of Al/B mixed oxides can explain why after short time exposure the Al 2 O 3 formation was locally hindered, thereby allowing transport of SO 2 and enhanced formation of internal Cr-sulphide. The reason for the rapid enrichment of B within the scale is that it forms a thermodynamically very stable oxide combined with much faster boron diffusivity in the Ni-rich matrix as compared to Al and Cr. The rapid incorporation of boron into the oxide scale apparently resulted in boron depletion from the alloys. This was indicated by specimens exposed for 500 h to synthetic air which showed continuous Al 2 O 3 scale formation for all three studied model materials...|$|E

Non-preoxidated and preoxidated (preliminarily oxidated in air atmosphere) samples were put through sulphurisation process. The SEM, EDX and XRD methods {{were employed to}} examine scale surface morphology, including its chemical constitution and phase composition. The SEM tests allowed to find that scale structure depends on atmosphere content and temperature. In conditions of high sulphur vapour pressure values (exceeding iron sulphide dissociation pressure), scale has two layers and consists of a mixture of iron <b>sulphides</b> (FenSm) and <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphides</b> (CrxSy). Outer scale layer is built of large, column-shaped grains with composition corresponding to (FenSm), whereas its inner layer – fine-grained and porous – {{is a mixture of}} <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphides,</b> iron sulphides and sulphospinels. Occurrence of internal oxidation zone has been observed at the temperatures of 800 ◦C and 900 ◦C. Scale has single layer at low sulphur vapour pressure values, that is under FeS dissociation pressure. Preoxidated steel samples undergo sulphurisation process also after incubation period. This period is changeable and depends on sulphur vapour temperature and pressure. The structure and chemical constitution of scale formed on pre-oxidated samples depends on sulphurisation process parameters. Morphology of outer scale surface on preoxidated samples is complicated, because sulphides of all steel constituents are forming on the surface of oxides...|$|R
40|$|The 8 th European {{conference on}} coal {{research}} and its applications. Oxyfuel combustion is envisaged {{as one of}} the main options for power production from fossil fuels in a carbon constrained scenery. There are still certain aspects of oxycombustion still on research stage, one of those is the issue of boiler materials resistance to corrosion due to solid deposits formed as a consequence of slagging in CO 2 rich flue gases. The novel approach to the issue is the simulation of realistic slagging by pyrite projection through an oxyacetylene spray gun, flying along a controlled flame and impacting onto metallic surfaces of selected composition for fireside waterwall construction (F 22, P 91, 409, 347, 304 H and I 800 HT). Metallic surface temperature was kept at 400, 500, 600 and 700 ºC, and after deposition, metallic coupons were aged for long periods (150 and 1500 hours) at the selected conditions (O 2 /N 2, CO 2 /N 2). The characterization of deposits was performed with XRD, SEMEDX and carburization tests. The first finding is that the oxidation scale progression is different when partially transformed pyrite covers metallic surfaces: chromium oxide grows as a response to oxidation between the steel and the deposit, less dense and partially interrupted, and no iron oxide scale is generated. There is a clear presence of <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphides</b> in competence with the chromium oxide. On the other hand, comparison of scales in CO 2 vs. air indicates same chemical composition but different morphology: in air combustion, corrosion layers are thicker and cracked. These results can improve the prediction of operational problems in coal oxyfuel combustion. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|However, not all {{contaminants}} {{are easily}} treated by bioremediation using microorganisms. For example, heavy metals such as {{cadmium and lead}} are not readily absorbed or captured by microorganisms. A recent experiment, however, suggests that fish bones have some success absorbing lead from contaminated soil. Bone char {{has been shown to}} bioremediate small amounts of cadmium, copper, and zinc. A recent experiment suggests that the removals of pollutants (nitrate, silicate, <b>chromium</b> and <b>sulphide)</b> from tannery wastewater were studied in batch experiments using marine microalgae. The assimilation of metals such as mercury into the food chain may worsen matters. Phytoremediation is useful in these circumstances because natural plants or transgenic plants are able to bioaccumulate these toxins in their above-ground parts, which are then harvested for removal. The heavy metals in the harvested biomass may be further concentrated by incineration or even recycled for industrial use. Some damaged artifacts at museums contain microbes which could be specified as bio remediating agents. In contrast to this situation, other contaminants, such as aromatic hydrocarbons as are common in petroleum, are relatively simple targets for microbial degradation, and some soils may even have some capacity to autoremediate, as it were, owing to the presence of autochthonous microbial communities capable of degrading these compounds.|$|R
40|$|Transition metal {{sulphides}} {{show the}} temperature programmed reduction (TPR) patterns consisting of multiple reduction domains: those at lower temperatures {{are attributed to}} the ‘‘weakly bonded'' sulphur, whereas the ‘‘bulk reduction'' peaks are usually placed at high temperatures. The present paper is focusing attention on the last type TPR maxima. Due to the positive free energy of reduction of catalytically important sulphides, their TPR at high temperatures is controlled by thermodynamics. For several bulk and supported sulphides, the ascending branch of the ‘‘bulk reduction'' event might be transformed to a linear (ln[H 2 S]– 1 /T) plot from which standard enthalpy of reduction can be reliably extracted with good precision. Thermodynamics of sulphur abstraction from mixed <b>sulphides</b> (Mo–W <b>sulphides,</b> <b>chromium</b> thiospinels), or from highly dispersed bulk and supported systems can be estimated and compared using this approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of cells {{that enables the}} electrical resistance of a material to be measured simultaneously with the collection of powder neutron diffraction data at a range of temperatures (4. 2 : 5 TIK: 5 1000) is described. The cells {{have been used to}} investigate the origin of the anomalous electron-transport properties of the ternary sulphides, TICu 6. ssS 4, BaCu 4 S 3 and CuFeS 2. Data for TICu 6. ssS 4 reveal that the anomaly observed at 255 K is associated with a structural change from P 41 n to 141 m on cooling due to a distortion involving a doubling of the e-axis of the unit cell. There,are. ~/ two resistance anomalies observed in BaCu 4 S 3. The first at 523 K is associated' with a phase transition from a two-phase mixture (Pllma + Cmem) to a Cmem phase, whilst the second anomaly can be correlated with the decomposition of the 'sample at 923 K. Variable temperature powder neutron diffraction reveals that CuFeS 2 adopts a tetragonal antiferromagnetically ordered structure up to 748 K, above which it consists of a mixture of two phases until TN = 823 K, where a loss of magnetic order is coincident with a transformation to a cubic structure. Resistance anomalies are observed at each of those temperatures. A new family of vanadium-substituted <b>chromium</b> <b>sulphides</b> (VxCr 2 -xS 3, 0 < x < 2) has been prepared and characterized by powder X-ray and neutron diffraction, SQUID magnetometry, electrical resistivity, and Seebeck coefficient measurements. Vanadium substitution leads to a single-phase region with a rhombohedral Cr 2 S 3 structure over the composition range 0. 0 < x: 5 0. 75, while at higher vanadium contents (1. 6 : 5 x < 2. 0) a second single-phase region, in which materials adopt a cation-deficient Cr 3 S 4 structure, is observed. Materials with the Cr 2 S 3 structure all exhibit semiconducting behavior whilst those adopting Cr 3 S 4 -type structure exhibit metallic behavior. Materials in both single phase regions undergo a magnetic ordering transition at temperatures in the range 90 - 118 K. Materials with the Cr 2 S 3 structure undergo a transition to a ferrimagnetic state, the nature of which has been determined by low-temperature neutron diffraction measurements. Structural studies of the mixed-metal sulphides, FexMnl_xS (0 : 5 x : 5 0. 4) were performed using powder neutron diffraction. Rietveld refinements show that all samples adopt a cubic rock-salt structure (F'm 3 m) at room temperature. The Feo. 2 Mno. sS sample is essentially pure phase whilst materials with higher Fe content contain 3 CFe 7 SS (21. 3 % in Feo. 4 Mno. 6 S). Low-temperature neutron diffraction reveals that all materials are magnetically ordered at temperatures in the range 180 - 185 K, below Which they show a structural distortion. The magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetically aligned layers, with antiferromagnetic coupling of adjacent layers. Electron-transport property measurements reveal that all the samples are Arrhenius semiconductors with activation energies that decrease with increasing Fe content.

This study presents a recently developed cyclic burner-rig test that is used to simulate helicopter engine conditions and to assess the oxidation and hot corrosion behaviour of MCrAlY coatings on nickel-base superalloys. A diluted sea-salt solution is atomised into the burner-rig to simulate hot-corrosion. Each cycle lasts 1 h with temperatures varying in the range of 900 Â°C to 1000 Â°C followed by 15 min cooling to room temperature. Specimens are tested up to 1000 such cycles. Three different NiCoCrAlYTa coating thicknesses are used to determine the influence of the Al reservoir on the lifetime of the coated MC 2 superalloy. The evolving microstructural features are identified using high resolution scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy and compared with isothermal testing in pure oxidising conditions. The NiCoCrAlYTa microstructure obtained after the burner-rig test has typical features of a Type 1 hot corrosion degradation, with internal oxidation and nitruration and a front of <b>chromium</b> and yttrium-rich <b>sulphides.</b> This type of advanced burner-rig test cycle is successful in reproducing the accelerated combined hot-corrosion/oxidation damage...|$|R
40|$|La {{migration}} et la spéciation de Cr, de Cu et de Pb sont étudiées sur le sol d'une colonne alimentée par les eaux usées de tanneries. La localisation des métaux est évaluée à l'aide du schéma d'extractions sélectives préconisé par Legret et al. (1988). Les résultats ont montré que l'horizon superficiel renferme des teneurs en métaux très élevées. Parmi les métaux étudiés, le Cr s'avère retenu essentiellement dans la phase résiduelle mais il se présente aussi sous des formes plus mobiles. Le Cu est principalement associé avec la phase résiduelle et organique. Le Pb est lié aux phases acido-soluble et réductible. De ce fait, l'épandage des eaux usées de tanneries, sans aucun traitement préalable, peut être une source de contamination des sols et des eaux souterraines, notamment pour le Cr. In Morocco, {{the town}} of Marrakesh, as {{in other areas of}} the country, is subject to multiple daily aggressions generated by industrial pollution, in particular from tanneries. The tannery waste water is discharged directly into the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems without any preliminary processing. In order to evaluate the danger that can be generated by tannery effluents in the receiving ecosystems, and to study the ecotoxicological and environmental impact resulting from that chemical treatment of these effluents, we determined, before and after treatment, the inhibitory effect of the two most polluted effluents originating from manufactured leather: liming-deliming and chromium tanning. The purpose of our investigation was thus to evaluate the acute toxicity of the chromium tanning and epilage-coat waste waters before and after chemical treatment. The invertebrate Daphnia pulex was used for the toxicity test and the toxicity due to these industrial waste waters was evaluated by regression analysis. The processing carried out on the chromium tanning waste water consisted of precipitation with sodium carbonate at different pH values. The treatment of liming-deliming wastewaters consisted of an elimination and recovery of the sulphide compounds without carrying out their degradation. The chromium level was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry with graphite furnace atomization. The results of the toxicity test showed that the investigated chromium tanning and liming-deliming effluents presented were toxic, with respective IC 50 - 24 h values of 0. 15 and 3. 36 (expressed as dilution ratios). This toxicity could be explained by high levels of <b>chromium,</b> <b>sulphides</b> and organic matter in these waste waters. It is however difficult to correlate the IC 50 values obtained with those of the physical-chemical parameters. The tested effluents are very complex matrices. On the other hand, we noticed a notable difference between these two effluents. The mineral tanning effluent is contaminated with chromium and organic matter, whereas the second is especially rich in organic matter and <b>sulphide.</b> The total <b>chromium</b> concentration corresponding to the IC 50 - 24 h value of the raw chromium tanning effluent is lower than that which would be expected on the basis on the known toxicity of K 2 Cr 2 O 7, showing the toxicity of raw chromium waste waters is due not only to chromium, but also to other chemicals used during the manufacturing process of leather. After processing by chemical precipitation, the IC 50 - 24 h values increased from 0. 15 to 26. 6 and from 3. 36 to 11. 1 respectively, for the chromium tanning and the epilage-coat effluents. Consequently, these treated sewages can be classified as low toxicity wastes. The comparison of the results is very difficult considering that the test conditions and the physicochemical and heavy metal characteristics of the effluents vary enormously over time, without forgetting the physicochemical composition of the experimental solution used by standard OECD (fresh water) and the standard ISO (synthetic water). From where necessity to vary tests for determining well the degree of an effluent toxicity which the effects appear differently at various levels trophic. The diminution observed in the toxicity of the effluents is linked to a reduction of suspended matter (95 %), COD (55 %), Cr (90 %) and sulphides (50 %). Hence, this treatment presents at least two advantages. The first is environmental as just mentioned. The second is economic since chromium can be recycled for reuse in leather tanning. The results suggest that the recovered chromium is similar to commercial tanning chromium. These results also show that the fixing of chromium does not depend on the nature of the treated skin. In fact, a technical and economic analysis showed that proposed treatment can be economically beneficial (3112, 5 $ per 1000 tons of skins) ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{focused on}} the ecotoxicogical impact of the Kenyan tanning {{industry}} due to worldwide concern of the leather processing sector as a major polluter.   The results obtained indicated that the tannery dust, when measured against UK Statutory limits, posed an occupational risk through inhalable and respirable dust particle size functions and their toxic chemical nature.   The processing waste was high in <b>chromium,</b> chlorinated phenols, <b>sulphides,</b> chlorides, COD and BOD levels when analysed.   The treatment lagoons, which were designed to reduce the pollutant load, {{were found to be}} inefficient, as all stages of treatment including the discharge point demonstrated high toxicity when screened by lux- marked biosensor.   Measurement of activity of the microbial biomass indicated that river health was equally affected and that the observed high particulate content, colour, low DO (high BOD) and multiple effect of the contaminant was potentially causative.   In summary, the work succeeded in meeting the overall aim of the thesis by identifying the main contaminant risks from the tannery dust and effluent as well as in river water and sediments and, determining contaminant bioavailability in terms of toxicity levels. Three specific objectives were achieved {{at the end of the}} investigation: characterisation of effluents and sediments and riverine samples, assessment of ecotoxicity and bioremediation potential of primary contaminants and input of environment risk assessment through development of a quantitative and qualitative risk assessment model.   It was concluded that because ecotoxicity testing in this study had comprised a bacterial assay, the incorporation of higher trophic levels in the determination of more specific  ecotoxicological risk assessment would compliment the work carried out.

40|$|In Ethiopia {{industrial}} effluents containing high {{contents of}} organic matter, nitrogen and heavy metals are discharged into inland surface waters {{with little or}} no pre-treatment. Significant pollution concerns related to these effluents include dissolved oxygen depletion, toxicity and eutrophication of the receiving waters. This has not only forced the government to formulate regulations and standards for discharge limits but also resulted in an increasing interest and development of methods and systems by which wastewater can be recycled and used sustainably. The need for technologies for environmentally friendly treatment of industrial wastes such as tannery wastewaters is therefore obvious. Biological processes are not only cost effective but also environmentally sound alternatives to the chemical treatment of tannery wastewaters. The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to develop and optimize processes for biological nitrogen removal from tannery wastewaters and to identify the most efficient denitrifying organisms in tannery wastewaters laden with toxic substances. A pilot plant consisting of a predenitrification anoxic system, aerated nitrification compartment and a sedimentation tank (clarifier) all arranged in series was developed and installed on the premises of Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. In spite of high influent <b>chromium</b> and <b>sulphide</b> perturbations over the successive feeding phases, the performance of the pilot plant was encouraging. The overall removal efficiency of the pilot plant over the experimental feeding phases varied between 82 - 98 % for total nitrogen, 95 - 98 % for COD, 96 - 98 % for BOD 5, 46 - 95 % for ammonia nitrogen, 95 - 99 % for sulphide and 93 - 99 % for trivalent Chromium. Six isolates from over 1000 pure cultures were identified as the most efficient denitrifying bacteria. From both cellular fatty acid profiles and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, the six selected strains were phylogenetically identified as Brachymonas denitrificans in the β-subdivision of the Proteobacteria. All the six strains contain cd 1 -type nitrite reductase. The efficient isolates characterized in this study are of great value because of their excellent denitrifying properties and high tolerance to the concentrations of toxic compounds prevailing in tannery wastewaters. Bio-augmentation of the pilot plant with this bacterium showed a clear correlation between in situ denitrifying activities measured by nitrate uptake rate, population dynamics of the introduced B. denitrificans monitored by fluorescent in situ hybridization and the pilot plant performance, suggesting that the strategy of introducing this species for enhancing process performance has potential applications. Moreover, the nitrate-reducing, sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (NR-SOB) were also found in the pilot plant in abundance with steady sulphide removal efficiency during the study period. This could provide opportunities for the application of biologically mediated simultaneous removal of sulphide and nitrogen from tannery effluents. In addition to enriching high consortia of denitrifiers in the anoxic system to attain high denitrification efficiency and also improving the overall nitrification efficiency of the system, the predenitrification-nitrification pilot process plant stimulated the activity of indigenous NR-SOB to simultaneously remove sulphide from the system. Thus, the pilot plant was found to be operationally efficient for the removal of nitrogen, organic matter and other pollutants from tannery wastewaters.

Improved knowledge on the material {{composition of}} paint layers on heritage items will allow {{a better understanding of}} the painting technique used by the authors, will contribute to the characterization assignment and authentication of artworks, and sustainable conservation of the heritage objects. This thesis presents a research related to the characterization and physical chemical properties of organic materials used in paint layers both from natural and synthetic origin. Organic materials can be used in painted surfaces for different purposes: as adhesives, when joining together two surfaces; as binging media, if applied in order to assure cohesion in a paint layer; as consolidant if used to return the lost coherence a paint layer; as varnish or protective layer or coatings of the painted surfaces. In this thesis we focus our attention on proteinaceous materials used as binders in tempera paint layers, their interaction with coloured pigments and their ageing behavior, and on alkyd resins used in modern and contemporary art; in particular synthetic resin produced by the Winsor & Newton, Series Griffin – fast drying oil colour were considered. Two formulations of siloxanes produced by Caparol (Disboxan 450) and Phase Restauro (Hydrophase) to be used as protective coatings were studied as well. Analysis were performed by using several techniques with a particular focus on thermoanalytical ones. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermogravimetric and evolved gas analysis coupled with Fourier infrared spectroscopy (TG-EGA-FTIR), and Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on the solid samples enabled the characterization of the chemical physical behavior of the paint layer components. The first chapter of the thesis introduces the different organic materials studied, natural and synthetic, in particular proteins, proteinaceous materials and alkyd resins. The second chapter presents the technical aspects of sampling giving an overview of the methods used for binding media and resins analysis (TGA, TG-FTIR, FTIR and DSC) revealing advantages and limits for each of them. Beginning from the third chapter the thesis presents the analysis of the material studied. The pure pigments (natural or synthetic) used in proteinaceous and alkyd binders, and filler are characterized by TGA and FTIR. The fourth chapter studies the proteinaceous binder (ovalbumin, casein and rabbit glue), their interaction with five different inorganic pigments (azurite, red ochre, calcium carbonate, cinnabar and minium) and the effect of artificial UV-ageing. The fifth chapter studies the alkyd resins produced by the Winsor & Newton- series Griffin- Fast drying oil colour and their interaction with ten different pigments, organic (arylamide yellow, phthalocyanine, naphtol carbamide) and inorganic (cadmium-zinc <b>sulphide,</b> <b>chromium</b> oxide and sulphoselenide, aluminium-silicate of sodium, titanium dioxide and bone black), the effect of natural ageing of 8 months and of artificial ageing with acetic acid. The sixth chapter studies the silane/siloxane coatings, in particular alkyl silane and alkyl-alkoxy siloxane, their characterization, their ageing after two years of natural outdoor ageing and their interactions with acrylic colour. These two formulations of coatings are produced by Caparol (Disboxan 450) and Phase Restauro (Hydrophase) and the selected product will be applied on the wall painting “Tuttomondo” of Keith Haring on the Church of Sant’ Antonio in Pisa...|$|R
