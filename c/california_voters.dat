5|$|Save Our Children was {{the first}} {{organized}} opposition to the gay rights movement, whose beginnings were traced to the Stonewall riots in 1969. The defeat of the ordinance encouraged groups in other cities to attempt to overturn similar laws. In the next year voters in St. Paul, Minnesota, Wichita, Kansas, and Eugene, Oregon overturned ordinances in those cities, sharing {{many of the same}} campaign strategies that were used in Miami. Save Our Children was also involved in Seattle, Washington, where they were unsuccessful, and heavily influenced Proposition 6—a proposed state law in California that would have made the firing of openly gay public school employees mandatory—that was rejected by <b>California</b> <b>voters</b> in 1978.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong was {{co-chair}} of a California campaign committee {{to pass the}} California Cancer Research Act, a ballot measure defeated by <b>California</b> <b>voters</b> on June 5, 2012.

25|$|By law, the {{committee}} had to collect signatures from registered <b>California</b> <b>voters</b> amounting to 12% {{of the number}} of Californians who voted in the previous gubernatorial election (November 2002) for the special recall vote to take place.

25|$|A {{basic problem}} with this {{explanation}} is that the Serrano decision and school finance equalization were actually quite popular among <b>California</b> <b>voters.</b> It is true that Californians who voted for Proposition 13 were less likely than other voters to support school finance, but Proposition 13 supporters were not more likely to oppose the Serrano decision, and on average they were typically supportive of both the Serrano decision and of school finance equalization.|$|E

25|$|Proposition 1F of 2009 (or Senate Constitutional Amendment 8) was {{a measure}} {{approved}} by <b>California</b> <b>voters</b> {{relating to the}} salaries of state officers.

25|$|In mid-1976, the ALRB {{ran out of}} its budgeted {{money for}} the year, {{as a result of}} a massive amount of work in setting up farmworker elections. The California {{legislature}} refused to allocate more money, so the ALRB closed shop for the year. In response, Chavez gathered signatures in order to place Proposition 14 on the ballot, which would guarantee the right of union organizers to visit and recruit farmworkers, even if it meant trespassing on private property controlled by farm owners. The proposition went before <b>California</b> <b>voters</b> in November 1976, but was defeated by a 2–1 margin.|$|E
25|$|As governor, Wilson {{was closely}} {{associated}} with California Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative to establish a state-run citizenship screening system and prohibit illegal immigrants from using health care, public education, and other social services in the U.S. State of <b>California.</b> <b>Voters</b> passed the proposed law as a referendum in November 1994; {{it was the first}} time that a state had passed legislation related to immigration, customarily an issue for federal policies and programs. The law was challenged in a legal suit and found unconstitutional by a federal court in 1998 and never went into effect.|$|E

25|$|After Lionel Cade, an accountant, {{assumed the}} mayor's office in 1977, {{one of the}} first orders of {{business}} was to conduct an audit of the city's finances. It was discovered that the city was $2 million in debt. The administration was able to eliminate the huge deficit in one year by making cuts in every department. It also aggressively sought federal funding to help pay for essential services, which was at least partially effective. However, {{with the passage of the}} property tax cutting initiative Proposition 13 by <b>California</b> <b>voters,</b> Compton was one of the cities hardest hit, since it had already eliminated most of the fat from its budget.|$|E
25|$|California {{women had}} the right to own {{property}} in their own name since the first California Constitution in 1850. In 1911 <b>California</b> <b>voters,</b> in a special election, narrowly granted women the right to vote, nine years before the 19th Amendment enfranchised women nationally in 1920, but over 41 years later than the women of Wyoming had been granted the right to vote. Women's clubs flourished and turned a spotlight on issues such as public schools, dirt and pollution, and public health. California women were leaders in the temperance movement, moral reform, conservation, public schools, recreation, and other issues. They helped pass the 18th amendment, which established Prohibition in 1920. Initially, women did not often run for public office.|$|E
25|$|During the {{economic}} boom years of the Davis administration, the California budget expanded to cover Davis' new programs. California's low national K-12 education rankings and Davis' campaign pledge to help education, along with the large majority that elected Davis to his first term and his early popularity, suggest {{that a majority of}} Californians supported increases in education spending during the early part of his first term when California was in budget surplus. Polls also showed that increased spending in education was supported by the <b>California</b> <b>voters.</b> Under the Davis administration, taxes were cut by over $5.1 billion that included a $3.5 billion cut in sales tax and a reduction in the vehicle licensing fees. The cut in sales taxes was mandated due to a 1991 law that required sales taxes to be reduced a quarter percent when budget reserves exceed 4 percent of the state general fund for two straight fiscal years which they did in 1999 and 2000. Davis also vetoed $5.1 billion in appropriations during that span.|$|E
