5|$|During {{the debate}} in the Parliament of Norway in 1899, it was {{proposed}} that construction be delayed until the Drammen Line was upgraded to standard gauge, but this was rejected by the majority. The plans to build the line were passed on 18 May 1899 and parliament gave a grant of NOK350,800. In 1903, this was supplemented with NOK22,500. Construction started in late 1901 and was led by Engineer E. Richter. No blasting was done, but difficulties arose because of the large amounts of clay, which <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> costs to NOK800,000.|$|E

25|$|Today {{nearly half}} of the {{utilities}} are public enterprises and majority-owned by the central government. Senegal is an example where private involvement was successful: the affermage (leasing) of the network to a private operator has considerably increased efficiency and <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> access. Besides Senegal, private operators still have a role in South Africa (four utilities), Cameroon, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Mozambique, Niger and Uganda (in small towns). In Uganda and Burkina Faso public national utilities were strengthened through short-term public-private partnerships in the form of performance-based service contracts.|$|E

60|$|Pendennyss and {{his companions}} pushed their way over the ground {{occupied}} before the battle by the enemy; descended into and through that little valley, in which yet lay, in undistinguished confusion, masses {{of the dead and}} dying of either side; and again over the ridge, on which could be marked the situation of those gallant squares which had so long resisted the efforts of the horse and artillery by the groups of bodies, fallen where they had bravely stood, until even the callous Harmer sickened with the sight of a waste of life that he had but a few hours before exultingly <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase.</b>|$|E

It is true, Crowsfeather and one or two of his companions had taken a look through that medicine-glass, but it rather <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the conjuror's renown, than served to explain any of the marvels he performed.|$|E

60|$|But {{all sorts}} of events had {{occurred}} {{in the course of}} the last few days which had <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> or account for her gaiety, and a little colony of the reader's old friends and acquaintances was by this time established in Lamb Court, Temple, and round Pen's sick-bed there. First, Martha, Mrs. Pendennis's servant, had arrived from Fairoaks, being summoned thence by the Major who justly thought her presence would be comfortable and useful to her mistress and her young master, for neither of whom the constant neighbourhood of Mrs. Flanagan (who during Pen's illness required more spirituous consolation than ever to support her) could be pleasant. Martha then made her appearance in due season to wait upon Mr. Pendennis, nor did that lady go once to bed until the faithful servant had reached her, when, with a heart full of maternal thankfulness she went and lay down upon Warrington's straw mattress, and among his mathematical books as has been already described.|$|E
60|$|Richard, on the contrary, was dark, {{like his}} father and mother, with high features, beautifully formed, but exhibiting {{something}} of a foreign character; and his person was tall and slim, though muscular and active. His address and manners must have been natural to him, for they were, in elegance and ease, far beyond any example which he could have found in his native burgh. He learned {{the use of the}} small-sword while in Edinburgh, and took lessons from a performer at the theatre, with the purpose of refining his mode of speaking. He became also an amateur of the drama, regularly attending the playhouse, and assuming the tone of a critic in that and other lighter departments of literature. To fill up the contrast, so far as taste was concerned, Richard was a dexterous and successful angler--Adam, a bold and unerring shot. Their efforts to surpass each other in supplying Dr. Gray's table, rendered his housekeeping much preferable to what it had been on former occasions; and, besides, small presents of fish and game are always agreeable amongst the inhabitants of a country town, and <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the popularity of the young sportsmen.|$|E
6000|$|The station {{which the}} Lady of Lochleven now held as {{the wife of}} a man of high rank and interest, and the mother of a lawful family, did not prevent her nourishing a painful sense of degradation, even while she was proud of the talents, the power, and the station of her son, now prime ruler of the state, but still a pledge of her illicit intercourse. [...] "Had James done to her," [...] she said, in her secret heart, [...] "the justice he owed her, she had seen in her son, as a source of unmixed delight and of unchastened pride, the lawful monarch of Scotland, and one of the ablest who ever swayed the sceptre." [...] The House of Mar, not {{inferior}} in antiquity or grandeur to that of Drummond, would then have also boasted a Queen among its daughters, and escaped the stain attached to female frailty, even when it has a royal lover for its apology. While such feelings preyed on a bosom naturally proud and severe, they had a corresponding effect on her countenance, where, with the remains of great beauty, were mingled traits of inward discontent and peevish melancholy. It perhaps <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> this habitual temperament, that the Lady Lochleven had adopted uncommonly rigid and severe views of religion, imitating in her ideas of reformed faith the very worst errors of the Catholics, in limiting the benefit of the gospel to those who profess their own speculative tenets.|$|E

6000|$|The {{vigor of}} Burns's understanding, and the keenness of his wit, as {{displayed}} more particularly at masonic meetings and debating clubs, {{of which he}} formed one at Mauchline, began to spread his fame {{as a man of}} uncommon endowments. He now could number as his acquaintance several clergymen, and also some gentlemen of substance; amongst whom was Mr. Gavin Hamilton, writer in Mauchline, one of his earliest patrons. One circumstance more than any other <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> his notoriety. [...] "Polemical divinity," [...] says he to Dr. Moore in 1787, [...] "about this time was putting the country half mad; and I, ambitious of shining in conversation-parties on Sundays, at funerals, etc., used to puzzle Calvinism with so much heat and indiscretion, that I raised a hue-and-cry of heresy against me, which has not ceased to this hour." [...] The farm which he possessed belonged to the Earl of Loudon, but the brothers held it in sub-lease from Mr. Hamilton. This gentleman was at open feud with one of the ministers of Mauchline, who was a rigid Calvinist. Mr. Hamilton maintained opposite tenets; and it is not matter of surprise that the young farmer should have espoused his cause, and brought all the resources of his genius to bear upon it. The result was The Holy Fair, The Ordination, Holy Willie's Prayer, and other satires, as much distinguished for their coarse severity and bitterness, as for their genius.|$|E
60|$|The {{constantly}} recurring discharges of {{four hundred}} pieces of heavy ordnance, within a space so small, {{had the effect}} to repel the regular currents of air, and, almost immediately, to lessen a breeze of six or seven knots, to one that would not propel a ship {{more than two or}} three. This was the first observable phenomenon connected with the action, but, as it had been expected, Sir Gervaise had used the precaution to lay his ships as near as possible in the positions in which he intended them to fight the battle. The next great physical consequence, one equally expected and natural, but which wrought a great change in the aspect of the battle, was the cloud of smoke in which the ten ships were suddenly enveloped. At the first broadsides between the two admirals, volumes of light, fleecy vapour rolled over the sea, meeting midway, and rising thence in curling wreaths, left nothing but the masts and sails of the adversary visible in the hostile ship. This, of itself, would have soon hidden the combatants in the bosom of a nearly impenetrable cloud; but as the vessels drove onward they entered deeper beneath the sulphurous canopy, until it spread on each side of them, shutting out the view of ocean, skies, and horizon. The burning of the priming below <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the smoke, until, not only was respiration often difficult, but those who fought only a few yards apart frequently could not recognise each other's faces. In the midst of this scene of obscurity, and a din that might well have alarmed the caverns of the ocean, the earnest and well-drilled seamen toiled at their ponderous guns, and remedied with ready hands the injuries received in the rigging, each man as intent on his own particular duty as if he wrought in the occupations of an ordinary gale.|$|E
