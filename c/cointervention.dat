40|$|Objectives. To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} berberine {{in the treatment of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Methods. Randomized trials of berberine compared with lifestyle modification, placebo, and/or oral hypoglycaemics intervention on treating T 2 DM were included. Study population characteristics and outcome results were extracted independently by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed for data available. Results. Fourteen randomized trials, involving 1068 participants, were included in this study. Methodological quality was generally low. Compared with lifestyle modification with or without placebo, the <b>cointervention</b> of berberine and lifestyle modification showed significantly hypoglycaemic and antidyslipidemic response. Compared with oral hypoglycaemics including metformin, glipizide, or rosiglitazone, berberine did not demonstrate a significantly better glycaemic control but showed a mild antidyslipidemic effect. Compared with oral hypoglycaemic drugs, cointerventions with berberine and the same oral hypoglycaemics showed a better glycaemic control. No serious adverse effects from berberine were reported. Conclusions. Berberine appeared to be efficacious for treating hyperglycaemia and dyslipidemia in T 2 DM. However, the evidence of berberine for treating T 2 DM should be carefully interpreted due to the low methodological quality, small sample size, limited number of trials, and unidentified risks of bias...|$|E
40|$|In {{combination}} with randomization, blinding or masking {{is an important}} factor inrandomized controlled trials (RCTs), particularly in trials that assess therapeutic effects. Here an attempt is made to explain blindness and why it is important. In clinical trials,blinding is defined as the condition imposed on a study in which study participants,health care providers and assessors collecting outcome data are unaware of the assignedintervention throughout the study. A single-blind trial means that usually one ofthree above mentioned categories of individuals remains unaware of the interventionassignment throughout the trial. The optimal approach, however, is the double-blind trialin which neither the participant nor the health care providers and assessors involved inimplementation of the intervention, evaluation or measurement of outcomes are aware ofthe treatment received. Additionally, nomenclature such as triple-blind or quadruple-blindexist in the literature which offer different and confusing interpretations and definitions. Thus what is very important in reporting the clinical trial is that researchers shouldclearly state those who are blinded and unblinded in their trial rather than solely labelingtheir trial as single-blind, double blind, etc. This issue is quite useful for the reader tojudge the effects of blinding on bias reduction. Knowledge of treatment allocation canaffect patients’ responses since participants who know that they have received a newintervention may report symptoms differently from blinded participants. Another riskof unblinding in the therapeutic trial is unequal <b>cointervention</b> in which patients receivea wide range of other treatments that will, on average, favorably affect their outcomes. This phenomenon may cause confusion in determining whether any outcome differencesare due to the experimental treatment or to unequal <b>cointervention.</b> Furthermore, lack ofblinding can cause ascertainment bias. Ascertainment bias is more important in subjective outcome assessments such aspain scores. Under these circumstances, if individuals are not successfully blinded,psychological responses to intervention could affect the measure of association. The lastrisk of unblinding that should be considered in designing of trials is contamination of thecontrol group. When the clinician or the patient is pretty suspicious that the experimentaltreatment is better than standard treatment one or both of them may take some actionsleading to access of control group to the experimental treatment. This contaminationresults in a decrease in any difference in outcomes between the two groups. Otheressential topics that should be taken into account in the blinding procedure are themethods to maintain blinding of participants and health care providers, assessment ofsuccess of blinding and the difference between blinding and allocation concealment. Wewill consider these topics in future notes (1 - 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Background Electronic {{medical records}} (EMRs) have the {{potential}} to improve the provision of preventive care by allowing general practitioners (GPs) to track and recall eligible patients and record testing for feedback on their service provision. Objective This study evaluates the effect of an educational intervention and feedback tool designed to teach GPs how to use their EMRs to improve their provision of preventive care. Methods A randomised controlled trial comparing rates of mammography, Papanicolaou tests, faecal occult blood tests and albumin creatinine ratios one-year pre- and post-intervention was conducted. Nine primary care practices (PCPs) representing over 30 000 patients were paired by practice size and experience of GPs, and randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. Physicians at the four intervention practices received a two-hour feedback session on their current level of preventive care and training to generate eligible patient lists for preventive services from their EMR database. Results One-year post-intervention results provided no evidence of a difference. The intervention was not a significant predictor of the one-year post-intervention test rates for any of the four tests. On average, the intervention practices increased postintervention test rates on all tests by 16. 8 %, and control practices increased by 22. 3 %. Conclusion The non-significant results may be due to a variety of reasons, including the level of intensity of the educational intervention, the <b>cointervention</b> of a government programme which provided incentives to GPs meeting specific targets for preventive care testing or the level of recording of tests performed in the EMR...|$|E
30|$|Based on {{the data}} {{recorded}} in PROTECT and our a priori plan, potential risk factors for death included baseline variables (APACHE II score, sex, BMI, history of malignancy, type of admission and diagnosis of sepsis on admission), use of UFH and interventions within the first 24  h of ICU admission (use of inotropes or vasopressors, invasive mechanical ventilation, dialysis and pharmacologic <b>cointerventions).</b> The APACHE II score [13] has three parts: an acute physiology score (up to 60 points), an age point (0 – 6) and a chronic health score (0 – 5). The acute physiology score is composed of 12 physiologic variables: creatinine (0 – 8 points); Glasgow Coma Scale (0 – 12 points); ten other variables including temperature, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, arterial pH, serum sodium, potassium, hematocrit and {{white blood cell count}} (0 – 4 points each). The maximum total APACHE II score is 71 points, and a higher score indicates a higher predicted probability of death. The type of admission was categorized as either surgical or medical.

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} The calcimimetic cinacalcet reduced {{the risk of}} death or cardiovascular (CV) events in older, but not younger, patients with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) who were receiving hemodialysis. To determine whether the lower risk in younger patients might be due to lower baseline CV risk and more frequent use of <b>cointerventions</b> that reduce parathyroid hormone (kidney transplantation, parathyroidectomy, and commercial cinacalcet use), this study examined the effects of cinacalcet in older (≥ 65 years, n= 1005) and younger (3 -fold higher in younger relative to older patients and were more frequent in patients randomized to placebo. In older patients, the adjusted relative hazard (95 % confidence interval) for the primary composite (CV) end point (cinacalcet versus placebo) was 0. 70 (0. 60 to 0. 81); in younger patients, the relative hazard was 0. 97 (0. 86 to 1. 09). Corresponding adjusted relative hazards for mortality were 0. 68 (0. 51 to 0. 81) and 0. 99 (0. 86 to 1. 13). Reduction in the risk of severe unremitting HPT was similar in both groups. Conclusions In the EVOLVE trial, cinacalcet decreased {{the risk of death}} and of major CV events in older, but not younger, patients with moderate to severe HPT who were receiving hemodialysis. Effect modification by age may be partly explained by differences in underlying CV risk and differential application of <b>cointerventions</b> that reduce parathyroid hormone...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the best}} medical and {{endoscopic}} efforts, some patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding suffer recurrences. Because high risk stigmata (visible vessels, active bleeders and adherent clots) often persist despite apparently successful initial hemostasis {{and have a}} variable natural history, it would seem reasonable to at least consider a routine second look endoscopy. However, {{a review of the}} literature revealed six randomized trials that, in aggregate, do not support such a strategy. In fact, a second look does not appear to be effective and is associated with an increased number of procedures, treatment sessions and possibly retreatment-related complications. In addition, the <b>cointerventions</b> in these trials are already out of date and the potential absolute risk reductions are low when a second look is used with intravenous proton pump inhibitors and/or the application of endoscopic hemoclips or combination endoscopic therapy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE— We {{sought to}} meta-analyze {{the effects of}} {{different}} modes of exercise training on measures of glucose control and other risk factors for complications of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS— The 27 qualifying studies were controlled trials providing, for each measure, 4 – 18 estimates for the effect of aerobic training, 2 – 7 for resistance training, and 1 – 5 for combined training, with 1, 003 type 2 diabetic patients (age 55 7 years [mean between-study SD]) over 5 – 104 weeks. The meta-analytic mixed model included main-effect covariates to control for between-study differences in disease severity, sex, total training time, training intensity, and dietary <b>cointervention</b> (13 studies). To interpret magnitudes, effects were standardized after meta-analysis using composite baseline betweensubject SD. RESULTS— Differences among the effects of aerobic, resistance, and combined training on HbA 1 c (A 1 C) were trivial; for training lasting 12 weeks, the overall effect was a small beneficial reduction (A 1 C 0. 8 0. 3 % [mean 90 % confidence limit]). There were generally small to moderate benefits for other measures of glucose control. For other risk factors, there were either small benefits or effects were trivial or unclear, although combined training was generally superior to aerobic and resistance training. Effects of covariates were generally trivial or unclear, but there were small additional benefits of exercise on glucose control with increased disease severity. CONCLUSIONS— All forms of exercise training produce small benefits in the main measure of glucose control: A 1 C. The effects {{are similar to those}} of dietary, drug, and insulin treatments.

40|$|Systematic {{review of}} the impact of N-acetylcysteine on {{contrast}} nephropathy. BackgroundThe efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for preventing contrast nephropathy is uncertain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of NAC for preventing contrast nephropathy after administration of intravenous contrast media. MethodsData were obtained from searching MEDLINE (1969 – 2003) and EMBASE (1988 – 2003), Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial Registry (2002, Volume 3), and conference proceedings. We considered all randomized studies that compared changes in renal function between groups that received and did not receive NAC. Studies in which the control group also received active therapy were excluded, although <b>cointervention</b> directed at both groups was permitted. Two reviewers independently extracted quantitative and qualitative data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus {{with the aid of a}} third party. ResultsFifteen studies with a total of 1776 patients satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria. Contrast nephropathy was typically defined by an increase in serum creatinine of 0. 5 mg/dL within 24 to 48 hours of contrast administration. The pooled random effect relative risk was 0. 65 (0. 43 – 1. 00, P = 0. 049), indicating that NAC significantly reduced the incidence of contrast nephropathy. However, the effect of NAC was not statistically significant in several prespecified subgroup analyses, and the results were not robust to the addition of hypothetical new or unidentified randomized trials. There was evidence of significant heterogeneity in NAC effect across studies (Q = 26. 3, P = 0. 02). Random effects meta-regression did not implicate identified differences in participant or study characteristics as responsible for the observed heterogeneity. ConclusionNAC may reduce the incidence of acutely increased serum creatinine after administration of intravenous contrast, but this finding was of borderline statistical significance, and there was significant heterogeneity between trials. Before NAC becomes the standard of care for all patients receiving intravenous contrast, new randomized trials evaluating its effect on clinically relevant outcomes are required...|$|E
40|$|Iron-deficiency anaemia {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} among non-pregnant women of reproductive age (menstruating women) worldwide, although the prevalence is highest in lower-income settings. Iron-deficiency anaemia {{has been associated}} with a range of adverse health outcomes, which restitution of iron stores using iron supplementation has been considered likely to resolve. Although there have been many trials reporting effects of iron in non-pregnant women, these trials have never been synthesised in a systematic review. To establish the evidence for effects of daily supplementation with iron on anaemia and iron status, as well as on physical, psychological and neurocognitive health, in menstruating women. In November 2015 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and nine other databases, as well as four digital thesis repositories. In addition, we searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and reference lists of relevant reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing daily oral iron supplementation with or without a <b>cointervention</b> (folic acid or vitamin C), for at least five days per week at any dose, to control or placebo using either individual- or cluster-randomisation. Inclusion criteria were menstruating women (or women aged 12 to 50 years) reporting on predefined primary (anaemia, haemoglobin concentration, iron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, all-cause mortality, adverse effects, and cognitive function) or secondary (iron status measured by iron indices, physical exercise performance, psychological health, adherence, anthropometric measures, serum/plasma zinc levels, vitamin A status, and red cell folate) outcomes. We used the standard methodological procedures of Cochrane. The search strategy identified 31, 767 records; after screening, 90 full-text reports were assessed for eligibility. We included 67 trials (from 76 reports), recruiting 8506 women; the number of women included in analyses varied greatly between outcomes, with endpoint haemoglobin concentration being the outcome with the largest number of participants analysed (6861 women). Only 10 studies were considered at low overall risk of bias, with most studies presenting insufficient details about trial quality. Women receiving iron were significantly less likely to be anaemic at the end of intervention compared to women receiving control (risk ratio (RR) 0. 39 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 25 to 0. 60, 10 studies, 3273 women, moderate quality evidence). Women receiving iron had a higher haemoglobin concentration at the end of intervention compared to women receiving control (mean difference (MD) 5. 30, 95 % CI 4. 14 to 6. 45, 51 studies, 6861 women, high quality evidence). Women receiving iron had a reduced risk of iron deficiency compared to women receiving control (RR 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 50 to 0. 76, 7 studies, 1088 women, moderate quality evidence). Only one study specifically reported iron-deficiency anaemia and no studies reported mortality. Seven trials recruiting 901 women reported on 'any side effect' and did not identify an overall increased prevalence of side effects from iron supplements (RR 2. 14, 95 % CI 0. 94 to 4. 86, low quality evidence). Five studies recruiting 521 women identified an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal side effects in women taking iron (RR 1. 99, 95 % CI 1. 26 to 3. 12, low quality evidence). Eight studies recruiting 1036 women identified an increased prevalence of hard stools/constipation (RR 2. 07, 95 % CI 1. 35 to 3. 17, high quality evidence); six studies recruiting 604 women identified an increased prevalence of loose stool (RR 2. 13, 95 % CI 1. 10, 4. 11, high quality evidence). Seven studies recruiting 1190 women identified evidence of an increased prevalence of abdominal pain among women randomised to iron (RR 1. 55, 95 % CI 0. 99 to 2. 41, low quality evidence). Eight studies recruiting 1214 women did not find any evidence of an increased prevalence of nausea among women randomised to iron (RR 1. 19, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 82). Evidence that iron supplementation improves cognitive performance in women is uncertain, as studies could not be meta-analysed and individual studies reported conflicting results. Iron supplementation improved maximal and submaximal exercise performance, and appears to reduce symptomatic fatigue. Although adherence could not be formally meta-analysed due to differences in reporting, there was no evident difference in adherence between women randomised to iron and control. Daily iron supplementation effectively reduces the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency, raises haemoglobin and iron stores, improves exercise performance and reduces symptomatic fatigue. These benefits {{come at the expense of}} increased gastrointestinal symptomatic side effects...|$|E

Study Design and SettingThis systematic review summarizes and evaluates the strength of available evidence on the Hawthorne effect. An inclusive definition of any form of research artifact on behavior using this label, and without <b>cointerventions,</b> was adopted.

40|$|Population aging {{results in}} urgent needs of {{interventions}} aimed at ensuring healthy senescence. Exercise {{often results in}} healthy aging, yet many molecular mechanisms underlying such effects {{still need to be}} identified. We here investigated whether the age-dependent accumulation of oxidative and methylglyoxal- (MG-) related molecular damage could be delayed by moderate exercise in the mouse ovary, an organ that first exhibits impaired function with advancing age in mammals. CD 1 female mice underwent two- or four-month treadmill-based running through the transition from adult to middle age, when ovaries show signs of senescence, and markers of protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MG were measured. The long-term exercise reduced the protein oxidative damage in the ovaries (P< 0. 01), and this was linked to the preservation of the glutathione peroxidase protection against ROS (P< 0. 001), {{as well as to the}} increased glutathione availability (P< 0. 001). Conversely, even though the age-related deactivation of the MG-targeting systems was partially prevented by the long-term running programme (P< 0. 001), exercised mice were not protected from the age-dependent glycative burden. In summary, lately initiated regular and moderate exercise limited some changes occurring in the ovaries of middle-aged mice, and this might help to develop nonpharmacological <b>cointerventions</b> to reduce the vulnerability of mammalian ovaries towards redox dysfunctions...|$|R

Characteristics and therapeutic success at discharge were compared in patients responding and those not responding. Results: Patients not responding to the follow-up questionnaires tended to be older and to assess the benefit of the treatment less positive than patients who responded (hospital one: 56. 2 % of patients with a follow-up reported a good or very good response to therapy at discharge compared to 37. 7 % of the patients without a follow-up: hospital two: 63. 7 % vs. 54. 6 %; hospital three: 71. 1 % vs. 65. 8 %; hospital four: 78, 3 % vs. 70, 9 %).

40|$|Background: The {{endogenous}} inhibitor of {{nitric oxide}} (NO) synthase, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), {{is a strong}} cardiovascular (CV) risk marker in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Statins have pleiotropic effects and are currently considered as potential ADMA-lowering agents. Methods: We investigated the effect of simvastatin on plasma ADMA levels in 35 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) by performing a secondary analysis of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial where patients were randomized to receive simvastatin or placebo for 6 months. Results: Plasma ADMA was higher in CKD patients (0. 84 +/- 0. 14 mu mol/L) than in healthy subjects (0. 69 +/- 0. 10 mu mol/L) (p< 0. 001). In CKD patients, ADMA at baseline was related directly with triglycerides (r= 0. 42, p= 0. 01) and inversely with HDL cholesterol (r=- 0. 37, p= 0. 03) and creatinine clearance (p= 0. 03). As expected, simvastatin caused significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, {{as well as in}} C-reactive protein (CRP; - 28 %, p= 0. 001) and IL- 6 (- 20 %, p= 0. 05) but failed to decrease plasma ADMA both in crude and adjusted analyses.

Methods We searched 11 databases up to Jan 14, 2016, websites and trial registers, contacted authors, and reviewed reference lists. We included studies published in any language of children aged 6 months to 16 years, with mass deworming for soil-transmitted helminths or schistosomiasis (alone or in combination with other interventions) for 4 months or longer, that reported the primary outcomes of interest.

Design: A prospective observational analysis of 5 patients who had undergone successful unilateral radiofrequency neurotomy (RFN) of the lumbar medial branch divisions of the lumbar dorsal rami. At 17 to 26 months after RFN, 3 blinded radiologists evaluated the relative composition {{and size of the}} multifidus muscle at different segmental levels on lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They were asked to {{determine the}} lesioned levels by evidence of multifidus atrophy. The accuracy of predicting the correct side and level lesioned was evaluated. Setting: Private spine practice in Tyler, Texas. Patients: Five patients who had unilateral lumbar medial branch RFN for proven lumbar zygapophysial joint-mediated pain were selected. Interventions: MRI of the lumbar spine at a mean of 21 months (range, 17 - 26) after successful lumbar RFN. Outcome Measures: Multifidus atrophy on a lumbar MRI, pain assessment and use of <b>cointerventions.</b> Results: Diffuse lumbar multifidus atrophy was detectable with MRI.

After thorough medical chart reviews of 109 patients with ISSNHL between May 2006 and December 2013, we performed a propensity score-matched analysis using previously known prognostic factors, steroid regimens, and other <b>cointerventions.</b> Patients were divided based on their steroid regimens into group I (which initially received 48 mg of methylprednisolone daily with a subsequently tapered dose) and group II (which initially received 24 mg of methylprednisolone daily with a subsequently tapered dose). We compared final hearing and the occurrence of adverse events between the two groups. As a result, 20 pairs of propensity score-matched patients (n = 40) were enrolled. Group I patients showed better final hearing levels compared with group II patients (42. 00 ± 22. 35 dB and 57. 38 ± 26. 40 dB, respectively), although this difference was marginally significant (p = 0. 058).

40|$|Introduction: Self-monitoring {{of blood}} {{pressure}} is effective in reducing blood pressure in hypertension. However previous meta-analyses have shown {{a considerable amount of}} heterogeneity between studies, only part of which can be accounted for by meta-regression. This may be due to differences in design, recruited populations, intervention components or results among patient subgroups. To further investigate these differences, an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of self-monitoring of blood pressure will be performed. Methods and analysis: We will identify randomised trials that have compared patients with hypertension who are self-monitoring blood pressure with those who are not and invite trialists to provide IPD including clinic and/ or ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline and all follow-up points where both intervention and control groups were measured. Other data requested will include measurement methodology, length of followup, <b>cointerventions,</b> baseline demographic (age, gender) and psychosocial factors (deprivation, quality of life), setting, intensity of self-monitoring, self-monitored blood pressure, comorbidities, lifestyle factors (weight, smoking) and presence or not of antihypertensive treatment. Data on all available patients will be included in order to take an intention-to-treat approach. A two stage procedure for IPD meta-analysis, stratified by trial and taking into account age, sex, diabetes and baseline systolic BP will be used. Exploratory subgroup analyses will further investigate non-linear relationships between the prespecified variables. Sensitivity analyses will assess the impact of trials which have and have not provided IPD. Ethics and dissemination: This study does not include identifiable data. Results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed publication and by international conference presentations. Conclusions: IPD analysis should help the understanding of which self-monitoring interventions for which patient groups are most effective in the control of blood pressure...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Blood transfusions are {{associated}} with morbidity and mortality. However, restrictive thresholds could harm patients less able to tolerate anemia. Using a context-specific approach (according to patient characteristics and clinical settings), the authors conducted a systematic review to quantify the effects of transfusion strategies. METHODS The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and grey literature sources to November 2015 for randomized controlled trials comparing restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies applied more than 24 [*]h in adult surgical or critically ill patients. Data were independently extracted. Risk ratios were calculated for 30 -day complications, defined as inadequate oxygen supply (myocardial, cerebral, renal, mesenteric, and peripheral ischemic injury; arrhythmia; and unstable angina), mortality, composite of both, and infections. Statistical combination followed a context-specific approach. Additional analyses explored transfusion protocol heterogeneity and <b>cointerventions</b> effects. RESULTS Thirty-one trials were regrouped into five context-specific risk strata. In patients undergoing cardiac/vascular procedures, restrictive strategies seemed to {{increase the risk of}} events reflecting inadequate oxygen supply (risk ratio [RR], 1. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 97 to 1. 22), mortality (RR, 1. 39; 95 % CI, 0. 95 to 2. 04), and composite events (RR, 1. 12; 95 % CI, 1. 01 to 1. 24 - 3322, 3245, and 3322 patients, respectively). Similar results were found in elderly orthopedic patients (inadequate oxygen supply: RR, 1. 41; 95 % CI, 1. 03 to 1. 92; mortality: RR, 1. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 80 to 1. 49; composite outcome: RR, 1. 24; 95 % CI, 1. 00 to 1. 54 - 3465, 3546, and 3749 patients, respectively), but not in critically ill patients. No difference was found for infections, although a protective effect may exist. Risk estimates varied with successful/unsuccessful transfusion protocol implementation.

We tested {{the hypothesis that}} cinacalcet would reduce the rate of clinical fractures in patients receiving hemodialysis {{using data from the}} Evaluation of Cinacalcet HCl Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events trial, a placebo-controlled trial that randomized 3883 hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism to receive cinacalcet or placebo for ≤ 64 months. This study was a prespecified secondary analysis of the trial whose primary end point was all-cause mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and one of the secondary end points was first clinical fracture event. Clinical fractures were observed in 255 of 1935 (13. 2 %) patients randomized to placebo and 238 of 1948 (12. 2 %) patients randomized to cinacalcet. In an unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis, the relative hazard for fracture (cinacalcet versus placebo) was 0. 89 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 0. 75 to 1. 07). After adjustment for baseline characteristics and multiple fractures, the relative hazard was 0. 83 (95 % CI, 0. 72 to 0. 98). Using a prespecified lag-censoring analysis (a measure of actual drug exposure), the relative hazard for fracture was 0. 72 (95 % CI, 0. 58 to 0. 90). When participants were censored at the time of <b>cointerventions</b> (parathyroidectomy, transplant, or provision of commercial cinacalcet), the relative hazard was 0. 71 (95 % CI, 0. 58 to 0. 87). Fracture rates were higher in older compared with younger patients and the effect of cinacalcet appeared more pronounced in older patients. In conclusion, using an unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis, cinacalcet did not reduce the rate of clinical fracture. However, when accounting for differences in baseline characteristics, multiple fractures, and/or events prompting discontinuation of study drug, cinacalcet reduced the rate of clinical fracture by 16 %- 29 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{a common}} complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and the benefit of pharmacologic treatment of the condition is unclear. Although prophylactic use of gabexate mesylate (GM) for the reduction of pancreatic injury after ERCP has been evaluated, uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness of GM treatment in post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine through systematic review and meta-analysis the effectiveness and tolerability of GM in the prophylaxis of PEP. Methods: MEDLINE (January 1966 –July 2007), EMBASE (January 1966 – July 2007), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register on The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2007), and the China Biological Medicine Database (January 1978 –July 2007) were searched. We used the method recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GM in the prevention of PEP. Results: Of the 38 studies identified, 31 were excluded for the following reasons: they were reviews or editorials (9 articles); were meta-analyses (4); had differences in <b>cointerventions</b> (4); were nonrandomized controlled trials or had incorrect randomization (4); were repeat publications (2); lacked a placebo group (1); or other (7). Seven RCTs, totaling 2883 patients, conducted in a variety of languages were included in the meta-analysis. When the RCTs were analyzed, odds ratios for GM were 0. 65 (95 % CI, 0. 36 – 1. 18; P 0. 16) for PER 1. 90 (95 % CI, 0. 54 – 6. 65; P 0. 32) for severe PEP, 0. 55 (95 % CI, 0. 17 – 1. 77; P 0. 32) for the case-fatality ratio of PEP, 0. 88 (95 % CI, 0. 74 – 1. 05; P 0. 16) for post-ERCP hyperamylasemia, and 0. 78 (95 % CI, 0. 49 1. 25; P 0. 30) for post-ERCP abdominal pain. No evidence of publication bias was found. Conclusions: No beneficial effects of GM on acute pancreatitis, the PEP mortality rate, or post-ERCP abdominal pain or hyperamylasemia were found; therefore, GM cannot be recommended for the prophylaxis of PEP...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Among {{women with}} unexplained infertility, 28 % to 55 % of {{patients}} with galactorrhea are normoprolactinemic. Bromocriptine, a common treatment for infertile women with hyperprolactinemia, {{has been used in}} the treatment of unexplained subfertility in women with galactorrhea and normal prolactin; however, its effectiveness and safety profile have never been determined. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relative effectiveness and safety profile of bromocriptine monotherapy or as an adjunct to clomiphene citrate in women with galactorrhea and normal prolactin levels. Methods: We conducted a search of the Cochrane Subfertility Review Group specialized register of controlled trials (March 2010), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2010), MEDLINE (1950 –March 2010), EMBASE (1980 –March 2010), and the China Biological Medicine Database (inception to March 2010) for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the following terms: controlled, randomized, blinded, clinical trials, humans, galactorrhea, prolactin, bromocriptine, infertility, and subfertility. Additionally, reference lists of identified articles were searched for relevant articles. Results: Of the 8 studies identified, 5 were excluded after full-text review for the following reasons: lack of a placebo group (2); difference in <b>cointerventions</b> (1); difference in end points (1); and systematic review (1). Therefore, 3 RCTs were included in this review. Bromocriptine administered in combination with clomiphene was found to be associated with a higher accumulative pregnancy rate compared with clomiphene monotherapy (fixed odds ratio [OR], 5. 33; 95 % CI, 2. 62 – 10. 88), and a lower miscarriage rate (fixed OR, 0. 20; 95 % CI, 0. 05 – 0. 76). Only 1 trial reported live birth as an outcome, and multiple pregnancy rates were poorly reported. Patient-reported adverse effects were mentioned in the studies, but reports were often incomplete. Conclusions: This review suggests the effectiveness of bromocriptine with clomiphene for infertility in women with galactorrhea and normal prolactin levels. Further RCTs of adequate power and of high methodologic quality are required to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to {{determine}} if postoperative sequelae (facial swelling, trismus, pain) and neurological complications are reduced when mandibular third molars are surgically extracted using a piezoelectric device for osteotomy compared with conventional rotary burs, and to determine if there is a difference in operating time between the two techniques. Clinical trials were identified through a search (April 2015) on the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Google Scholar databases. Studies were assessed by study type, characteristics of participants, sample size, surgical technique, <b>cointerventions,</b> outcomes, risk of bias, and findings. We calculated a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) rating of confidence in the effect estimates. We identified 2515 citations and found 15 eligible clinical trials. Patients who had osteotomies with the piezoelectric device had less facial swelling (standard mean difference - 1. 15; 95 % CI - 2. 02 to - 0. 27; p < 0. 0001), trismus (greater maximum mouth opening, standard mean difference 0. 78; 95 % CI 0. 56 to 1. 00; p = 0. 33) and pain (standard mean difference - 0. 84; 95 % CI - 1. 55 to - 0. 13; p < 0. 0001) at day 1, less facial swelling at day 7 (standard mean difference - 0. 98; 95 % CI - 1. 52 to - 0. 44; p = 0. 05), and a reduced risk of neurological complications (odds ratio (OR) 0. 28; 95 % CI 0. 09 to 0. 89; p = 0. 79). Trismus at day 7 and pain at day 5 did not differ significantly between the two methods. Operating time was longer with the piezoelectric device (standard mean difference 0. 83; 95 % CI 0. 57 to 1. 09; p = 0. 001). The confidence in the effect estimates was low or very low across all outcomes. The findings raise the possibility of an improved clinical healing response to osteotomy with the piezoelectric device compared with one done with conventional rotary burs for surgical extractions of mandibular third molars...|$|R
