40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} a possible solution to promote and support the integration of unmanned aircraft in <b>civil</b> non-segregated <b>airspaces.</b> The capability to "detect and avoid" mid-air collision hazards {{is one of the}} main technical challenges restricting widespread operations of unmanned aircraft in non-segregated airspaces. In fact, to operate in prescribed environments, an unmanned aircraft needs an onboard technology to replace the capability of the human pilot to "see and avoid" potential collisions with an equivalent level of safety. Such a technology is a so-called "detect and avoid" system. Within the problem of developing such a "detect and avoid" system, this thesis focuses on the corresponding "avoid function" and proposes a possible solution. The approach to obtain the solution is to schematize a generic obstacle or a moving intruder through a quite generic moving ellipsoid that represents the region of space the unmanned aircraft must not violate. The outcome is a novel and deterministic solution that enables situations of potential conflict to be detected through a single metric, both simple and flexible, and to be avoided through a set of possible actions, such as speed changes in magnitude and/or direction. A simulation campaign is also conducted to validate the proposed solution. The result is that the corresponding algorithms are able to implement a process of conflict detection and resolution, in a three-dimensional space and in real-time, even without the assistance of the human operator. Moreover, simulations with the human operator in the loop demonstrate that the developed solution is able to work as an advisory system that provides also resolution indications for the remote human pilot, as well as an autonomous "detect and avoid" system that detects the potential conflict and implements actions to avoid it. As such, the proposed solution can be considered as a fundamental step for the development of a prototype of "detect and avoid" system for promoting the integration of unmanned aircraft in non-segregated <b>civil</b> <b>airspaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} three {{different}} sets of ideas from computer science to develop a self-learning system capable of delivering an obstacle avoidance decision tree for simple mobile robots. All three topic areas have received considerable attention in the literature but their combination in the fashion reported here is new. This work {{is part of a}} wider initiative on problems where human reasoning is currently the most commonly used form of control. Typical examples are in sense and avoid studies for vehicles – for example the current lack of regulator approved sense and avoid systems is a key road-block to the wider deployment of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs) in <b>civil</b> <b>airspaces.</b> The paper shows that by using well established ideas from logic circuit design (the “espresso” algorithm) to influence genetic programming (GP), it is possible to evolve well-structured case-based reasoning (CBR) decision trees {{that can be used to}} control a mobile robot. The enhanced search works faster than a standard GP search while also providing improvements in best and average results. The resulting programs are non-intuitive yet solve difficult obstacle avoidance and exploration tasks using a parsimonious and unambiguous set of rules. They are based on studying sensor inputs to decide on simple robot movement control over a set of random maze navigation problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{sense and}} avoid {{capability}} {{is one of}} the greatest challenges that has to be addressed to safely integrate unmanned aircraft systems into <b>civil</b> and nonsegregated <b>airspace.</b> This paper gives a review of existing regulations, recommended practices, and standards in sense and avoid for unmanned aircraft systems. Gaps and issues are identified, as are the different factors that are likely to affect actual sense and avoid requirements. It is found that the operational environment (flight altitude, meteorological conditions, and class of airspace) plays an important role when determining the type of flying hazards that the unmanned aircraft system might encounter. In addition, the automation level and the data-link architecture of the unmanned aircraft system are key factors that will definitely determine the sense and avoid system requirements. Tactical unmanned aircraft, performing similar missions to general aviation, are found to be the most challenging systems from an sense and avoid point of view, and further research and development efforts are still needed before their seamless integration into nonsegregated airspac...|$|R
40|$|During AprileMay 2010 {{volcanic}} ash clouds from the Icelandic Eyjafjallajökull volcano reached Europe causing an unprecedented disruption of the EUR/NAT region <b>airspace.</b> <b>Civil</b> aviation authorities banned all flight operations because of {{the threat posed by}} {{volcanic ash}} to modern turbine aircraft. New quantitative airborne ash mass concentration thresholds, still under discussion, were adopted for discerning regions contaminated by ash. This has implications for ash dispersal models routinely used to forecast the evolution of ash clouds. In this new context, quantitative model validation and assessment of the accuracies of current state-of-the-art models is of paramount importance. The passage of {{volcanic ash clouds}} over central Europe, a territory hosting a dense network of meteorological and air quality observatories, generated a quantity of observations unusual for volcanic clouds. From the ground, the cloud was observed by aerosol lidars, lidar ceilometers, sun photometers, other remote-sensing instruments and in-situ collectors. From the air, sondes and multiple aircraft measurements also took extremely valuable in-situ and remote-sensing measurements. These measurements constitute an excellent database for model validation. Here we validate the FALL 3 D ash dispersal model by comparing model results with ground and airplane-based measurements obtained during the initial 14 e 23 April 2010 Eyjafjallajökull explosive phase. We run the model at high spatial resolution using as input hourlyaveraged observed heights of the eruption column and the total grain size distribution reconstructed from field observations. Model results are then compared against remote ground-based and in-situ aircraft-based measurements, including lidar ceilometers from the German Meteorological Service, aerosol lidars and sun photometers from EARLINET and AERONET networks, and flight missions of the German DLR Falcon aircraft. We find good quantitative agreement, with an error similar to the spread in the observations (however depending on the method used to estimate mass eruption rate) for both airborne and ground mass concentration. Such verification results help us understand and constrain the accuracy and reliability of ash transport models and it is of enormous relevance for designing future operational mitigation strategies at Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers...|$|R

50|$|Both the {{civilian}} SSR {{and the military}} IFF have become much more complex than their war-time ancestors, but remain compatible with each other, not least to allow military aircraft to operate in <b>civil</b> <b>airspace.</b> Today's SSR can provide much more detailed information, for example, the aircraft altitude, as well as enabling the direct exchange of data between aircraft for collision avoidance. Most SSR systems rely on Mode C transponders, which report the aircraft pressure altitude. The pressure altitude is independent from the pilot's altimeter setting, thus preventing false altitude transmissions if altimeter is adjusted incorrectly. Air traffic control systems recalculate reported pressure altitudes to true altitudes {{based on their own}} pressure references, if necessary.|$|E

50|$|In January 2015, the German Luftwaffe and Bundeswehr began {{considering}} the Triton {{to fill their}} signals intelligence (SIGINT) needs as {{a continuation of the}} cancelled Global Hawk-based EuroHawk program. After the retirement of the German Navy's five Br.1150 Atlantique aircraft in 2010, the EuroHawk was intended to fill the SIGINT gap, but was cancelled in May 2013 after spending €600 million ($750 million) from concerns of its ability to satisfy airworthiness regulations to permit flight over <b>civil</b> <b>airspace</b> in Europe. With about half of the investment on the electronic intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT) sensors, Germany is trying to get some form of the program into service. Using the Triton would ease integration by keeping the sensors in the same place, gondolas hung under the wings, which limited attempts to put them on other airframes due to reception problems with nearby engine placement. With icing and lightning-strike protection already included, the MQ-4C would {{have a better chance of}} achieving safety certification to fly over inhabited areas of Europe that previously ended the EuroHawk. The German Defence Ministry confirmed in March 2017 that it had decided to buy the MQ-4C to replace the EuroHawk program, with deliveries occurring after 2025.|$|E
