How is male {{sexuality}} defined in our culture? How has that definition changed and not <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> time? To answer these questions, the author examines several films with rape scenes, including Frenzy, The Accused, A Clockwork Orange, and Straw Dogs. Methodology includes the study of Susan Brownmiller’s book, Against Our Will, and Timothy Beneke’s book, Men on Rape...|$|R

The equation defining price elasticity for one product can be rewritten (omitting secondary variables) as a linear equation.|$|E

5|$|Another {{study by}} He et al. used a simple {{epidemic}} model, to incorporate three factors including school opening and closing, temperature <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> {{the course of}} the outbreak, and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Their modelling results showed that all three factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition Association {{following}} a decade of financial difficulty for the fair. He made a variety of operational and programming <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> the years. Notably, he repositioned the fair's focuses as technology supplanted earlier attractions. He became a Canadian citizen in 2000, at a ceremony in the Automotive Building, during the company's fair.|$|E
5|$|Cancer <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> time, {{and pain}} {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress is a key element in effective pain management.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cast and}} production <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> the years, Last of the Summer Wine {{continued to be}} popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary. Rumours circulated {{as early as the}} 1980s that the BBC wanted to end the show {{and replace it with a}} new programme aimed at a younger audience. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode.|$|E
5|$|French {{civilian}} administrators {{struggled with}} the military leaders, and the two forces went {{through a number of}} leadership <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> the territory, until Louis Archinard was appointed military governor in 1892. Archinard led military campaigns against Samori Ture, Ahmadu Tall, and other resistant leaders in the region, with varying success. Archinard's campaigns were often executed through direct military control, without civilian oversight. As costs increased, the French administration decided to replace Archinard's control over the area with a civilian governor, Louis Albert Grodet.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he {{was not prepared to}} implement <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> the objections of his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to such examples, creationists specify that they are objecting only to macroevolution, not microevolution: most creationist organizations do not dispute the occurrence of short-term, relatively minor evolutionary changes, such as that observed even in dog breeding. Rather, they dispute the occurrence of major evolutionary <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> long periods of time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.|$|E
5|$|Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) {{was also}} from Angus and his Principles of Geology built on Hutton's ideas. Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism and his {{interpretation}} of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> enormously long spans of time was a central theme in the Principles, and a powerful influence on the young Charles Darwin. (Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS Beagle, loaned Darwin a copy of Volume 1 of the first edition just before they {{set out on the}} 'Voyage of the Beagle'.) Lyell is buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The BDI was {{originally}} developed {{to provide a}} quantitative assessment of the intensity of depression. Because {{it is designed to}} reflect the depth of depression, it can monitor <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> time and provide an objective measure for judging improvement and the effectiveness or otherwise of treatment methods. The instrument remains widely used in research; in 1998, it had been used in over 2000 empirical studies. It has been translated into multiple European languages as well as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Xhosa.|$|E

5|$|The Moon {{may have}} {{dramatically}} affected {{the development of}} life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> millions of years, as {{appears to be the}} case for Mars.|$|E
5|$|The Smashing Pumpkins are an American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1988.

It has undergone many line-up <b>changes</b> <b>over</b> the course of its existence, with the current lineup being Corgan and rhythm guitarist Jeff Schroeder.|$|E
5|$|The {{geomagnetic}} field changes on time scales from milliseconds {{to millions of}} years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes {{can be traced to}} geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. <b>Changes</b> <b>over</b> time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.|$|E
