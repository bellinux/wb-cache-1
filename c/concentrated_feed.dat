40|$|Short-chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFAs) and lactate are endproducts of rumen {{fermentation}} and important energy {{sources for the}} host ruminant. Because their rapid accumulation results in ruminal acidosis, enhancement of the absorption of SCFA and lactate across reticuloruminal wall is instrumental in increasing energy supply and preventing ruminal acidosis in cattle. This study investigated whether the reticuloruminal absorption of SCFAs and lactate was altered by different strategies of high <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding.</b> Eight rumen-cannulated, non-lactating Holstein cows were fed a forage-only diet (baseline) and then gradually adapted over 6 d to a 60 % concentrate level. Thereafter, this concentrate-rich diet was fed for 4 wk either continuously (Con; n = 8) or interruptedly (Int; n = 8). Absorption of SCFAs and lactate was determined in vivo from the experimental buffer introduced into the washed reticulorumen. The buffer contained acetate, propionate, butyrate and lactate at a concentration of 60, 30, 10 and 5 mmol/L, respectively and Cr-EDTA as a marker for correcting ruminal water fluxes. The reticuloruminal absorption after 35 and 65 min of buffer incubation was measured at the baseline, after 1 wk of 60 % <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding</b> in the interrupted model (Int- 1) and after 4 wk of <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding</b> in both feeding models (Int- 4 and Con- 4). Data showed that the absorption rates of individual and total SCFAs during the first 35 min of incubation of Con- 4 were highest (~ 1. 7 times compared to baseline), while Int- 1 and Int- 4 were similar to respective baseline. Lactate was not absorbed during forage-only baseline and 1 -wk <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding,</b> but after 4 -wk <b>feeding</b> of <b>concentrates</b> in both models. In conclusion, SCFAs absorption across the reticulorumen of non-lactating cattle was enhanced by the 4 -wk continuous <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding,</b> {{which seems to be}} more advantageous in terms of rumen acidosis prevention compared to the interrupted feeding model. The study provides evidence of lactate absorption across the reticulorumen of non-lactating cattle after both continuous and interrupted 4 -wk <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding...</b>|$|R
500|$|Horses are grazing animals, {{and their}} {{major source of}} {{nutrients}} is good-quality forage from hay or pasture. They can consume approximately 2% to 2.5% of their body weight in dry feed each day. Therefore, a [...] adult horse could eat up to [...] of food. Sometimes, <b>concentrated</b> <b>feed</b> such as grain is fed in addition to pasture or hay, especially when the animal is very active.

500|$|In general, {{the portion}} of the ration that should be grain or other <b>concentrated</b> <b>feed</b> is 0-10% grain for mature idle horses; between 20-70% for horses at work, {{depending}} on age, intensity of activity, and energy requirements. Concentrates should not be fed to horses within one hour before or after a heavy workout. Concentrates also need to be adjusted to level of performance. Not only can excess grain and inadequate exercise lead to behavior problems, it may also trigger serious health problems that include Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis, or [...] "tying up," [...] in horses prone to the condition. Another possible risk are various forms of horse colic. A relatively uncommon, but usually fatal concern is colitis-X, which may be triggered by excess protein and lack of forage in the diet that allows for the multiplication of clostridial organisms, and is exacerbated by stress.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is caused}} by an {{impaction}} of food material (water, grass, hay, grain) at {{a part of the}} large bowel known as the pelvic [...] of the left colon where the intestine takes a 180 degree turn and narrows. Impaction generally responds well to medical treatment, usually requiring a few days of fluids and laxatives such as mineral oil, but more severe cases may not recover without surgery. If left untreated, severe impaction colic can be fatal. The most common cause is when the horse is on box rest and/or consumes large volumes of <b>concentrated</b> <b>feed,</b> or the horse has dental disease and is unable to masticate properly. This condition could be diagnosed on rectal examination by a veterinarian. Impactions are often associated with the winter months because horses do not drink as much water and eat drier material (hay instead of grass), producing drier intestinal contents that are more likely to get stuck.|$|E

50|$|Horses are grazing animals, {{and their}} {{major source of}} {{nutrients}} is good-quality forage from hay or pasture.

40|$|It {{was adopted}} {{in this work}} a {{methodology}} to estimate the optimal level of concentrate food for dairy cows on tropical pastures based on the theory of marginal analysis. An empiric model was developed and validated for application of the methodology using a database composed of 62 means of treatments from 32 studies in which milk production was evaluated regarded to the levels of <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeding.</b> Milk production (MP) showed quadratic behavior in response to concentrate intake (CI) : MP (kg/cow/day) = 10. 554 + 1. 5855 CI - 0. 0552 CI². Evaluation of the MP values observed over the predicted ones pointed the non-rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating that the model can be applied on the prediction of milk production, and consequently, on the optimal level of supplementation. However, evaluation of the partition of mean square error of prediction indicated the need for adjustments. The marginal production response (MPR) presented decreasing linear effect at CI level: MPR (kg milk/kg concentrate added) = 1. 5855 - 0. 1104 CI. The intake of concentrate that maximizes profit per animal (CIoptimum) is estimated by the following equation: CIoptimum (kg/cow/day, as fed basis) = (1. 5855 - (Px/Py)) / 0. 1104; in which Px and Py are, respectively, the prices of <b>concentrate</b> <b>feeds</b> ($/kg, as fed basis) and of the milk at farmgate ($/kg).
