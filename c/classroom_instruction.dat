At the time the destroyer was deployed on active service in the Pacific Ocean. Shepard joined it when it returned to the naval base at Ulithi on October 30. After just two days at sea Cogswell helped rescue 172 sailors from the cruiser , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, then escorted the crippled ship back to Ulithi. The ship was buffeted by Typhoon Cobra in December 1944, a storm in which three other destroyers went down, and battled kamikazes in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in January 1945.|$|E

40|$|The diploma thesis <b>Classroom</b> <b>Instructions</b> in Teaching English aims at {{presenting}} {{basic principles}} of giving instructions during English lessons and their practical use. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. The latter is further separated into a list of textbook instructions {{and a list of}} instructions used in classes. The theoretical part describes an important relation of <b>instructions</b> and the <b>classroom</b> situation as well as the dependence on the immediate response from the students. The ensuing part deals with applying the theoretical principles in practice. The author gathered instructions used in the third edition of New Headway series textbooks and instructions used by teachers in English lessons at various types of schools (the age of the observed students ranged from 7 to 18 years old) not only to illustrate usage of the theoretical principles in practice but also to show the differences between textbook and <b>classroom</b> <b>instructions</b> and to present a sample of instructions that are used at several schools in the Czech Republic.

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{innovative}} areas of YCT’s curriculum is an unprecedented emphasis on pastoral care and professional development. Whereas it is common in other rabbinical schools to offer a semester or a year of pastoral counseling courses, YCT’s program spans the entire four year curriculum. The pastoral counseling program is taught by leading psychiatric professionals, and includes formal <b>classroom</b> <b>instruction,</b> role-playing, clinical experience and mentored field work. The program places particular emphasis on topics that rabbis regularly encounter: religious doubt and personal change; rites of passage; adolescence; substance abuse; marital and family problems; sexual function and dysfunction; homosexuality; domestic violence; loss, tragedy and bereavement; and response to catastrophe.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for Provincial Achievement Tests (PATs) {{at the end}} of the year, grade nine students operate on a similar system to that of the local middle schools. All courses run from September until June with the exception of option courses which are semestered. This is contrary to grades ten through twelve, where nearly all classes are semester long and students receive 5 credits per course. 100 credits are needed to graduate, per Alberta Learning requirements. Each credit signifies approximately 125 hours of <b>classroom</b> <b>instruction.</b> Of their final sixteen high school modules (4 in grade eleven and 4 in grade twelve), students are permitted to take three spare modules with a general restriction of one per year in grade eleven and one per semester in grade twelve.|$|E
25|$|ADTs provide <b>classroom</b> <b>instruction</b> and teachings to Afghans {{about how}} to improve their farming {{practices}} during non-seasonal growing months, which allows the farmers to use skills in the winter to prepare for farming {{in the summer and}} fall. This enhances agricultural production and the Afghan economy as a whole. Agricultural education also improves lines of communication and builds trust between the people, the US government, and the Host Nation. Additionally, through word of mouth in the provinces ideas are spread that inform others about these farming techniques, that may not have had direct interaction with the ADTs. The National Guard ADTs also introduce their US civilian colleagues to the Afghan University personnel, which further strengthens relations and trust in the US efforts in Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|Instructional design, the {{systematic}} design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a taxonomy of educational objectives created by Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched mastery learning, an instructional strategy in which learners only advance {{to a new}} learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered {{that a combination of}} mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in <b>classroom</b> <b>instruction.</b> Gagné, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of task analysis in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives connected by prerequisite relationships.|$|E

25|$|Baylor University, {{like most}} schools, was {{successful}} in the multiple missions of aiding national defense, recruiting soldiers, and keeping the institution operational while the war continued. Texas Tech University likewise had many roles in the war; the most famous was the War Training Service Pre-Flight program during 1943–44. It prepared Air Force pilots for full-fledged military aviation training. The efforts of Clent Breedove and M. F. Dagley, private contractors for the Civilian Pilot Training Program at the university site since 1939, with Harold Humphries as chief pilot, brought an economic boost to Lubbock. 3,750 cadets received <b>classroom</b> <b>instruction</b> and flying time.

50|$|In his journals, Kierkegaard {{notes that}} Møller {{provided}} him advice {{about the study}} of philosophy and communication.

In addition to <b>classroom</b> <b>instructions,</b> they also frequented Møller's favorite tea house. Kierkegaard adopted Møller's preferred method of writing, recording his thoughts in a short mixture of poetry and prose, into his own journals. Kierkegaard records that shortly before his death, Møller cautioned him regarding the polemical tone that he had adopted. Kierkegaard, however, viewed his tone as consistent with the New Testament writers.|$|R
