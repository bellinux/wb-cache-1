5000|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, United Video began {{encouraging}} cable systems still using either the full- or split-screen {{versions of the}} Amiga 1000-based EPG Sr. to upgrade to the Amiga 2000-based Prevue Guide. Active support for the Amiga 1000-based EPG Sr. installations was discontinued in 1993. Like the Amiga 1000-based EPG Sr., Prevue Guide also ran from bootable 3½ diskettes, and its locally customizable features remained configurable only from the local keyboard, subjecting viewers to the same on-screen maintenance-related interruptions by local cable company employees as before (silent remote administration of locally customizable features would not be added until the [...] "yellow grid" [...] appeared shortly after {{the beginning of the}} TV Guide Channel era, when the Amiga platform was fully abandoned). To support Prevue Guide's new, satellite-delivered video and audio, each Amiga 2000 featured a UV Corp. UVGEN video/genlock card for the satellite feed's video and a Zephyrus Electronics Ltd model 100 rev. C demodulator/switching ISA card for manipulating the feed's audio. Also included were a Zephyrus Electronics Ltd. model 101 rev. C demodulator ISA card for the WGN data stream, and a Great Valley Products Zorro II A2000 HC+8 Series II card (used only for 2 MB of Fast RAM with SCSI disabled). The 101C fed demodulated listings data at 2400 baud from a DE9 RS232 serial connector on its backpanel to the Amiga's stock DB25 RS232 serial port via a short cable. The 101C also featured <b>connection</b> <b>terminals</b> for contact closure triggering of external cable system video playback equipment.|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{hand-operated}} and hydraulic compressors use crimping of <b>connection</b> <b>terminals.</b> However, {{this equipment}} often causes compressed defects because non-uniform pressure is {{applied in the}} circumferential direction of the terminal during crimping. A defective terminal often leads to fire in electric equipment due to overheating. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop a new crimping process for manufacturing highly durable terminals. MPC (magnetic pulse crimping) uses uniform electromagnetic pressure by a high magnetic field interaction between coil and terminal. This process uses only electromagnetic pressure for crimping, so the terminal can be crimped without physical contact, thereby producing a highly durable connection terminal. In this study, a MPC process was developed to fabricate a prototypical terminal. The result was compared with other crimping processes in terms of durability. The crimped part using MPC has a lower rising temperature and higher tensile strength than those using other crimping process. It is inferred from the experimental results that an optimal charging voltage exists in the MPC proces...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solar power}} forecasting scheme, which uses spatial and temporal time series data along with a photovoltaic (PV) power conversion model. The PV conver- sion model uses the forecast of three different variables, namely, irradiance on the tilted plane, ambient temperature, and wind speed, in order to estimate the power produced by a PV plant at the grid <b>connection</b> <b>terminals.</b> The forecast values are obtained using a spatio-temporal method that uses the data recorded from a target meteorological station as well as data of its surrounding stations. The proposed forecasting method exploits the sparsity of correlations between time series data {{in a collection of}} sta- tions. The performance of both the PV conversion model and the spatio-temporal algorithm is evaluated using high-resolution real data recorded in various locations in Italy. Comparison with other benchmark methods illustrates that the proposed method significantly improves the solar power forecasts, particularly over short-term horizon...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cooling {{equipment}} is the frequent occurrence of fire despite {{the absence of}} the heating element. National fire statistics in 2013 show that a total of 263 fires occurred in the cooling equipment and the number of electric fan has 145 fire cases. This is accounted for 55. 1 % of the whole. Electric fan is the electrical appliance that the heat is generated on the winding wire and the iron core. If such characteristic is not controled properly, fire would break out at the electric fan. also there is a gap filled with an insulator between <b>connection</b> <b>terminals</b> of the capacitor in the electric fan. But in case that the gap on the capacitor is covered with some conductive material such as dust, there would be a fire as well caused by electrical heating locally. Although many studies related with those have been conducted, electric fan fire is continuously occurred. In this study, thermal characteristics and current signal in various conditions such as the heat generation of windings including iron cores of the motor and the dielectric breakdown of terminals on the capacitor connected to the motor were detected. In order to measure the maximum temperature, “third level ” wind velocity button was pushed and the time selection switch t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: 4 G {{network is}} {{a network of}} {{emerging}} various networks such as CDMA 2000, Wireless LAN and WCDMA into all IP-based networks {{that will make it}} globally available. 4 G technology is a very complex technology of integrating different new techniques, and 4 G services for a higher speed wireless internet access. In the near future, wide variety of wireless networks will be merged into the internet and allow users to continue their application with higher degree of mobility. In such environment, wireless mobile internet that are anticipated to deliver service to a mobile terminal “anywhere at anytime”, which further requires an efficient handoff. Whereas conventional handoff techniques support single <b>connection</b> <b>terminals</b> that operate within a homogeneous network, 4 G wireless systems promise to support terminals with multiple connections carrying different types of traffic, with varying quality of service constraints, which may handoff between different tiers of the same network, or between different types of networks. In this paper, new handoff techniques are proposed to support wireless mobile internet with quality of service constraints within 4 G wireless systems. This proposal will include handoff architecture and algorithm which try to combine cellular network for uplink traffic services and 802. 11 b Wi-Fi network for downlink traffic service during and after handoff according to internet characteristics which uplink traffic services is one of fourth of downlink traffic service.
