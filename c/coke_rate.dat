40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to clarify the influence of operating conditions on the formation and emissions of polychlorinated-p-dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) from a sintering process with hot flue gas recycling. A pilot scale sinter pot with simulated flue gas recycling was developed, and four key operational parameters, including temperature, oxygen content of the simulated waste flue gas, the <b>coke</b> <b>rate</b> of the sintering mixture, and the quicklime quality, were selected for exploring PCDD/Fs formation. The results showed that the temperature of the recycled flue gas had a major affect on PCDD/Fs formation, and a high temperature could significantly increase their formation during sintering. A clear linear correlation between the temperature of recycling flue gas and PCDD/Fs emission (r = 0. 93) was found. PCDD/Fs could be reduced to a certain extent by decreasing the level of oxygen in the recycled flue gas, while sintering quality was unchanged. The <b>coke</b> <b>rate</b> had no significant influence on the formation of PCDD/Fs, but the quality of quicklime used in the sintering mixture could affect not only the amount of PCDD/Fs emissions but also the sintering productivity. Compared with a benchmark sinter pot test, PCDD/Fs emissions markedly decreased with improvements to quicklime quality. However, the reduction in PCDD/Fs emissions realized by using high-quality quicklime was limited by the temperature of the inlet gas. The highest reduction achieved was 51 % compared with conventional quicklime when the temperature of the inlet gas was 150 degrees C...|$|E

40|$|The sinter {{quality is}} {{dependent}} on sinter mineralogy, which in turn depends on the chemical compositions of the sinter mix. Although many research works have been conducted, further investigation {{on the effect of}} chemical compositions (MgO, A 2 O 3, Basicity) on the sinter quality is still required for further improvement of the sinter and more alternative additives are still being tested. In this project, a sinter pot has been used to manufacture sinters, which were characterized using point-counting to quantify the different phases and X-Ray diffraction to identify the polymorphic forms of Ca 2 SiO 4 of the silicate phases. The produced sinters were evaluated with respect to reducibility index (RI), reduction degradation index (RDI), physical breakdown (TI and AI), and production properties (yield, <b>coke</b> breeze <b>rate</b> and production rate). The influence of ignition temperature, magnesium oxide, alumina addition and basicity on the mineralogy as well as physical and chemical properties of iron ore sinters were investigated. Results were obtained as follows: For the Base case with a basicity of 2, 2. 8 mass% MgO content, 1. 7 mass % Al 2 O 3 and 10 mass% CaO, the effect of ignition temperature, which ranged between 864 oC and 1100 oC, on the sinter quality was investigated. Results showed that the ignition temperature had an effect on the sinter properties: reducibility (RI), physical strength (TI and AI), production properties (yield, <b>coke</b> breeze <b>rate</b> and production rate). The temperature 1053 oC was the best ignition temperature for an economically acceptable sinter. A further increase in ignition temperature was found to form melt {{on the surface of the}} sinter produced, leading to a sinter of low quality. Also, X-rays diffraction pattern showed that the allotropic transformation of the Ca 2 SiO 4 did not take place. The Low SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter had the highest reducibility index and had the highest Abrasion index and the lowest <b>coke</b> breeze <b>rate</b> at 2. 8 mass% MgO content compared to all the sinters produced in this project. For the High SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter MgO was added through dolomite and fused magnesia. A comparative study on the effect of dolomite and fused magnesia was conducted. The sinter to which fused magnesia was added had lower reducibility, higher reduction degradation, higher tumble index, lower abrasion index and lower <b>coke</b> breeze <b>rate</b> than the sinter to which dolomite was added.

The injection of coal, oil, gas and plastics to replace coke at the tuyeres {{has now become a}} widely accepted technology in modern blast furnace operations and <b>coke</b> <b>rates</b> have decreased very rapidly. This injection practice has led to more severe quality requirements for coke. Furthermore, the coal market situation has changed tremendously in recent years with coal prices rising continuously.

Because ammonia preferentially occupies the acidic sites of the anode catalyst materials, {{a significant decrease in}} the <b>coke</b> formation <b>rate</b> is realized by introducing ammonia into the methane gas. In addition, hydrogen, a decomposition product of ammonia, also acts as an additional fuel for the SOFCs, resulting in high cell performance.

The predicted values of BF <b>coke</b> <b>rate</b> and blast rate are 8. 6 % and 5. 11 % higher than that of the actual values, respectively. The First and Second law efficiencies of the BF operating system were found to be 77. 3 % and 39. 13 %, respectively. Irreversibility of the actual operation of BF was found to be 18. 9 %, which included the irreversibility due to the transformation of chemical energy and promotion of reduction reactions. The main cause of the irreversibility in the process was the conversion of chemical energy of the fuel (coke) to thermal energy. The effect of the changing operating parameters on the plant productivity is also investigated. This study suggests that the plant productivity can be improved by increasing the hot air blast temperature, reducing hot metal silicon level, reducing coke ash level and increasing sinte rvolume in the charge...|$|E
40|$|During {{iron ore}} sintering, {{material}} coalescence {{in the bed}} determines the physical properties of the agglomerated product. Sinter density and structural quantification by 2 D image analysis were used to elucidate the degree of coalescence and densification achieved during sintering. In the first program, samples - representing increasing temperatures - were obtained from three locations down a sintered bed. Sinter density, determined by liquid pycnometry, {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on green granulated bed bulk density. Image analysis results indicated a strong dependence between sinter density and porosity. Results also show that more coalescence occurs for blends containing porous ores at increasing sintering temperatures. When sinter basicity and/or <b>coke</b> <b>rate</b> is low the effect of temperature on coalescence is less pronounced for all blends. The second program compared coalescence using 19 to 21 mm sinter from eight different pot tests and blends containing significant porous ores. For the same ore blend sintered under different conditions, measured trends in sinter density and porosity were in line with expectations but the changes were not large because the material in sinter has a high specific gravity of over four and changes in porosity were less than 5 %. It was concluded that small increases in coke level could decrease sinter porosity by 5 %, resulting in increased sinter tumble strength. Both programs show that when melt volume is high, small increases in temperature {{have a significant effect on}} coalescence in the flame front...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} forty years, {{the cost of}} heat energy and of labour has risen, {{accurate}} methods of automatic temperature control have been devised, the standard of thermal comfort demanded in dwellings, offices, factories, etc., has increased (vide the Factories Act of 1937) and, for many purposes, electricity, gas, and oil are used in preference to coal and <b>coke.</b> The <b>rate</b> of consumption of these more modern forms of potential heat energy can be readily measured by means of meters, and these developments all tend to concentrate attention on the quantitative aspects of space-heating technique, including {{the capacity of the}} installation to carry relatively heavy overloads during periods of severe weather. Warmed buildings should no longer be regarded as receptacles for unknown quantities of valuable heat energy, even in its crudest form. Conversely, their space-heating instdlations should be con-sidered as energy converters, possessing a thermal efficiency which can be accurately assessed, when the hour-to-hour and day-to-day thermal potential (expressed in terms of degree-days), and certain other factors are known. The Royal Meteorological Society recently published two important papers covering the OctobeFMay heating season back to 1881, and the three winter months (December-February) back to 1783 respectively. The statistical data, thus made conveniently available, sug...|$|R
40|$|A {{packed bed}} {{microbalance}} reactor setup (TEOM-GC) {{is used to}} investigate the formation of coke {{as a function of}} time-on-stream on ?-Al 2 O 3 and 3 P/SiO 2 catalyst samples under different conditions for the ODH reaction of ethylbenzene to styrene. All samples show a linear correlation of the styrene selectivity and yield with the initial coverage of coke. The COX production increases with the coverage of coke. On the 3 wt% P/SiO 2 sample, the initial coke build-up is slow and the <b>coke</b> deposition <b>rate</b> increases with time. On alumina-based catalyst samples, a fast initial coke build-up takes place, decreasing with time-on-stream, but the amount of coke does not stabilize. A higher O 2 : EB feed ratio results in more coke, and a higher temperature results in less coke. This coking behaviour of Al 2 O 3 can be described by existing “monolayer–multilayer” models. Further, the coverage of coke on the catalyst varies with the position in the bed. For maximal styrene selectivity, the optimal coverage of coke should be sufficient to convert all O 2, but as low as possible to prevent selectivity loss by COX production. This is in favour of high temperature and low O 2 : EB feed ratios. The optimal coke coverage depends in a complex way on all the parameters: temperature, the O 2 : EB feed ratio, reactant concentrations, and the type of starting material.

40|$|A {{combination}} of in situ UV-Vis and confocal fluorescence micro-spectroscopy {{is applied to}} investigate the influence of an external silicalite- 1 shell on the Brønsted acidity and coke formation process of individual H-ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals. Three probe reactions were used: oligomerization of styrene, methanol-to-olefin (MTO) conversion and aromatization of light naphtha (LNA) derivatives. Oligomerization of styrene leads {{to the formation of}} optically active carbocationic oligomers. Different styrene substitutions indicate the conversion ability of the catalyst acid core, a preferred alignment of the oligomers within the straight zeolite channels and a Brønsted acidity gradient throughout the zeolite crystal. Both the MTO conversion and the LNA process lead to limited carbonaceous deposition within the external silicalite- 1 layer. This outer shell furthermore prevents the growth of extended coke species at the zeolite external surface. During MTO, the formation of carbonaceous compounds initiates {{at the center of the}} H-ZSM- 5 zeolite core and expands towards the zeolite exterior. This coke build-up starts with a 420 nm UV-Vis absorption band, assigned to methyl-substituted aromatic carbocations, and a second band around 550 nm, which is indicative of their growth towards larger conjugated systems. Aromatization of linear and branched C 5 paraffins causes negligible darkening of the zeolite crystals though it forms fluorescent coke deposits and their precursors within the H-ZSM- 5 catalyst. Olefin homologues on the contrary cause pronounced darkening of the zeolite composite. Methyl-branching of these reactants slows down the <b>coke</b> formation <b>rate</b> and produces carbonaceous species that are more restricted in their molecular size...|$|R
