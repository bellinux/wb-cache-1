Cutting force reflected structure of the blade and movement of machine. Cutting force was changed with feed speed varied and the rotation of axis B & C.

The box-counting dimension for the <b>cutting</b> load time <b>series</b> {{was consistent with the}} fractal dimension of the corresponding fragment size distribution, which indicated that there were inherent relations between the rock fragmentation and the cutting load. Furthermore, the box-counting dimension was used to describe the fractal characteristic of <b>cutting</b> load time <b>series</b> under different conditions. The results show that the rock compressive strength, cutting depth, cutting angle, and assisted water-jet types all have no significant effect on the fractal characteristic of cutting load. The box-counting dimension can be an evaluation index to assess the extent of rock crushing or cutting. Rock fracture mechanism would not be changed due to water-jet in front of or behind the cutter, but it would be changed when the water-jet was in cutter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The Burrows-Wheeler {{transform}} permutes {{the symbols}} of a string such that the permuted string can be compressed effectively with fast, simple techniques. Inversion of the transform is a bottleneck in practice. Inversion takes linear time, but, for each symbol decoded, folklore says that a random access into the transformed string (and so a CPU cache-miss) is necessary. In this paper we show how to mitigate cache misses and so speed inversion. Our main idea is to modify the standard inversion algorithm to detect and record repeated substrings in the original string as it is recovered. Subsequent occurrences of these repetitions are then copied in a cache friendly way from the already recovered portion of the string, short <b>cutting</b> a <b>series</b> of random accesses by the standard inversion algorithm. We show experimentally that this approach leads to faster runtimes in general, and can drastically reduce inversion time for highly repetitive data.

The Fourier transform formulas for the gravity anomalies of the two-dimensional structures are derived. For small values of omega, the Fourier transforms give valuable information about the parameters of the structures. Under favorable conditions the amplitude spectrum of the Fourier transforms can give information about the depth as well as the inclination of the anomalous mass. The validity of the new formulas and the suitability cf the new interpretation techniques are tested by comparing results obtained from field measurements with the known geology of the structures...|$|R

A forest-level optimisation model was extended to include uncertainty in timber growth, plant diversity, and cutting costs.

Patch-clear cutting provided higher biodiversity benefits (i. e., 59 vs. 11 understorey plant species) with an opportunity cost of 27 NZD (18 USD) per extra plant species or 1250 NZD (820 USD) ha− 1. However, the true benefits of patch-clear cutting would be even greater if other benefits of stand retention are included.
