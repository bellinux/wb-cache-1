5|$|<b>Cockatoos</b> {{are popular}} birds in aviculture, but their needs are {{difficult}} to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest cockatoo species to maintain and {{is by far the}} most frequently kept in captivity. White <b>cockatoos</b> are more commonly found in captivity than black <b>cockatoos.</b> Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some cockatoo species in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Trained <b>cockatoos</b> are {{sometimes}} seen in bird shows in zoos. They are generally less motivated by food than other birds; some may more respond to petting or praise than food. <b>Cockatoos</b> {{can often be}} taught to wear a parrot harness, enabling their owners to take them outdoors. <b>Cockatoos</b> {{have been used in}} animal-assisted therapy, generally in nursing homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{cockatiel}} {{is by far}} the cockatoo species {{most frequently}} kept in captivity. Among U.S. bird keepers that participated in a survey by APPMA in 2003/04, 39% had cockatiels, as opposed to only 3% that had (other) cockatoo species. The white <b>cockatoos</b> are more often encountered in aviculture than the black <b>cockatoos.</b> Black <b>cockatoos</b> are rarely seen in European zoos due to export restrictions on Australian wildlife but birds seized by governments have been loaned.|$|E

50|$|The yellow-crested <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua sulphurea) {{also known}} as the lesser sulphur-crested <b>cockatoo,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} (approximately 34 cm long) <b>cockatoo</b> with white plumage, bluish-white bare orbital skin, grey feet, a black bill, and a retractile yellow or orange crest. The sexes are similar. Lessor, the <b>cockatoo</b> used in the TV series Baretta, is thought to be a yellow-crested <b>cockatoo</b> but is actually a medium sulphur-crested <b>cockatoo.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in {{eucalyptus}} woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these <b>cockatoos</b> are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black <b>cockatoos,</b> the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black <b>cockatoos</b> are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.|$|E
5|$|Two 1970s police dramas {{featured}} protagonists with pet <b>cockatoos.</b> In the 1973 film Serpico, Al Pacino's character had a pet {{white cockatoo}} {{and the television}} show Baretta saw Robert Blake's character with Fred the Triton cockatoo. The popularity of the latter show saw a corresponding rise in popularity of <b>cockatoos</b> as pets in the late 1970s. <b>Cockatoos</b> have been used frequently in advertising; a cockatoo appeared in a 'cheeky' (and later toned down) 2008 advertising campaign for Cockatoo Ridge Wineries.|$|E
5|$|Yellow-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> {{can cause}} damage in pine and {{eucalyptus}} plantations by weakening stems through gouging out {{pieces of wood}} to extract moth larvae. In places with these gum plantations, {{the population of the}} larva of the cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali grows, which then leads to increased predation (and hence tree damage) by <b>cockatoos.</b> Furthermore, plantations generally lack undergrowth which might have prevented <b>cockatoos</b> from damaging younger trees. Yellow-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> were shot as pests in some districts of New South Wales until the 1940s because of this. The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is promoted by the Shoalhaven City Council local government on the NSW south coast as the region's bird. Within the Jervis bay area the birds can be seen feasting on the many casuarina trees native to the area.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} <b>cockatoo</b> except the {{cockatiel}} {{are protected by}} the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts import and export of wild-caught parrots to special licensed purposes. Five <b>cockatoo</b> species (including all subspecies)—the Tanimbar corella (Cacatua goffiniana), red-vented <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua haematuropygia), Moluccan <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua moluccensis), yellow-crested <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua sulphurea) and palm <b>cockatoo</b> (Probosciger aterrimus)—are protected on the CITES Appendix I list.

50|$|The white <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua alba), {{also known}} as the {{umbrella}} <b>cockatoo,</b> is a medium-sized all-white <b>cockatoo</b> endemic to tropical rainforest on islands of Indonesia. When surprised, it extends a large and striking head crest, which has a semicircular shape (similar to an umbrella, hence the alternative name). The undersides of the wings and tail have a pale yellow or lemon color which flashes when they fly. It is similar to other species of white <b>cockatoo</b> such as yellow-crested <b>cockatoo,</b> sulphur-crested <b>cockatoo,</b> and salmon-crested <b>cockatoo,</b> all of which have yellow, orange or pink crest feathers instead of white.|$|R
5|$|A 2008 {{mitochondrial}} {{and nuclear}} DNA phylogenetic {{study of the}} parrots, <b>cockatoos</b> and related taxa by utilizing among others the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, provides confirmatory evidence for a Gondwanaland origin of the ancestral parrots in the Cretaceous period, and an Australasia divergence of the ancestral <b>cockatoos</b> from the parrots in either late Cretaceous (66 mya) or Paleogene (45 mya) periods depending on baseline assumptions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cockatoos</b> {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. <b>Cockatoos</b> are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some cockatoo {{species have been}} adversely affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Like other <b>cockatoos,</b> {{this species}} is long-lived. A pair of yellow-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> at Rotterdam Zoo stopped {{breeding}} {{when they were}} 41 and 37 years of age, but still showed signs of close bonding. Birds appear to reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age; this is the age range of breeding recorded in captivity.|$|E

50|$|The palm <b>cockatoo</b> (Probosciger aterrimus), {{also known}} as the goliath <b>cockatoo</b> or great black <b>cockatoo,</b> is a large smoky-grey or black parrot of the <b>cockatoo</b> family native to New Guinea, Aru Islands, and Cape York Peninsula. It has a very large black beak and {{prominent}} red cheek patches.|$|R
5|$|Like other parrots, <b>cockatoos</b> can be {{afflicted by}} psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The viral {{infection}} causes feather loss and beak malformation {{and reduces the}} bird's overall immunity. Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested <b>cockatoos,</b> little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may pose a high risk to smaller stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|The Swan Coastal Plain {{north of}} Perth {{has become an}} {{important}} feeding area. There, <b>cockatoos</b> also forage in the Gnangara pine plantations, where they feed on the seeds of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). Carnaby's black <b>cockatoos</b> have come to depend on these plantations since the early 20th century. Almost two-thirds of the Carnaby's black <b>cockatoos</b> in the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain roost in the Gnangara-Pinjar pine plantation. Other non-native plants that the birds also consume include Erodium species, doublegee (Emex australis) seeds, {{the fruit of the}} umbrella tree (Schefflera actinophylla), seeds of liquidambar (Liquidambar styraciflua), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), almond (Prunus amygdalus), onion grass (Romulea rosea), white cedar (Melia azedarach), and hibiscus flowers.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} <b>cockatoos</b> are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All <b>cockatoos</b> {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. <b>Cockatoos</b> are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested <b>cockatoos</b> were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare <b>cockatoos</b> alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E
50|$|The Solomons <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua ducorpsii), {{also known}} as the Ducorps' <b>cockatoo,</b> Solomons corella or broad-crested corella, is a species of <b>cockatoo</b> endemic to the Solomon Islands. This small white <b>cockatoo</b> is larger than the Tanimbar corella yet smaller than the {{umbrella}} <b>cockatoo.</b> The species is common across most of the Solomons, absent only from Makira in the south. It inhabits lowland rainforests, secondary forests, cleared areas and gardens.|$|R

A detour takes visitors to the Western Australian Black <b>Cockatoo</b> exhibit, planted with <b>cockatoo</b> food trees and home to Baudin's <b>cockatoo,</b> Carnaby's <b>cockatoo,</b> Major Mitchell's <b>cockatoo,</b> Muir's corella, red-tailed black <b>cockatoo,</b> and red-capped parrot. Another detour takes visitors to the Numbats Under Threat exhibit, which showcases the endangered Australian numbat along with rufous whistlers.|$|R
50|$|The little corella (Cacatua sanguinea), {{also known}} as the bare-eyed <b>cockatoo,</b> blood-stained <b>cockatoo,</b> short-billed corella, little <b>cockatoo</b> and blue-eyed <b>cockatoo,</b> is a white <b>cockatoo</b> native to Australia and {{southern}} New Guinea. It was known as Birdirra among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara. They would keep them as pets, or traditionally cook and eat them. The downy feathers are used in traditional ceremonies and dances where they adorn head and armbands.|$|R
5|$|This {{species was}} seldom seen in captivity before the late 1950s, after which time {{a large number}} of wild-caught birds entered the Australian market. Since then, it has become more common, but is still rarely seen outside Australia. Captive yellow-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> require a large aviary to avoid apathy and poor health. There is some {{evidence}} that protein may be more important to them than to other <b>cockatoos,</b> and low protein has been linked with the production of yolkless eggs in captivity. Females in particular enjoy mealworms. They can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots, but do not handle disturbance while breeding. As with other black <b>cockatoos,</b> yellow-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> are rarely seen in European zoos, since Australia restricted exportation of wildlife in 1959, but birds seized by government agencies in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). In 2000, there were pairs of yellow-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> in Puerto de la Cruz zoo in Spain and in Rotterdam. Like most species of parrots, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cockatoos</b> {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All <b>cockatoos</b> have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's <b>cockatoos</b> are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cockatoos</b> are {{recognisable}} by the showy crests and curved bills. Their plumage {{is generally}} less colourful {{than that of}} other parrots, being mainly white, grey or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks or tail. On average they are larger than other parrots; however, the cockatiel, the smallest cockatoo species, is a small bird. The phylogenetic position of the cockatiel remains unresolved, other than that {{it is one of}} the earliest offshoots of the cockatoo lineage. The remaining species are in two main clades. The five large black coloured <b>cockatoos</b> of the genus Calyptorhynchus form one branch. The second and larger branch is formed by the genus Cacatua, comprising 11 species of white-plumaged <b>cockatoos</b> and four monotypic genera that branched off earlier; namely the pink and white Major Mitchell's cockatoo, the pink and grey galah, the mainly grey gang-gang cockatoo and the large black-plumaged palm cockatoo.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cockatoos</b> {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male <b>cockatoos</b> are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cockatoos</b> {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove dirt {{and oil and}} realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that are otherwise hard to get at. <b>Cockatoos</b> produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and apply it by wiping their plumage with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E
