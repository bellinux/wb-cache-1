25|$|A natural {{development}} from digital delay-processing hardware was {{the appearance of}} software-based delay systems.

Software delays, in many cases, offer much greater flexibility than even the most recent digital hardware delays. Abundant system memory on modern personal computers offers practically limitless storage for the audio buffer, and the natural efficiency of audio delay algorithms has made the implementation trivial for delays offering shifting or random delay times, or the insertion of other audio effects during the feedback process. Many authors of software plugins have added functionality to emulate {{the sounds of the}} earlier analog units.|$|E
