5|$|Animals such as chameleon, frog, {{flatfish}} such as {{the peacock}} flounder, squid and octopus actively change their skin patterns and colours using special chromatophore cells to resemble their current background, or, as in most <b>chameleons,</b> for signalling. However, Smith's dwarf chameleon does use active colour change for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} woodcut, Study for Stars, {{completed}} in August 1948, depicts wireframe versions {{of several of}} the same polyhedra and polyhedral compounds, floating in black within a square composition, but without the <b>chameleons.</b> The largest polyhedron shown in Study for Stars, a stellated rhombic dodecahedron, is also one of two polyhedra depicted prominently in Escher's 1961 print Waterfall.|$|E
5|$|The Carmel Mountain {{has three}} main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Si’ach. For {{the most part}} these valleys are undeveloped natural {{corridors}} that run up through the city from the coast {{to the top of}} the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls and <b>chameleons.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Witchwood public house, in the St Petersfield {{area of the}} town, {{has been}} a music venue since the 1960s, hosting acts such as Muse, The Coral, and Lost Prophets. In 2004 The Witchwood came under threat when the area was being redeveloped, but was saved from {{demolition}} after a campaign by locals and led by Tom Hingley, drawing support from musicians such as Bert Jansch, The Fall, and The <b>Chameleons.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other mammals, {{including}} the cat-like fossa, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic. The few families and genera of reptile that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90percent of these being endemic (including one endemic family). The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species, including the smallest known, and researchers have proposed that Madagascar may be the origin of all <b>chameleons.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of animals are kept as pets, from {{invertebrates}} such as tarantulas and octopuses, insects including praying mantises, reptiles such as snakes and <b>chameleons,</b> and birds including canaries, parakeets and parrots all finding a place. Mammals {{are the most popular}} pets in the Western world, with the most kept species being dogs, cats, and rabbits. For example, in America in 2012 there were some 78 million dogs, 86 million cats, and 3.5 million rabbits. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{could be}} exploited industrially and commercially, and research {{that could lead}} to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as <b>chameleons</b> and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E
5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, <b>chameleons,</b> and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird. Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles. The pieces are so fine that small insects were included on the surfaces of some while others have what looks like bronze wires decorated around them. None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is an {{opportunistic}} omnivore primarily eating fruits and leaves, {{particularly those of}} the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), known natively as kily. When available, tamarind makes {{up as much as}} 50% of the diet, especially during the dry, winter season. The ring-tailed lemur eats from as many as three dozen different plant species, and its diet includes flowers, herbs, bark and sap. It has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, spider webs, insect cocoons, arthropods (spiders, caterpillars, cicadas and grasshoppers) and small vertebrates (birds and <b>chameleons).</b> During the dry season it becomes increasingly opportunistic.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} also known for its herpetofauna. More than 100 species of frogs are found within a 30 km radius of Analamazaotra Forest Station. There are at least five species of <b>chameleon</b> {{including}} the brown pygmy leaf <b>chameleon,</b> Parson's <b>chameleon,</b> short-horned <b>chameleon,</b> nose-horned <b>chameleon,</b> and short-nosed <b>chameleon.</b> The forest station {{is also home to}} the Madagascar tree boa.|$|R

5|$|The {{two towers}} of Waterfalls {{impossible}} building are topped with compound polyhedra, one {{a compound of}} three cubes, the other a stellated rhombic dodecahedron known as Escher's solid. Escher had used this solid in his 1948 woodcut Stars, which also contains all five of the Platonic solids and various stellated solids, representing stars; the central solid is animated by <b>chameleons</b> climbing through the frame as it whirls in space. Escher possessed a 6cm refracting telescope and was a keen enough amateur astronomer to have recorded observations of binary stars.|$|E
5|$|This serpent eagle {{feeds on}} snakes, <b>chameleons,</b> and toads, and hunts these species by {{dropping}} onto {{them from a}} perch in the understory. Its excellent eyesight enables it to hunt in the dark forest. Very {{little is known about}} its breeding habits, though it is suspected to breed from June to December. The Congo serpent eagle is listed as a species of Least Concern due to its large range and population. This species has been kept as a pet.|$|E
5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} forest floor to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. They mostly operate alone, in pairs or groups of three, and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and <b>chameleons),</b> next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, <b>chameleons,</b> snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} was found with a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, {{at the peak of}} the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about this species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle lives in the {{understory}} of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs in tall trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially <b>chameleons,</b> toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as <b>chameleons</b> and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E
