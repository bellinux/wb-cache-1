25|$|Ghana amended its {{nationality}} law in 2000, to the 2000 Ghana Citizen Act Dual Citizenship Scheme, {{which came}} into effect from Friday, 1 November 2002, {{in accordance with}} the provisions of the Citizenship Act 2002. Applicants eligible for dual citizenship are those who hold citizenship of any country in addition to the citizenship of Ghana. In these instances, all applicants are required by law to provide evidence of their Ghanaian nationality or their country of birth. Its intention was to increase immigration of skilled labour, but the law has been criticised for not giving full <b>citizens</b> <b>rights</b> as native-born citizens.|$|E
25|$|After the {{revocation}} of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic {{received the}} largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the Cévennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Lozère. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot. In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full <b>citizens</b> <b>rights</b> to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715. Huguenots intermarried with Dutch from the outset.|$|E

25|$|On November 27, 2012, after {{voters in}} the states of CO and WA voted to legalize {{recreational}} use of marijuana, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO) introduced a bill {{referred to as the}} 'Respect States and <b>Citizens</b> <b>Rights</b> Act' which aimed to amend the Controlled Substances Act to exclude any state that has legalized marijuana (for medical OR recreational use) from marijuana provisions of the CSA, effectively giving state law precedence over federal law in cases where an individual (or commercial enterprise) is acting within the letter of state law regarding marijuana/cannabis. The bill was referred to committee but died when no further action was taken. The same bill was reintroduced later in the 113th and 114th Congresses, where it died each time.|$|E
25|$|The {{interaction}} of overlapping <b>citizens</b> <b>rights</b> and laws {{has led to}} some cases of exploitation of loopholes to avoid {{the intention of the}} law. For example, the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was required to amend the potential for abuse of the rights of Irish citizenship to the right to abode in the United Kingdom. Before then, Irish citizenship was granted on the basis of jus soli (i.e. being born on the island of Ireland was reason in itself to be considered an Irish citizen). In one case, a Chinese migrant to the UK, living in Wales on Great Britain, chose to give birth to a child in Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland, to take advantage of Irish citizenship laws. Consequently, her child was born an Irish citizen by virtue of jus soli and so was entitled to permanent abode in the UK even though the mother did {{not have the right to}} visit the Republic of Ireland. The mother and father then claimed the right to stay in the United Kingdom by virtue of being the guardians of a citizen of the European Union who would be unable to look after itself should they be deported.|$|E
500|$|According to Miller, [...] "The {{succession}} of New World constitutions of which Virginia's, with Mason as its chief architect, was the first, declared {{the source of}} political authority to be the people... in addition to making clear what a government was entitled to do, {{most of them were}} prefaced by a list of individual rights of the <b>citizens...</b> <b>rights</b> whose maintenance was government's primary reason for being. Mason wrote the first of these lists." [...] Diane D. Pikcunas, in her article prepared for the bicentennial of the U.S. Bill of Rights, wrote that Mason [...] "made the declaration of rights as his personal crusade". Tarter deemed Mason [...] "celebrated as a champion of constitutional order and one of the fathers of the Bill of Rights". Justice Sandra Day O'Connor agreed, [...] "George Mason's greatest contribution to present day Constitutional law was his influence on our Bill of Rights".|$|E

2500|$|Since Israeli {{electoral law}} forbids any {{organization}} calling {{to abolish the}} Jewish character {{of the state to}} take part in the Knesset elections, Abnaa al-Balad boycotts what it calls the [...] "Zionist electoral process". Ibrahim Makkawi, a member of the movement and professor of Educational Psychology, explained this position further in a paper presented at the Third North American Student Conference on the Palestine Solidarity Movement at Rutgers University in October 2003, stating:We refuse to enter the Zionist Knesset, simply because it is (a) in direct contradiction with our national identity as the legitimate owners of the land, (b) it gives legitimacy to the Zionist Entity and support to its myth about democracy, (c) it is a vehicle of cooptation and fragmentation of our leadership and (d) there is virtually nothing that we can achieve through the Knesset with regard to our <b>citizens</b> <b>rights</b> that we cannot do without it." ...|$|E

2500|$|First, the <b>Citizens</b> <b>Rights</b> Directive 2004 article 4 says {{every citizen}} {{has the right}} to depart a member state with a valid passport. This has {{historical}} importance for central and eastern Europe, when the Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall denied its citizens the freedom to leave. Article 5 gives every citizen a right of entry, subject to national border controls. Schengen Area countries (not the UK and Ireland) abolished the need to show documents, and police searches at borders, altogether. These reflect the general principle of free movement in TFEU article 21. Second, article 6 allows every citizen to stay three months in another member state, whether economically active or not. Article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of [...] "sufficient resources... not to become a burden on the social assistance system". Articles 16 and 17 give a right to permanent residence after 5 years without conditions. Third, TEU article 10(3) requires the right to vote in the local constituencies for the European Parliament wherever a citizen lives.|$|E
