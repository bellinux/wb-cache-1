Little ignorance towards health can result in serious concerns and can also possibly cause life threatening situations. A system is proposed which can collect different parameters of an individual and upload those on a global database for the best assistance from experts {{from all over the}} globe. Cloud computing is available on various devices like PCs, Laptops, and Smartphones. To help maintain security of a database, various encryption techniques are applied. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a new way for public key encryption that would allow the encryption and decryption of messages based on user attributes. Given its expressiveness, attribute based encryption is currently being considered for many <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> computing <b>applications.</b> The aim of the system is to reduce the complexity involved in the current design and also to reduce the computation load on the client’s side without compromising the privacy through trying to shift the heavy computation burden to the server instead of the client’s device with limited computational power and many other constraints...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Secure and verifiable data {{transfer}} {{is needed in}} every distributed systems. Currently the attribute based encryption mechanism is used on which the encryption and decryption is based on user attributes. A promising application of ABE is flexible access control of encrypted data stored in the cloud, using access policies and ascribed attributes associated with private keys and ciphertexts. This technique is considered in many <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> computing <b>applications.</b> But the main efficiency drawback is that the decryption will be complex and time consuming with the access structure of attributes. Inorder to overcome this overhead for users the proposed system is using an outsourced decryption which possess only a small computation overhead for recovering the plaintext [...] This system also guarantees the verifiability. Informally, verifiability means that a user can efficiently check whether the transformation is done correctly. This system also proposes a mechanism for identifying whether data stored in cloud is modified or not. Security can also be achieved since the untrusted server, cloud {{is not able to}} learn anything about the encrypted data. Thus the system is verifiable and secure without relying on random oracles. Sensitive data can transferred confidently with the implementation of the proposed mechanism. Index Terms- access control, access structure, attribute based encryption, random oracles, verifiability. 1...|$|R
40|$|Attribute-based {{encryption}} (ABE) is a {{new vision}} for public key encryption that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages based on user attributes. For example, a user can create a ciphertext that can be decrypted only by other users with attributes satisfying (“Faculty ” OR (“PhD Student ” AND “Quals Completed”)). Given its expressiveness, ABE is currently being considered for many <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> computing <b>applications.</b> However, {{one of the main}} efficiency drawbacks of ABE is that the size of the ciphertext and the time required to decrypt it grows with the complexity of the access formula. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for ABE that largely eliminates this overhead for users. Suppose that ABE ciphertexts are stored in the cloud. We show how a user can provide the cloud with a single transformation key that allows the cloud to translate any ABE ciphertext satisfied by that user’s attributes into a (constant-size) El Gamal-style ciphertext, without the cloud being able to read any part of the user’s messages. To precisely define and demonstrate the advantages of this approach, we provide new security definitions for both CPA and replayable CCA security with outsourcing, several new constructions, an implementation of our algorithms and detailed performance measurements. In a typical configuration, the user saves significantly on both bandwidth and decryption time, without increasing the number of transmissions...|$|R
40|$|Advances in Mobile and Cloud {{technologies}} have redefined {{the way we}} perceive and use computers. Mobile devices now rely on <b>Cloud</b> technology for <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>applications.</b> Furthermore, recent advances in network technology ensure that mobile devices {{in the future will}} have high-bandwidth connectivity at all times. This drives the incentive of doing all the processing <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> in the <b>Cloud</b> <b>and</b> using mobile devices to access the services. In this chapter, the authors argue that always-on connectivity along with increased demand of Cloud services will contest the Internet backbone and create problems in the management of Cloud resources. Client mobility is also a factor that should be taken into account when providing Cloud services to mobile devices. The authors therefore propose a new service delivery architecture that takes into account client mobility as well as the distance between clients and services in order to manage Cloud and network resources more efficiently and provide a better Quality of Experience for the user...|$|R

In the present scenario, {{this is the most}} prominent requirement that must be served while introducing a communication protocol for an IoT environment. IoT network success and performance enhancement depend heavily on optimization of energy consumption that enhance the lifetime of IoT nodes and the network. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review on energy efficiency techniques used in IoT environments. The techniques proposed by researchers have been categorized based on five different layers of the energy architecture of IoT. These five layers are named as sensing, local processing <b>and</b> <b>storage,</b> network/communication, <b>cloud</b> processing <b>and</b> <b>storage,</b> <b>and</b> <b>application.</b> Specifically, the significance of energy efficiency in IoT environments is highlighted. A taxonomy is presented for the classification of related literature on energy efficient techniques in IoT environments. Following the taxonomy, a critical review of literature is performed focusing on major functional models, strengths and weaknesses. Open research challenges related to energy efficiency in IoT are identified as future research directions in the area. The survey should benefit IoT industry practitioners and researchers, in terms of augmenting the understanding of energy efficiency and its IoT-related trends and issues...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> {{services}} such as Dropbox, Box, Syncplicity and SugarSync. These public <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> services can store gigabytes of corporate and personal data in remote data centres around the world, which can then be synchronized to multiple devices. This creates an environment which is potentially conducive to security incidents, data breaches and other malicious activities. The forensic investigation of public cloud environments presents {{a number of new}} challenges for the digital forensics community. However, it is anticipated that end-devices such as smartphones, will retain data from these <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> services. This research investigates how forensic tools that are currently available to practitioners can be used to provide a practical solution for the problems related to investigating <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> environments. The research contribution is threefold. First, the findings from this research support the idea that end-devices which have been used to access <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> services can be used to provide a partial view of the evidence stored in the cloud service.

This project targets several different aspects of security and reliability in data communication. Two activities are associated with digital steganography, and their goal is discovering of new covert channels in the new web transfer protocols, such as HTTP/ 2 and QUIC, as well as using new anti-steganographic techniques for digital images {{in order to prevent}} terrorists to use them for hidden communication. The ultimate goal is to obtain a modular tool that would use the <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> services <b>and</b> web <b>applications</b> that provide a public service for images. Two other activities are related to cryptography, and include the development of optimal 8 x 8 S-boxes from small quasigroups of order 4 or 8, or from binary quasi-cyclic codes; development of an E-voting system using Bitcoin technology; development of Hill cipher cryptosystem with CSPRNG, and parallel realization of some cryptographic algorithms related to cryptographic measures for S-boxes. One activity involves the analysis and processing of data obtained by testing computer and network security, by using algorithms from artificial intelligence.

However, the performance of restore operations from a deduplicated backup can be significantly lower than that without deduplication. The main reason {{lies in the fact that}} a file or block is split into multiple small data chunks that are often located in different disks after deduplication, which can cause a subsequent read operation to invoke many disk IOs involving multiple disks and thus degrade the read performance significantly. While this problem has been by and large ignored in the literature thus far, we argue that the time is ripe for us to pay significant attention to it in light of the emerging <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> the increasing popularity of the VM platform in the cloud. This is because, in a <b>cloud</b> <b>storage</b> or VM environment, a simple read request on the client side may translate into a restore operation if the data to be read or a VM suspended by the user was previously deduplicated when written to the cloud or the VM storage server, a likely scenario considering the network bandwidth <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> capacity concerns in such an environment. To address this problem, in this article, we propose SAR, an SSD (solid-state drive) -Assisted Read scheme, that effectively exploits the high random-read performance properties of SSDs and the unique data-sharing characteristic of deduplication-based storage systems by storing in SSDs the unique data chunks with high reference count, small size, and nonsequential characteristics. In this way, many read requests to HDDs are replaced by read requests to SSDs, thus significantly improving the read performance of the deduplicationbased storage systems in the cloud. The extensive trace-driven and VM restore evaluations on the prototype implementation of SAR show that SAR outperforms the traditional deduplication-based and flash-based cache schemes significantly, in terms of the average response times...|$|R
