25|$|Another {{important}} reliability {{problem is}} caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually oxygen in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys (such as <b>Cunife</b> and Fernico) and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed.

50|$|At {{one point}} Fender Musical Instruments Corporation used <b>Cunife</b> magnets in their Wide-Range humbucking pickups, however {{discontinued}} use, due to <b>Cunife</b> being hard to source.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cunife</b> has a {{magnetic}} coercivity {{of several hundred}} oersteds. Unlike most high coercivity magnetic materials which are hard and brittle {{and need to be}} cast into shape, <b>cunife</b> can be drawn into thin wires. Wires as thin as five thou can be produced this way.|$|E
50|$|The Wide Range pickup was {{conceived}} to be sonically closer to Fender's single coil pickups than Gibson humbuckers. Due {{to the difficulty}} of machining AlNiCo magnets into screw-type pole pieces, this concept called {{for the use of the}} more easily machinable <b>CuNiFe</b> (Copper/Nickel/Iron) rod magnets as pole pieces within the coil structures, to function more like a regular Strat pickup than a Gibson humbucker. Whereas Gibson humbuckers use a single bar magnet under the coils of the pickup, Wide Range pickups have individual <b>CuNiFe</b> magnets that were threaded and slotted to resemble the adjustable screw type poles of a Gibson humbucker. The pickup bobbins were wound with approximately 6800 turns of copper wire around the pole-pieces and the Wide Range pickup has a DC resistance of around 10 kΩ.|$|E
50|$|Electrolytic {{effects from}} the differing metals used for the {{miniature}} tube pins (usually <b>Cunife</b> or Fernico) and the tube base could cause intermittent contact due to local corrosion, especially in relatively low current tubes such as were used in battery-operated radio sets. Malfunctioning equipment with miniature tubes can sometimes be brought back to life by removing and reinserting the tubes, disturbing the insulating layer of corrosion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cunife</b> is an alloy {{of copper}} (Cu), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), {{and in some}} cases cobalt (Co). The alloy has the same linear {{coefficient}} of expansion as certain types of glass, and thus makes an ideal material for the lead out wires in light bulbs and thermionic valves. Fernico exhibits a similar property. It is a magnetic alloy and can be used for making magnets.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} pickup makers {{producing}} modern replacements {{based on the}} original design, namely Jason Lollar, Curtis Novak, Seymour Duncan and Telenator in the US, The Creamery from Manchester, UK and Oil City Pickups from London UK are also available. Telenator currently is the only {{company in the world}} to offer actual <b>CuNiFe</b> threaded magnets in two versions of their pickups, with other manufacturers using FeCrCo and some using AlNiCo threaded magnets.|$|E

5000|$|FerNiCo I has {{the same}} linear {{coefficient}} of expansion as certain types of borosilicate ("hard" [...] glass), (c6.5 × 10−6°K−1, thus serving as an ideal material for the lead-out wires or other seal structures in light bulbs and thermionic valves. Dumet is also used for this purpose, but for passing through softer soda-lime and lead-alkali glasses.

50|$|Both the Mexican and the Japanese {{versions}} {{feature a}} reissued {{version of the}} Fender Wide Range humbucking pickup, each of which differs fundamentally in construction from the original. The original WRH used magnetized <b>CuNiFe</b> (copper, nickel and iron) polepieces ("slugs") with a copper wiring around the slugs, while the reissue has a standard non-magnetized set of slugs with an AlNiCo (aluminum, nickel, Cobalt) magnetized bar underneath. This standard humbucker is fitted in the larger casing of the original pickup, using wax to fill the void. The original WRH measured an average of 10.6 kΩ and used a 1 MΩ audio volume pot (P/N 021832) and a 1 MΩ LIN (P/N 010188) tone pot, while the reissue measures a fairly standard 8 kΩ and uses 250 kΩ volume and tone pots. This results in a much darker sounding reissue wide range pickup.|$|E
5000|$|The 2004 reissue {{version of}} the pickup was {{redesigned}} by Fender employee Bill Turner {{in order to achieve}} a similar sound in the absence of <b>cunife</b> magnets. While looking almost identical to the original 1970s version it differs greatly in its construction, featuring an alnico bar magnet underneath non-magnetized pole-pieces. It is in fact an ordinary humbucker placed in the larger Wide Range Humbucker casing, and the gap is filled with wax. This is one important reason the reissue Deluxe sounds different from the original guitars. Another reason is the use of 250kΩ volume and tone pots, while the original used 1 MΩ pots. Using 250kΩ pots with very hot humbuckers results in a dark and muddy sound; a common remedy is to replace the controls with 500kΩ pots, which is generally agreed to improve the sound of the reissues. (These same reissue pickups are used for the current 1972 Custom and Thinline Telecaster Reissues.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010 the Fender Custom Shop {{released}} a limited issue of 30 '72 Telecaster Custom relics. While they {{used some of}} the original '72 design features such as the three bolt neck and the classic look, these guitars had many more differences from the originals. The body is made of ash, and features a belly cut. The neck is one piece maple with a flatter 9.5 inch radius and larger 6105 frets. The head stock has the original design [...] "Custom" [...] logo. The neck pickup is a custom wound wide range humbucker. Alnico 2 magnets were used which more closely resemble {{the sound of the}} <b>CuNiFe</b> magets used the original Seth Lover pickup (I have only been able to verify this with a phone call to Fenders customer service). The bridge pickup is a [...] "hot nocaster". The overwound pickup has more output which better matches the output of the neck pickup. These guitars are distinguished from production reissues by a [...] "Custom Shop Limited Edition" [...] logo {{on the back of the}} head stock and also on the neck plate.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the octal base, the B8G loctal base or lock-in base (sometimes spelled [...] "loktal" [...] - trademarked by Sylvania), was {{developed}} by Sylvania for ruggedized applications such as automobile radios. Along with B8B (a British designation out of date by 1958), these eight-pin locking bases are almost identical and the names usually taken as interchangeable (although there are some minor differences in specifications, such as spigot material and spigot taper, etc.). The pin geometry {{was the same as}} for octal, but the pins were thinner (although they will fit into a standard octal socket, they wobble and do not make good contact), the base shell was made of aluminium, and the center hole had an electrical contact that also mechanically locked (hence [...] "loctal") the tube in place. Loctal tubes were only used widely by a few equipment manufacturers, most notably Philco, which used the tubes in many table radios. Loctal tubes have a small indexing mark {{on the side of the}} base skirt; they do not release easily from their sockets unless pushed from that side. Because the pins are actually the Fernico or <b>Cunife</b> lead-out wires from the tube itself, they are prone to intermittent connections caused by the build-up of electrolytic corrosion products due to the pin being of a different metallic composition to the socket contact.|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{polarization}} has {{not been}} implemented successfully on a time of flight small angle neutron scattering TOF SANS machine to this date anywhere in the world. Designing a suitable one for the small angle scattering instrument SASI at IPNS, and implementing it, is an important first on a pulsed source. To achieve this, the installation of a solid state supermirror based polarizer, a gradient field adiabatic spin flipper, and a new collimator package were required. A polarizing solid state bender without adsorbing layers, designed to transmit one polarized spin state and reflect the other has been purchased from Neutron Optics Berlin NOB. By placing this package upstream of the collimation only the transmitted spin state passes through to the sample. The polarization achieved with this technique up to now is 80 for neutrons in a wavelength range of 3 8 A amp; 730; and 67 for larger wavelengths. The polarizer is placed on a linear translator {{so it can be}} easily removed from the beam, when regular SANS measurements are desired. The first experimental results from a two phase <b>CuNiFe</b> alloy sample are reported her...|$|E
