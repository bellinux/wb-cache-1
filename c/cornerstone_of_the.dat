5|$|In these works, Wigner {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics. Wigner's theorem proved by Wigner in 1931, is a <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. The theorem specifies how physical symmetries such as rotations, translations, and CPT symmetry are represented on the Hilbert space of states. According to the theorem, any symmetry transformation is represented by a linear and unitary or antilinear and antiunitary transformation of Hilbert space. The representation of a symmetry group on a Hilbert space is either an ordinary representation or a projective representation.|$|E
