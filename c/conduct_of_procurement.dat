40|$|Many public {{procurement}} systems, within the United States and abroad, have established systems for allowing vendors {{to challenge the}} <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> processes. Providing an effective domestic review mechanism for vendors who believe that government procurement officials have not conducted an acquisition lawfully brings an important measure of transparency and accountability to {{public procurement}} systems. This brief article discusses the goals of these bid protest systems, and then presents key choices that must be made in crafting such a system. For example: Where in the government is the protest forum located? How broad is the forum 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction? Who has standing to protest? What are the time limits at the forum? What evidence does the forum receive? Is the procurement put 2 ̆ 2 on hold 2 ̆ 2 during the protest? How difficult is it for a protester to win? What power does the forum have to provide meaningful relief? The article does not describe an ideal bid protest system, but rather presents the decisions {{that need to be}} made when constructing a bid protest system...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of recent procurement reform done by the Government of the Philippines, particularly the centralized procurement system for common-use supplies, materials, and equipment. The centralized procurement system is adopted with the intent of taking advantage of the savings inherent to bulk purchasing, streamlining procurement procedures, and reducing opportunities for corruption in the procurement of the abovementioned items. By legislative authority under Republic Act No. 9184, the centralized procurement system was made mandatory among all government agencies, government owned and controlled corporations and local government units in the purchase of their supplies, materials and equipment requirements. With the introduction of tighter budget and the stronger pressure for good governance, the contributions of procurement policy and institutions of procurements to the achievement of good governance and potential relation to development has been gaining global recognition. Given the association of procurement to the way public money is spent, the issue on corruption is also central to this research. There has been a growing recognition of the relationship between corruption and development – the more corrupt a country is, the more underdeveloped it becomes. With the daunting task of battling against corruption, the country’s strategy is to direct its efforts in combating corruption in specific areas, like public procurement. This thesis demonstrates that the centralized procurement system offers a significant reduction in processing times in the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>procurement.</b> Additionally, it offers opportunities for savings generation with the cheaper prices of goods and the reduction of administrative cost associated with procurement. More over, it provides a procurement framework where opportunities for administrative corruption are reduced. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} centralized procurement system is efficient in that it reduces administrative processing time and concomitant costs. This, in the long run, will benefit the procuring entities and ultimately the tax payers. However, the emphasis placed on achieving administrative savings is at the expense of other measures of effectiveness such as quality of goods being supplied and the quality of services being extended to client agencies. Moreover, the lack of effective inventory and control system may pave the way to greater waste. Without an effective inventory and control system as well as an improved quality control system, the centralized procurement system that works faster and cheaper may not be better after all...|$|E

40|$|Many African {{countries}} such as Ghana have adopted rules and procedures that regulate the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> public <b>procurement.</b> These developing countries usually rely on foreign aid, which is disbursed through public procurement, to undertake major development projects. However, unreliable domestic systems contribute to the motivation of donors who usually require beneficiary countries to apply procurement rules and procedures set out by the donor {{for the implementation of}} development projects funded by the donor. Different rules of donors are applicable to procurement in addition to existing rules under the domestic regime, which results in the application <b>of</b> multiple <b>procurement</b> rules. Adopting a doctrinal approach, this thesis examines the issues <b>of</b> multiple <b>procurement</b> regimes using Ghana as a case study. It seeks to analyse the manner of interaction between the rules of the different regimes and to identify and elaborate the policy issues arising from the application and interaction of the different sets of rules. The thesis concludes that policies <b>of</b> the multiple <b>procurement</b> rules are almost the same but rather expressed in different terminologies. However, implementation of the multiple rules may have negative implications not only for the achievement of domestic policies such as value for money and simplification of procedures, but also for policies of the development partners that seek to promote domestic development on issues such as corruption and local capacity development.

40|$|Extract] The Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 {{received}} Royal assent on March 8, 2012. It requires public {{contracting authorities}} to consider (in s. 1 (3)) : "(a) how what is proposed to be procured might improve the economic, {{social and environmental}} well-being of the relevant area, and (b) how, in <b>conducting</b> the process <b>of</b> <b>procurement,</b> it might act {{with a view to}} securing that improvement. " By January 31, 2013, all parts of the Act should have come into force. The gap between Royal assent and the Act's actually taking effect aims to give authorities time to prepare to meet this obligation. While the idea of seeking to obtain social value through public procurement is hardly novel, this legislation—developed from the Public Services (Social Enterprises and Social Value) Bill 2010 —raises numerous issues for academics and practitioners, and also presents areas for possible law reform.

40|$|The {{recently}} adopted UK National Health Service (Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition) (No. 2) Regulations 2013 {{include an}} interesting (and somehow unsettling) provision authorising anti-competitive behaviour in the commissioning {{of health care}} services by the National Health Service (NHS), if {{that is in the}} (best) interest of health care users. Generally, it seems that under the new public procurement and competition rules applicable to the NHS, whatever is considered in the “interest of patients” could trump pro-competitive requirements and allow the commissioning entity to engage in distortions of competition (either directly, or by facilitating anti-competitive behaviour by tenderers and service providers) — as long as a sort of qualitative cost-benefit analysis shows that net advantages derived from the anti-competitive procurement activity. The apparent oddity of such general “authorisation” for public buyers to engage in anti-competitive <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> health care services deserves some careful analysis, which this paper carries out. The paper assesses Regulation 10 <b>of</b> the NHS <b>Procurement,</b> Patient Choice and Competition Regulations 2013 and the substantive guidance published by the UK's health care sector regulator (Monitor) from the perspective of EU economic law (and, more specifically, in connection to public procurement and competition rules). The paper claims that there is a prima facie potential incompatibility between Regulation 10 of the 2013 NHS Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition Regulations and both EU competition law and public procurement law — which are, in principle, opposed to any anti-competitive or competition restrictive behaviour in the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> public <b>procurement</b> activities. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} an EU law compliant, restrictive interpretation and enforcement of the provision — at least where there is a cross border effect on competition and/or a cross border interest in tendering for the health care contracts, which triggers the application of both EU competition law and public procurement law.

The research {{was carried out in}} two stages. In the first stage archival analysis was <b>conducted</b> <b>of</b> government documents, reports including reports by international organisations, policy documents and literature. As a result of this it was found that there are two different methods <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> used for procuring infrastructure projects in public sector in Pakistan i. e. the traditional method for example competitive design-bid-build and the non-traditional method for example Public-Private-Partnership (PPP). During the second stage case studies were selected based on archival analysis. A total of 6 public sector organisations had been selected as organisational case studies and 8 projects had been selected among these organisations as project case studies. Out of the 6 organisations 5 were federal government and 1 provincial government organisation. The organisational coverage of sub-sectors of infrastructure includes transport, water and power sub-sectors. Geographically the organisations and projects covered all four provinces and tribal areas as well as the state of Azad and Jammu Kashmir. Projects were selected on the basis <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> method. Out <b>of</b> the total 8, 3 of the projects were on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), 2 projects on Build-Own-Operate (BOO), 1 project on Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) (only BOOT project in Pakistan) and 2 projects on traditional method <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> were selected.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on a {{research}} thesis that investigates the role <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> practices in effective implementation of infrastructure projects in a developing country, i. e. Pakistan. The research investigated and explored the issues and barriers to effective implementation <b>of</b> different <b>procurement</b> methods, the environment and its suitability for implementing different forms <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> in context <b>of</b> public sector in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach – The research was carried out in two stages in the first stage archival analysis was <b>conducted</b> <b>of</b> government documents, reports including reports by international organisations, policy documents and literature. During the second stage case studies were selected based on archival analysis. The unit of analysis is the basis for the case and for this study, it was the <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure projects in public sector in Pakistan and that was the boundary of the research. Eight project case studies were selected from six public sector organizations (organizational case studies). A total of 24 respondents participated from these six organisations. Findings – The research has identified the different procurement choices and reasons for a particular choice, the issues in procurement choice and the issues in procurement implementation in the public sector organisations in Pakistan. It has also described the impact <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> practice on successful project outcomes. As a result multiple issues have been identified which affects the choice <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> such as the need for efficiency and finances, client objectives, timely policy decisions, clarity of clients needs, delays in bidding and response, delays in approvals, proposal and bid evaluation procedures, need for relaxation of rules and project characteristics. The major barriers and constraints to implementation <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> have been reported to be regulatory and legal, risks and contract management, principles <b>of</b> <b>procurement,</b> political, culture, inter and intra organisational issues, conditions of the country, lack of understanding, land acquisition, project revenue and finance issues.

40|$|Purchasing {{function}} is, {{along with}} a sale, {{one of the most}} important functions of every commercial (trading) company. Management <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> is related to selection and number of suppliers, policy relations with them, setting <b>of</b> purchasing (<b>procurement)</b> quotas as well as to methods and types of payments. The role <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> in relations between suppliers and buyers has been changing with market developments. Purchasing is no longer just a passive function for selecting the best suppliers to send orders to, but it establishes partnership relations with suppliers. The objectives <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> function, among others, are timely and safe delivery, professional relationships with suppliers, product quality, inventory optimization and cost reduction. Due to strong competitive pressures in the markets where they operate that limit the possibility of significant influence on individual forming of selling prices of goods and services, commercial (trading) companies are forced to find appropriate methods to reduce their operating costs. One of the business areas where a company can realize cost reductions is <b>procurement.</b> The complexity <b>of</b> business operations and market relations are influencing the value <b>of</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> goods and services that represent a significant share in the sales value of commercial companies. In order to reduce and control procurement costs, enterprises must develop and implement appropriate cost management systems. Reducing procurement costs can be achieved in two key areas, namely in the area <b>of</b> prices <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> objects and in the area of cost reduction <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> function.
