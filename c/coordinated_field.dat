2500|$|Mexican {{journalist}} Raymundo Riva-Palacio criticized (on his {{columns of}} October 21 and October 23) the privileges {{given by the}} Calderón administration to American intelligences agencies and billateral cooperation in general, and wrote: [...] "...It {{can be argued that}} Washington mocked him and betrayed him..." [...] Mr. Riva-Palacio wrote that American intelligence agencies <b>coordinated</b> <b>field</b> operations and even interrogated the detainees before Mexican authorities could do their own. According to Mr. Riva, this privileges led to the illegal spying which enabled American intelligence agencies to make a map of the Mexican political world, which (according to him) is demonstrated in many documents where the main concern is the political stability and future of Mexico, and the subsequent spying carried on Mr. Peña while he was running for office. He then criticized Mr. Calderón request to Mr. Peña to investigate the spying carried on his e-mail and his cabinet members e-mails and declared that Calderón should have done that when the first allegations of illegal spying came out in 2009-2010. On October 22, 2013, CNNMéxico published on its website that Calderón avoided sending sensitive information through his e-mail, to outsmart spies, and when realized phone calls with other cabinet members, spoke in code. On October 23, 2013, the Secretary of the Interior, Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong, announced that, by presidential mandate, a profund investigation would be carried on the illegal spying done towards Calderón.|$|E

50|$|Permanent councils of war {{had already}} been summoned by the Habsburg emperor Maximilian I about 1500. Founded in 1556 in the reign of Emperor Ferdinand I, the Steter Kriegsrat was a council of five generals and senior civil {{servants}} who controlled army appointments, the finances of warfare, and the deployment of forces. It also handled civil and military administration of the border region of Croatia. With {{the establishment of an}} imperial standing army in the 17th century, the Hofkriegsrat was the bureaucracy charged with managing the permanent military force. It served as the central military administrative agency and a military chancery, provided a staff for the emperor, and directed and <b>coordinated</b> <b>field</b> armies. Additionally, it conducted relations with the Ottoman Empire and administered the Military Frontier (Militärgrenze).|$|E

In the 1960s, the band received some nationwide television coverage with their performances at Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions football games. Then, in 1974, the band traveled with the football team for the Division II national championship game (The Camiellia Bowl) and received significant airtime for their halftime performance. That same year, the band was featured in the nationwide release of recordings of new marching band music from Charter Publications (which was sent to all high school and college band directors in the nation).|$|E
50|$|The fourth IPY {{comprised}} an intense, <b>coordinated</b> <b>field</b> {{campaign of}} observations, research, and analysis. It was the largest, most comprehensive campaign ever mounted {{to explore the}} Earth's polar regions. An estimated 50,000 researchers, local observers, educators, students and support personnel from more than 60 countries {{were involved in the}} 228 international IPY projects (170 in scientific research, one in data management, and 57 in education and outreach) and related national efforts. The IPY included intensive research and observation periods in the Arctic and Antarctic over a three-year timespan, which started 1 March 2007 and was formally concluded 12 June 2010 at the IPY Oslo Science Conference. However, many activities continued beyond that date. The IPY Science Program covered eleven areas: Polar atmosphere, Arctic ocean, Southern Ocean, Greenland ice sheet and Arctic glaciers, Antarctic ice sheets, Sub-glacial aquatic environments, Permafrost, Earth structure and geodynamics at the poles, Polar terrestrial ecology and biodiversity, Polar societies and social processes and Human health.|$|E
