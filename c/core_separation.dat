40|$|We {{present a}} {{kinematic}} analysis of jet component {{motion in the}} VLBI jet of the BL Lac object S 5 1803 + 784, which does not reveal long-term outward motion {{for most of the}} components. Understanding the complex kinematic phenomena can possibly provide insights into the differences between quasars and BL Lac objects. The blazar S 5 1803 + 784 has been studied with VLBI at ν = 1. 6, 2. 3, 5, 8. 4, and 15 GHz between 1993. 88 and 2005. 68 in 26 observing runs. We (re) analyzed the data and present Gaussian model-fits. We collected the already published kinematic information for this source from the literature and re-identified the components according to the new scenario presented in this paper. Altogether, 94 epochs of observations have been investigated. A careful study of the long-term kinematics reveals a new picture for component motion in S 5 1803 + 784. In contrast to previously discussed motion scenarios, we find that the jet structure within 12 mas of the core can most easily be described by the coexistence of several bright jet features that remain on the long-term at roughly constant <b>core</b> <b>separations</b> (in addition to the already known stationary jet component ∼ 1. 4 mas) and one faint component moving with an apparent superluminal speed (∼ 19 c, based on 3 epochs). While most of the components maintain long-term roughly constant distances from the core, we observe significant, smooth changes in their position angles. We report on an evolution of the whole jet ridge line with time over the almost 12 years of observations. The width of the jet changes periodically with a period of ∼ 8 to 9 years. We find a correlation between changes in the position angle and maxima in the total flux-density. We present evidence for a geometric origin of the phenomena and discuss possible models.

40|$|To {{characterize}} the initial conditions for intermediate- to high-mass star formation, we observed two Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) that remain absorption features up to 70 mum wavelength, with the PdBI in the 3. 23 mm dust continuum {{as well as}} the N 2 H+(1 [...] 0) and 13 CS(2 - 1) line emission. While IRDC 19175 - 4 is clearly detected in the 3. 23 mm continuum, the second source in the field, IRDC 19175 - 5, is only barely observable above the 3 sigma continuum detection threshold. However, the N 2 H+(1 - 0) observations reveal 17 separate sub-sources {{in the vicinity of the}} two IRDCs. Most of them exhibit low levels of turbulence (dv ≤ 1 km/s), indicating that the fragmentation process in these cores may be dominated by the interplay of thermal pressure and gravity, but not so much by turbulence. Combining the small line widths with the non-detection up to 70 mum and the absence of other signs of star formation activity, most of these 17 cores with masses between sub-solar to 10 M_sun are likely still in a starless phase. Furthermore, we find a large CS depletion factor of the order 100. Although the strongest line and continuum peak is close to virial equilibrium, its slightly broader line width compared to the other cores is consistent with it being in a contraction phase potentially at the verge of star formation. The relative peak velocities between neighboring cores are usually below 1 km/s, and we do not identify streaming motions along the filamentary structures. Average densities are between 10 ^ 5 and 10 ^ 6 cm^- 3 (one to two orders of magnitude larger than for example in the Pipe nebula) implying relatively small Jeans-lengths that are consistent with the observed <b>core</b> <b>separations</b> of the order 5000 AU.

30|$|The Fe–S–Si {{system has}} a very low solidus {{temperature}} compared to the solidus of the silicate mantle, which indicates that heating during accretion of the Earth created a metallic melt in crystalline silicates, and the <b>core</b> <b>separation</b> perhaps started by percolation of a eutectic-like metallic melt with S enrichment in the silicate mantle early in the accretion of the planetesimals (Terasaki et al. 2005). The thermal models of Mars and Mercury (Breuer et al. 2007; Solomon 1976; Toksoz et al. 1978) indicate that the internal temperatures approached the solidus temperature of the silicate mantle and the magma ocean occurred early in the histories of these planets. By assuming that the cores of the planets contain both S and Si as light elements (Malavergne et al. 2007; Malavergne et al. 2010), the models of the thermal history of these planets suggest that, during their formation, the temperature in their centers approached or exceeded the liquidus temperature of the Fe–Si–S system after the magma ocean stage.

More than 90 epochs of observations at 6 frequencies from 1. 6 GHz up to 22 GHz have been combined and analyzed. We discuss an alternative jet model for the source. In contrast to previously discussed motion scenarios for S 5 1803 + 784, we find that the jet structure within 12 mas of the core can most easily be described by seven "oscillating" jet features. We find that the parameters of jet features, such as <b>core</b> <b>separation,</b> position angle and flux density, change in a periodic way with a timescale of about 4 years. We also find evidence for a correlation between these parameters and the total flux density variability.
