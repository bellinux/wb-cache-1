25|$|Physicians {{sometimes}} use {{the term}} palliative <b>care</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sense meaning palliative therapies without curative intent, when no cure can be expected (as often happens in late-stage cancers).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{if there}} is a link between quality of <b>care</b> <b>in</b> the Norwegian nursing home industry and exposure of the industry to competition. Exposing public care to competition implies that the responsibility for providing care services is shared between public authorities and private actors. In Norway, exposure to competition means tender competition. Suppliers bid for a contract issued by the Norwegian authorities for a limited number of years. Quality of <b>care</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> institution is the major competitive factor. The provider categories of elderly care are: 1) care provided by institutions run by municipalities, 2) care provided by institutions run by private companies, which have won a tender competition, 3) care provided by institutions run by private companies owned by private families, voluntary religious or idealistic organizations. Nurse-to-patient ratio is used as a proxy for quality of care. The regression analysis indicates a relationship between quality of care and exposure to competition. The quality of <b>care</b> <b>in</b> provider category 2 is significantly lower than in provider category 1, but there are more variations in the quality of <b>care</b> <b>in</b> provider category 1 than in provider category 2. We find the lowest quality of <b>care</b> <b>in</b> provider category 1. There is also a relationship between the quality of <b>care</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> institution and the educational level of the staff, the location, the workforce, and the size of an institution. Finally, there is a relationship between the quality of <b>care</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> institution and the real and the required capacity, and the financial status <b>in</b> <b>a</b> region. </span...|$|R

In 2010, there were 138 hospitals with 31,000 beds in the country, but on 1 July 2011, the Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity announced its plans to decrease the number to 77 hospitals with 36,035 beds, as a necessary reform to reduce expenses and further enhance healthcare standards. Greece's healthcare expenditures as a percentage of GDP were 9.6% in 2007 according to a 2011 OECD report, just above the OECD average of 9.5%. The country has the largest number of doctors-to-population ratio of any OECD country.|$|E
25|$|Managed {{care plans}} are widely {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing {{the health care industry}} to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health <b>care.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E

25|$|Early colonial administrations {{were anxious}} to address the gender {{imbalance}} in the population {{brought about by the}} importation of large numbers of convict men. Between 1788 and 1792, around 3546 male to 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney. Women came {{to play an important role}} in education and welfare during colonial times. Governor Macquarie's wife, Elizabeth Macquarie took an interest in convict women's welfare. Her contemporary Elizabeth Macarthur was noted for her 'feminine strength' in assisting the establishment of the Australian merino wool industry during her husband John Macarthur's enforced absence from the colony following the Rum Rebellion. The Catholic Sisters of Charity arrived in 1838 and set about pastoral <b>care</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> women's prison, visiting hospitals and schools and establishing employment for convict women. The sisters went on to establish hospitals in four of the eastern states, beginning with St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in 1857 as a free hospital for all people, but especially for the poor. Caroline Chisholm (1808–1877) established a migrant women's shelter and worked for women's welfare in the colonies in the 1840s. Her humanitarian efforts later won her fame in England and great influence in achieving support for families in the colony. Sydney's first Catholic Bishop, John Bede Polding founded an Australian order of nuns—the Sisters of the Good Samaritan—in 1857 to work in education and social work. The Sisters of St Joseph, were founded in South Australia by Saint Mary MacKillop and Fr Julian Tenison Woods in 1867. MacKillop travelled throughout Australasia and established schools, convents and charitable institutions. She was canonised by Benedict XVI in 2010, becoming the first Australian to be so honoured by the Catholic Church.|$|E
