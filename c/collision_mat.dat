25|$|Yellowstone {{anchored}} at Quiberon Bay at 0953 on 14 February 1919. Her troubles {{were not}} over, however, as she grazed the jetty wall while entering the locks at St. Nazaire. At 0545, the engineer officer {{reported to the}} captain that two boilers were under water and the steam was cut off. As Yellowstone moored alongside the nearby quay, her crew broke out a tarpaulin and <b>collision</b> <b>mat.</b> Soon thereafter, Yellowstone, still with way on, nudged into the bridge walk of the lock. By 0630, under tow by a French tug, she reached a safe basin, where she dropped both anchors and her crew began {{to take stock of}} the situation. Divers examining the damage reported that a hole, six inches (15.2cm) in width, had been opened up in Yellowstones side, extending from a point 10 feet (3 meters) beneath the waterline and about six feet (1.8 meters) in length. Drydocked on 11 March 1919, Yellowstone grazed the French passenger ship SS Alesia that morning, causing minor damage to Alesias railings on her promenade deck and boat deck.|$|E
50|$|In 1870, Makarov {{invented a}} {{design for a}} <b>collision</b> <b>mat,</b> to seal holes in a ship’s hull. The {{invention}} was displayed at the 1873 Vienna World’s Fair, which Makarov attended.|$|E

500|$|Bismarck {{also used}} her main and {{secondary}} batteries to fire at maximum depression to create giant splashes in {{the paths of}} the incoming torpedo bombers. None of the attacking aircraft were shot down. Bismarck evaded eight of the torpedoes launched at her, but the ninth struck amidships on the main armoured belt, throwing one man into a bulkhead and killing him and injuring five others. The explosion also caused minor damage to electrical equipment. The ship suffered more serious damage from manoeuvres to evade the torpedoes: rapid shifts in speed and course loosened <b>collision</b> <b>mats,</b> which increased the flooding from the forward shell hole and eventually forced abandonment of the port number 2 boiler room. This loss of a second boiler, combined with fuel losses and increasing bow trim, forced the ship to slow to [...] Divers repaired the <b>collision</b> <b>mats</b> in the bow, after which speed increased to , the speed that the command staff determined was the most economical for the voyage to occupied France.|$|R
50|$|Captain Sealby and a {{skeleton}} crew remained on board Republic {{to make an}} effort to save her. Crewmen from the Gresham tried using <b>collision</b> <b>mats</b> to stem the flooding, but to no avail. By this time the steamers New York and Lucania (from Cunard) had also arrived, and waited while an attempt was made by Gresham to take Republic under tow. This effort too proved futile, and on 24 January, Republic sank. At 15,378 tons, she was the largest ship to have sunk up to that time. All the remaining crew were evacuated before she sank.|$|R
50|$|Bullfinch {{was laid}} down on 17 September 1896, at the Earle’s Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Limited {{shipyard}} at Hull, Yorkshire, and launched on 10 February 1898. During her trials while steaming at 30 knots she suffered a major accident {{in which the}} connecting rod to the high-pressure cylinder broke and released steam into the forward engine room. Eight individuals were killed and six were injured. The broken connecting rod punctured the hull, and Lieutenant F.G. Dineley, RN (in command during trials) ordered the use of <b>collision</b> <b>mats</b> to stem the intake of water {{and she was able}} to make port. The destroyer was completed and accepted by the Royal Navy in June 1901.|$|R
5000|$|The reactor {{was placed}} {{to allow for}} access from above for refueling. The 74-MW reactor is a tall, narrow cylinder, housed in a {{cylindrical}} containment vessel with rounded ends and a 14 ft diameter vertical cylindrical projection housing the control rods and refueling equipment. The 50 ft long containment vessel houses the pressurized-water reactor, the primary coolant loop and the steam generator. The steel vessel has a wall thickness varying from 2.5 in to 4 in, designed to accommodate the [...] (gauge) pressure generated by a ruptured primary coolant pipe. There are two 42 in diameter manholes {{in the top of}} the containment vessel. Two 24 in by 18 in manholes in the bottom of the containment vessel are designed to admit water to the containment vessel if the ship sinks in more than 100 ft of water to prevent the pressure vessel's collapse. The containment vessel was not occupied under operational conditions, but could be accessed within 30 minutes of reactor shut-down. The lower half of the containment vessel is shielded by a 4 ft concrete barrier. The upper half is shielded by 6 in of lead and 6 in of polyethylene. A <b>collision</b> <b>mat</b> shields the sides of the vessel with alternating layers of 1 in steel and 3 in of redwood in a 24 in assembly.|$|E
50|$|It {{was a hot}} afternoon, and a Thursday, {{which was}} {{traditionally}} a rest time for the crew. All hatches and means of ventilation were open to cool the ship. There was a 100 sq ft hole {{in the side of}} the ship open to the sea, but initially, Tryon and his navigation officer, Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, did not believe the ship would sink, as the damage was forward and had not affected the engine room or ship's power. Tryon gave orders to turn the ship and head for the shore 5 mi away so she could be beached. Some of the surrounding ships had launched boats for a rescue, but he signalled for them to turn back. Just two minutes after Camperdown backed out of the hole she had created, water was advancing over the deck and spilling into the open hatches. A party under Lieutenant Herbert Heath attempted to unroll a <b>collision</b> <b>mat</b> down the side of the ship to patch the hole and slow the inrush of water, but by the time they could manhandle it into position they were standing in water, and had to abandon the attempt. Five minutes after the collision, the bow had already sunk 15 ft, the ship was listing heavily to starboard and water was coming through the gun ports in the large forward turret. The foredeck became submerged, with the top of the gun turret forming a small island. Although the engineroom was still manned and the engines running, hydraulic power for the helm failed so the ship could not be turned and there was no power to launch the ship's boats. Eight minutes after the collision, the entire fore end of the ship was under water, and the water was lapping the main deck. The stern had risen so that the screws were nearly out of the water.|$|E
500|$|The impact {{punched a}} hole some [...] deep and [...] wide in Otranto, from below the {{waterline}} {{up to the}} boat deck. The hole was right at the bulkhead between the fore and aft stokeholds (boiler rooms) and both instantly flooded, killing most of the crewmen in those spaces. When the engine room flooded shortly afterwards, Otranto lost all electrical power and began to drift towards the cliffs of Islay. The water pressure caused other bulkheads to collapse, quickly flooding other spaces below the waterline and giving the ship a massive list to starboard. The impact also damaged many of the remaining lifeboats on that side. The crew attempted to use <b>collision</b> <b>mats</b> to cover {{the hole in the}} ship's side, but it proved to be too large. Kashmirs bow was crushed by the impact, although she was able to steam off when a wave forced the two ships apart soon after the collision.|$|R
500|$|Szent István {{was hit by}} two [...] torpedoes abreast her {{boiler room}}s. The aft boiler room quickly flooded and gave the ship a 10° list to starboard. Counterflooding of the {{portside}} trim cells and magazines reduced the list to 7°, but efforts to use <b>collision</b> <b>mats</b> to plug the holes failed. While {{this was going on}} the dreadnought steered for the nearby Bay of Brgulje at low speed. However, water continued to leak into the forward boiler room and eventually doused all but the two boilers on the port side. This killed the power for the pumps and only left enough electricity to run the lights. The turrets were trained to port in a futile effort to counter the list and their ready ammunition was thrown overboard. An attempt by Tegetthoff to take the crippled battleship into tow was also abandoned after it became clear that Szent István was doomed. Flooding continued, and the ship capsized at 6:05am off Premuda Island. Only 89 sailors died—41 from Hungary—the low death toll partly attributed to the fact that all sailors with the KuK Navy had to learn to swim before entering active service.|$|R
2500|$|Evolutionary Squadron {{was engaged}} in what became {{the first of the}} Victorian Royal Navy's annual manoeuvres. When the Leander joined on 17 June, she was {{attached}} to the ships blockading Berehaven. On 18 June [...] "the weather was so stormy that all exercises were suspended... After sunset, the Conquest, Mercury, Leander, Racer, Cormorant and Mariner with the torpedo boats attached to them got under way top take up their position of observation outside the haven. The weather proved so boisterous that the blockading division returned before it had reached the open water outside. In returning... the Leander, while manoeuvring to keep clear of the Conquest, struck on the Hornet rock, and was seriously injured. As soon as the accident occurred the engines were stopped, the watertight doors closed, the pumps were set going, and <b>collision</b> <b>mats</b> and sails were passed under the ship's bottom. After some time it was found that e pumps failed to gain on the leak. On the following day the ship was moved nearer the shore, so as to be ready to beach in case of necessity. Early, however on the 21st the divers succeeded in finding the leak and stopping it with the patent leak-stopper. The ship's hold was thereupon cleared of water." [...] It was not until 24 June that Leander was ready to go to sea again. [...] On 26 June, the Leander, escorted by the Mercury, arrived at Devonport, where she was placed in dock. [...] The damage to the Leader was described as follows: [...] "The sea entered through numerous rivet holes where rivets had been sheared, but the compartment kept the ship afloat in a working condition." [...] Amongst the stores destroyed by water were 168lb of soft soap and 400lb powder (propellant for the guns). [...] The repairs to the ship cost £8,947.|$|R
