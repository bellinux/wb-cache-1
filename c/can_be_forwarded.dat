5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>forwarded</b> {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E
5|$|Other major {{subsystems}} in the E-3 Sentry are navigation, communications, and computers. Fourteen consoles display computer-processed data in graphic and {{tabular format}} on video screens. Console operators perform surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management and communications functions. The radar and computer subsystems on the E-3 can gather and present broad and detailed battlefield information. This includes position and tracking information on enemy aircraft and ships, and location {{and status of}} friendly aircraft and naval vessels. The information {{can be sent to}} major command and control centers in rear areas or aboard ships. In times of crisis, data <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>forwarded</b> to the National Command Authority in the U.S. via RC-135 or naval aircraft carrier task forces.|$|E
25|$|In a middeck stowage locker, Atlantis {{carried the}} Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Communication Unit (CUCU) {{developed}} by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) {{in collaboration with}} NASA to the ISS. It will be integrated on the space station in preparation for future SpaceX flights to the orbiting complex. The unit allows for communication between ISS and SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft via a UHF radio. Commands from SpaceX <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>forwarded</b> through ISS to CUCU and on to Dragon. Similarly, telemetry from Dragon and CUCU <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>forwarded</b> down through ISS for monitoring by SpaceX and NASA ground-based mission control. The Crew Command Panel (CCP) provides feedback {{about the state of}} the Dragon vehicle to astronauts aboard ISS. It additionally provides some simple commanding capability to the astronauts to be used during the Dragon approach to ISS.|$|E

5000|$|In {{wormhole}} switching, each buffer {{is either}} idle, or allocated to one packet. A header flit <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>forwarded</b> to a buffer if this buffer is idle.
